The substantial increase in human population during the 20th century combined with rapid increases in overall global economic development has resulted in rising challenges for the future of public water management. The developing world has been particularly impacted by the lack of access to clean water. Each year, millions of people die due to illnesses, diseases, and lack the capital to create the infrastructure necessary to combat the problem.(Segerfeldt 2005) These conditions have increased the global demand for clean water and in turn, have pressured free market economists to suggest that wealthy market players are the most efficient solution to addressing water issues.(Saefong 2006) Several nations can benefit from international trade in water. Particularly nations with excess fresh water and abundant capital are looking forward to making healthy profits from either the export of water to other nations, or are interested in the investment returns they will earn from participation in foreign markets. However, not everyone agrees that market forces are best capable of solving water issues. NGO‚Äôs, human rights organizations, and various stakeholders oppose viewing water in economic terms. These individuals accuse international trade agreements and international economic institutions including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of attempting to privatize a resource that they consider a basic human right.(Overbeke 2004) The lack of a common understanding of whether or not water should be viewed as a commodity or a basic human right has resulted in heated debates among legal professionals and leading members of the academia. Water as a commodity Prior to the industrial period, water had been extracted by whichever local community lived around it. As the industrial period progressed however, this view began to be replaced by a more economic oriented approach. Today, most water goes through a complicated industrial process that begins with its extraction and ends in a complicated process involving pipes, dams, and other sorts of unnatural facilities. Even fresh water that is located in rivers and lakes must somehow be extracted. In general these considerations involve the use of land, labor and capital thereby replacing the notion of a common resource into a value based product. Desalinization and desalinization plants play a major role also. International institutions, international trade agreements and water privatization In 2000, out of the 40 IMF loans distributed 12 had requirements of partial or full privatization of water supplies.iv Likewise 50 percent of World Bank loans issued in 2002 to developing countries contained a clause that requested privatization of water services.(Public Citizen.org 2002) In addition to international institutions pushing for privatization, trade agreements in the 20th century have also created the legal framework for allowing the sale of water. The GATS, known as the General Agreement on Trade in Services, operates on a list in approach, meaning it allows privatization in areas that the nation has agreed to open to other members. The Doha Development Round of negotiations aims at changing this stature. During these negotiations it was declared that no sector is to be excluded from the negotiations to the new agreement. If water services negotiations succeed then once a member chooses to open their markets to their own private sector, then will have to afford other members the same rights to invest in that sector.(Mann 2006) Many regional trade agreements do not have a list in approach and are therefore subject to the same conditions mentioned above. For example, in the US-CAFTA agreement only Costa Rica directly specified that water services were to be excluded from foreign investment the other nations made no similar request.(Mann 2006) Due to the mixed results obtained from privatization of water services and the difficulty of reversing that decision, several actors have strongly opposed the export of bulk fresh water. These actors claim that once such an action is allowed to occur then it will establish a precedent of treating water just like any other export. This in turn will become legally binding and irreversible. International trade and water legal disputes and politics Canada is one of the largest owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its possession of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement.(Dr. Isabel Al- Assar 2008) In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a non-discriminatory manner. Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada‚Äôs actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise. Turkey-Israel In 2002, Israel agreed to buy 1.75 billion cubic feet of water from Turkey every year for a period of 20 years.(US Water News Online 2004) The method of transport involved the use of large plastic bubbles that would bring the water to the storage facility. In regards to the talks, the foreign minister of Turkey declared that this agreement will increase the cooperation between the two countries and also lead to peace and stability in the Middle East.(US Water News Online 2004) Economically Israel concluded that the cost of importing water would be higher than choosing the desalinization option but chose to import anyway. In addition to hoping to achieve peace the foreign minister also mentioned that the landmark agreement turns water into an internationally accepted commodity, and that Turkey hopes to sell water to other countries. Turkey canceled the deal after the Gaza Flotilla Raid by IDF commandos Gaza Flotilla Raid on May 31 2010. During this incident several Turkish nationals were killed by Israeli armed forces.Israel signs agreement to buy water from Turkey UN declaration In July 2010, the UN General Assembly declared that access to clean water and sanitation is a human right. The assembly did not specify whether a public authority or the private sector would be best capable of providing this right.

Definite calls for an English Academy came in 1617, based on the Italian model dating back to the 16th century; they were followed up later, after the 1635 founding of the French Acad√©mie, by John Dryden (1664), John Evelyn (1665), and Daniel Defoe (1697).Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage (1995), p. 7a. Historical overview The proposals for an English Academy were initially and typically characterised by an antiquarian interest, for example in heraldry and medieval history. They represented a conservative wing in the larger discussion, and in different ways they informed approaches to the idea of a learned society as an active educational and regulatory body. In fact no such Academy would be set up, though discussion of the perceived need for one continued into the eighteenth century.http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362-RabyMichael.htm The development of ideas on the language-regulation function of a putative English Academy was studied initially by Hermann Martin Flasdieck.Der Gedanke einer englischen Sprachakademie in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart (1928). Flasdieck distinguished three phases: first private initiatives up to the middle of the 17th century; then the Restoration period in which the Royal Society and its membership took an interest; and a later period in which proposals to mirror the French Acad√©mie met with serious opposition.p. 9 of PDF. Nothing much came directly of such proposals, typically for an \\"academy royal\\" or court academy; but they formed part of a wider debate including the role of the universities, and the foundation of new institutions such as the successive Gresham College, Chelsea College, Durham College, and the Royal Society, which had very different fates, as well as the pansophic projects that failed to get off the drawing board. Elizabethan proposals In the early 1570s Humphrey Gilbert published The erection of an achademy in London, concerned with the education of wards and the younger sons of gentlemen. The proposed course included subjects seen as practical, as well as classical studies. This conception already had a generation of history behind it: in the reign of Henry VIII Nicholas Bacon (with Robert Carey and Thomas Denton) had reported on a project to create a new inn of court, conceived along the lines of a humanist academy. Bacon had then taken the idea further and combined it with legal experience of wardship, and in a paper of 1561 made a recommendation to the queen. The home and library of John Dee at Mortlake from 1570 to the early 1580s has been identified as a prototype 'academy'. His circle included Thomas Hariot and Walter Raleigh, and was closely linked to that around Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland. These groups with Gresham College comprised the centre of English scientific life at the period.Peter J. French, John Dee, p. 60 and pp. 171‚Äì2. =The Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries= The College (or Society) of Antiquaries met from around 1586 to around 1607. The membership comprised successful lawyers, members of the College of Heralds, wealthy collectors of old manuscripts and a few professional archivists. They met in London during each law term unless plague intervened.C. Wright, ‚ÄòThe Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries and the formation of the Cottonian Library‚Äô in Francis Wormald & C. Wright (eds), The English Library Before 1700, (London, 1958), 185. M. Stuckey, ‚Äú‚Äò...this Society tendeth...‚Äô: Elite Prosopography in Elizabethan Legal History‚Äù, Prosopon 1 (2006) 1-58.. Using the notebook of one member, Francis Tate, Wright dates 22 meetings from 1590 to 1601. Thereafter, meetings became less regular, not only owing to plague but also to the suspicions of the government of James I after 1603. Two subjects for discussion were agreed in advance of meetings and every member was expected to contribute. They aimed to ‚Äòconstruct a detailed and credible account of the origins and development of the English people.‚ÄôJohn Niles, The Idea of Anglo-Saxon England, 1066-1901: Remembering, Forgetting, Deciphering and Renewing the Past (Chichester, 2015), 78 Some, influenced by William Camden‚Äôs Britannia, tackled the broad historical picture from pre-Roman times; some specialised in common law developments from the twelfth century. However, others began a serious study of the early-medieval origins of English culture and identity. In so doing, they made considerable use of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts in both Old English and Latin to supplement still thin published sources. A large number of the contributions to their discussions were published by Thomas Hearne in the eighteenth century and these give several indications of how the antiquaries worked. For example, on 24 November 1599, the Society chose to discuss the antiquity, etymology and variety of English terms used to measure land. Arthur Agard (or Agarde), the Society‚Äôs most respected member, was hesitant: > Although I must confess that in this proposition I have more travelled than > in any of the former, for that it concerneth me more to understand the right > thereof, especially in that sundry have resorted to me thereabouts to know > whether I have in my custody any records that avouch the same in certainty; > yet so it fareth with me, that in perusing as well those abbreviations I > have noted out of Domesday and other records ‚Ä¶, as also those notes I have > quoted out of ancient registers and books which have fallen into my hands > within these xxx. years, I have found the diversity of measurement so > variable and different in every ‚Ä¶ place in the realm, as I was in a > mammering ‚Ä¶. Society members consulted Agard for advice on what material might be available. He had been deputy chamberlain of the exchequer since 1570, responsible for what would be a 40-year project to compile inventories of the four treasuries at Westminster, which contained both royal and abbey records. The Society was eventually closed down owing to the disapproval of James I. Those involved included: *Arthur Agard, 1535/6‚Äì1615 *Benedict Barnham *Robert Beale *Edward Brerewood *Hugh BroughtonG.

The Society paid attention to the succession to Elizabeth, and then the Jacobean debate on the Union, with union tracts written by Cotton and another member, John Dodderidge, papers read on names for \\"Britain\\" in 1604, and Walter Cope, a member and M.P., involved in the parliamentary debate. Jacobean proposals Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales revived by his patronage Humphrey Gilbert's proposal. He combined that concept with the French model of Antoine de Pluvinel's riding academy, which included varied studies. The project was intended to cover mathematics and languages as well as equestrian skills, but was cut short by the Prince's death. The suppression of the Society of Antiquaries having left a hiatus in intellectual life, at least as far as antiquarian interests were concerned, Edmund Bolton brought forward a plan for a royal academy (his \\"academ roial\\"). In 1617 a list of 27 names was put forward: it included Sir John Hayward, and Henry Ferrers. A similar list in 1624 included Sir William Segar. Bolton proposed a complex structure, an outer ring of membership (listing 84), and a role in censorship of publications outside theology, all supported by a subsidy. He gained some support from George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, who put forward a plan (attributed to Prince Henry) in the 1621 Parliament;Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1991), p. 216. but nothing came of it. The end of the reign put an end to the plan. Salomon's House, the proposal or model from Francis Bacon's New Atlantis for an institution of natural philosophy, dates also from this period at the end of the reign of James I. It is an orderly and royally authorised institute for research.Simon Wortham, Censorship and the Institution of Knowledge in Bacon's New Atlantis, pp. 185‚Äì6 in Bronwen Price (editor), Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (2002) Bacon's follower Thomas Bushell was later rumoured to be intending to set up an actual institution, in London, or Wells in Somerset. Kynaston‚Äôs academy The foundation in 1635 of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise coincided closely with Francis Kynaston's setting up of an actual educational institution, his Musaeum Minervae, in his own home in Covent Garden. The king gave money, and the academy admitted young gentlemen only, on exclusive grounds. The tutors were hand-picked by Kynaston. The new institution was satirised, though mildly, by Richard Brome's play The New Academy (dated to 1636). Kynaston gave his own house in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, for the college, with ambitions to move into Chelsea College. He furnished it with books, manuscripts, musical and mathematical instruments, paintings, and statues, at his own expense. He was himself the regent, and his friends Edward May, Michael Mason, Thomas Hunt, Nicholas Fiske, John Spiedal (Spidall), and Walter Salter were professors in various areas. According to the Constitutions published by Kynaston in 1636, only the nobility and gentry were to be admitted to the college, the object of which was to prepare candidates for a Grand Tour. The full course was to occupy seven years; no gentleman was ‚Äòto exercise himself at once about more than two particular sciences, arts, or qualities, whereof one shall be intellectual, the other corporall.‚Äô The regent taught the following subjects: heraldry, a practical knowledge of deeds and the principles and processes of common law, antiquities, coins, husbandry. Music, dancing and behaviour, riding, sculpture, and writing also formed important parts of the curriculum. The academy idea was still in the air in the years before the First English Civil War, and Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel brought forward a proposal during the Short Parliament. Samuel Hartlib spoke of a pilot scheme he had run. In the years 1648‚Äì1650 Balthazar Gerbier revived the idea of an academy on Kynaston's lines in a series of pamphlets. Peter Chamberlen the third suggested an academy to oversee public welfare, as part of his reforming scheme. After the Restoration of 1660 Around 1660 John Evelyn and Robert Boyle were interested once more in the idea of an academy.http://www.bartleby.com/219/1509.html Evelyn's experience abroad included a meeting of the Umoristi, an academy in Rome devoted to verse and linguistic matters. Language now became aspect of the \\"English Academy\\" issue that continued to resonate with English literati, and was floated by small groups from time to time; and Evelyn himself was a constant advocate of attention to it. Evelyn sent Boyle a plan, costed at something over ¬£1000, in a letter from in September 1659; in 1660 Bengt Skytte, a follower of Comenius, brought up a pansophic version of the concept with Boyle and others, on a similar scale.Michael Cyril William Hunter, Establishing the New Science: the experience of the early Royal Society (1989), p. 157; Google Books. These ideas were overtaken by Boyle's involvement in the 1660 committee of 12 which led shortly to the formation of the Royal Society. Abraham Cowley in 1661 conspicuously and in detail advocated a \\"philosophical college\\" near central London, that would function as an innovating educational institution, in his Proposition for the Advancement of Experimental Philosophy. One supporter of an English Academy to regulate the language was Thomas Sprat of the Royal Society, founded in 1662. A group actually met in Gray's Inn in 1665 to plan an academy, as was recalled later by Evelyn: Cowley and Sprat were involved, with George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, Matthew Clifford, Cyril Wyche, John Dryden, and others.Katsuhiro Engetsu, Dryden and the Modes of Restoration Sociability, p. 185, in Steven N. Zwicker (editor), The Cambridge Companion to John Dryden (2004). After only a little progress, London was subject to the Great Plague, Wentworth Dillon, 4th Earl of Roscommon set up, around 1682, a literary society that attracted the name 'academy'. It involved Dryden, other participants being George Savile, Marquess of Halifax, Richard Maitland, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, Lord Cavendish, Sir Charles Scarborough, and Heneage Finch. Their linguistic interests extended mainly to issues of translation. This group was documented by Knightly Chetwood, Roscommon's friend. Giovanni Torriano, in his The Italian Reviv'd, equated some English clubs of the Restoration period with groups who in France or Italy would be called \\"academies\\".Frances Yates, An Italian in Restoration England, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes Vol. 6, (1943), pp. 216‚Äì220 Later proposals At the beginning of the reign of William III and Mary II a proposed Royal Academies Company was a lottery scheme. Lewis Maidwell (1650‚Äì1716) had some initial success in promoting his school in King Street, London as chartered by William III, with a modernised curriculum. He proposed a tax on publications to support it, but was opposed in Parliament and met with serious resistance from the universities. At the same period Daniel Defoe in his Essay upon Projects had a section on academies. Jonathan Swift in his Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue, advocated an academy for regulating the English language. In the form of a call for a \\"national dictionary\\" to regulate the English language, on the French model, this conception had much support from Augustan men of letters: Defoe, Joseph Addison (The Spectator 135 in 1711) and Alexander Pope. At the end of Queen Anne's reign some royal backing was again possible, but that ended with the change of monarch in 1714. The whole idea later met stern opposition, however, from the lexicographer Samuel Johnson, invoking \\"English liberty\\" against the prescription involved: he predicted disobedience of an academy supposed to set usage. Matthew Arnold, in an 1862 essay The Literary Influence of Academies, was positive in assessing the French and Italian cultural academies; but marks an endpoint in the tradition.William K. Wimsatt, Jr. and Cleanth Brooks, Literary Criticism: A Short History (1957), p. 441. In Culture and Anarchy Arnold denied that he supported setting up an English Academy, guying the likely membership as establishment figures. During his 1780 diplomatic mission to Amsterdam, statesman, and later President of the United States, John Adams advocated for an official English Academy as part of the federal government in a letter to the Second Continental Congress. The proposal was later rejected by the Continental Congress due to concerns of individual liberty, and marked one of the earliest instances of the government‚Äôs consideration of linguistic diversity.

The influence of this group of Australian missionaries in Yunnan was profound - though one story is incorrect: they did not introduce the eucalyptus trees into the Luquan District. These had been in Yunnan since the 1850s, and may have been brought back by Chinese miners after the Australian goldrush for use as railway sleepers.Lachlan Strahan Australia's China: Changing Perceptions from the 1930s to the 1990s. p. 111. Ministry in Yunnan Porteous arrived in Yunnan in 1907 with Arthur G. Nicholls (ÈÉ≠ÁßÄÂ≥Ø) and George E. Metcalf (ÁéãÊá∑‰ªÅ). One of the main influences was the theological school run by Porteous. Another was the location, since Sayingpan (ÊííËê•ÁõòÈïá), 80 km north of the county seat of Luquan, was the original site of Salaowu (ÊííËÄÅ‰πå), chief fortress of the Yi.Joakim Enwall A Myth become Reality: History and Development of the Miao written language. Institute of Oriental Languages (Stockholm University, 1995) p. 241. He was joined by his wife, Minnie (n√©e Pearson) from England, whom he married in 1908. Together they ministered to the people of Yunnan, and eventually moved three days travel to the north to work amongst the Nosu people at Salaowu, where their fruitful ministry continued for over twenty years. A talented linguist, Porteous set about translating parts of the Bible into at least three separate Chinese dialects, in collaboration with Nicholls. These included the Gospel of Mark in the Laqua language (spoken by a people group in south-western China (1912); the Gospel of Matthew in the Hmong language - spoken in western Guizhou Province of China and as far southward as Vietnam and Laos - together with Samuel Pollard, who was responsible for devising the syllabic script used for the Miao dialects and its related languages); and the New Testament in the Nusu language (spoken from Sichuan Province to the south of Yunnan - Gospel of St Luke, 1923; Acts of the Apostles, 1926; New Testament, 1948). His assistant in the Yi language translation and among the Yi people was Li Faxian (ÊùéÁôºÁçª). Death and legacy Gladstone and Minnie Porteous had three children: Ruth Catherine, Christine Olive, and Stanley John (who was killed in action during World War II serving with the RAAF). One of his grandsons is the Australian actor and scriptwriter Shane Porteous, best known as Dr. Terence Elliot in television's A Country Practice. Gladstone Porteous died of Typhus in Salaowu (also known as Sayingpan) on 10 November 1944. A tombstone was erected by local church members; \\"When our father died, a large slab of stone was cut by the people and the surface polished by the exhausting but surprisingly effective method of dragging the slab back and forth against another rock. Then the pastor chiselled out an inscription in three languages - English, Nuosu and Chinese, and the stone was erected by the Christians above the grave.\\"A Tribute from a Friend, quoted in biography of Gladstone Porteous by Ruth Porteous Bailey and Christine Porteous, in The Porteous Story, 1975, Porteous Associates. At his death 20,000 of the Yi and Miao were Christians. Today (2011) there are 40,000 Christians and each valley is marked by white-towered churches. His tombstone was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and a new one later placed where the site of the grave was presumed to be, a location that was disputed by some of the older villagers, to show when Australians again visited Sayingpan in the late 1990s.Chinese language travel blog with photos of chapel and road to the graveÊííËê•ÁõòÈïá‰∫∫ÊñáÂú∞ÁêÜ on Yunnan government site www.ynszxc.gov.cn/szxc/ 2007Âπ¥11Êúà29Êó• ...

Later there was a Roman villa at nearby Wykham Park.http://www.information- britain.co.uk/history/town/Banbury11/A history of Banbury and the Banbury Cross explained A small drinking-water reservoir lies to the north of Hennef way. The major road was named after Hennef in Germany. Ruscote was a local village, that dated back to the 15th century, but did not develop until the late 19th century. It was formally incorporated into the borough of Banbury in 1889.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63793http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63792 The 1919 Housing Act was followed by the building of the Easington housing estate of 361 council houses in what was one of the first slum clearance schemes in the country. By 1930 the medical officer reported 131 Banbury town centre houses unfit for habitation. So in 1933 Banbury council opened the Ruscote housing estate of 160 houses. The heavy increase in population between 1931 and 1949 was accommodated by the expansion of the town in three main areas, in each of which houses were built both by the town corporation and by housing private companies. The three areas were between the Oxford and Bloxham roads, where about 500 houses were built before 1939 to form the bulk suburb of Easington; in the area of the older village and suburb of Neithrop, where before 1939 some 500 houses were built both around the earlier houses and further west in new streets on either side of the Warwick road, a development which was extended to the south-west after 1945. In 1933 Banbury council opened the Ruscote housing estate of 160 houses, for working-class families. The estate, which now has a notable South Asian community, was expanded in the 1950s because of the growth of the town due to the London overspill and further grew in the mid-1960s. Industry and commerce The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway (OIR) was opened between 1917 and 1919,https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/199178 was closed in 1967 and the line was lifted between 1967 and 1968. It was a major employer in Banbury for many of those years. The mid-1950s the council established the Southam Road Industrial Estate which was successful in bringing a wide range of industries to the town. The most important newcomer was General Foods Ltd, formerly Alfred Bird & Sons (now Kraft Foods),http://www.kraftfoods.co.uk/kraft/page?siteid=kraft- prd&locale;=uken1&PagecRef;=2297&Mid;=2297 which produced convenience foods. The plant was built between 1964 and 1965 and the company moved to Banbury from Birmingham in 1965. General Foods received active political and fiscal co-operation from the council to partly help find jobs for the local London overspill population. Kraft Foods Banbury is the Kraft centre of manufacturing in Britain, with the Kraft UK headquarters located at Cheltenham. A new factory with a floor space was being constructed in 1969 for Encase Ltd and a factory was being built for Demag Hoists and Cranes Ltd., a subsidiary of Demag Zug, one of the world's largest manufacturers of lifting equipment. The industrial estate had become one of the 'economic epicentres' of the Banburyshire region by the early 1970s. The Kraft Foods factory in Banbury has been a major employer in the town since the mid-1960s. The Kraft Factory ‚Äì a familiar sight on the skyline of Banbury. The local Kraft Foods Banbury plant, which is sometimes known as General Foods after the original owner the building, and the Beaumont industrial estate and Lockheed Drive retail estate would become the leading employers for Ruscote and Hardwick estates.

One of the first records of the hamlet of Hardwick was in the year 1279 when 'Laurence of Hardwick' was paying rent for a local mill to the Bishop of Lincoln. In 1247 The hundred of Banbury was valued at ¬£5 a year and in 1441 'certainty money' (a form of rent) due from the northern part of the hundred was 89s. 8d. It was made up of payments from Shutford, Claydon, Swalcliffe, Great Bouton and Little Bourton, Prescote, Hardwick, Calthorpe and Neithrop, Wickham, Wardington, Williamscot, Swalcliffe Lea, and the former 'prebend' of Banbury. By 1568 these, except the rent from Wardington and amounted to 69s. 4d. in 1652, when the total profits of court were valued at 103s. 4d. a year in 'certainty money'. In 1875 payments were made only by Williamscot, Swalcliffe, Prescote, Great and Little Bourton, Neithrop, Claydon, and Shutford since the rest were freed from their rent obligations.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63787 Hardwick was a Medieval hamlet that did not expand much until the late 19th century and was formally incorporated into the borough of Banbury in 1889. It became a minor village in the late 1930s and finally a housing estate in the late 1950s. =Industry and commerce= The presence of local industry was recorded as far back as the year 1279, when 'Laurence of Hardwick' was paying 3 Marks in rent to the Bishop of Lincoln annually for a mill in Hardwick hamlet. The Northern Aluminium Co.

Output had reached such an extent that in the early 1950s that Banbury's economy had become dependent on the plant's prosperity, with 24%, of the town's workers being employed there.

A picture of the Hanwell Fields estate, Banbury in early 2011. =History= Hanwell Field has been farmland since at least Norman times.Lobel & Crosley, 1969, pages 112‚Äì123 Local villagers farmed the parish of Hanwell, Oxfordshire and its related lands on a two-field open field system until 1768, when Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet bought out the rights of copyholders, life and leaseholders and enclosed the common lands. In 1645 during the English Civil War, Parliamentary troops were billeted in nearby Hanwell village for nine weeks. Villagers petitioned the Warwickshire Committee of Accounts to pay for feeding them. The estate lies between Banbury and Hanwell, built in-between 2001 and 2006, with a minor extension occurring in 2008 on the grounds of the former Hanwell Farm. This has become one of the constituent houses due to the natural growth of the town's commuter population. Hanwell Fields was heavy flooded for a few days in 2007 due to heavy rainfall.-://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73gjLk9Klxg The estate has a small group of shops and one pub. Many residents are part of London's commuter population. =Schools= Hanwell Fields Community School, Rotary Way.http://www.schoolsnet.com/uk-schools/school-details- reviews/oxfordshire/hanwell-fields-community- school/16180339/0/220691.htmlhttp://www.hanwellfieldscommunityschool.org.uk/contact.asp =Recreational areas and parks= * Winter Gardens Way Children's Play Park is well maintained and has 1 bench, 1 playground slide and a Spring rider.

Transport A former Cheney Coaches bus, a Heyfordian bus, a Stagecoach bus and a Banburyshire Community Transport Association (B.C.T.A). bus in Banbury. The Stagecoach busses ran every 20 minutes on weekdays and every 30 minutes at weekends and the Heyfordian bus runs every 30 minutes, except on Sundays as of 2009. The local bus services to Banbury town centre and the Hardwick and Ruscote estate are run by the Stagecoach Oxfordshire bus company. Heyfordian Travel also run a service to the Hardwick estate and Hanwell Fields via the local Tesco and the Barley Mow pub. Cheney Coaches also ran a service that ran parallel to most of the Stagecoach route between 1996 and 2004. Local politics The Ruscote and Hardwick wards were traditionally a Labour ward but for the first time, during the 2006 local elections for Cherwell District Council, the Ruscote ward changed to one Labour councillor and one Conservative Party councillor. The traditionally present Green party candidate lost in 2006. The Conservatives held the ward for the Banbury Town Council and Oxfordshire County Council out right as of 2010. The UKIP or British National Party fielded no candidates in the ward during 2006. A lone Liberal Democrat ran and lost in the Hardwick estate during 2006. Following the local elections of 2012, the Conservatives retain all District and Town council seats in Hardwick while Labour holds all District and Town council seats in Ruscote.

Chemically it is not a phenethylamine or amphetamine and is not their functional analog either. It originally appeared for public sale in the UK in December 2010 as a \\"research chemical\\" or \\"legal high\\", recently branded as Blow. It has limited popularity as a recreational stimulant.Methiopropamine Thread at UKChemicalResearch.org Pharmacology Methiopropamine functions as a selective norepinephrine- dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is approximately 1.85 times more selective for norepinephrine than dopamine. It is approximately one third as potent as dextroamphetamine as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and one fifth as much as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It displays negligible activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Methiopropamine has the potential for significant acute toxicity with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and psychotic symptoms. Metabolism Methiopropamine metabolism is somewhat similar to methamphetamine. Hydroxylation, demethylation and deamination are in common. Formation of thiophene S-oxide is different, as is the end product which will probably be (substituted) thiophene-2-carboxylic acid. It is then excreted in urine. Compounds on red are inactive. For N-alkyl amphetamines, deamination and N-dealkylation are the major elimination pathways and renal excretion is a minor one. Methiopropamine is metabolized into active thiopropamine, 4-hydroxymethiopropamine and thiophene S-oxides. These N-demethylated metabolites are further deaminated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19 in the liver transforming them into inactive 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-propan-2-one which can be seen as a phenylacetone derivative. Thiophene-2-carboxylic acid is the final major metabolic product. It is very hydrophilic and is excreted in urine. Methiopropamine and especially thiopropamine are also excreted renally, unchanged. Synthesis There is a four-step synthesis of methiopropamine. It begins with (thiophen-2-yl)magnesium bromide, which is reacted with propylene oxide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-hydroxypropane which is reacted with phosphorus tribromide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-bromopropane which is finally reacted with methylamine, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane. Four-step synthesis of racemic methiopropamine from (thiophen-2-yl)magnesium bromide. Legal status =China= As of October 2015 MPA is a controlled substance in China. =Finland= Methiopropamine is illegal in Finland. =Germany= Methiopropamine is explicitly illegal in Germany. =United Kingdom= Following the ban on ethylphenidate authorities noticed an increase in methiopropamine use by injecting users. The ACMD suggested it be banned on 18 November 2015 as it had similar effects to ethylphenidate. The government enacted a temporary drug control order a week later which came into force on 27 November 2015. Though ordinarily the TCDO would only last 1 year, the ACMD reported that since its invocation prevalence of MPA had significantly decreased, and that it had been challenging to collect information about the drug. As a result of this, they requested that the TCDO be extended a further year. Methiopropanine was made a Class B controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (as amended) (Amendment)(No.2) Order 2017 [SI 2017/1114], this came into effect on the 27th of November 2017. =United States= Methiopropamine is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States.21 CFR ‚Äî SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ¬ß1308.11 Schedule I.

Jigu Suanjing was included as one of the requisite texts for Imperial examination; the amount of time required for the study of Jigu Suanjing was three years, the same as for The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art and Haidao Suanjing. The book began with presentations to the Emperor, followed by a pursuit problem similar to the one in Jiu Zhang Suan shu,Jean-Claude Martzloff A History of Chinese Mathematics, \\"Jigu Suanjing\\", p140, Springer followed by 13 three-dimensional geometry problems based mostly on engineering construction of astronomic observation tower, dike, barn, excavation of a canal bed etc., and 6 problems in right angled triangle plane geometry. Apart from the first problem which was solved by arithmetic, the problems deal with the solution of cubic equations, the first known Chinese work to deal with complete cubic equations, as such, it played important roles in the development for solution of high order polynomial equations in the history of Chinese mathematics. Before his time, The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art developed algorithm of solving simple cubic equation x^3=N numerically, often referred to as the \\"finding the root method\\". Wang Xiaotong used an algebraic method to solve three- dimensional geometry problems, and his work is a major advance in Algebra in the history of Chinese mathematics. Each problem in Jigu Suanjing follows the same format, the question part begins with \\"suppose we have such and such,... question:...how many are there?\\"; followed by \\"answer:\\", with concrete numbers; then followed by \\"The algorithm says:...\\", in which Wang Xiaotong detailed the reasoning and procedure for the construction of equations, with a terse description of the method of solution. The emphasis of the book is on how to solve engineering problems by construction of mathematical equations from geometric properties of the relevant problem. In Jigu Suanjin, Wang established and solved 25 cubic equations, 23 of them from problem 2 to problem 18 have the form : x^3+px^2+qx=N, , The remaining two problems 19, and 20 each has a double quadratic equation: :x^4+px^2+q=0 *Problem 3, two cubic equations: :: x^3+frac{3cd}{b-c}x^2+frac{3(a+c)hd^2}{(H-h)(b-c)}x=frac{6Vd^2}{(H-h)(b-c)}Bai Shangshu Critical Edition of Wang Xiaotong's Ji gu Suan Jing, P83 :: x^3+5004x^2+1169953frac{1}{3}x=41107188frac{1}{3}Ôºõ *Problem 4 two cubic equations: :: x^3+62x^2+696x=38448,quad x=18; :: x^3+594x^2=682803,quad x=33; *Problem 5 :: x^3+15x^2+66x-360,quad x=3 *Problem 7: :: x^3+(D+G)x^2+left(DG +frac{D^2}{3}right)x=P-frac{D^2G}{3} :: X^+3frac{hs}{D}x^2+3left(frac{hs}{D}right)^2x=frac{P'}{3}frac{h^2}{D^2} *Problem 8: :: x^3+90x^2-839808,quad x=72 *Problem 15: :: x^3 +frac{S}{2}x^2-frac{P^2}{2S}=0„ÄÇYoshio Mikami, The Development of Mathematics in China and Japan p54, 1913.

Wang's work influence later Chinese mathematicians, like Jia Xian and Qin Jiushao of Song dynasty. Editions During the Tang dynasty there were hand-copied Jigu Suanjing in circulation. During the Song dynasty there were 1084 government-printed edition copies. However, by the Ming dynasty the Tang dynasty hand-copied editions and Song dynasty printed editions were almost all lost; only a single copy of a Southern Song print survived. This copy was later obtained by early Qing dynasty publisher Mao Jin, who made an image hand copy (hand-copied character by character, following the printed form closely) of it. Mao Jin's image copy of Jigu Suanjing later became the source for a printed edition during the Qianlong era and was also incorporated into the Siku Quanshu. The Qianlong era printed edition disappeared, and only Mao Jin's image copy edition of Jigu Suanjing survived at the Forbidden City Museum. The copy in the Siku Quanshu still exists. During the Qing dynasty, study of Jigu Suangjing was in vogue; half a dozen books devoted to the study of Jigu Suanjing by mathematicians were published, some of which concentrated on filling the gaps left by many missing characters due to age, and some devoted to the detail elaboration of algorithm either from geometry point of view (Li Huang) or from Tian yuan shu (Zhang Dunren). In 1963, Chinese mathematics historian Qian Baocong published his annotated The Ten Computational Canons, which included Jigu Suanjing. Jigu Suanjing was introduced to the English speaking world by Alexander Wylie in his book Notes on Chinese Literature.Alexander Wylie, Notes on Chinese Literature, p115-116, 1902, Shanghai, reprint References Chinese mathematics Tang dynasty Mathematics manuscripts 7th-century books ","title":"Jigu Suanjing"},{"id":"30257078","text":"Peoples National Bank and Trust Company Building is a historic bank building located at White Plains, Westchester County, New York.

Biography  Pierre de Saint-Yves was born in the French Ardennes (near Maubert-Fontaine) on May 3, 1660, within a family protected by Marie de Guise. This princess called both young Saint-Yvess and his brother Charles de Saint-Yves (1667‚Äì1733) to Paris in the early 1670s, as pages and sponsored their formations. Having received a King's pension, Saint-Yves completed studies with a three-year stay at the French Academy in Rome before returning to Paris as a painter. On January 28, 1708, Saint-Yves became a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, in the category of history painter, and he died in Paris on November 4, 1730. Saint-Yves is an illustrative example of the transition between 17th-century art careers that were usually introduced by the protection of high nobility sponsors, and 18th- century art circles organized around and in the glory of the King. To that extent, Saint-Yves' membership to the Academy as a history painter constituted the utmost position in the Court system at the time, although this category of French classical painting declined by the end of the century and has been almost totally forgotten since the 19th century. Thus, most of Saint-Yves' posterity lies in his art cabinet, which was bequeathed to the family of his brother Charles and based the reputable art collection of Charles L√©offroy de Saint-Yves.

It was built by the New York Central Railroad in the late 19th century. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Croton North Railroad Station. It had long been out of active service, and was converted to office use three years before the listing. Despite the conversion it remains largely intact, and is considered an excellent example of a commuter railroad station from this era, when stations began to reflect the industrial role of the railroads. Included in the listing are two 1930s Pullman electric passenger coaches parked on a disconnected spur north of the station. Building and grounds The property included in the listing is a narrow parcel along railroad tracks currently owned by the Metro-North commuter railroad and also used by Amtrak and CSX Transportation for intercity passenger rail and freight respectively. Two disused sidings lead to the station building from the main Hudson Line tracks, the south end of a working rail yard used primarily by CSX, approximately one mile (1.6 km) northwest of Metro-North's Croton‚ÄìHarmon station and its Harmon Yard maintenance facility. Automotive access is from Senasqua Road, a short service road along the west side of the U.S. Route 9 Croton Expressway. It rejoins US 9 southbound at its southern end and provides access to the rest of Croton-on-Hudson via an overpass to New York State Route 9A at the interchange at its northern end. The station is the only building along Senasqua Road. There is a small unpaved lot, the end of a short driveway to the rail yard, to the east and south of the station. A row of mature trees along the road. Across the tracks, to the southwest, is Elliott Way and the parking area for Croton Landing Park on the Hudson River. The station building itself is a one- story rectangular building topped by an asphalt-shingled hipped roof. Brownish brick faces its load-bearing clay tile walls. At the top its roof is pierced by a brick chimney; three skylights are on the west slope. Its wide overhanging eaves are supported by large wooden brackets. A canopy extends out over the former platform, now filled with gravel and serving as a patio, a short distance on the south, and farther along the north. At the north end the wall curves into a five-facet section with full windows. A hip-roofed porte- coch√®re, now enclosed with concrete blocks painted with stucco, extends from the center of the east section. Fenestration is irregular; doors and windows have terra cotta surrounds. The main entrance is located at the southwest junction of the porte-coch√®re and the rest of the building. Inside the rooms have been renovated for their current use as office space. Much of their original layout and some finishes remain. The porte-coch√®re has been divided into two rooms, one faced in glass block. The former waiting room retains its high ceilings. On a disconnected stretch of track just north of the station are two Pullman-Electric passenger cars. Inside they have their original furnishings, with upholstered seats, overhead luggage racks and cab compartments. They were built in the 1930s and have the livery of the Erie Railroad, which operated them on tracks in New Jersey. They were never used on the line in New York that served the station. Since they are in an appropriate historical setting, they are considered contributing objects to the National Register listing. History The original stations built by the Hudson River Railroad in the mid-19th century were cottage-like Picturesque wooden board- and-batten structures, in keeping with a popular regional style. None of these are extant. As the railroad became part of the New York Central and linked to the expanding national railway network, traffic increased and the original stations were no longer adequate. Starting around 1860, the Central built new stations reflecting the railroads' wider economic role. These showed the influence of industrialization, and were often rectangular structures of brick. Four of them remain today.Two (Peekskill and Cold Spring) survive on the Metro-North portion of the line (the former is partially a restaurant today; the latter is exclusively one and is not part of the modern station complex a short distance to its south). North of the current end of commuter service at Poughkeepsie, the Hudson station is still used by Amtrak while the Stuyvesant station is no longer used for any rail-related purpose. A third wave of stations came along later in the century and continued into the early decades of the next. These buildings reflected the emergence of the automobile and the consequent growth of the highway network. In response to these needs, railroads began developing more architecturally sophisticated stations, primarily by contracting with architectural firms such as Warren and Wetmore, who designed Grand Central Terminal for the Central. These stations show a great deal of variation, and no two are exactly alike. Their commons design features such as the overhanging roof and linear form are still recognized as typical of rail stations today While Warren and Wetmore designed other Central stations outside of New York City such as Mount Vernon and Hyde Park, the small Croton North station was a product of the railroad's own engineering department. It has many of the standard features of the era's stations, such as the hip roof with broad eaves to shelter waiting passengers and linear form, but reflects some other contemporary architectural trends as well. The faceted north end, breaking up the otherwise absolute rectilinearity of the building, is a mark of the Queen Anne Style then popular with homebuilders. The connection is further evidenced by the asymmetrical roof and irregular fenestration. Lastly the choice of materials, with quoined terra cotta surrounds in the brick and large but carefully crafted wooden brackets supporting the roof, is another sign of the Queen Anne style. These features also serve to enhance the building's functionality. The location within of specific interior functions such as the waiting room and ticket office is evident from the outside. The porte-coch√®re and canopy completely shelter the traveler in his or her transition from street vehicle to train. Initially, the station complex included an iron bridge that crossed not only the tracks, but also what is now the expressway. This bridge deteriorated to the point that it was removed at some point after the station was listed on the Register. The Central stopped service to the station in the 1960s. It was vacant and neglected until its conversion for office use in 1984, a project that did not significantly alter the station beyond enclosing the porte-coch√®re. Two years later, in 1986, a small section of new track was laid north of the station to accommodate the Pullman cars. There have been no alterations since. Today it is the offices of an electrical contractor and architect.

It was released on 29 July 2010 and is a sequel to the 2008 game Hero of Sparta. The game follows the player's efforts as Argos, an ancient Greek king, as he attempts to save the city of Sparta from the demonic armies of Hades. Story The game begins where its predecessor left off, as Argos emerges from the Underworld on his ship. As he sets sail towards Sparta, Hades suddenly appears in the sky, and threatens that should Argos set foot in Sparta, the armies of the Underworld will be unleashed and will destroy Argos' world. Argos nevertheless attempts to defy Hades, and continues forwards to the shores. As Hades had warned, demonic creatures shoot up from the ground as soon as Argos steps off his ship. Argos makes his way back to the city, which is being completely destroyed by a large Manticore. Argos hunts the beast through Sparta before eventually confronting and brutally slaying it in the city theatre. However, Hades informs Argos that the Manticore attack was only the beginning of an endless torment, and that he must seek out Selene, the goddess of the moon, if he wishes to undo what he did. Argos travels to Selene's temple, but finds that it is submerged deep beneath a lake. Selene appears before Argos and tells him that draining the lake will be his first great test. Argos travels around the lake and manages to drain the lake using a large pipeline system, on his way finding a pair of golden wings. He then proceeds to enter the temple, where he finds the Crown of Meteors. Selene appears again and says that the Crown and the wings were two of several items that he must find on his quest, and that she can guide him no longer. However, she tells him that Pegasus is locked up at the bottom of the temple, and that Argos must release him in order to carry on. Argos finds and releases Pegasus before evacuating the temple; however, he first has to escape from the Guardian, a gigantic water entity, as it attempts to stop him from leaving with Pegasus. After escaping from the Guardian, Pegasus flies Argos to Egypt, where he is stopped in his tracks by a woman calling herself 'the Sphinx Master'. She tells Argos that he may go no further and proceeds to battle him; however, he manages to defeat her before taking the Sphinx Claws, her signature weapons. As she dies on the ground, the Sphinx Master reveals that his visit was foreseen in a prophecy, and tells him to go forth to an underground temple at the end of the valley ahead. Argos follows her directions to the underground temple, where he finds the Thunder Spear, another mystical weapon. Pegasus takes Argos back to Greece, but they are struck down by the Colossus, which is guarding the road ahead. Argos heads over a pile of destroyed ships towards the Colossus before defeating it by catapulting himself into the monster's head. He then heads through the gate the Colossus was guarding, and finds that it leads to the fortress of Khronos, the god of time. Now aware of his final goal, Argos scales the fortress and defeats Khronos. He then harnesses the god's power, and travels back in time to the point when he emerged from the Underworld. Rather than heading back to Sparta like he did before, he instead turns the ship around and sails away, preventing the apocalypse from ever happening. Gameplay The game consists of 11 levels where the player controls Argos as he fights through Hades' armies. Argos collects \\"orbs\\" from his fallen enemies; green for health, and blue for mana. He can also find \\"seals\\", hidden power-ups that can be used to upgrade weapons in various ways.These seals come as the elements of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. After collecting a set of them (Three seals to a set) Your weapon of choice will be granted a special power. When enemies are weakened, Argos can also activate quick-time events to kill them. Doing so will earn Argos more orbs, and sometimes it is necessary for advancing the story. 2010 video games Action-adventure games Bada games IOS games Video games set in antiquity Video games based on Greek mythology Video games developed in Spain ","title":"Hero of Sparta II"},{"id":"30257258","text":"Oleh Leschynskyi (); Oleg Leshchinsky (); (born 31 December 1965 in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR) is a former Soviet professional football midfielder and Ukrainian (until 2014) and Russian (since 2014) coach.

His genealogy was as follows: Al-Husayn bin Imam al-Qasim bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Imam al-Qasim al-Rassi bin Ibrahim Tabataba bin Isma'il al-Dibaj bin Ibrahim bin al-Hasan al-Ridha bin Imam al-Hasan bin Imam Ali bin Abi Talib. Al-Husayn was a Sayyid originally from Tarj, Tihamah. His father was the imam al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani who briefly held power in the Yemeni inland in 999‚Äì1002, and died in 1003. After the death of al-Mansur, al-Husayn set forth his claim to the imamate, in rivalry with his distant relative ad-Da'i Yusuf. He declared himself with the title al-Mahdi.Enzyklop√§die des Islam, Vol. IV. Leiden 1934, p. 1296. He was supported by large groups from Himyar and Hamdan. At this time, the key city San'a was governed by the Zaidi sharif al-Qasim bin al-Husayn. The sharif was expelled from the city, pursued and killed in 1012. The rival imam ad-Da'i died in the same year. With this, the power of al-Mahdi al-Husayn extended from Alhan to Sa'dah and San'a. However, in 1013, the imam was attacked by a Hamdanite force near Dhu Bin and lost his life.H.C. Kay, Yaman; Its early Medieval History. London 1892, pp. 228-9. Like many Zaidi imams, al-Mahdi al-Husayn was a prominent author. After his demise, his brother Ja'far played a political role as emir in the Yemeni highlands for several decades.

Opened in 1866, it forms part of the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway, which also links Florence with Rome. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Regional train services calling at the station are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. Location Orneore Metelli, Temporale alla stazione di Assisi (1938). Assisi railway station is situated at Piazza Dante Alighieri, in the frazione of Santa Maria degli Angeli, about southwest of the city centre. History The station was opened on 21 July 1866, upon the inauguration of the Foligno‚ÄìCollestrada section of the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway. Features The passenger building is on two levels, but only the ground floor is accessible to the traveller. The first floor houses some Trenitalia offices. Next to the passenger building is another building, single storey but lengthy. It, too, houses Trenitalia offices. On the other side of the passenger building (originally occupied by a goods yard) there are other small single storey buildings, which house the RFI technical departments. The station yard consists of three tracks: track 1 is just a single track through line, and the other two tracks are used for overtaking. All tracks are served by platforms connected by an underpass. Previously, there was a goods yard that has now been dismantled. As at 2010, the yard area was vacant. Passenger and train movements The station has about 800,000 passenger movements each year. Trains are mainly regional rail services, with occasional InterCity trains to Milan, and Eurostar trains to Perugia and Rome. Regional services are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. InterCity and long-distance services are operated by Trenitalia itself. About 54 trains call at the station each day. The main destinations of the regional trains are Rome, Florence, Foligno, Terontola- Cortona, Terni and Perugia. Interchange Local bus services link the station with the city centre.

The most influential definitions of the term come from international institutions, e.g., the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the United Nations agencies, e.g., United Nations Development Program, World Health Organization and UNICEF, and the aid organizations, e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The crucial point of debate is in how resources that define the 'fiscal space' should be viewed and thus calculated. In particular, unlike the IMF-World Bank,See: World Bank, \\"Infrastructure: Lessons from the Last Two Decades of World Bank Engagement,\\" January 30, 2006 World Bank, Development Committee, \\"Fiscal Policy for Growth & Development (FPGD): An Interim Report,\\" April 23, 2006. the UN agencies advocates defining it in relation to the extent to which a government can mobilize resources to a means to combat poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The term featured during campaigning ahead of the 2016 Irish general election. Moody's Analytics provides monthly estimates of the fiscal space of many countries. They define it as the difference between an estimated upper limit of public debt (beyond which action would have to be taken to avoid default) and actual public debt, expressed as a percentage of GDP or equivalently as the difference between the debt-limit-to-GDP percentage and the actual-debt-to-GDP percentage.

It was formed in Philadelphia by American citizens concerned by the outbreak of World War I in Europe. Support for the league dissolved and it ceased operations by 1923. History =Prewar projects= In his Nobel Prize address of 1910, Theodore Roosevelt said: \\"it would be a master stroke if those great Powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep the peace among themselves, but to prevent, by force if necessary, its being broken by others.\\"Henry F. Pringle, Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography (1931) p 519 The planned league would have executive power such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 lacked. He called for American participation. =Wartime= No one expected a world war to start in 1914, but the July Crisis launched World War I and made the cause of peace an immediate concern. Activism calling for the formation of an international organization to contain and respond to violence began in 1914 with speaking tours. Roosevelt proposed in September 1914 \\"a World League for the Peace of Righteousness,\\" which would preserve sovereignty but limit armaments and require arbitration - and added that it should be \\"solemnly covenanted that if any nations refused to abide by the decisions of such a court, then others draw the sword in behalf of peace and justice.\\" In 1915, he outlined this plan more specifically, urging that nations guarantee their entire military force, if necessary, against any nation that refused to carry out arbitration decrees or violated rights of other nations. He insisted upon the participation of the United States as one of the \\"joint guarantors.\\" Roosevelt referred to this plan in a 1918 speech as \\"the most feasible for...a league of nations.\\"William Clinton Olson \\" Theodore Roosevelt's Conception of an International League\\" World Affairs Quarterly (1959) 29#4 pp 329-353.Stephen Wertheim, \\"The league that wasn't: American designs for a legalist-sanctionist league of nations and the intellectual origins of international organization, 1914‚Äì1920.\\" Diplomatic History 35.5 (2011): 797-836. By this time Wilson was strongly hostile to Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, and developed his own plans for a rather different League of Nations. It became reality along Wilson's lines at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. =League formed= Roosevelt denounced Wilson's approach but died before it was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations. In the end, on March 19, 1920, Wilson had Democratic Senators vote against the League with the Lodge Reservations, while Republicans opposed Wilson's plan to join the League without reservations, and the United States never joined the League of Nations.David Mervin, \\"Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations.\\" Journal of American Studies 4#2 (1971): 201-214. online Advocates worked to distinguish their efforts from antiwar efforts aimed at preventing American participation in the war and to counter misimpression that they were trying to end the war in Europe.New York Times: \\"Seek to Stir West for Peace League,\\" July 31, 1914, accessed January 1, 2011 Hamilton Holt published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine The Independent titled \\"The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal\\" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by Viscount James Bryce, a former ambassador from the U.K. to the U.S.Herman, 56-7 Group of people of the League to Enforce Peace, William H. Taft is in the center of the photograph, 1916, Harris & Ewing At a convention in Philadelphia's Independence Hall on June 17, 1915, with the first president of the League of Peace, former U.S. President William Howard Taft, presiding, one hundred noteworthy Americans formally announced the formation of the League to Enforce Peace. They proposed an international agreement in which participating nations would agree to \\"jointly use their economic and military force against any one of their number that goes to war or commits acts of hostility against another.\\" The founders included Elihu Root, Alexander Graham Bell, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, James Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore, and Edward Filene on behalf of the recently founded U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Elected to the Executive Committee were Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, former Cabinet member and diplomat Oscar S. Straus, magazine editor Hamilton Holt, Taft, and a dozen othersNew York Times: \\"League to Enforce Peace is Launched,\\" June 18, 1915, accessed January 2, 2010 Pacifists rejected the league's notion of collective security and nationalists rejected the idea of America submitting to arbitration. The founders, on the other hand, though varied in their outlooks, expressed a long established ideal of the civilizing influence of the British Empire and American democracy.Herman, p. 57ff. The initial efforts of the League to Enforce Peace aimed at creating public awareness through magazine articles and speeches. S. Harrison White, Justice and Chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, lectured across the United States on behalf of the League to Enforce Peace. The League of Peace combined enthusiastic support for the American war effort with its proposals for a new international order to follow the defeat of Germany. It presented its plans for an international organization to respond to any nation that would follow a course like that of German militarism.New York Times: \\"To Hold War Convention,\\" March 18, 1918, accessed January 1, 2011 Anachronous map of the world between 1920 and 1945 which shows The League of Nations and the world. President Wilson's specific proposal for the League of Nations met resistance from the Republican-controlled Senate and the opposition led by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. The high- minded debate deteriorated until the ideal of international cooperation was, writes one historian, \\"sacrificed to party intrigue, personal antipathy, and pride of authorship.\\"Yeomans, 454 The League to Enforce Peace believed American participation was more important than the exact nature of the organization, but found itself defending Wilson's plan against attempts to restrict American participation in it.New York Times: \\"Straus Deplores Taft Reservations,\\" July 25, 1919, accessed January 1, 2011 When the U.S. Senate debated the treaty with Germany, the League of Peace opposed attempts in the Senate to restrict American participation in international arbitration.New York Times: \\"Reed Reservation Called Fatal,\\" November 17, 1919, accessed January 1, 2011 In February 1919, the League held a series of public meetings in more than half-a-dozen American cities in support of Wilson's League proposal.New York Times: \\"Send Committee to Paris,\\" December 19, 1918, accessed January 1, 201 President Wilson thanked the League for its support.New York Times: \\"Wilson Praises Support,\\" February 15, 1919, accessed January 1, 2011 In the summer of 1919, the League of Peace published a book of essays modeled on The Federalist Papers called The Covenanter: An American Exposition of the Covenant of the League of Nations. It delivered a copy to every member of Congress.New York Times: \\"Issues 'The Covenanter',\\" July 2, 1919, accessed January 1, 2011 Lowell, Taft, and former Attorney-General George W.

For example, in November 1920, it analyzed the annual budgets of the League of Nations to demonstrate that participation in the League of Nations in the coming year would cost the United States \\"exactly one-tenth of one percent of what we spent on armaments during a single year before the war, while it would amount to something like two- thousandth of one per cent of what the direct cost of our belligerency reached in 1918.\\"New York Times: \\"Compares Cost of War and League of Nations,\\" November 22, 1920, accessed January 1, 2011 =Dissolution= Support for the League of Peace dissolved and it ceased operations by 1923.

They finished 4th out of the 9 teams in the newly formed leagues' first season. The club was disbanded due to financial reasons in July 2019 History The club began in 1979 as Red Star Southampton, competing in the Home Counties League then the Southern Regions League. In 1991 Red Star won the Southern Region Division One and became founder members of the FA Women's Premier League National Division. In August 1991 the club were in Russia as guests of FC Spartak Moscow during the collapse of the Soviet Union. The first season at national level saw Red Star finish second in the League to Doncaster Belles and also lose the 1992 WFA Cup final 4‚Äì0 to the same opponents. Red Star failed to build on their promising start and were relegated from the top flight in 1994‚Äì95. In summer 1995 the club became known as Southampton Saints due to affiliation with Southampton F.C., winning promotion as Southern Premier League champions in 1995‚Äì96. However the club's second spell in the top-flight lasted only a season, as 1996‚Äì97 ended in another relegation.

As part of this process the Saints' long-serving manager Vanessa Raynbird was controversially sacked to make way for a male coach. The club was relegated in 2002‚Äì03 and this time was unable to bounce straight back, missing out on promotion by a point in 2003‚Äì04. Sue Lopez had been appointed manager in 2003. In 2005 Southampton FC were relegated from the men's Premier League and withdrew their support for Southampton Saints as a result.

They had evaded relegation by a point in 2005‚Äì06.

Juli√† died in January 2019 at the age of 98.Mor Conxita Juli√†, la nena del mocador de Companys The Companys handkerchief In 1934, Llu√≠s Companys, with the rest of the Catalan government, was imprisoned for his role in the political rebellion known as the \\"events of October the 6th\\". Initially they were held on the prison ship Uruguai in Barcelona, which the fourteen-year-old Conxita visited with her father to show their support. They were later moved to a prison in C√°diz in southern Spain. Conxita wrote to Companys in C√°diz, sending him a supportive poem called \\"Al meu aire\\". He replied to her, and they exchanged several more letters, hers in verse, during his imprisonment. In 1936, following his release by the new left-wing Spanish government, he returned to Barcelona and his old job as president of the Catalan autonomous government. On 14 April that year Companys attended a ceremony at the grave of Francesc Maci√† in Montju√Øc cemetery, where Conxita approached him and identified herself. Companys embraced her warmly, and when she asked him for a memento, he presented her with the white silk handkerchief from the breast pocket of his jacket, which was one of his famous symbols, exhorting her to \\"guard it, and love Catalonia\\". She brought the handkerchief home, and had a neighbour embroider it with the Catalan coat of arms and wording explaining the handkerchief's origin. Later in 1936, the Spanish civil war broke out, which resulted in a victory for the Nationalists in 1939. Conxita's parents decided to burn everything the family had which might incriminate them, including Conxita's letters from Companys, who had now fled into exile. However, she managed to hide the handkerchief inside the lining of her coat, and carried it around with her from then on. In the following years, Conxita got married and started having children, still living in the Poblenou district of Barcelona, where she grew up. One day she received a warning that she was being monitored by local agents of the repressive authorities, so in fear of being found in its possession she sent the handkerchief away to Catalan acquaintances in Caracas in Venezuela, for safekeeping in the Catalan Centre in that city. Following the end of Francoist Spain and the Spanish transition to democracy, she started making enquiries about getting the handkerchief back, and with the assistance of politicians and secured its return and presented it to the Catalan government in 1993. The handkerchief is now stored in the in Barcelona. Monument In April 1998, a memorial bronze-and-stone sculpture called A Llu√≠s Companys (\\"to Llu√≠s Companys\\") was unveiled in Barcelona, at the junction of Ronda de Sant Pere and Passeig de Sant Joan, near the Arc de Triomf. It was created by Spanish sculptor . Although it is named for Companys and the inscription only mentions Companys, its main feature is a two-metre-high figure of Conxita Juli√† at about 20 years old (her age at the time of Companys's execution), holding a handkerchief and a rose and leaning on a memorial plaque to Companys. On 15 October each year, the anniversary of Companys's execution, a floral tribute is laid at this monument, with Juli√† in attendance. Poetry and other activities Poetry by Juli√† was published throughout her life in various magazines and anthologies, such as Tramuntane (Perpignan), and performances, such as at the (in Barcelona).

The gas field is roughly west of Haifa in waters deep in the Levantine basin, a rich hydrocarbon area in one of the largest offshore natural gas field finds. According to some commentators, the gas find has the potential to change Israel's foreign relations with neighboring countries Turkey, and Egypt. Together with the nearby Tamar gas field, the Leviathan field is seen as an opportunity for Israel to achieve a degree of energy independence in the Middle East. As of 2017, even by conservative estimates, Leviathan holds enough gas to meet Israel's domestic needs for 40 years. The field began commercial production of gas on 31 December 2019. History Boundaries of the Levant Basin, or Levantine Basin (US EIA) The potential for a natural gas prospect at the Leviathan site was identified by geologist Eitan Aizenberg, co-founder of the small Israeli oil exploration company Ratio. To assist with exploring the prospect Ratio enlisted the cooperation of another Israeli firm, Delek, who then brought in Texas-based Noble Energy to the venture ‚Äì with whom it had previously developed the small Mari-B offshore gas field in southern Israel under the Yam Tethys partnership. In July, 2010, Noble Energy announced that seismic studies indicated there was a 50% chance of the Leviathan field containing natural gas, with the potential reserve size being estimated at . The initial exploration well, Leviathan 1, was drilled to a depth of and the discovery was announced on December 30, 2010. The cost of drilling the exploration well was $92.5 million.Ratio Oil Exploration Limited Partnership Annual Report 2010, p.74. (Hebrew version) The well was drilled by the Homer Ferrington rig. The second stage of drilling of the Leviathan 1 well was intended to reach a depth of , which would include an additional natural gas reserve and potentially 600 million barrels of oil.Leviathan partners to raise gas reserves estimate Globes, 22 April 12 13:22, Hillel Koren While the gas discovery at -5170m was made in the Tamar sands layer which was already known to contain gas, the additional oil and gas potential exists in layers that have not been explored in the Levant basin. Noble has twice failed to reach the deeper layers due to technical challenges with drilling to the extreme depths involved. However, during drilling towards the intended target some gas was detected and as of 2012 Noble still had plans to explore those layers. The Leviathan gas field was the second largest gas field in the Mediterranean Sea after the August 2015 discovery of the Zohr field off the coast of Egypt, only 6 km from Cyprus's Block 11. Chevron Corporation operates Leviathan with a 39.66% working interest; Delek holds 22.67%; Avner Oil Exploration holds 22.67%; and Ratio Oil Exploration holds the remaining 15%. In February 2014, Woodside Energy agreed to buy a 25% stake of the Leviathan field for up to US$2.55 billion. It was announced on 21 May 2014 that Woodside Energy pulled out of an agreement to take a stake worth up to $2.7 billion in Israel's flagship Leviathan gas project, as the group developing the field shifted focus to regional markets. In the summer of 2014, Netherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI) made an upward revision on the amount of gas reserves, giving a 2P value of 621 BCM. The expected year of production was stated to be 2017. In April, 2015, the Israel Ministry of Energy reported that it was working with NSAI and the Leviathan partners to understand the discrepancy between the NSAI revised estimate and the estimate provided by other analyses provided to the ministry, indicated a best estimate of only 16.5 tcf (470 BCM).New report sees 20% less gas reserves in Leviathan Globes, 3 June 2015, Hedy Cohen On 19 October 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to allow major concessions for Gazprom to develop the Leviathan reserves. On 19 February 2018, The partners in Israel‚Äôs Tamar and Leviathan natural gas fields signed $15 billion in deals to export natural gas to Egypt over 10 years. One accord calls for the sale of 3.5 BCM of natural gas annually from the Leviathan field, for a total of 32 BCM, estimating the sale from the Leviathan field to reach $7.5 billion. Regarding the deal, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, declared about the project : \\"Has a lot of advantages for us (Egyptians). And I want people to be reassured\\". Yossi Abu, chief executive of Delek Drilling, said: \\"I think that the main thing is that Egypt is becoming the real gas hub of the region\\". In September 2020, the owners of the field agreed to sell $190 million worth of natural gas to a power plant in Ramat Hovav. =Inovo BV controversy= Inovo BV, the Dutch corporation owned by Kamil Ekim Alptekin, claims to be the sole Turkish representative in Ratio Oil Exploration. Ratio has denied that it has any affiliation with Alptekin or Inovo BV, though BuzzFeed News has produced evidence documenting a relationship dating back to at least early 2016. Technical description Gas production is carried out by four wells connected by two 18-inch, 73-mile subsea tiebacks to a gas processing platform located 10 km offshore Dor, Israel. The processing platform has the capacity to handle up to 1.2 BCF of gas per day (12 BCM per year) and could be expanded to handle up to 2.1 BCF per day (21 BCM per year). Rights dispute The existence of the Leviathan gas fields poses several challenges to states in that area of the Eastern Mediterranean, in terms of cooperation between them, as well as for the wider Mediterranean energy context. After discovery of the Leviathan gas fields in 2010, Lebanon argued that the field extends into Lebanese waters. Lebanon‚Äôs Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri stated that Israel is \\"ignoring the fact that according to the maps the deposit extends into Lebanese waters,\\" Agence France-Presse reported on June 9. Israeli Minister of National Infrastructures Uzi Landau responded \\"We will not hesitate to use our force and strength to protect not only the rule of law but the international maritime law,\\" in an interview. In August 2010, Lebanon submitted to the United Nations its official view regarding the maritime border, indicating that it considered the Tamar and Leviathan gas fields to be outside Lebanese territory (though it indicated other prospective fields in the region may be within Lebanese territory). The US expressed support for the Lebanon proposal.

HD 36960 (HR 1887) is a B-type main-sequence star in the constellation Orion. At an apparent magnitude of +4.78 it is easily visible to the naked eye in many areas, though in most urban areas it cannot be seen due to light pollution. Although it does not have a Bayer or Flamsteed designation, it is brighter than over 30 Flamsteed stars in Orion, as well as being brighter than any of the stars in the nearby Orion Nebula such as Œ∏1 Orionis C and Œ∏2 Orionis. HD 36960 forms a close pair with the slightly fainter HD 36959 36\\" away. Multiple star catalogues also list the 9th magnitude BD-06¬∞1233 as part of the system. HD 36959 is itself a very close binary with a 9th magnitude companion. All these stars are likely members of open cluster NGC 1980 which includes Œπ Orionis 7' away. At over 15 solar masses, it shines with around 20,000 times the Sun's luminosity due to its high surface temperature of 29,000 K and radius over five times that of the sun. It is calculated to be around six million years old, consistent with other stars thought to be members of NGC 1980.

On January 23, 2014, at the age of 22, Elliot was sentenced to 20 years in prison for two counts of sexual assault against a former female Baylor athlete. He is expected to serve a minimum of 10 years before becoming eligible for parole sometime in 2024, around the age of 33. In May 2016 reports surfaced that Baylor University and its head football coach Art Briles were aware of Elliot's assault and rape of a Baylor student. A report issued by the Pepper Hamilton law firm‚Äîhired to investigate Baylor's treatment of sexual assault claims‚Äîsubstantiated much of the report and indicated that Baylor took actions to cover up its students' reports of sexual assault and rape.

His parents separated, and he was brought up in a socialist boarding school operated by the ISK, a German socialist party founded by Leonard Nelson. After the rise of Nazism, the party was banned in Germany and its property was seized. The school frequently relocated to different European countries, as Nazi strength grew. During the Second World War the adults in the party were interned on the Isle of Man and Nemenyi lived in a number of foster homes and youth homes.

The church is the parish church of the State of Vatican City and is placed under the jurisdiction of the Vicariate of the Vatican City and is located beside the Porta Sant'Anna (Saint Anne's Gate), an international border crossing between Vatican City State and Italy.St Peter's Basilica also has parochial rights within Vatican City. Commissioned by the , Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola introduced the oval plan to church design, for the first time in the churches of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia and Saint Anne in Vatican, pioneering a plan which was to become influential to Baroque architecture.  History  On 20 November 1565, Pope Pius IV authorized the Archconfraternity of the Pontifical Grooms to build a church dedicated to Saint Anne close to the Apostolic Palace. The construction began that same year on a design attributed to Renaissance architect Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola. It was one of the first churches in Rome with an elliptical plan. According to David Watkin, Vignola introduced the oval plan to church design for the first time in the churches of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia and Saint Anne in the Vatican, pioneering a plan which was to become influential to Baroque architecture. After a smooth start, the construction of the church slowed because the Archconfraternity was in financial trouble. After Vignola's death in 1573, the church was finished by his son Giacinto Barozzi, according to a payment made by the Archconfraternity. When it was consecrated in 1583 it had a temporary roof. The facade attributed to Borromini and later attached to the oval church prefigured the facade of the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone in attempting to reconciled a front with five bats to two towers. The facade was completed between 1700 and 1721 by Alessandro Specchi while the dome was finally built in 1763 and completed in 1775. Engraving of 1615, which shows the gabled roof, with the bell tower The Archconfraternity briefly exhibited in St. Anne a pairing of the saint it commissioned in 1603 from Caravaggio. Destined for the altar of the papal Grooms in the Basilica of Saint Peter, it was painted in 1605‚Äì1606, Madonna and Child with St. Anne. It was later sold to Cardinal Scipione Borghese and now hangs in the museum of the Galleria Borghese. The church belonged to the Archconfraternity until the Lateran Treaties of 1929, which constituted the Vatican City. Pope Pius XI erected the church into a parish, with the Apostolic Constitution \\"Ex Lateranensi pacto\\" of 30 May 1929. The pastoral care of the new parish was entrusted to the Augustinian Order. In return, Pope Pius XI granted the Archconfraternity the church of Santa Caterina della Rota.  Interior  The interior, built to Vignola's design, is elliptical with eight side chapels. The main entrance is located at one end of the major axis of the ellipse. The minor axis ends with two chapels. Four doors surmounted by a pediment and framed by travertine columns with Corinthian capitals are distributed between the main altar and the side chapels. Four large arches rise at the ends of the two main axes, framing the areas of entry, the altar and the two chapels. The sacred area of the main altar is a square enclosed by four arches as a clear counterpoint to the oval part of the church. The dome itself rests on a plinth with a cornice with three strips, pierced at the base by eight windows. At the top of the dome stands the lantern, the only source of natural light onto the main altar. It is decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit, from which golden rays radiate in circle. Until the mid-18th century, the inner walls of the church were white and the columns showed the natural color of the travertine stone, typical of Renaissance churches. Influenced by the rise of the Baroque in Rome, the Archconfraternity started redecorating the church with more lavish decorations and plenty of gilt and stucco. The fa√ßade was re-decorated in the Baroque style by Alessandro Specchi who added the upper facade to Vignola's church. The dome was designed by Francesco Navole. They commissioned in 1746 the sculptor Giovan Battista de' Rossi (Il Rosso) to redecorate the church with angels holding garlands in stucco above the doors. Four windows were walled and replaced with four frescoes depicting scenes from the life of Saint Anne. Giovan Battista de' Rossi also made in stucco shells with festoons decorating the frescoes. The decorator Annibale Rotati (c. 1673‚Äì1750) colored the walls in blue, cream and light gray. The doorjambs were decorated with marble stucco marbled by Giacomo de Rocchi. The gold and silver stucco was made by Pietro Ricci. Despite the Baroque decoration, the initial plan of the church is still visible.

It is usually rocky terrain on which grass has established itself, but it can also refer to purely rocky slopes. Schrofen are found especially where the rock has broken off against its angle of dip. Schrofen differs from trackless terrain in that hands are needed in order to negotiate it. Often there are route markings that only indicate a rough direction.So gehen Sie sicher im Schrofengel√§nde (\\"How to negotiate schrofen terrain safely\\") at www.alpin.de. Accessed on 31 Dec 2010 Schrofen terrain requires at least sure-footedness and is typical of grade I climbing routes. In wet weather schrofen can become very dangerous because of the increased risk of slipping, particularly in the descent. In addition, the risk of falling in schrofen terrain is often underestimated. In keeping with the base meaning of the word (\\"rock spikes\\"), schrofen also forms part of the name of numerous mountains in the Northern Limestone Alps. Alpine farms near a schrofen are often named after it, as are their access roads, e.g.: Ob dm Schrofa, Schrofaweg.

History  The wall was erected after the old Berlin Fortress was demolished in 1734; the walls of the latter had already started to crumble and its military function was questionable. Frederick William I of Prussia ordered the construction of stockades around the city which were completed in 1737 - the new ring fence incorporated the existing northern \\"palisade line\\" built in 1705. The location of this oldest stockade is recalled today by the street name \\"Linienstra√üe\\" (line street). Few parts of this original customs wall were stone-built. The original customs wall had 14 city gates which were mostly named after the city to which the ensuing road led. Additionally, the river Spree was blocked with customs gates called \\"Oberbaum\\" (upper beam) and \\"Unterbaum\\" (lower beam) after the heavy tree trunks, covered in metal spikes, that were used as booms to block the river at night to prevent smuggling. The new wall engirded not only the city of Berlin and its suburbs but also some rural land in the east and south. Wall monument made from excavated stones With the growth of Berlin, the stockades and gates were moved as dictated by circumstances during the following decades. Between 1786 and 1802 the wooden stockades were replaced by stone walls at a height of 4 metres. Also, various gates were rebuilt in an imposing style, one notable example being the Brandenburg Gate. In the middle of the century more gates were added to meet the increased transport requirements - these included New Gate (1832), Anhalt Gate (1839/1840), K√∂penick Gate (1842) and Water Gate (1848). The middle of the century was marked by new railway lines terminating in stations built in front of the wall usually near one of its gates. This was the case with Potsdam Station (1841), Anhalt Station (1842), Stettin Station (1842), Hamburg Station (1846) - only Frankfurt Station (1842) was built just inside the ring wall. An interconnecting railway line, the (\\"Berliner Verbindungsbahn\\") for goods and military transport, was built in 1851 linking the terminal stations and thus turning Berlin into a central transport hub for Prussia and the German Customs Union. With the rise of Berlin, new suburbs were built outside the Customs Wall, which increasingly became a hindrance to the continued development of the city. In 1860 the Customs Wall was removed and on 1 January 1861 Berlin amalgamated its suburbs resulting in a doubling of the city's population. The remaining walls were demolished for the most part between 1867 and 1870 - including most of the gates. Only the Brandenburg Gate remains today. With the old walls out of the way, the city developed quickly almost doubling in population over the following decade. The interconnecting railway line (on the southern and western sides) was replaced by the circle line railway in 1871, and the existing railway track was then used by horsecar lines. The route of the southern lines was used for the first electric metro line in 1900, which is now the U1 (Berlin U-Bahn). Its metro stations Silesian Gate (Schlesisches Tor), Cottbus Gate (Kottbusser Tor), Halle Gate (Hallesches Tor), and former Stralau Gate (Stralauer Tor) are a reminder of its heritage. The following streets follow the original route of the customs wall: Stresemannstra√üe (former K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe), Marchlewskistra√üe, Friedenstra√üe, Prenzlauer Berg avenue, part of Prenzlauer Allee, Torstra√üe, Hannoversche Stra√üe, Charit√©stra√üe, part of Reinhardtstra√üe, and Ebertstra√üe.  Gates  The eighteen city gates and two river gates are still visible on the map, their names having been given to squares and streets. In clockwise order these are: * Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor at Pariser Platz /Unter den Linden), the only city gate left. * Unterbaum (near Unterbaumstra√üe). * New Gate (Neues Tor at today's \\"Platz vor dem Neuen Tor\\", design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel). * Oranienburg Gate (Oranienburger Tor at Torstra√üe /Friedrichstra√üe) ‚Äì the original gate was sold to Gro√ü Behnitz * Hamburg Gate (Hamburger Tor at Torstra√üe /Kleine Hamburger Stra√üe). * Rosenthal Gate (Rosenthaler Tor at Torstra√üe /Rosenthaler Stra√üe near Rosenthaler Platz). * Sch√∂nhausen Gate (Sch√∂nhauser Tor at Torstra√üe /Sch√∂nhauser Allee). * Prenzlau Gate (Prenzlauer Tor at Torstra√üe /Prenzlauer Allee). * Bernau Gate (Bernauer Tor, since 1809 \\"K√∂nigstor\\", at Greifswalder Stra√üe /Am Friedrichshain) * Landsberg Gate (Landsberger Tor at Landsberger Allee /Friedenstra√üe). * Frankfurt Gate (Frankfurter Tor, west of the current location somewhere near U-Bahnhof Weberwiese). * Stralau Gate (Stralauer Tor, earlier named \\"M√ºhlentor\\" / Mills Gate) (Warschauer Stra√üe /Stralauer Allee /M√ºhlenstra√üe). * Oberbaum (Oberbaumbr√ºcke). * Silesian Gate (Schlesisches Tor, earlier \\"Wendentor\\" / Wends Gate) (Skalitzer Stra√üe /Schlesische Stra√üe am U-Bahnhof Schlesisches Tor). * K√∂penick Gate (K√∂penicker Tor at Lausitzer Platz). * Cottbus Gate (Kottbusser Tor at Skalitzer Stra√üe /Kottbusser Stra√üe near U-Bahnhof Kottbusser Tor). * Water Gate (Wassertor on today's Wassertorplatz): named the crossing point of the new Luisenstadt canal. * Halle Gate (Hallesches Tor at Hallesches Ufer /Mehringplatz near U-Bahnhof Hallesches Tor), After the original gate was dismantled, two buildings were built by Heinrich Strack in 1876-9.

It consists of several brick buildings from the 19th century, in a variety of contemporary architectural styles. In 1980 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Most of the original buildings succumbed to fire in the 1870s, but the oldest, a Greek Revival building possibly designed by Calvin Pollard in the 1830s, remains. Nearby is a corrugated iron structure that may be the earliest use of that material in Westchester County. The main building itself was one of the first to have Otis elevators installed.Village of Ossining, , April 2010, retrieved July 22, 2011, p. 83. Benjamin Brandreth made his family's popular medicine, said to treat blood impurities, at the factory, starting in the 1830s. The factory's construction was the beginning of the industrial development of the Ossining waterfront. It continued to be used for manufacturing until the 1940s. Some of the smaller buildings remain in use today, although the former main building is vacant. The village had been considering a proposal to convert the main factory building to green housing. After a proposal to do so failed to gain approval, due in part to flooding concerns in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the owners demolished part of the building in 2015. The village claimed it was illegal as the permit had expired; the owners claimed otherwise. Buildings and grounds The site stretches along the north end of Water Street on Ossining's waterfront, close to the Hudson River and the railroad tracks of Metro-North's Hudson Line and Amtrak's Empire Service. With the exception of a modern warehouse facility at the end of the street, north of the old main building, they are the only buildings in the area, some still used for industrial or commercial purposes. The land is level due to the proximity of the river; Water Street generally follows the lower edge of a steep wooded bluff to the north end of the site, where a stream flows into the Hudson and opens a wide gorge. Just past the fork to Solitude Lane, about north of the intersection with Snowden Avenue and Westerly Road, are the first set of buildings. Between the street and the tracks is a gable-roofed one-story brick storage building with segmental-arched windows. East of the street is a group of small buildings that constituted the factory in its earliest days‚ÄîBrandreth's office (now demolished), a mixing and packing building, a box-making building and the storage facility that is the oldest building of the group. Set back a short distance are two single-story buildings. The northerly of the pair is a Carpenter Gothic-styled one-story structure with a gabled roof, board-and- batten siding and lancet arched windows in the gables. It was used to dry pills and make boxes, and as office space. It has been modified greatly since its construction. The southerly is a flat-roofed brick building used for pill manufacture. alt=A gray building with two sections, both with large garage doors. A small green sign on the front of the smaller section, to the right, indicates that it is a registered New York State motor vehicle repair shop. Two cars are parked in front of that section, and behind the building is woods To their east, at the edge of the woods, is the oldest building in the factory complex. It is a two-story three-by-three-bay flat-roofed structure. Doric pilasters at each corner, along with three at evenly spaced intervals along between windows along the north and south facades, support a blank entablature below the roof. Their granite bases and capitals complement the granite sills and lintels on the windows. A modern concrete block addition is attached to the south. Inside, it retains much of its original furnishing. Another to the north, also between the road and the tracks, is a corrugated iron storage facility built on the original factory site. Its framing, visible on the exterior, consists of timber wrapped in iron. In both roof gables are simple classically inspired designs, also of iron-wrapped wood. Further along Water, another , on the east, is the joined complex of three buildings that included the three-story main building. It was an L-shaped three-story brick structure with a slate-covered mansard roof pierced by four brick chimneys. The tallest, near the south end of the L, rises two additional stories above the roof. Windows and doors had brick hood lintels; above the cast iron cornice supported by pendanted brackets were hooded dormer windows in the roof. Inside there was exposed original brick, segmental-arched entryways, walnut and cast iron roof columns and exposed roof framing. The main building had two additions: a one-story machine shop on the north side of the western corner, and a large two-story section with a corrugated iron gabled roof and segmental-arched windows without lintels extending east from the north end. The cleared sites of other additions, as well as several buildings in the bend of the L to the east, are still extant. To the west of the building, at the street, is a small brick office building with a granite water table. It is one and a half stories high, three bays by four, with a gabled roof supported by large wooden pendanted brackets. Its decoration also includes a course of painted brickwork crosses setting off an entablature above in the gable fields with some other isolated brickwork crosses. Fenestration consists of rectangular windows with granite sills and lintels along the north and south profiles, with an oculus in the gable apex. Stone steps lead to the paneled wooden and glass doors, sheltered by a curved canopy supported by large brackets at the sides. Inside the remaining original features include intricately molded woodwork and ceiling medallions, door hardware and a vault with a stone floor and brick walls. History alt=A slightly distressed oil painting of an old bearded man in a dark suit While the factory did not start out as Brandreth's, it became associated with him by the mid-19th century and remained so through the main building's partial demolition in the early 21st century. =1835‚Äì1939: Brandreth years= A native of the English city of Leeds who was raised in Liverpool, Benjamin Brandreth took over the patent medicine business started by his grandfather in the 1820s. He pioneered the use of advertising with testimonials to the effectiveness of the pills' treatment of the blood impurities thought to create disease at the time, and developed a growing presence in the English and American markets. In 1835 he moved to New York with his family. His success continued, and the following year he moved to Ossining, then known as Sing Sing, to acquire all the land the remaining buildings sit on, and build a factory. By 1837 he was working from two buildings, one of which is the Greek Revival building that still stands in the cluster of buildings east of the street at the south end of the site. It may have been designed by Calvin Pollard, who built two houses in Ossining for Brandreth (neither extant) during this period as well as St. Paul's Episcopal Church downtown. An early engraving, used in his ads, depicts the building as having three stories and a cupola. It was right on the shore of the Hudson. Brandreth may have found Sing Sing not only a beautiful place to do business but a strategic one as well. Agricultural produce shipped down to its active river port could be used as the vegetable base of the pills, and those pills could then be shipped down to New York City. At the time, there were also mining and quarrying operations, particularly at the new Sing Sing Prison, on the riverside, but Brandreth's manufacture of finished goods at his facility made his the first true industrial facility on the Ossining waterfront. alt=A color illustration of a naked child and a dog seen from the rear, sitting on a small pier on a riverbank with clothes at the right. In the distance are a sailing ship and a rocky mountain. The top of the image has the inscription \\"Allcock's Porous Plasters Are The Best\\" in red and black lettering. Smaller, curved lettering at the bottom reads \\"Brandreth's Pills\\" and the ship's sail says \\"Brandreth's Pills Purely Vegetable\\". After an 1838 trip down the Mississippi River to sell pills, the business grew even more. Brandreth became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1840, and became active in the politics of the growing village. He served as its president for three years, and later was elected to two separate terms in the State Senate. In 1848, he purchased an interest in fellow English American Thomas Allcock's Porous Plasters and began developing a facility to manufacture them on an old mill site further up the river. The Hudson River Railroad was being built through Sing Sing that year, further extending the company's reach and filling in the riverfront to provide a stable, straight surface for tracks. The latter opened more land for future building in the process. The factory's expansion served it well for the next two decades. It continued to produce 1.2 million boxes of pills annually, each of which retailed for 25 cents ($ in modern dollars). The pills were well known enough that Herman Melville mentioned them in Moby-Dick and Edgar Allan Poe devoted part of his story \\"Some Words with a Mummy\\" to a fanciful discussion of what their ingredients might be. P.T. Barnum gave Brandreth sardonic recognition in his book Humbugs of the World for his promotional skills. Back in Ossining, Brandreth helped establish two banks, and was on the founding board of Dale Cemetery, still the community's largest. If the company had wanted to expand during this period, the economic pressures of the Civil War prevented it from doing so. Seven years after the end of the war, in 1872, a fire destroyed many of the buildings, including Brandreth's first manufacturing facility., The New York Times; February 27, 1872; retrieved July 25, 2011. The rebuilding put up most of the surviving buildings, as well as the more modern facility on an old mill site at the north end of the property: the current main building. Brandreth wanted to incorporate the newest technology into his new buildings, and so the storage facility midway between the two complexes was one of the first in Westchester to use corrugated iron while the main building had some of the first Otis elevators. One morning in early 1880, Brandreth collapsed and died shortly after leaving his office. His son Franklin took over management. During the later years of the 19th century and the early 20th, the factory began to diversify its operations in response to increasing federal regulation of the patent-medicine industry. Among the new products were ammunition-box liners for the military during World War I. alt=A black-and-white photograph taken from the corner of a room with tables on which small objects are piled, some in containers and others loose. In the middle of the room women in white aprons are seated around the tables, apparently at work. Franklin Brandreth stepped down in 1928 and was replaced by his grandson Fox Brandreth Connor. By then the domestic market for the pills it had once manufactured in abundance was gone. Of the factory's earlier products, only porous plaster remained, and that was only made in winter. The company was making nail polish, mannequins, cell forms for bulletproof fuel tanks and the Havahart line of non-lethal animal traps. =1940‚Äì2015: Use, disuse and demolition= In 1940 the company sold the buildings at the southern end of the property to the Gallowhur corporation, which used them to make insect repellent and suntan lotion. The rights to the pill formula were also sold off after World War II. Brandreth's company, under the Allcock name, continued its manufacturing operations in the 1870s complex until 1979. They were later used by the Filex Corporation, a maker of steel office furniture. Eventually they became vacant again. In the 2000s a local developer, Plateau Associates, proposed the Hidden Cove on the Hudson project for the main building area. A total of 132 new housing units, planned as condominiums of a mix of prices, would be created, 28 of which would be in the main building. Plateau hoped to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the completed units. Plans apparently stalled after Plateau submitted its draft environmental impact statement (EIS) in 2008. At that time it also secured a demolition permit, but did not use it as other options were explored. In 2011 it prepared to submit a final EIS, with Hidden Cove now, in the wake of the Great Recession, changed to luxury rental units. alt=The factory building, largely demolished, behind a chainlink fence with bare trees in the background However, in 2007, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had issued updated flood plain maps for the Hudson River. They showed that the property would be under two feet () of water in a hundred-year storm. By late 2012 that probability had been demonstrated by flooding after three tropical storms‚ÄîIrene, Lee and Sandy‚Äîhad struck the region. The last of those storms had, in fact, flooded the factory area up to four feet (). In the wake of Sandy, FEMA issued new maps. Before Sandy, the already-deteriorated building's ground floor would have to be raised at least two feet, making it impossible to put any residential units on it. Afterwards, that would likely have been increased to six feet () \\"We were thinking about adaptive reuse of the mill,\\" said Peter Stolatis of Plateau. \\"The new floodplain plan puts an end to that.\\" Plans to demolish the building were accelerated by village officials' insistence that the project be limited to just one building rather than several, he added. Shortly afterward, the village's Historic Preservation Commission gave the building local landmark status. This meant that the building could not be demolished without its official permission. But in April 2015 Plateau Associates, the owner, began demolishing the building. While the company had been issued a demolition permit in 2008, Village manager Christine Papes said it had expired, and Plateau had not cleared its action with the village's Historic Preservation Commission, either. Plateau's lawyer claimed it had met all the village's requirements and not heard back from the village, so it proceeded with the demolition.

held in Beijing, China, from December 18 to December 22, 1978. The conference marked the beginning of the \\"Reform and Opening Up\\" policy, and is widely seen as the moment when Deng Xiaoping became paramount leader of China replacing Chairman Hua Guofeng, who remained nominal Chairman of the Communist Party of China until 1981. The meeting was a decisive turning point in post-1949 Chinese history, marking the beginning of the wholesale repudiation of Chairman Mao's \\"Cultural Revolution\\" policies, and set China on the course for nationwide economic reforms. The meeting took place at the Jingxi Hotel in western Beijing. Preparation Before the plenum, demands for a repudiation of the Cultural Revolution increased, especially by those who were persecuted during Mao Zedong's last year. In October 1976, the radical Gang of Four led by Mao's widow Jiang Qing was arrested, and Deng Xiaoping himself‚ÄîMao's chief rival from 1975 to 1976‚Äîwas officially rehabilitated in 1977. Although Hua Guofeng, who succeeded as Chairman of the Communist Party of China and \\"the great helmsman,\\" in 1976, tried to carry on the Maoist rhetoric and to gain an authority like that of Mao's. He also allowed the rehabilitation of many of Deng's allies, who, calling for economic reform, then revolted against him. During the 1978 working conference held in November, preparing for the plenum, Chen Yun raised the \\"six issues\\"‚ÄîBo Yibo, Tao Zhu, Wang Heshou and Peng Dehuai; the 1976 Tiananmen Incident; and Kang Sheng‚Äôs errors‚Äîto undermine the leftists. At the same conference, Deng said it was necessary to go over ideological barriers. Relevant decisions Trying to distance from the Cultural Revolution practice which put politics before the economy, the Third Plenary Session argued that extensive criticism campaigns against Lin Biao and the Gang of Four were to be abandoned in favour of a greater attention to economics. The \\"Four Modernizations\\" of industry, agriculture, national defence and science-technology were considered the Party's key tasks for the new period. Former President Liu Shaoqi's theory that under socialism, mass class struggle came to an end, and it was necessary to develop relations of production in order to follow the growth of social forces, was openly endorsed, while Mao's theory of continued revolution under socialism was abandoned. Changes in economic management were called for. The new slogan was to \\"make China a modern, powerful socialist country before the end of this century\\". Although it did not take any open resolution against Mao, the Plenary Session attacked his leadership, implying that it did not guarantee full democracy or collective leadership. Particularly, it criticized the use of issuing Mao's \\"instructions\\", as it was said that \\"No personal view by a Party member in a position of responsibility, including leading comrades of the Central Committee, is to be called an 'instruction.'\\" It also put an end to the extensive personality cult towards Mao and Hua, even going as far as to avoid using the titles \\"Chairman Mao\\" and \\"Chairman Hua\\". Putting forward the \\"Seeking truth from facts\\" principle, the plenum started the repudiation of the Cultural Revolution: the \\"Counterattack the Right-Deviationist Reversal- of-Verdicts Trend\\" campaign aimed against Deng was openly rejected, and Peng Dehuai, Tao Zhu, Bo Yibo and Yang Shangkun were rehabilitated. The Cultural Revolution was openly rejected only in 1981 at the Sixth Plenary Session. The weakness of both the National People's Congress and the Supreme People's Court during this period were criticized as well. Leadership changes Despite its great relevance in advancing Deng Xiaoping's ideas and leadership, during the Third Plenary Session no critical or substantial reshuffle occurred, as opposed to the Sixth Plenary Session held in 1981 when Hua Guofeng was removed from his posts. Important additions were made, however. Chen Yun was appointed Politburo Standing Committee member, as well as Party Vice-Chairman and First Secretary of the newly created Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Deng Yingchao, Hu Yaobang and Wang Zhen were all made new Politburo members, and they were given important posts in the Discipline Inspection Commission. 9 new members, former Head of the PLA General Staff Huang Kecheng among them, were co-opted in the Central Committee.

She holds the Chair of Translation and Interpreting at the Department of Translation and Interpreting of the University of Granada since 2001. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Granada in 1986 and also holds degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Paris-Sorbonne University. Research Pamela Faber is best known for her works on the Functional Lexematic Model and her cognitive theory of Terminology called Frame-Based Terminology. =Functional Lexematic Model= The Functional Lexematic Model was elaborated by Leocadio Mart√≠n Mingorance and further developed by his collaborators Pamela Faber and Ricardo Mairal. It integrates Co≈üeriu's Theory of Lexematics and Dik's Functional Grammar. The two main objectives sought within this lexicological model are: # the specification of the semantic architecture of the lexicon of a language, and # the representation of knowledge based on the linguistic encoding found in dictionary entries. These objectives are mutually dependent in the sense that the former serves as the input for the latter. =Frame-Based Terminology= Frame-Based Terminology is a recent cognitive approach to Terminology developed by Pamela Faber and colleagues at the University of Granada. It was conceived within the context of the Functional Lexematic Model and Cognitive Linguistics. Frame-Based Terminology focuses on: # conceptual organization; # the multidimensional nature of terminological units; and # the extraction of semantic and syntactic information through the use of multilingual corpora. Within this context, Faber's current major project is called EcoLexicon, a terminological knowledge base on the Environment. Seminal publications * Faber, Pamela (ed.). 2012.

After leaving the Leukentals and Tyrol the river is known in Bavaria as the Tiroler Ache until it discharges into the Chiemsee lake, and its valley is known as the Achental. The parishes in the Leukental are: Jochberg, Aurach bei Kitzb√ºhel, Kitzb√ºhel, Oberndorf in Tirol, St. Johann in Tirol, Kirchdorf and K√∂ssen. The name \\"Leukental\\" might almost have been forgotten by the 20th century because, from the middle of the 19th century the name \\"Gro√üachental\\" had become common. This was mainly because it was a time when the imperial and royal monarchy wanted to survey all crown lands precisely and the state surveyors, who were mostly from Bohemia, did not often quite understand Alpine dialects and many names were entered on the maps without being researched. The Leukental from the Gampenkogel, looking north. Also visible are St. Johann in Tirol and the Kitzb√ºheler Horn. For example, the erroneous change of the name of the valley to the name of the river could be explained because the state surveyor may have asked the name of the river and would have been told \\"that is the gro√üe Ache.\\" As a result, even today the name \\"Gro√üachental\\" appears in most of the maps. During the 20th century the incorrect belief also arose that the Leukental ran from the Inn valley near W√∂rgl via S√∂ll and Ellmau to St. Johann, so that the station near Bruckh√§usl (in the town of W√∂rgl) was called \\"S√∂ll-Leukental\\" until a few years ago. In 1875, when the station was built, it was thought that you could get off at this station and continue your journey to S√∂ll and then via Ellmau and Going enter the Leukental. Over the decades the error was perpetuated that the Leukental ran from W√∂rgl via S√∂ll, Scheffau, Ellmau and Going to St. Johann. The local Kitz√ºhel historian, Peter Brandst√§tter, who died in November 2008, gave the Leukental its name back by raising the awareness of the issue with the public authorities through letters and publications. He even managed to persuade the Austrian Federal Railways to change the name of the station from \\"S√∂ll-Leukental\\" to \\"Bruckh√§usl\\".

The FIGLA gene is a germ cell-specific transcription factor preferentially expressed in oocytes that can be found on human chromosome 2p13.3.  Function  This gene encodes a protein that functions in postnatal oocyte-specific gene expression. The protein is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates multiple oocyte-specific genes, including genes involved in folliculogenesis, oocyte differentiation, and those that encode the zona pellucida. FIGLA is related to the zona pellucida genes ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3.  Clinical significance  Mutation in the FIGLA gene are associated with premature ovarian failure. Premature ovarian failure is a genetic disorder that leads to hypergonadotropic ovarian failure and infertility. It is believed that premature ovarian failure in humans is caused by FIGLA haploninsuffciency, which disrupts the formation of the primordial follicles. This was observed in FIGLA mice knockouts which had diminished follicular endowment and accelerated oocyte loss throughout their reproductive life span. Women with mutations in their FIGLA were shown to have a form of premature ovarian failure. As well as the failure to form primordial follicles, knockout mice also lacked zona pellucida genes Zp1, Zp2, and ZP3 expression.

The official symbol (NOBOX) and the official full name (NOBOX oogenesis homeobox) are maintained by the HGNC. The NOBOX gene is conserved in chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey, cow, mouse, and rat. There are 175 organisms that have orthologs with human gene NOBOX. It is capable of regulating other genes that are important in the development of follicles. Follicles do not develop and oocytes decrease in its absence which lead to infertility.  Discovery  NOBOX is an in silico subtraction discovery when Suzumori et al. searched for novel genes involved in early mammalian folliculogenesis in 2002. It is one of the several genes that appeared in the search in expressed sequence tag (EST) databases of mouse. It was then cloned and characterised for its genomic structure.  Gene location  The human NOBOX is located in chromosome 7q35 while the mouse NOBOX is in proximal chromosome 6.  Protein structure  The human NOBOX is a 14 kb protein and encoded by 8 exons. It has a proline rich C terminus and contains putative SH3 and WW domains. This C terminus is believed to be critical in its transcriptional activities when bound to oocyte-specific genes. NOBOX belongs to the family of proteins that contains homeodomain. Homeodomain is a stretch of 32 specific amino acids in primates downstream the NOBOX Arg303 residue and is very well-conserved among the species. It contains an asparagine residue at position 51 which is important for its interactions with DNA base pairs.  Function  NOBOX is a homeobox gene that is preferentially expressed in oocytes. In mice, it is essential for folliculogenesis and regulation of oocyte-specific genes. Regulation of these oocyte-specific genes is thru direct binding of NOBOX to its promoter regions via the specific consensus sequences, the NOBOX DNA binding elements (NBEs). There are three NBEs that have been identified: 5'-TAATTG-3', 5'-TAGTTG-3', and 5'-TAATTA-3'. Knockout study of NOBOX against wild-type ovaries in newborn female mice revealed that 74% (28/38 genes) were downregulated more than 5-fold and 15% (5/33 genes) were upregulated more than 5-fold. However, microRNA population is not affected by NOBOX in newborn ovaries. NOBOX also plays an important role in the suppression of male-determining genes such as Dmrt1. Its deficiency can cause rapid loss of postnatal oocytes and during its absence in female mice, follicles are replaced by fibrous tissue. Recently, a new role of NOBOX in controlling the G2/M arrest was discovered.  Mutations and clinical significance  A mutation in the NOBOX gene is associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). It is a condition which ovaries loss its normal function before the age of 40. It is a heritable disease in up to 30% of patients which is characterised by secondary infertility, amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the serum (FSH>40IU/liter). It affects ‚âà1% of women below 40 years old. A study conducted on 96 white women with POF revealed one case of heterozygous mutation in the NOBOX homeodomain, p.Arg355His, in one patient. This mutation was absent in the control population and significantly disrupts the binding of NOBOX to the NBE. Arg355 is critical to DNA binding and is conserved in the homeodomain of the NOBOX from zebrafish to humans. Moreover, its significant negative effect suggests that NOBOX homeodomain may function as a dimer but its rare occurrence suggests a low contribution to POF. Further investigations on POF were conducted on Caucasian, African, Chinese, and Japanese women diagnosed with POF. Several NOBOX loss-of-function mutations were observed in Caucasian and African women accounting to 6.2%, 5.6% and 6.4%. These results suggest that NOBOX gene is a strong autosomal candidate for POF and its genetic mechanism involves haploinsufficiency. However, these mutations were not found in Chinese and Japanese women making it a less common explanation for POF in the region. The POF syndrome is a highly heterogenous clinical disorder but a recent study showed the first homozygous mutation associated with NOBOX loss- of-function. One patient out of 96 population diagnosed with POF in China was found with one novel homozygous truncating variant in the NOBOX gene. This truncated variant caused a defective transcriptional activation of GDF9, a well-known target of NOBOX, which led to the lost ability of NOBOX to induce G2/M arrest. This finding disagrees that mutation is a less common explanation for POF in Asian population. Understanding the mutations in NOBOX homeodomain is important to researchers and clinicians to develop diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for POF such as genetic control of mammalian reproductive life-span, regulation of fertility, and generation of mature eggs in the lab.

Eftim I had strong influences from Turkish nationalist ideology. He ruled as Patriarch from 1923 until 1962, when he resigned due to ill health. Keeping the title of honorary patriarch, he ordained his younger son as patriarch assuming the name Papa Eftim II. Earlier years Karahisarithis was born in Maden qadaa (today Akdaƒümadeni) of Bozok sanjak in 1884. He worked in a factory. He was ordained as a priest in 1915 and was given the name Eftim (). In the house of his neighbor √áerkes Ethem, he met Mustafa Kemal and became a supporter of his ideas. He took part on 23 April 1920 in the opening of the Turkish Parliament as representative of the Turkish Orthodox Community of All Anatolia (Umum Anadolu T√ºrk Ortodokslarƒ± Cemaatleri). In 1922 the Autocephalous Orthodox Patriarchate of Anatolia was founded in Kayseri by Father Pavlos Karahisarithis a supporter of the General Congregation of the Anatolian Turkish Orthodox. in opposition to Patriarch Meletius IV. During the meeting in a convent in Kayseri, decision was taken to establish a Turkish Christian church independent of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Karahisarithis moved to Istanbul in 1923, and took the name Pope Eftim I. The same year, his supporters, with his tacit support assaulted Patriarch Meletius IV on 1 June 1923.The Ecumenical Patriarchate Under the Turkish Republic: The First Ten Years, by Harry J. Psomiades] On 2 October 1923 Papa Eftim besieged the Holy Synod and appointed his own Synod. When Eftim invaded the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate he proclaimed himself \\"the general representative of all the Orthodox communities\\" (). With a new Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory VII elected on 6 December 1923 after the abdication of Meletius IV, there was another occupation by Papa Eftim I and his followers, when he besieged the Patriarchate for the second time. This time around, they were evicted by the Turkish police. Establishment of the Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate In 1924, Karahisarithis started to conduct the liturgy in Turkish, and quickly won support from the new Turkish Republic formed after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.Leader of Turkish Nationalist Church Dies He claimed that the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople was ethnically-centered and favored the Greek population. Being excommunicated for claiming to be a bishop while still having a wife (married bishops are not allowed in Orthodoxy) Karahisarithis, who later changed his name into Zeki Erenerol, called a Turkish ecclesial congress, which elected him Patriarch in 1924. On 6 June 1924, in a conference in the Church of the Virgin Mary (Meryem Ana) in Galata, it was decided to transfer the headquarters of the Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate from Kayseri to Istanbul. In the same session it was also decided that the Church of Virgin Mary would become the Center of the new Patriarchate of the Turkish Orthodox Church. Karahisarithis and his family members were exempted from the population exchange as per a decision of the Turkish government, although there was not the exemption for either Karahisarithis' followers or the wider Karamanlides communities of Turkish speaking Christian that was hoped for. Most of the ethnic Turkish speaking Orthodox population remained affiliated with the Greek Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The excommunication of Papa Eftim was revoked and he is consecrated as a bishop by metropolitan bishops Amorsios of Kayseri, Kirilios of Erdek and Agatangelos of Adalar on 18 March 1926. After the death of Mustafa Kemal, Papa Eftim lost some of his prestige in the eyes of the Turkish state. In 1953 he organized a demonstration march against the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I and he continued to make statements against the Greek Patriarchate. Resignation and death He resigned in 1962 due to ill health and his elder son Turgut Erenerol (formerly Yiorghos Karahisarithis) became Papa Eftim II, and held this post until his death in 1991. The office was then passed to his younger son Sel√ßuk Erenerol, who took the title Papa Eftim III until 2002. The current holder of the title is Pa≈üa √úmit Erenerol, Papa Eftim I's grandson (son of Sel√ßuk Erenerol, Papa Eftim III) who has held the title Papa Eftim IV since 2002. He died on 14 March 1968 and was refused a burial in the Greek Orthodox cemetery of Sisli due to his excommunication, and the Turkish government had to intervene to secure his burial.

History Long Hill was originally and entirely settled as a part of Stratford, Connecticut, settled in 1639. By the mid-1650s, the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation began to petition the Court of the Colony of Connecticut for compensation for lost territory taken by the encroaching English settlement at Stratford. This legal action led the court to set the town boundary on May 15, 1656 to include all of the territory inland from Long Island Sound between the Housatonic River and the Fairfield town line, including all of Long Hill.Colonial Records of Connecticut Vol. 1 p. 281 The English continued to purchase territory from the Native Americans entering the deeds of transfer into the land records.

At that time, the road from Bridgeport to Trumbull was already a toll road known as the Bridgeport and Newtown Turnpike, connecting its namesake towns and had been in operation since 1801. In 1922, the former Monroe and Zoar Bridge Turnpike (more commonly known as simply the Monroe Turnpike) became part of the Connecticut state highway system. It was given the designation State Highway 308 and ran from modern Route 25 to modern Route 34. The continuation into Bridgeport, which would later become Route 25, was at the time part of State Highway 122.

Wilson has caused debate amongst some in the blues/guitar community due to his comments about the state of modern blues; especially what he calls \\"karaoke blues\\" artists. In an interview with Alternative Magazine Online and a BBC Radio interview, Wilson adopted an aggressive stance against \\"karaoke blues\\" artists, considering them nothing more than merchants of parody and pastiche. Sound and style His main guitar influences stylistically would seem to be Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Dave Gilmour, Albert King and Duane Allman,while his voice takes a more modern laid-back approach eschewing the typical blues sound. His compositions tend to vary from the very simplistic to near avant- garde while maintaining a modern feel with the bass lines tending to be crucial to the minimalist approach. Lyrically, he has mentioned in frequent interviews, the influence of the poet Charles Bukowski. Recordings Follow Your First Mind was released in February 2010 via 19 Miles High and distributed through Interscope Digital Distribution. The album was recorded in Manhattan and in Wilson's home town of Newark-on-Trent, England, and mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Christian Wright.

It is a wood frame building, the oldest elements of which date to the mid-18th century, before the American Revolution, making it possibly the oldest structure in the village. It has, however, been expanded and modified since then, and was almost completely rebuilt in the late 19th century. In 1976 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally it was located along the Albany Post Road, the central building in the small hamlet of Sparta, a name still used for the neighborhood later absorbed into the village of Ossining and retaining many other intact historic buildings. Much of the house's history is unclear, including whether it was ever even a tavern. Some local legends hold that Revolutionary War figures such as George Washington and John Andr√© visited. The name \\"Jug Tavern\\" was not even known to have been used for the property until the mid-20th century. A local organization dedicated to preserving the building currently owns the property. Building The tavern is located on the northwest corner of the intersection, west of Albany Post Road (U.S. Route 9) and east of the Hudson River. On the east are large modern commercial buildings and parking lots; to the west are the other residential buildings of Sparta, amid mature trees. Sparta Brook, a small tributary of the Hudson that takes its name from the settlement, is just to the east. The land slopes up slightly toward the north and northwest as a result. The six-by-two- bay building is built into that rise, with its stone foundation exposed on the east to give it the appearance of two and a half stories. The basement's east face, like the upper stories, is sided in clapboard. It is topped with a side- gabled, shingled roof from which one brick chimney rises. On the northwest corner of the second story is an addition that gives the north facade an extra bay. Along the full length of the second story is a balustrade veranda that serves as a porch for the ground floor. It is supported by five square wooden pillars that rise to the overhanging eaves. Both stories have full fenestration with two-over-two double-hung sash windows and two entrances flanking the center, with those on the second story closer together and having no intervening window. Similar windows are on the other three elevations and in the gable fields. Additional entrances are located at the south basement and the north addition. Inside all the finishes are modern. Most date to the late 19th century at the earliest. The only remnant of the original building is in the structural system, where later renovations replaced some, but not most, of the original mortise and tenon framing with balloon framing more common at the time the renovations were likely done. History Early 18th- century records suggest that the land where the tavern now stands, then owned by the Philipse family, was leased by a Charles Davids (or Davis, in some documents), a tenant farmer. The Albany Post Road was built through the area in 1723, and by 1744 a bridge crossed the brook. The area was a natural crossroads, and Davids built a farmhouse from which at least the foundation and framing survive between 1758 and 1760. Incomplete later records suggest that his sons inherited various portions of the leasehold, though it is not known which. By the 1780s, the latest period suggested for the house's construction,Village of Ossining; , April 2010; p. 11; retrieved August 6, 2011 a road ran down to the river from the site and the future hamlet of Sparta was coming into being. In 1784 the Philipse land was confiscated by the state as a consequence of Frederick Philipse's support for the British during the recent Revolutionary War. The following year it was offered for sale, and Peter Davids bought the that comprise not only the tavern site but present- day Sparta. Maps from this time show a building, but not at the exact site.McCormick, 4. Four years later, Davids took out a mortgage covering 70 of those acres () to cover debts he had owed a New York City man since 1772. In 1794 he defaulted, and signed it over to James Drowley, who laid out a plan for Sparta but died in 1795. A survey map from that year of the plan is the first known to show a building at the current site. Davids died that year also, and his widow may have lived there at the time.McCormick, 5. By 1814 the house had become the property of Nathaniel and Annis Garrison. That year they transferred it to a Samuel and Tallman Garrison, possibly Nathaniel's brothers. In turn, Tallman Garrison's 1817 will bequeathed his half of the property to his brother William. Nathaniel and Annis apparently continued living there.McCormick, 6. Sparta changed soon after when the Post Road was rerouted away from the house to the current alignment of Route 9. This benefited Sing Sing (as Ossining was then known) to the north as a local port for river shipping, since its Main Street was still a convenient route to its docks, which also charged a lower fee. Sparta began to decline as a commercial center, to the point that when then Hudson River Railroad was built two decades later, no station was built to serve it. Nathaniel Garrison died in 1843. His wife at some point regained the property, since records show that she paid the property taxes on it during the 1860s, possibly with proceeds from a very small shop local lore says she ran in the house and boarders they took in.McCormick, 6. At some time during the Garrisons' ownership of the house, its size was doubled and the veranda added. Sparta further changed two years after Nathaniel Garrison's death, when, in 1845, it became part of the Town of Ossining, newly created from the Town of Mount Pleasant. The likelihood that Nathaniel and Annis Garrison regained ownership sometime during the early 19th century also finds support in their grandsons' sale of the house to Michael Geisler in 1882. He spent much of the next year rebuilding it almost as it was. A contemporary painting, presumed to show the house as it was before this work, depicts it almost as it is now save for having two chimneys and showing signs of neglect, with gaps in its eaves showing its rafters. This might have led Geisler to restore the house, but that is not known for sure. It is also possible that it was damaged by fire, as a contemporary newspaper account reports that Geisler's home in Sparta was burned. It is not clear whether the article is referring to the tavern itself though since Geisler owned more than one property in the hamlet, and an account of the tavern's demolition in the same newspaper a week later makes no mention of a fire.In the late 1970s, two architectural specialists who inspected the framing and fabric of the building found no evidence of fire; however, they were also not aware that one had supposedly occurred. It also reports that much of the original timber framing was in good condition, so it may likely have been reused either in the rebuilt house or the new house Geisler was building nearby.McCormick, 7‚Äì8. In 1901 the village of Sing Sing formally changed its name to Ossining, in order to distinguish itself from Sing Sing Prison. Five years later, Sparta itself voted to be annexed by the prosperous village, which they had increasingly come to feel part of. It was an increasingly declining part, with high crime and deteriorating buildings. That ended in 1919 when Frank A. Vanderlip, president of National City Bank, and his wife, residents of Scarborough to the south, began redeveloping the hamlet. They bought many of the old houses and restored them into middle-class housing. The Jug Tavern, already renovated by the Geislers, was not among Vanderlip's restorations. However, it may have figured in Vanderlip's efforts, as many of the houses were being renovated in the Colonial Revival mode, and it was the only building in Sparta that actually dated to that period. The Vanderlip efforts, which continued past his death until the last restored house was sold in the 1970s, led to much local newspaper coverage and an interest in the history of the area.McCormick, 8‚Äì9. It is during that period that much of the lore about the Tavern‚Äîthat various Revolutionary figures such as George Washington or John Andr√© had stopped in for a drink, or that British prisoners of war were held in the cellar‚Äîmay have surfaced and become accepted as, or confused with, fact.McCormick, 2. Geisler's descendants owned and lived in the house until 1974, when it was sold to the town. The village designated Sparta a local historic district the following year. Restoration efforts began, and it was listed on the Register in 1976. In 1986, the property was turned over to its present owner, Jug Tavern of Sparta Inc., a non-profit organization that preserves it. Restoration was completed in 1991. Name and use There is uncertainty over whether the house was ever used as a tavern, and if it was, whether it was called the Jug Tavern. No clear record of a liquor license being granted to the property exists. In 1795, a man named William Hall was granted a license to operate a tavern in Sparta, the first record of that name being used for the community, but the tavern's location is not specified. Some local lore holds that liquor was served illegally, without charge, to those who could be trusted to keep that knowledge to themselves, and hence no license would have been sought, much less recorded. That belief also holds that liquor sales were illegal when made by the jug rather than the glass, hence the name. \\"Jug Tavern\\" does not appear in any document related to the building until 1947, and reportedly the Geisler descendants who lived there as it began to catch on were offended by it. Almost 30 years later, Frank Vanderlip's son told the authors of a walking tour guidebook that he had never heard the name in his lifetime of developing the area. To him it had always been known as the \\"Grapevine Inn\\", due to the decorations around the front door. An 1895 photograph appears to show them.McCormick, 2‚Äì3.

It was built in 1907 in the Beaux-Arts style, one of two in the village to use it.The other Beaux- Arts school building in Ossining is [ ]. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It was built as a high school, in response to the village's rapid growth following industrialization in the early 20th century, from a design by Wilson Potter of New York City, an architect who specialized in schools. It includes what were at the time some of the most progressive and advanced features of school buildings. Its early (for a school) use of the Beaux-Arts style and placement on a rise in the land give it a monumental quality despite its relatively small size. It is no longer used as a school, and has been turned over to the village for reuse. For a time it housed a museum established by the local historical society. In 1973 it was closed by the school district as part of desegregation efforts. Since a 2009 renovation it has been home to the House of Refuge Apostolic Faith Church. It remains largely as it was originally built, with few alterations. Building The school building is located on a one-acre (4,000 m2) lot the north side of Croton, a quarter-mile (500 m) northeast of where it forks off from Highland Avenue (U.S. Route 9) in downtown Ossining. It is just west of Todd Place, and the intersection where Dale Avenue (New York State Route 134) forks off to the northeast. Across the street are some commercial buildings and a parking lot; to the south there is a high-rise apartment complex. The neighborhood is otherwise residential, composed of two-story wooden frame houses built later in the 20th century. See also: The land under the school rises slightly, reflecting the gorge of Sing Sing Kill, a tributary of the Hudson River, just to its northwest. A circular walkway connects the building to Croton Avenue. There is a flagpole in the center. Both are considered contributing resources to the National Register listing. =Exterior= The building itself is a T-shaped two-story load-bearing brick structure on a raised basement topped by a partly hipped roof pierced by three brick ventilation stacks and one brick chimney, all near the corners. Its facades are trimmed with terra cotta. The middle of the east (front) face projects slightly. A one-story auditorium wing projects from the west. The basement's brick is laid in rusticated bands. In the middle is the recessed main entrance, with double wooden doors in a classically detailed segmental-arched surround and narrow one-over-one double- hung sash windows on either side. It has four bays set with double three-over- three double-hung sash elsewhere on the facade. On the second and third stories of the projecting middle section, the three bays are set with triple three-over-three double-hung sash. Paired pilasters running up both stories separate them vertically; between the two stories are recessed terra-cotta spandrels inscribed with \\"SCIENCE\\", \\"LANGUAGE\\" and \\"HISTORY.\\" At the top is a wide frieze, then a wider terra cotta entablature with \\"WASHINGTON SCHOOL\\" inscribed in a central tablet. Outside the central section, the only decoration is rectangular molded brick tablets on the third story. The two side facades have a largely similar treatment. The rustication and entablature along the basement are continued. Their entrances have a similar surround, but are topped with a recessed two-story segmental arch with windows that light the staircase behind them. On either side are three two-over-two double-hung sash at the basement level and groups of five two-over-two double-hung sash on the second and third stories. The four-by-four-bay auditorium wing also sits on a raised basement. It lacks terra cotta but is otherwise similar in materials and decorative treatment to the main block. The auditorium section has large tripartite windows with transoms, giving way to six-over-six double- hung sash backstage. In one window bay on each side are exit doors, with steel platforms and stairs. Below, on the basement, are paired two-over-two double- hung sash. The wing has a flat roof. A cornice, modillioned above the central main facade, marks the roofline. Above it is a parapet wall. The roof is surfaced in slate sections broken by banks of skylights. In the center it is flat, with a larger skylight superstructure. =Interior= At all the main entrances a vestibule leads to steps up to the second story. The building's interior floor plan, with of space, remains unaltered. Two central corridors on either side cross the building, with the east-west one providing access to the stairs at either end. The boiler room is located at the western corner of the basement. The second story has a library and office suite in the southeast corner and large classrooms in the others. The auditorium begins within the main block and extends into the west wing. Above it the third story has smaller classrooms. The skylights on the attic level illuminate laboratory rooms. In the center is an open rectangular room with a coffered skylight. Many of the original finishes remain. The corridors are floored in hardwood, although they have been replaced by plywood and carpeting in the classrooms. The plaster walls and ceilings, ceramic-tile wainscoting and woodworking are all original. Some modern features, like fluorescent lights and wireglass doors to the stairwells, have been added. The auditorium has its original fold-down wooden chairs and ceiling skylight with a stained glass emblem in the center depicting a ship with sails and the legend \\"Embark on a voyage of knowledge.\\" History Originally known as Sing Sing, Ossining first prospered in the 18th and early 19th centuries as one of many farm communities shipping produce to New York City via sloops on the Hudson River, benefiting from the village's location at a crossroads with a turnpike connecting it to farms further inland, corresponding to the current intersection of Croton and Highland avenues. The construction of one of New York's first prisons near the port in the 1820s spurred some additional development, and when the Hudson River Railroad was built in the middle of the century industrialization soon followed. By the beginning of the 20th century, when Ossining changed to its current name to distance itself from the prison, its population had multiplied considerably from a century before. The village's older system of small wooden schoolhouses was no longer adequate to educate its children to the level society desired, and Washington was commissioned as its first modern school. Architect Wilson Potter, of New York City, specialized in school buildings. He included a number of modern features that had already become standard on other institutional buildings of the era, such as large windows to let in natural light, partially enclosed steel stairways to provide better fire safety, and central heating. Potter used the Beaux-Arts style that had become popular over the preceding decades, particularly for public buildings. Only one other building in the village, the Bank for Savings, a contributing property to the Downtown Ossining Historic District built the year after the school, would use it. The school is a particular strong example of the style, with its axial symmetry, advancing and retreating wall planes and classical detailing. Despite the building's relatively small size, it achieves the monumental presence characteristic of Beaux-Arts buildings through an exaggerated sense of its height conveyed the combination of its siting on a low rise and its hipped roof and chimneys. The new school served the community and the school district for a quarter-century before continuing growth fueled by suburbanization exceeded its capacity. In 1929 the district built the current Ossining High School downtown, on Highland Avenue.Village of Ossining; , April 2010; p. 238; retrieved January 11, 2013. It was converted to an elementary school.Significant Sites and Structures, 268‚Äì269. The Ossining Historical Society, founded two years later, would be housed in the school for over three decades. Ossining continued to grow, adding another four elementary schools over the next several decades. As the school district's reach extended beyond the town and village of Ossining to neighboring New Castle, racial disparities became evident. Since most of the district's minority population lived in Ossining, their children were concentrated at Washington. In 1968 a state commission identified Ossining as one of the 54 most segregated districts in the state. Since the five elementary schools fed into a single middle and high school, racial tensions sometimes flared into riots that spilled off school grounds into the village's downtown business district. To remedy that, the school board voted to close Washington and implement busing to even the racial balance at the other schools. The historical society moved to the Richard Austin House, further east along Croton, in 1968. Washington, already showing signs of physical decline, was closed in 1973. The district continued to use it for offices for another eight years, after which it was rented out to private parties. In 2006 Joan Whittaker, pastor of the growing House of Refuge Apostolic Faith Church, which had worshipped at several other locations around Ossining, saw the building as a likely future location. She persisted despite being told it was not for sale, and eventually purchased it. After extensive renovations, it opened for services in 2009.

The studio project has been categorized as part of subgenre known as spacesynth and has been generally considered as a major influence for the subgenre and has remained popular around Europe in the mid-1980s. All of Laserdance's tracks are known to feature basic analog synthesizers, drum machines and vocoders. The name of the studio project comes from the first single with the same name published in 1984. Numerous hit singles from Laserdance include Goody's Return, Humanoid Invasion, Power Run, Fear and Shotgun (Into The Night). Composer Michiel van der Kuy and producer Erik van Vliet are known to be key members of the studio project, while other members such as Ruud van Es, Rob van Eijk and Julius Wijnmalen, the composer of the recent studio album Strikes Back from 2000, have been involved as well. The very first single of Laserdance has been published in 1984 and the first album Future Generation was released in 1987 with successful sales for the studio project and generated a lot of interest towards the spacesynth genre. History Producer Erik van Vliet started studio project under the title \\"Laser Dance\\" in 1984 by releasing the first single with the same name on Break Records label and later on Hotsound Productions. Erik van Vliet and Fonny de Wulf (the producer of Rofo) produced the single, that is based upon the song with the same name by Sponooch from 1979. Michiel van der Kuy himself joined the studio project and became the composer of the project by composing the second single Goody's Return in 1984. The first Laserdance album titled Future Generation was released by Hotsound Records in 1987 and was considered big success with approximately 150 000 copies being sold. Between 1987 and 1995, Laserdance was producing new studio album every year with numerous singles and few compilation albums being released in-between. Notably, the fifth studio album Ambiente from 1991 contains only an ambient tracks, while the seventh album Hypermagic from 1993 is the only Laserdance album to being released separately on Dolby Surround. The declining era of italo disco in early 1990s was affecting on Laserdance in terms of sales as the ninth studio album The Guardian of Forever in 1996 mixes the spacesynth with more house and trance tracks, one of the latter ones being a cover of Humate's Love Stimulation, accompanied by a clarifying statement that it was not composed by van der Kuy on the CD casing. This tonal shift received cold feedback from fans and the studio project was stopped for few years. However, Erik van Vliet was planning to bring Laserdance back, while Michiel van der Kuy was working as producer of Alice Deejay and his own music project Rygar. Erik hired Julius Wijnmalen to be composer of the recent studio album called Strikes Back that was released on ZYX Music label in 2000. After the release of Strikes Back, anything about Laserdance's state hadn't been known or confirmed, although Michiel van der Kuy stated in December 2010 interview to have no plans for continuing on Laserdance while working with his new music project called Rygar. At the same time, Erik van Vliet mentioned on Discogs that he was still looking for a \\"new Michiel van der Kuy\\" to continue Laserdance with after Wijnmalen had demanded too much money from him for another album. Eventually in April 2016, Erik van Vliet and Michiel van der Kuy confirmed in social media that a new record is soon to be released.

It is also the most important railway junction in Umbria. Opened in 1866, it forms part of the Ancona‚ÄìOrte railway, and is the southeastern terminus of the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway, which links Florence with Rome. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Regional train services on the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub- contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. Location Foligno railway station is situated at Piazzale Unit√† d'Italia, at the eastern end of the city centre. History The station was opened on 4 January 1866, upon the inauguration of the Orte‚ÄìFoligno section of the Rome‚ÄìAncona railway. A few months later, on 29 April 1866, that line was extended from Foligno to Falconara Marittima. Then, on 21 July 1866, Foligno became a junction station, when the Foligno‚ÄìCollestrada section of the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway was opened. The station has since been expanded and rebuilt several times because of destruction caused by earthquakes and bombing raids. The current passenger building was built as a project of Paolo Perilli, to replace the building destroyed during World War II. It was opened in 1949. Features The passenger building is a large multi level structure with many passenger services, including a shipping department, railway police station, bar, restaurant, newsagent, tobacconist, ATMs, car and bicycle rental, infirmary and a Roman Catholic chapel. The station has six tracks reserved for passengers and equipped with platforms outfitted with canopies. The platforms are numbered from 1 to 5, and 1 north, which is a bay platform constructed originally to serve the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola line. The platforms are also linked with each other by two passenger lifts and subways leading to Piazzale Unit√† d'Italia and its interchange facilities. Another six tracks are used as a goods yard or for carriage storage. In this part of the station yard are also a locomotive shed, an old water column and an electrical substation. Train services The station has about 2.3 million passenger movements each year. Approximately 100 trains call at the station daily (about 25 train pairs on each line). These trains range from regional services to InterCity and Eurostar trains. Regional services on the Foligno‚ÄìTerontola railway are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. All other train services are operated by Trenitalia itself. Interchange The station is connected with Foligno's urban transport system by bus and shuttle bus services. It also has parking spaces for about 1,200 vehicles.

Solar access is calculated using a sun path diagram. Sun is the source of our vision and energy. Its movements inform our perception of time and space. Access to sun is essential to energy conservation and to the quality of our lives. Solar access is differentiated from solar rights or solar easement, which is specifically meant for direct sunlight for solar energy systems, whereas solar access is a right to sunlight upon certain building fa√ßades regardless of the presence of active or passive solar energy systems.  History  A historical example of Solar access is Ancient Lights, a doctrine based on English law that refers to a negative easement that prevents the owner or occupier of an adjoining structure from building or placing on his own land anything that has the effect of obstructing the light of the dominant tenement. In common law, a person's window on his property receiving flow of light that passed through it for so long a time as to constitute immemorial usage in law, the flow of light became an ‚Äúancient light‚Äù that the law protected from disturbance. The Prescription Act 1832 created a statutory prescription for light. It provided that:  Solar access in urban planning  The goal of using solar access in urban planning is to create well-designed urban districts that assure exposure of buildings' elevations and public spaces to the sun during a desired period of the year. Urban areas that do not consider solar access may cause discomfort inside buildings and on the street, as well as increase energy consumption for lighting and heating, due to the lack of passive solar energy. On the other hand, as a result, buildings without solar access may also have less solar heat gain and thus reduced cooling load. = Solar envelope = The solar envelope is a space-time construct. Its spatial limits are defined by the characteristics of land size, shape, orientation, topography, latitude, and its surroundings. Its time limits are defined by the hours of the day, season of the year, and the time interval. In 1976, solar envelope was first proposed by Ralph L. Knowles as a zoning device. It guarantees solar access to properties by regulating construction limits derived from the sun‚Äôs relative motion. Buildings within the solar envelope would not shadow adjacent properties during a predefined period of time, usually critical energy-receiving periods during the year. The solar envelope presents the maximum heights of buildings that do not violate the solar access of any existing buildings during a given period of the year. The solar envelope is a way to assure urban solar access for both energy and life quality. The concept of solar envelope was first developed in 1969. It was developed as a framework for architecture and urban design at the University of Southern California. The goal of that study was to improve the quality of the urban environment by designing buildings that pay attentions to orientations. In 1976, a research was carried out by Ralph L. Knowles to further develop the concept of solar envelope as a public zoning policy. Assisted by planning department of the city of Los Angeles, the results of this research were first published in an article called Solar Energy, Building, and the Law. In 1977, to tests the solar envelope concept as a zoning mechanism, Richard D. Berry joined with Knowles to direct undergraduate architecture students in designing buildings within solar envelopes based on a presumption of solar zoning on real urban sites in Los Angeles.  Precedents  The first implementation of the idea of solar access was in the United States around 10th century. In Acoma, 50 miles west of modern Albuquerque, New Mexico, its rows of house are stepped down to the south. Those houses were built for the high-desert climate. The low angle sun in the winter is welcomed and the high angle summer sun is not wanted. During the winter time, houses do not shadow one another. It is this critical relationship of building-height to shadow-area that gave rise to the solar- envelope concept.  Legal background  The most commonly cited law outside the United States is the English Doctrine of Ancient Lights, but there were problems with its application in modern society. Roughly, the doctrine states that if in 20 years no one has overshadowed your property, they cannot now do so. However, this doctrine has been repeatedly disavowed in U.S. courts. Prior appropriation principle was used for the United States water law, which was developed during the west settlement. Similar to the Ancient Lights doctrine, prior appropriation water rights states that the first person to take water for \\"beneficial use,\\" such as agricultural or household use, has the right to continue use the same amount of water for the same purpose. Simply put, ‚ÄúHe who gets there first, gets the most‚Äù. Zoning regulations provide a foundation for regulating solar rights. Since the type of construction is unlikely to change within a zoning district, local administrations do not have to deal with the complexity of different building types when assuring solar rights to each property.  Space-time construct  The solar envelope is a space-time construct. In terms of space, a solar envelope assures solar access to the surrounding properties. Solar envelope defines shadow fences that avoid unacceptable shadow beyond the property lines by limiting the size the building on-site. Solar envelope also offers the greatest potential volume within time constraints, also known as cut-off times. Within the time constraint, for example 9am to 5pm in the winter and 7am to 7pm in the summer, the solar envelope defines the biggest volume that a construction can have to avoid casting shadows off-site. As the periods of assured solar access increases, the solar envelope's size would decrease. During winter time, due to lower angle sun, the increase of the cut-off time has greater impact to the size of the solar envelope than in the summer time when the sun angle is high.  Solar envelope generation  A solar envelope can be generated for any land parcel during any time interval using the following methods: the heliodon (sun-simulating machine), descriptive geometry, or computers software (e.g Autodesk Revit and DIVA for Grasshopper in Rhino). Given a site, and its location and orientation, a heliodon can be used to determine the Solar azimuth angle and altitude angle for any given time. Four critical time points are typically used to determine the solar envelope: morning and afternoon cut-off time during the winter and summer solstice. If the information in regards to solar positions and site geometry are known, the solar envelope can be directly calculated using trigonometry. The current computer software can be the easiest and fastest way for calculating the solar envelope using the same principle that is being used in the heliodon method.  Impact on building design  When required to design within the solar envelope, designers naturally prefer certain architectural features. Commercial buildings designed within the solar envelope tend to be short and flat than thin and tall. Terraces and courtyards are often favored to make the best use of the envelope‚Äôs volume. The practical approach to apply solar envelope to the zoning regulation was to require developers or property owners to provide the solar envelope description with the normal land survey prior to the preparation of construction drawings and the filing for building permits. Compliance would be checked by city building departments. = The influence of street orientation = The importance of street orientation for solar access Ildefons Cerd√†'s Eixample of Barcelona is credited as being a good example of an orthogonal town-plan street orientation for increased solar access. By rotating the grid to a 45 degree angle from southernly orientation, the morning and afternoon sunlight is able to penetrate into the urban fabric more than in a north-south oriented grid. The so-called \\"Spanish grid\\" was also applied in Los Angeles, though in newer parts of the city a north-south grid was used. The Spanish grid is advantageous regarding street qualities of light and heat. During the winter, every street on the Spanish grid receives direct light and heat sometime between 9AM and 3PM, the six hours of greatest insolation. It is true that at midday, all streets have shadows; but because of their diagonal orientation, more sunlight enters than if they ran due east-west. In summer, the advantage of the Spanish grid is that shadows are cast into every street all day long, creating a more comfortable environment in hot climates, with the exception of a short period during mid- morning and mid-afternoon when the sun passes quickly over first one diagonal street and then the other.  Solar access laws  = The Netherlands = In the Dutch building codes, the principal fa√ßade of houses must receive 3 hours of direct sunlight between the dates of 21 March and 21 September, the vernal point and autumnal points of the equinox. when the solar elevation is about 38¬∞. For East and West oriented houses, the solar elevation is lowered to 32¬∞, which reflects the sun‚Äôs path across the sky.MVRDV. FARMAX: Excursions on Density. 010 Publishers. Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2006. . page 206. = United States = Legal experts have suggested that American water law, especially the doctrine of prior appropriation, may offer a more useful precedent for sun rights. They point out that both sunlight and water are used rather than captured and sold; both may be consumed, but both are renewable. In addition, there is an equivalence between upstream and downstream in water law and the geometry of solar shadowing. But, like the Doctrine of Ancient Lights, there are problems with the application of water law. At the moment, Solar access laws are usually ‚Äúvoluntary,‚Äù meaning that a solar owner cannot require that their neighbor agree to a solar easement.Kettles, Colleen McCann. A Comprehensive Review of Solar Access Law in the United States. Solar America Board for Codes and Standards. 2008.  State of Massachusetts  State law provides a solar access permit, and also provides for solar access in zoning ordinances, including the regulation of planting and trimming of vegetation on public property to protect solar access.  State of California  State law limits vegetation growth on neighboring properties under some circumstances.  Washington, DC  Zoning regulations in Washington DC require that \\"Any addition, including a roof structure or penthouse, shall not significantly interfere with the operation of an existing or permitted solar energy system of at least 2kW on an adjacent property...\\"DC Municipal Regulations DCMR 11-E 206.1 (c) The regulation goes on to define \\"significant interference\\" as no more than 5%, and includes the ability of neighbor/developer & solar owner to come to an agreement that allows infringement. While most solar access provisions limit vegetation growth, the DC provisions limit permitted construction of neighbors (and don't address vegetation).

He was also a noted supporter of the cause of total abstinence from alcohol. He was born in Dublin, the fourth son of the Reverend Cecil Crampton, vicar of Headfort, County Galway, and Nicola Mary Marsh, daughter of the Rev. Jeremy Marsh, rector of Athenry, aunt of Sir Henry Marsh and great-granddaughter of Archbishop Francis Marsh. His namesake, the celebrated doctor Sir Philip Crampton, 1st Baronet, was a cousin, a fact which benefitted his career. He was educated at the University of Dublin, where he was an outstanding student, and gold medallist; later becoming a Fellow of the University (1807‚Äì16) and Regius Professor of Law in 1816. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1808. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1810. He was appointed Solicitor-General in 1830. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Saltash in February 1831, and MP for Milborne Port in July 1831. He was judge of the Court of Queen's Bench (Ireland) 1834‚Äì1859. In politics he was a Whig and a strong supporter of progressive Whig causes such as Parliamentary reform and abolition of the slave trade. Though a fine academic lawyer and a \\"pleasant and tactful\\" advocate, he was not considered much of a politician. His various proposals to reform the Irish legal system met with little support, and he clashed repeatedly with Daniel O'Connell (he was to be one of the judges at O'Connell's trial in 1844). O'Connell opposed Crampton's appointment to the Bench, calling him \\"utterly incompetent\\", lacking in integrity, and chosen only due to his friendships with senior judges. O'Connell however disliked and despised nearly all the Irish judges of his time, and his low opinion of Crampton was not generally shared: when he retired, it was said that no judge's reputation stood higher. Most contemporaries praised him as \\"a true gentleman, a true Christian, and a noted philanthropist\\". He married firstly in 1817 Sidney Mary Browne, who died in 1839, and secondly Margaret Duffy. By his second marriage he had one son, Cecil, who died young. He lived in considerable state at his home St. Valery, near Bray, County Wicklow, but was not noted for hospitality. A strict advocate of temperance, he refused to serve alcohol to his guests, and according to a much repeated story, poured the entire contents of the St. Valery wine cellar into the nearby River Dargle. He retired from the Bench in 1859 and died at St. Valery in 1862. Cecil, his only son, died four years later while still in his teens. The estate passed to another branch of the Crampton family.

Early life, education, and career Dahms graduated from Redwood Falls High School in 1965, then went on to the University of Minnesota, earning a B.S. degree in agricultural business administration. Dahms is the former owner of Riverside Motors and American Family Insurance Agency in Redwood Falls. He most recently served as a Redwood County Commissioner, and was also a board member of the Redwood County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Redwood County Agricultural Society, the Redwood Area Development Corporation, the Redwood County Economic Development Association, the Southwest Minnesota Regional Development Commission, the Minnesota Valley Rail Authority, and the Redwood-Renville Health Services Board. Minnesota Senate Dahms was first elected in 2010, succeeding retiring longtime Senator Dennis Frederickson of New Ulm. He was reelected in 2012 and 2016. In April 2015 Dahms voted against the Sunday liquor sales bill, which would have repealed the long-standing ban on Sunday liquor sales in Minnesota. Senator Dahms‚Äô opposition to breweries and distilleries has been well-documented throughout his tenure at the MN Capitol. During the Covid-19 crisis of 2020, Senator Dahms (the Chair of the Commerce Committee) was implicated by a number of his colleagues as one of the main roadblocks to a temporary bill which would have allowed Minnesota craft breweries to sell package sizes other than 750ml and 64oz directly you their patrons. This bill would have given a much-needed revenue stream to small businesses which were hurt by the economic crisis brought on by Covid-19. As of May 15, 2020, no action has been taken to make the temporary change. Many breweries will be at risk of losing yet another revenue stream because the company that produces the 750mL crowlers (a large can which can be quickly and somewhat easily sealed by a relatively small hand-operated machine) is shifting its production fully to 32oz in order to meet demands from breweries in the 49 states where vessel sizes are not so strictly limited. Without the ability to sell 12 or 16 oz cans directly, many breweries will be unable to safely sell beer directly to their consumers, leaving them without a revenue stream which they have grown to rely on (taproom sales). https://m.startribune.com/castle-danger- bids-farewell-to-growlers/561556052/ References External links *Senator Gary Dahms official Minnesota Senate website *Project Vote Smart - Senator Gary Dahms Profile *Senator Gary Dahms official campaign website 1947 births Living people University of Minnesota alumni Minnesota state senators Minnesota Republicans People from Redwood Falls, Minnesota 21st-century American politicians ","title":"Gary Dahms"},{"id":"30258436","text":"The 1991 South Kesteven District Council election for the South Kesteven District Council was held in South Kesteven in 1991.

More precisely, this set of positions can be decomposed into the union of a finite set and finitely many full arithmetic progressions. Here, an infinite arithmetic progression is full if there exist integers a and b such that the progression consists of all positive integers equal to b modulo a. This result is named after Thoralf Skolem (who proved the theorem for sequences of rational numbers), Kurt Mahler (who proved it for sequences of algebraic numbers), and Christer Lech (who proved it for sequences whose elements belong to any field of characteristic 0). Its proofs use p-adic analysis. Example Consider the sequence :0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, ... that alternates between zeros and the Fibonacci numbers. This sequence can be generated by the linear recurrence relation :F(i) = F(i-2) + F(i-4) (a modified form of the Fibonacci recurrence), starting from the base cases F(1) = F(2) = F(4) = 0 and F(3) = 1. For this sequence, F(i) = 0 if and only if i is either one or even. Thus, the positions at which the sequence is zero can be partitioned into a finite set (the singleton set {1}) and a full arithmetic progression (the positive even numbers). In this example, only one arithmetic progression was needed, but other recurrence sequences may have zeros at positions forming multiple arithmetic progressions. Related results The Skolem problem is the problem of determining whether a given recurrence sequence has a zero. There exist an algorithm to test whether there are infinitely many zeros, and if so to find the decomposition of these zeros into periodic sets guaranteed to exist by the Skolem‚ÄìMahler‚ÄìLech theorem. However, it is unknown whether there exists an algorithm to determine whether a recurrence sequence has any non-periodic zeros .

Is far from Cali to about 75 km, stand as architectural and tourist references The Making Hato Viejo declared a national monument since 1996 and the Sonso Laguna. According to historians this region was inhabited by freeloaders Indians during the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors and was founded by the Spanish Captain Diego Rengifo Salazar in the year 1622, on the banks of the river that bears his name. According to legend, at that site commanded the chief Yotoco and the name Yotat means \\"blowgun\\" because the population was near the land of blowgun. On December 5, 1777 the viceparrish was erected; in 1858 it appeared as a village and in 1864 was elevated to the category of district with the name \\"Sucre\\", which was preserved until 1868. Through Decree 455 of April 24 1908 it was annexed to the municipality of Buga, then in 1912, according to Law 23 passed to the municipality of Cali. That same year it returned to belong to Buga until, finally, it was given the autonomy and became the Municipality of Yotoco. Geography Yotoco territory is divided into two different areas: a flat, belonging to the Cauca River Valley and another mountain, on the west, which is part of the eastern slopes of the ‚ÄúCordillera Occidental‚Äù. Among the highlights orographic Altos Heart, The Garden, Guacas, La Cecilia, La Florida, Paloalto, Sugar Loaf and pulpit. Their lands are distributed in heat, hot, medium and cold floors, watered by the Cauca River and Mediacanoa rivers, stones, Volcano and Yotoco, as well as various smaller streams. LIMITS AND SOME DISTANCES It borders on the north with the municipality of Riofr√≠o (29), on the east with San Pedro (31), Buga (20) and Guacar√≠ (19), to the south with the municipality of Vijes (37), to the west with Calima-Dari√©n (10) and Restrepo (28). It is about 75 km. to Cali (9), and about 115 km. to Buenaventura (6), it is also about 12 km. to Buga. Economy The main economic activities in our municipality is agriculture and other activities like hog farming, poultry, cattle rising, and the exploitation of rock and sand, coffee production, pineapple, avocado, plantain, tomato, beans and sugar cane. Due to its location on the main artery to Calima Lake and Buenaventura's port there are many hotels and restaurants located along the route, which generates great employment. Culture Yotoco is a municipality located in the center of Valle del Cauca of whose traditional roots are of peasant culture and various celebrations of a religious type. It is normal to find festivals and celebrations in the rural area at different times of the year. This municipality is privileged by having one of the three schools of music in the country. The name of this school is ‚ÄúRey de los vientos‚Äù(King of the winds). This school is directed by Juan Pablo Parra Nore√±a, sponsored by The Municipal administration. Also there is a Cultural House ‚ÄúHerminio Salguero‚Äù which plublishes the book of ‚ÄúCuenta cuentos que yo me invento‚Äù written by the students and teachers of the educational institutions of the Municipality: Alfonso Zawadzky, Gabriela Mistral, San Juan Bosco. With the support of the Ministry of Education the book ‚ÄúCruce de Miradas‚Äù was just published which contains pictures of memorable people and places, poems and narrations of some of its inhabitants. The Municipality counts with the ‚ÄúAlejandro Arce Library‚Äù both inaugurated by the Culture Ministers of the years 2008 and 2015. It is currently in the municipality as a historic cultural flagship as part of Hato Viejo Farm which is private. The farm has colonial architecture and its monumental ceiba which is about 600 years old. They are part of the beauty of rural and urban Yotoco. Chiquique wetland is also part of the fishing tradition in the municipality also contributing the traditional Bocachico and corroncho and mojarra fish that fed our ‚Äúyotocences‚Äù traditional families. Tourism The Municipality of Yotoco, is a territory in tourist development, where thanks to the support of community organizations and institutions that base this activity with sustainable processes minimizing the negative impact that this can generate. =EcoTourism= La hacienda Hato Viejo located on the road Vijes, via Panorama, it was declared a National Monument of Colombia in 1996. Whose house dates back like the chapel 350 years ago. In the eighteenth century the estate played a very important socio-economic and cultural role in the colonial economic circuit... It took care of supplying food and various products derived from sugarcane for mines. It was also an instrument for colonization and population of the region that is now called ‚ÄúValle del Cauca‚Äù. LAGUNA DE EL SONSO O CHIRCAL It is a nature reserve since 1987 by the Agreement CVC No 17, October 1978 and regulated the use of land, water and airspace by the Agreement CVC No 16, May 1979. The lake has an area of 2045 hectares located between Guacar√≠, Buga and Yotoco municipalities, It also is the 14th largest wetland in the upper part of the Cauca system, and it is one of the most important sites at a regional level for bird watching, environmental education, sightseeing and research . Some of the species you will find there are swamp vultures, osprey and cattle heron. It is a habitat for mammals such as the common possum, common vampire and in recent years the capybara. The most common fish are the bocachico, chamburos, Caracol√≠es, swifts and chambimbes. The most common shrub species are: planta de garza, gam√≠neas and rushes. Others like the ‚Äúarchucha‚Äù and stiff brooms are used by animal species as shelter, nesting and feeding. The reserve is a natural regulation system of the Cauca River and is used as a means of subsistence through artisanal fisheries. =Recreational Tourism= Here are many sites for artisanal fisheries such as: Escondite and Picapiedra Lake on the route to Buga; Colombia Lake located on the Panorama route near to the toll on the road to Mediacanoa; Chiquique Wetlands and other sites with panoramic sightseeing such as Dopo's Stone located in Dopo Town and also the Natural Reserved Park on the road to Buenaventura.

The home stands upon a wooded tract of land overlooking Pelham Bay; the once large estate surrounding it has now diminished to 3.7 acres. Influenced by the Romantic Movement in England, Bolton chose to design the house in the Romantic idiom. The building was designed to appear as if it had been constructed over a period of time; stone was used in one section and brick in another, to give the impression of various additions. Bolton Priory serves as a good reflection of both the lifestyle and tastes of a cultivated, influential family in mid-19th century rural Pelham as well as a great example of the romantic theories of architectural design emerging in America at that time. The Priory was illustrated in the first edition of Andrew Jackson Downing's influential Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening published in 1841, in which he described it as a \\"highly unique residence in the old English style\\". The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Overview Purchased from the Siwanoy Indians by Thomas Pell in 1654 the tract of land known as Pelham had become by 1790 a largely agrarian settlement with a population of 199, of which 38 were slaves. Its relative proximity to New York City resulted for much of the succeeding century in the use of rural Pelham both as working farmland and as country estates for men associated with the economic and cultural life of the City to the south. Born in the United States in 1778, Robert Bolton traveled as a young man to England where he received an education as a minister and married Ann Jay, daughter of an English clergyman. Returning to America with his family of 13 children, Bolton in 1836 was given St. Paul's Parish in the Town of Eastchester, Westchester County, and settled on a farm on the site of the present village of Bronxville. The following year Bolton purchased 38 acres on Shore Road in the settlement of Pelham on which he completed the Priory residence in 1838. It is believed that Washington Irving, a friend of Bolton's, was closely associated with the design of both the house and the surrounding gardens. Bolton's sons executed much of the interior finishing themselves, including the richly carved woodwork. and the stained glass made by William Jay Bolton, a pioneer in the manufacture of stained glass in America. Design The main structure is composed of a long two-story block intersected by a gabled two-story wing, with a crenelated four-story octagonal tower at the northern angle of that junction and a crenelated three-story square brick tower at the southwestern end of the main block. See also: Washington Irving gave yellow bricks from the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow to outline the construction date on the wall above the door. The interior, also essentially little altered from the 19th-century scheme, contains a number of well-proportioned areas on the first floor. On the second floor, eight rooms are accessible from the main hall which extends the full length of the house. The craftsmanship attributed to Robert Bolton's sons is exhibited in the richly detailed woodwork such as mantels and built-in bookcases. Situated in the vicinity of the Priory are several structures associated with the property: Christ Church (1843), Christ Church Parish House (1845, 1876), Bolton Memorial Building (ca. 1848), Bolton Cottage (1810), and the Stables (1895).

R. Osman had written a pantomime called \\"Harlequin Cock Robin and the Children in the Wood\\" in 1866. See Nicoll, Allardyce. A History of English Drama, 1660‚Äì1900, Volume 6, p. 206, Cambridge University Press, 2009 was a pantomime written by W. S. Gilbert. As with many pantomimes of the Victorian era, the piece consisted of a story involving evil spirits, young lovers and \\"transformation\\" scenes, followed by a harlequinade. The piece premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, London on 26 December 1867. It was the only pantomime written by Gilbert alone, although before and afterwards he collaborated with other authors on pantomimes for the London stage. It was written early in his career, when he was not yet an established playwright, and the script was regarded as of less importance than the spectacle. The first night was under-rehearsed, and the spectacular effects and scenery failed to work properly. Later performances were satisfactory in that respect, and the piece received some good reviews. Background Gilbert and his wife, Lucy, in 1867 Gilbert had always been fascinated by pantomime.Crowther, Andrew. \\"Clown and Harlequin\\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, vol. 3, issue 23, Summer 2008, pp. 710‚Äì21 In 1865, he had written Pantomimic Presentiments, one of his Bab Ballads, satirising pantomime and complaining that \\"I'm beginning to get weary of dramatic desert dreary,/ And I ask myself a query, when will novelties begin?\\"Pantomimic Presentiments , Bab Ballads, originally published in Fun magazine on 7 October 1865, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 31 December 2010 Gilbert had collaborated on an earlier pantomime, Hush-a-Bye, Baby, on the Tree Top, in 1866.Stedman, pp. 34‚Äì35 Immediately following his production of Harlequin Cock Robin, Gilbert published an article called \\"Getting Up a Pantomime\\".Gilbert, W. S. \\"Getting Up a Pantomime\\", London Society, January 1868, pp. 50‚Äì51; Crowther, pp. 716‚Äì17 His 1875 opera with Arthur Sullivan, Trial by Jury, included a pantomime-style transformation scene (especially prominent in the 1884 version), and he collaborated on The Forty Thieves, a pantomime written as a charity fund- raiser in 1878, in which he played Harlequin.Hollingshead, John. Good Old Gaiety: An Historiette & Remembrance, pp. 39‚Äì41 (1903) London: Gaity Theatre Co His last full-length play, The Fairy's Dilemma (1904), drew heavily on (and satirised) pantomimic conventions. But Harlequin Cock Robin was Gilbert's only solo essay in the genre of traditional pantomime.Stedman, passim In the West End, during the mid-19th century, pantomimes traditionally opened at the major theatres on 26 December, known in England as Boxing Day, intended to play for only a few weeks into the new year. Gilbert's pantomime opened on the same night as rival shows at the Drury Lane Theatre, Covent Garden, Sadler's Wells, and eight other London theatres. Less well-established pantomime venues opened on Christmas Eve to give themselves an edge over the competition; seven such shows opened on 24 December 1867.\\"The Christmas Burlesques and Pantomimes\\", The Era Almanack, 1868, p. 60 The writers of the rival shows included established authors such as Mark Lemon, Gilbert √† Beckett, C. H. Hazlewood and E. L. Blanchard. Gilbert's piece ran until the end of February 1868, being given about 83 performances. So, notwithstanding Gilbert's statement about it in 1868, it gained average success for a Christmas pantomime.Moss, Simon. \\"Harlequin Cock-Robin and Jenny Wren\\", c20th.com, W. S. Gilbert archive, accessed 31 December 2010 At this early stage of his career as a playwright, Gilbert had only two substantial successes behind him ‚Äì his burlesques, Dulcamara! or, The Little Duck and the Great Quack and La Vivandi√®re; or, True to the Corps!. Professionally, he was not yet in a position to control the casting or staging of his works. In 1884, he wrote a humorous article for the annual almanac published by The Era recalling the chaotic circumstances of the production of his pantomime. > The piece was written in four days and produced in about three weeks ‚Ä¶ [A]ll > the laughs in the piece were the stage manager's. I was rude to him at the > time, but I apologise to him now. The rehearsals, of course, were a wild > scramble. Everybody was going to introduce a song or a dance (unknown to > me), and these songs and dances were rehearsed surreptitiously in corners. ‚Ä¶ > At about four o'clock on Boxing-day [the day of the opening] instalments of > the scenery began to arrive‚Äîthree pairs of wings, then half a flat, then a > couple of sky borders and so on. When the curtain rose on the piece about > three complete scenes had arrived. ... [A] \\"Fish Ballet\\" entered (very shiny > and scaly but otherwise not like any fish I have ever met) and danced a long > ballet, which they themselves thoughtfully encored. Then came the clever and > hardworking lady with another song (from last year's pantomime). Then a can- > can by the Finette troupe. Then a party of acrobats. Then the spotted > monarch's mystic dance. Altogether a chain of events calculated to arrest > the attention of a wayfarer through that wood and set him pondering. Gilbert's article also mentions that he was paid ¬£60 for Harlequin Cock Robin. This was twice what he had been paid for the libretto of Dulcamara in 1866, but was still a modest sum for the time.W. S. Gilbert, \\"My Pantomime\\" , The Era Almanack, 1884, pp. 77‚Äì79 The Gilbert scholar Jane Stedman notes that this production had \\"the questionable honour of introducing the cancan to the English stage.\\"Stedman, p. 53 Men flocked to see what one paper called \\"the most gross and filthy exhibition that has ever disgraced our degenerate stage.\\"Stedman, p. 54 Gilbert's early pantomimes, burlesques and farces, full of awful puns and broad humour, show signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of his work.See The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15 (1907‚Äì21) and Crowther, Andrew, The Life of W. S. Gilbert . These works gave way, after 1869, to plays containing original plots and fewer puns.Crowther, Andrew. The Life of W. S.

Miasma, indignant at the > ascendancy that his old foe, Fresh Air, is gaining over him, consults with > Satana as to the best means of revenging himself on the fairy. He cannot > enter her pure realms himself, so he is fain to intrust the accomplishment > of his designs upon her to three wicked birds ‚Äì the Sparrow, the Cuckoo, and > the Raven. They explain that they cannot kill her as Miasma suggests, > because Fresh Air is absolutely necessary to their existence, but they offer > to kill her favourite child, Cock Robin, who is that day to be united to > Jenny Wren, of whom the Sparrow, the Cuckoo, and the Raven are rejected > admirers. Health and Happiness overhear this conspiracy, and interpose to > plead for Cock Robin's life, but Miasma is inexorable, and the three birds, > attended by Satana and her dumb-familiar Demonio, betake themselves to The > Abode of the Spirit of Fresh Air, who is then in the act of receiving the > various feathered guests, whom she has invited to the grand wedding of Cock > Robin and Jenny Wren. Just as the happy pair are on the point of being > united, the Cuckoo attempts to kiss Jenny Wren, and the Sparrow, pretending > to shoot Cuckoo as a punishment for his madness, kills Cock Robin. A court- > martial is held, and, on the evidence of \\"the fly who saw him die\\", and \\"the > fish who caught his blood\\", the Sparrow and his companions are found guilty. > As summary justice is about to be wreaked on them, their friend Satana > changes them into three bears. > > The next scene takes place in the forest, where Cock Robin is to be buried. > Fairy Fresh Air transforms the dead body of Robin into a live little man. We > now come to The Home of the Three Bears. Jenny seeks shelter in their new > abode from the storm, and, finding the house unoccupied, takes the liberty > of tasting the porridge prepared for the breakfast of the bears. After > sitting in all their chairs, and trying all their beds, she finally goes a > nid nid nodding on the bed of The Little Bear. The three bears return, and, > finding their porridge eaten and their beds tumbled, seize on Little Maid > and turn her into a pie, but Little Man arrives, defeats the three bears and > Demonio. A fairy at that moment appears, and gives them a magic ring, which > entitles the holder to three wishes. The Little Man and Little Maid transfer > the responsibility of wishing to Gaffer and Gammer Guy, Little Maid's father > and mother. Through the agency of Demonio, the old lady desires that a black > pudding shall come down the chimney ready dressed. Her wish is realised, and > the Old Gentleman wishes as a punishment it may stick to her nose. This it > does, and the old lady wishes the pudding off again. > > The good Fairy, Fortune, appears, and gives Little Man a magic purse, a > magic cap, and a magic sword, conferring unlimited wealth, universal > locomotion, and absolute invincibility.

The Times wrote, \\"Few managers would have attempted to get up such a pantomime within the very short time Mr. E. T. Smith has had possession of the Lyceum. The want of sufficient preparation was manifest in more than one instance during the first night's performance; but had everything gone off perfectly smooth, such a result would, perhaps, have surprised persons much more than did the drawbacks for which Mr. Smith felt it necessary to ask the forbearance of the audience.\\"\\"Lyceum Theatre\\", The Times, 27 December 1867 The review comments on the elaborate requirements of the piece: \\"This is a pantomime with not merely a single transformation, but three changes leading up to the comic business; and when the latter commences there are four clowns, two harlequins, a harlequin √† la Watteau ‚Äì played by a lady ‚Äì two columbines, two pantaloons, five sprites, and two ‚Äúexquisites,‚Äù besides scores of supernumerary comic pantomimists, in the shape of policemen, costermongers, butchers‚Äô boys, &c.;\\" Once the piece had settled in, the reviews were favourable.

He was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1822, and Attorney-General for Ireland in 1827. He was made Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1831, a position he held until his death in 1838. He was a cousin of the United Irishmen leader, Henry Joy McCracken.  Family  He was born in Belfast, son of Henry Joy and grandson of Francis Joy;Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.347 his mother was Barbara Dunbar, daughter of George Dunbar from Dungannon. The Joy family, who were of Huguenot origin, were among Belfast's leading industrialists and Francis founded the Belfast News Letter. His aunt Ann was the mother of Henry Joy McCracken. The future judge did not share his cousin's passion for politics; although he opposed the Act of Union 1800, he was considered a non-political barrister.  Career  He was educated at the University of Dublin, entered Middle Temple in 1783 and was called to the Bar in 1788. He went on the north-east circuit and specialised in equity. He was an acknowledged expert in this field of law, but his career progressed slowly, due perhaps due to his lack of interest in politics. He took silk in 1808, and became Third Sergeant in 1814, Second Sergeant in 1816 and First Sergeant in 1817.Ball p.347 According to Elrington Ball, his promotion from Attorney- General to Chief Baron was a purely political decision. Although Joy was well qualified for the position on grounds of legal ability, the appointment was intended to please Daniel O'Connell. O'Connell, however, had quarreled with Joy, as he had with most of the Irish judiciary, and so far from being pleased at Joy's elevation, unsuccessfully sought his removal from the Bench.Ball pp.269-70 Joy died in 1838 at his residence Woodtown Park, Rathfarnham, County Dublin, and was buried in Monkstown. He never married.  Character  A popular verse, punning on his surname, suggests that he was a rather dour character: \\"tho' he smiles, 'tis less with mirth than pleasure\\". He was noted for his dedication to the law and lack of interest in politics, but did not lack other enthusiasms. He was deeply interested in ornithology and arboriculture, and kept a small private museum. He was a noted traveller, who went as far as Constantinople.Ball p.347 References 1767 births 1838 deaths Solicitors-General for Ireland Attorneys-General for Ireland Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Lawyers from Belfast Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer Serjeants-at-law (Ireland) ","title":"Henry Joy (judge)"},{"id":"30258821","text":"Francis Blake Delaval may refer to: * Francis Blake Delaval (1692‚Äì1752), naval officer * Sir Francis Blake Delaval (1727‚Äì1771), his son ","title":"Francis Blake Delaval"},{"id":"30258823","text":"Maria Westberg Maria Westberg (1853‚Äì1893), was a Swedish ballerina.

He had a privileged and aristocratic education at Westminster School, Eton College and then Christ Church at Oxford University.Roger Burgess, Those Delavals! (1972), p.9 Life Delaval was the eldest son of Captain Francis Blake Delaval RN of Seaton Delaval Hall, and he succeeded to his father's estate in 1752. He added to it by building the folly known as Starlight Castle, overlooking Holywell Dene which leads to Seaton Sluice. It was allegedly built in a single day to win a wager. Little survives of it now apart from a single stone arch. Delaval fell in love with a singer and actor named Ann Catley in about 1760. She had been apprenticed to William Bates, who was a composer and singing teacher. Bates sold Ann's apprenticeship to Delaval. Bates was given money by Delaval to make up for any financial loss to him, but Catley's father could see that Ann had been sold. Aided by his employer, her father sued Delaval and Bates but to no benefit. Eventually the relationship with Delaval ended and Catley continued her career. Available in print, and online for subscribers Francis was an actor in a group led by Samuel Foote. He was a gambler but could not afford that lifestyle. He married the wealthy (and much older) Isabella, daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet and widow of Lord Nassau Powlett, but it was not a happy marriage. His wife filed a lawsuit against him because of adultery with an actress, Miss La Roche, for which Isabella unknowingly forked out ¬£1500. His military career was of short duration. He took part in the Raid on St Malo, and received a knighthood for his bravery when storming the Brittany beach, although there were no French troops present to offer resistance. He represented Hindon in Wiltshire in Parliament from 1751 to 1754, and Andover in Hampshire from 1754 to 1768.

It was designed by noted theater architect Thomas W. Lamb (1871 - 1942) and built in 1926. The 1,800-seat facility operates as a concert venue, hosting musicians and occasionally comedians, as owned and operated by NYC-based concert promoter Peter Shapiro. The Capitol Theatre has had a long history, with tenures as a movie theater and catering hall, in addition to hosting concerts. Building Structure It consists of two parts: a three-story section containing three storefronts, the theater entrance, two stories of office space; and the theater auditorium. The front section is nine bays wide and four bays deep with a truncated hipped roof. It features a decorative terra cotta cornice. The theater structure is irregular in shape and ranges from four to seven stories in height. History =Movie theatre= The Capitol Theatre was built for Vaudeville and Cinema and continued as a movie theater until 1970. Its opening night in 1926 sold out all 2,000 seats and had to turn hundreds away. =Concert venue= In the 1970s, the theatre was renovated for use as a performance space. Note: This includes and Accompanying 47 photographs The Capitol was utilized as a concert space throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and featured performances by such acts as Pink Floyd, Johnny Winter, Rick Derringer, The Talking Heads, The Grateful Dead, Rub√©n Blades ,Janis Joplin, Parliament-Funkadelic and Traffic. The Grateful Dead played 13 dates at the Capitol Theatre in a one-year span from 1970-1971. American Songwriter notes that \\"Many fans think those shows were some of the best the band ever played.\\" Janis Joplin debuted her song Mercedes Benz at the theater, to the surprise of her band, after writing it at a bar nearby. In 1984, the Capitol Theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1980s, the frequency of live events at the theatre diminished, partially due to a village curfew for live music after 1:00 am. The Capitol would host off-Broadway plays and musicals, and events run by the Port Chester Council of the Arts. The 1990s would see some live music again, with the likes of Phish, Blues Traveler, Spin Doctors and Strangefolk. Both David Bowie and the Rolling Stones performed at the Capitol in 1997, as part of episodes of the MTV television program Live From The 10 Spot. =Catering hall= The theatre later became a catering and special-events facility, run by owner Marvin Ravikoff. The lower level seats were removed to create a flat space for tables and a dance floor for weddings, Bar Mitzvot and other events. =Reopening as concert venue= In December 2011, The New York Times announced that the theatre was to be reopened by music entrepreneur Peter Shapiro, owner of the Brooklyn Bowl and former owner of the NYC club Wetlands Preserve, to present major concerts at the venue, in partnership with concert promoter The Bowery Presents. A multimillion-dollar renovation took place; \\"state-of-the-art\\" sound and lighting equipment was installed. Part of the renovations included acquiring the adjacent Capitol Jewelers store and converting it into a bar, which is open to the public most nights when the theatre does not have an event. The bar, with the approval of the estate of the Garcia family, was named \\"Garcia's\\" in honor of Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia. The Capitol Theatre reopened on September 4, 2012, with Bob Dylan as its first act. Initially, Shapiro had a long-term lease on the Capitol Theatre, which, at the time, was owned by Marvin Ravikoff. In December 2012, Shapiro purchased the theatre. The theatre has hosted many famous performers and top acts such as, BB King, Furthur, Willie Nelson, the Black Crowes, Skrillex, George Lopez, Elvis Costello & The Roots, Steely Dan, Al Green, the B-52s, and Yo Gabba Gabba!. In 2013 alone the venue hosted Dawes, Blondie, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, the Rascals, and Chicago, and scheduled Neil Young, Willie Nelson, Chris Isaak, Yes, Foreigner, Patti Smith, Courtney Love, Bonnie Raitt, Jonny Lang, Cyndi Lauper, Herbie Hancock and many other top performers. On November 3, 2013, The New York Times reported that Phil Lesh, longtime bass player of the Grateful Dead, would play 45 shows with Shapiro of which 30 would take place at the Capitol Theatre and the first at Brooklyn Bowl on November 14, 2013.The New York Times Since Lesh's retirement from touring in 2014 he has performed multiple residencies each year at the Capitol Theatre in addition to performing other shows at his own venue, Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, California, and occasionally other venues, often ones owned by Shapiro. The Capitol Theatre was the filming location for comedian Bo Burnham's stand-up special Make Happy. 1990s Folk Rock band Counting Crows played a special show at The Capitol Theatre where super fans Mike and Melissa (known to the band as the M&M; couple) would get engaged.

He was initially involved in petty crimes between baking jobs, but Eriksson joined a double-murder conspiracy on the promise of a monetary reward. Despite being caught, he escaped the death penalty and was sentenced to life imprisonment, of which he served nearly 21 years. Background =Early life= Eriksson was born in Badelunda, V√§ster√•s, Sweden. His family moved to Stenby, Adels√∂, when he was six years old. At the age of thirteen, Eriksson moved back to V√§ster√•s, where he lived until his church confirmation. =Education and work= After his confirmation, Eriksson became an apprentice with a local baker. In the early 1890s, Eriksson moved to Stockholm, where he held jobs at several bakeries. He later moved to Gnesta. Around 1900, Eriksson moved to Obbola, where he found work at a local store. After about a year, he became very poor and began to live as a vagrant. In July 1907, Eriksson found employment at a baker's shop in Vretstorp, where the owner was pleased with his work. Crimes In September 1900, Eriksson borrowed a suit from a friend. When he did not return the suit, the friend pressed charges against him; Eriksson was sentenced to two months imprisonment for shoplifting and embezzlement. On 8 July 1904, he was convicted of shoplifting for a second time after stealing clothes from a shop in Haver√∂. He was sentenced to prison for two months, which he served in Sundsvall. In January 1905, Eriksson and a friend, who were both drunk, stole three cans of lobster in Sollefte√•. He was again sentenced to two months in jail, plus an additional year to be served in H√§rn√∂sand. In 1909, Eriksson moved to the city of Leksand. =Double murders= Crime scene at the Dunders' home. In the village of Heden, Leksand, Eriksson moved in with Kerstis Karin Olsdotter (also known as \\"Jutta\\"), and Fredrik Alfred Vestlund (also known as \\"L√∂fstalunsen\\"). Olsdotter lived a promiscuous life and had a poor reputation in the village. Olsdotter was informed that a former corporal named Daniel Dunder born 1827, and his wife Kerstin born 1834, had recently sold their last cow to a neighbour and had received a substantial sum of money. In need of money, Eriksson, Olsdotter and Vestlund conspired to rob the Dunder couple on 11 December 1909. To avoid later identification by the victims, the trio decided to poison them. Vestlund served the Dunders coffee laced with arsenic, while Eriksson and Olsdotter stood guard outside the Dunders' home. After the Dunders had died from the poison, the trio tried to destroy the evidence of murder, starting a fire in the fireplace so it would appear the couple had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. =Discovery of the bodies and trial= A neighbour discovered the dead couple and the police quickly suspected murder. The available evidence pointed to Eriksson, Olsdotter and Vestlund, who were all arrested in a matter of days. By late December they were taken to Falu prison by Christmas and on 10 January 1910, legal proceedings started in Leksand. Olsdotter was sentenced to death for plotting the murders while Eriksson received life imprisonment. Vestlund, who was considered the mastermind behind the murders, was also sentenced to death. On 15 July of that year, the court denied their appeals but on 28 October 1910, the sentences against Vestlund and Olsdotter were commuted to life imprisonment. Eriksson and Vestlund served their time in L√•ngholmen Prison in Stockholm while Olsdotter served her time at a women's prison in V√§xj√∂. =Imprisonment= Eriksson served the first years of his sentence on the island of L√•ngholmen. In January 1916, he was transferred to Malm√∂. During his time in prison, Eriksson was involved in a number of fights because of his temperament, which may have contributed to the denials of his appeals for clemency. In 1918, he was sent to Karlskrona before he was transferred back in L√•ngholmen in 1920. In 1922, Eriksson was transferred to a low-security prison in Mariestad that specialized in farming, and was permitted to work there with horses. =Appeals= In November 1925, Eriksson wrote his first appeal for clemency, which was denied. He made additional requests in 1926, 1928 and 1929 without success. On 31 October 1930, his clemency request was approved upon his fifth appeal.

He was an early photographer and designed the Coat of arms of New South Wales. Biography William Applegate Gullick was baptised in Edington, Wiltshire in 1858. He and his family emigrated to Sydney where his mother died in childbirth. His father, a printer, lost all his money after he had married Sarah Dust, and was declared bankrupt in 1869. The Coat of Arms for New South Wales as published in March 1906 after it was approved by Joseph Carruthers, the Premier of NSW. Gullick started his printing career working for the trusted printing company of John Sands and Co. This company published directories and also worked on heraldry. This organisation published the directory of deaths. He married Mary Pierce; William and Mary had five children, whom they named Chloe, Zoe, Marjorie, Dorothy and Noel.William Gullick, heritage.nsw.gov.au, accessed 31 December 2010 Gullick was asked to create the coat of arms for New South Wales. The interpretation of the ideas that he had were published in 1907 and later a book on the seals in 1914.Gullick, National Library of Australia, accessed December 2010 He was honoured to have his designs approved by the King, and Gullick expected these \\"emblems of distinction to be prized and guarded jealously\\". The motto of the arms had originally been devised for Sydney University, but it was Gullick who decided that his arms would bear the message ‚ÄúOrta recens quam pura nites‚Äù (Newly risen, how brightly you shine). Mary Gullick, Zoe Gullick, Marjory Gullick and Chloe Gullick in an early colour picture The 1909 picture cropped and colour balanced using a modern image cleaner Gullick experimented with the early use of colour photography in Australia. The Lumi√®re brothers' autochrome process that he used relied on using potato starch dyed to the three key colours of red, blue and green. The photo of his wife and daughters was taken with this process in about 1909 only two years after the process first went on sale. The three basic colours of the Lumi√®re process is thought to be the reason why Gullick's family are wearing different coloured dresses. The photo is at their home in Killara. Intriguingly these are the same three colours as basic stamp denominations used across Australia. Gullick is thought to have influenced the heraldic nature of the stamp designs.Officers of the Government Printing Office, accessed 31 December 2010 Zoe Gullick (in the red dress) helped Gullick as a laboratory assistant when he was working on his photography. Gullick died suddenly, and his will indicates that he did not leave his family the money they might have expected. His obituary does list his hobbies which included both coin and stamp collecting and he left a lathe, many woodworking tools and a camera.

Construction started in 1650. The demolition of its ramparts began in 1740.  History  Berlin was an important market place on the main east-west route (today Bundesstra√üe 1). However, it had no real fortifications, unlike Spandau in the west (Spandau Citadel) and K√∂penick in the east (K√∂penick Palace). Although Berlin was not the site of any battles during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) it suffered heavily from the Swedish occupation; by the end of the war in 1631, a third of the buildings had been demolished and half the population had fled or died. Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg ordered the engineer architect Johann Gregor Memhardt to make plans for a fortification for the town. These began in 1650 following the contemporary fortification model of bastions in northern Italy. Large ramparts were erected and the space between was filled with water. The construction of the parts east of the river was finished between 1658 and 1662. There were more problems with the western parts due to the swamps in the area and accordingly these were not finished until 1683. However, the ramparts on that side never reached their intended height. In the following years the ramparts deteriorated to such an extent that Frederick William I of Prussia decided to abandon them in 1734. In their place the Berlin Customs Wall was erected, a project that continued until 1737. In 1740 work began to demolish the walls of the fortress, but it was not until the end of the 19th century that all of the ramparts had been levelled. Today nothing remains apart from an echo of its path as shown by the zig-zag routes taken by some streets in the city center. A map can be seen in the Berlin Stadtbahn of railway tracks which were built along the eastern (northern) section where the fortress had been.  Fortifications  The Berlin Fortress had five city gates and 13 bastions. * Leipzig Gate (Leipziger Tor) * K√∂penick Gate (K√∂penicker Tor) * Mills Gate (M√ºhlentor) * Georges Gate (Georgentor), originally named after the Hospital Saint-Georges it was renamed to King's Gate (K√∂nigstor) in 1701 * Spandau Gate (Spandauer Tor) * New Town Gate (Neust√§dtisches Tor) added in direction of the western planned town Dorotheenstadt which was supposed to be fortified as well but these plans were never realized. * I.

Life  German was born in Riga (then part of the Russian Empire) and accompanied his father, an artillery officer, during the Civil War. He graduated from high school in Kursk and studied at the Technical School of Performing Arts in Leningrad in 1929. At age 17, he wrote the novel Rafael iz parikmakherskoi (Raphael of the barbershop), published in 1928, but did not consider himself a professional writer until he published the novel Vstuplenie (Entry), which met with the approval of Maxim Gorky, in 1931. In 1936, together with director Sergei Gerasimov, he wrote the screenplay for the movie Semero smelykh (The courageous seven), about researchers in the Arctic; among his other screenplays were Pirogov (1947) and Belinsky (1951), both directed by Grigori Kozintsev, and Delo Rumyantseva (The Rumyantsev case, 1955), directed by Iosif Kheifits. During World War II German was a war correspondent for TASS and the Soviet Information Bureau with the Northern Fleet. He spent the entire war in the north; from Arkhangelsk he often flew to Murmansk or Kandalaksha, living in the Arctic for months on end, traveling to the front, visiting forward positions, and spending time on the warships of the Northern Fleet. During this time he wrote essays and articles for TASS, and still found time for short stories and novels. During the war he wrote the short novels Bi kheppi! (Be happy!), Attestat (The certificate), Studyonoe more (The frozen sea), and Daleko na Severe (The far north) and the plays Za zdorov'e togo, kto v puti (To the health of the man on the road) and Beloe more (White Sea). He was a member of the Communist Party from 1958. After the war he wrote a historical novel about the era of Peter the Great, Rossiya molodaya (Young Russia, 1952).

The public telephone box does not accept coinage and there is a bus shelter but, from 2009, only one bus per week leaves the village for Banbury, at 1017 hours on Thursdays with the return bus leaving Banbury at 1330 hours. The bus service is operated by A & M Group. In September 2011 Regenco, a renewable energy developer, announced that it was exploring the possibility of building a wind farm adjacent to the M40 motorway between Shotteswell and Hanbury and local inhabitants formed SHAMWAG (Shotteswell, Hanwell and Mollington Wind Farm Action Group) to resist this development. In November and December 2011 the group was successful in its challenge when both Stratford District Council and Cherwell District Council rejected an application by Regenco to build a meteorological mast near Bury Court Farm although the company lodged an appeal with the Planning Inspectorate on 6 February 2012 which was eventually rejected on 22 June 2012.Wind farm plans refused to delight of protesters.(http://www.wind-watch.org/news/2011/12/13/wind-farm-plans-refused- to-delight-of-protestors/)Regenco appeals refusal of temporary wind monitoring mast application.(http://shamwag.com/2012/02/06/regenco-appeals-refusal-wind- monitoring-mast-application/ Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Laurenceanon.

It is believed that the small cell which is now the vestry was the original church with the old altar stone placed under the east window in the present day vestry. The north window is only two inches wide which is a feature of early windows when glass was not used in them. There is an early thirteenth century tower which has six bells and an early fourteenth century chancel with a north chapel dating from the latter part of that century. A spire was added in the fifteenth century. The church is constructed from the local ironstone or Horton stone and was restored in 1875. The earliest recorded Vicar of Shotteswell was Father Stotterwell in 1287 but no Vicarage existed until 1381.St. Laurence Church, Shotteswell A Wesleyan Chapel was opened in the village in 1854 but was closed before 1981 when it was used, first as a workshop and afterwards as a hairdressing salon, eventually being sold in 1996 to be converted into a private house.

In 1235 &1242, Wydo (Guy) held a knight's fee in Shotteswell as did his son, John, in 1268. Their successors, the FitzWyth family, held the manor after John Dyve in 1279 ‚Äì John FitzWyth in 1301, his son, Robert FitzWyth in 1309 until 1316 when he was wife, Elizabeth, is mentioned but in 1316, Robert's son, Guy, also died and he was probably succeeded by his cousin, John FitzWyth, recorded as holding it in 1326. He was succeeded by Robert and he then passed the manor to his nephew, Robert FitzWyth, in 1352. Robert's widow, Joan, conveyed her life interest in the estate to John Catesby. Robert's daughter by his first wife, Agnes Catesby, married Sir John de Beauchamp of Holt, a favourite of King Richard II, but after his execution for treason during the Merciless Parliament in 1388, the estate passed to his son, John. Sir John Beauchamp and Sir Baldwin Bereford shared the fees in Shotteswell in 1400 and when Sir John died in 1420, his widow, Alice, held the manor for life to be succeeded by Margaret, Sir John's daughter and her husband, John Wisham, in 1423. Margaret's three daughters, Alice, Joan and Elizabeth were co-heirs. Elizabeth's son, John Croft and his wife, Joan, held one third of the manor in 1499 and one half in 1501. Simon Rice, a London merchant, purchased the moiety of the manor in 1514 and was succeeded by his widow, Lettice who held lands in 1531. The FitzWytes had retained as much of the manor as represented one quarter of the fee and the rest was held by the Wandard family and in 1262 Robert Wandard had agreed to do suit to John FitzWyth's court in Shotteswell twice-yearly. In 1319, the Wandards sold the manor to William de Bereford who was succeeded by his son, Sir Edmund, who died in 1354 settling the manor on his illegitimate son, Sir John and after his death the manor passed to his brother, Baldwin. He was succeeded firstly by his widow, Elizabeth and then by her daughter, Maud. After her death the manor was held by Thomas Sinclair, great great nephew of Sir Edmund, who died in 1435 and, despite having three daughters, settled the manor on trustees \\"to defraud the king of the custody and marriage of his heirs\\". Trustee and subsequent owner, John Aston, sold the manor in 1436 to the head of the le Botiler or Butler family, James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, the husband of Joan Beauchamp, and he was succeeded by his son, James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wiltshire, who was beheaded after the Battle of Towton on 1 May 1461 at Newcastle. In 1462 the manor of Shotteswell was granted to Richard Harcourt for services to King Edward IV but the Botilers/Butlers were restored subsequently with the succession of John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond, James' brother, who died childless in 1515 when the manor passed to Richard Farmer, a Calais merchant, who then sold it in 1537 to Sir Thomas Pope for ¬£400. In 1555 Shotteswell was granted a licence to grant for the endowment of Trinity College, Oxford. Edmund Hutchins, Pope's nephew, inherited the manor in 1559 and when he died in 1602, another of Pope's nephews, William, succeeded and afterwards, the latter's grandson, Thomas Pope, 2nd Earl of Downe, inherited the manor on 2 June 1631. His uncle, Sir Thomas Pope, held the manor in 1655 and from 1667‚Äì8, his son, also Sir Thomas, held the title but after his death the title became extinct although his four sisters inherited the estates. The Norths, later Earls of Guilford, the family of the husband of Frances, the third sister, gained possession of the entire manor of Shotteswell until George Augustus (the member of parliament for Banbury from 1792 to 1794 and grandson of the former prime minister, Lord Frederick North) died in 1802 to be succeeded by his brother Francis, who held the manor as a trustee for his three nieces. Col. John Sidney Doyle married the second niece, the Hon. Susan North, in 1838 and adopted her surname and became lord of the manor of Shotteswell in 1841 after the death of the eldest sister, Maria, when Susan became Baroness North. William Henry John, Lord North succeeded in 1894 when his father died and the manor was sold to B. J. Daunt of County Cork in September 1937.British History Online Parishes Shotteswell.(http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=57064) English Civil War The villagers of Shotteswell would have been considerably affected by the events of the civil war which took place in the vicinity of the village since it is situated only a short distance from the site of the Battle of Edgehill, the first major encounter of the war on 23 October 1642, there having been a minor skirmish the evening before at the nearby village of Wormleighton. Before the battle, the Parliamentary forces under the Earl of Essex had been camped a short distance to the north of Shotteswell, at Kineton, and the Royalist forces were camped to the south, at Banbury ‚Äì Shotteswell more or less lay half-way between the two armies. Later in the war, another significant battle was fought between the two forces, only about two miles from Shotteswell, at Cropredy Bridge on 29 June 1644.Trevor Royle (2004) \\"Civil War The War of the Three Kingdoms 1638‚Äì1660\\" pages 184‚Äì200, Abacus.Terry Slater (1997)\\"A History of Warwickshire\\" pages 78‚Äì80, Phillimore & Co. Ltd. Nineteenth century In the mid-nineteenth century Shotteswell was described as a \\"poor and very unimportant parish\\". In the 1851 census, 70 households were recorded with a number of them closely related to each other. Most recorded occupations in the census were related to agriculture; farming families included the Whites, the Ledbrooks and the Bulls whilst the numerous Sharman family was mainly employed as agricultural labourers. At this time about 60% of the land belonged to the White family which had become established in the village when an ancestor, Thomas White, had moved there from north Oxfordshire in the 1730s and his son, also Thomas, and other close relatives were buried significantly in the chancel of St. Laurence Church around 1811‚Äì15. As well as farming, this family later owned shops in the village as well as The Flying Horse Inn around 1874.\\"Misc Inns and Taverns in Warwickshire S ‚Äì W\\"(http://www.Hunimex.com/warwick/inns- mscs.html) By the 1881 census, the long-established Sharman family which had made its first appearance in the parish records in 1690, was the most numerous family in the village.\\"Shotteswell\\"(http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bewickgenealogy/census/shotteswell.htm) In 1831 a notable crime was committed in the village when a bankrupt farmer, John Coleman, shot Edward Goode, an agricultural worker, fatally in the head and was charged with murder and subsequently tried at Warwick Assizes in 1832 where he was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter due to his mental disturbance brought on by the loss of his property. He was sentenced to transportation for life. The inquest into Goode's death had been held in The Flying Horse Inn, as had a number of other inquests during the 19th century. It is recorded that one of the members of the White family, another Thomas, was the village constable at the time and it was he who apprehended Coleman after the killing. In 1888 the villagers of Shotteswell, as well as those of neighbouring Farnborough, Mollington and Ratley and Upton, expressed a preference for their villages to be transferred from Warwickshire to Oxfordshire in a \\"memorial\\" in response to the \\"Report of the Committee of County Magistrates upon the rectification of County and Union Boundaries in Oxfordshire\\". This response highlighted the villages' close links to the town of Banbury.Oxford Journal, 18 February 1888 Nothing came of this expressed preference. First and Second World Wars A memorial plaque at the entrance to St. Laurence Church records the names of five men associated with the village who died serving in the armed forces during the First World War as well as naming four men who died similarly during the Second World War. On 22 November 1942, a Wellington BK261 aircraft broke up and crashed at Shotteswell when a photo-flash exploded in the aircraft and this resulted in the death of five crew members.\\"Military crashes in the south west Midlands ‚Äì 1942\\"(http://www.aviationarchaeology.org.uk/marg/crashes1942.htm) The village was situated close to a Royal Air Force practice bombing range during World War II and in his book \\"A Thousand Shall Fall\\", the Canadian former pilot, Murray Pedersen, described how the village sometimes sustained inadvertent damage from bombs which had gone astray from Allied bombers using the practice range.Murray Pedersen (2003) \\"A Thousand Shall Fall\\", Dundun Press Ltd.

Notable inhabitants John Profumo, Member of Parliament for Stratford-upon-Avon in the 1950s and 60s lived in Cherry Lodge in Shotteswell until he sold it in 1987. He was the centre of a national political scandal when he lied to the House of Commons, hiding the truth that whilst serving as war minister he was having an affair with Christine Keeler, a teenaged call- girl who was simultaneously having an affair with a Russian naval attache which raised serious national security issues. John Profumo was forced to resign as a cabinet minister and MP and local people were offered ¬£100 by journalists to reveal Profumo's whereabouts after he went into hiding at a friend's home in Radway. He died in 2006.\\"Loyal to scandal minister\\"(http://www.banburyguardian.co.uk/news/local/loyal-to-scandal- minister-1-587820) References Civil parishes in Warwickshire Villages in Warwickshire ","title":"Shotteswell"},{"id":"30259122","text":"Maruteh is a settlement in Sarawak, Malaysia.

History In March 1941, the U. S. Navy awarded McDonnell Aircraft a contract for a radio- controlled target drone under the designation of XTD2D-1 for anti-aircraft and aerial gunnery practice. The aircraft had a mid-mounted wing, V-tail, and McDonnell XPJ40-MD-2 pulsejet engine mounted atop the rear fuselage. The drone could be either launched by catapult from the ground or from underwing racks on Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats. It was gyro-stabilized, and control was by radio command; at the end of its mission the drone could be recovered by parachute. Operational history The Katydid entered service in 1942; testing took place at the Naval Air Missile Test Center in Point Mugu, California. Production models were originally designated TD2D-1, however the Navy changed its designation system in 1946 and the XTD2D-1 and TD2D-1 were redesignated as XKDD-1 and KDD-1, respectively. Later that year, the Navy changed McDonnell's manufacturer code letter from \\"D\\" - which had been shared with Douglas Aircraft - to \\"H\\", the KDD-1 being again redesignated, as KDH-1.

The museum is fully accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.  Museum history  = 1913-1957: Early years = The Morris Children's Museum was founded in 1913 as a collection of curio cabinets held in the Neighborhood House School in Morristown, New Jersey. In 1922, the Neighborhood House expanded to include an abandoned macaroni factory next to the original school. The Children's Museum continued to grow, eventually taking up two rooms of the factory. In 1938, with approval from the Morristown Board of Education, the museum moved to the Maple Avenue School. The collections of stuffed birds, toys, fossils, and various other articles were housed on the third floor. The museum was officially incorporated in 1943, and began loaning out exhibits to local schools and libraries. Previously a volunteer-based organization, the museum hired its first director, Chester H. Newkirk, in 1956. The museum continued to acquire more collections, opening a Native American exhibit in 1949. The museum expanded in 1957, purchasing and relocating to 141 Madison Avenue. The museum also changed its name from the \\"Morris Children's Museum\\" to the \\"Morris Junior Museum\\". = 1957-present day = In 1963 the Morris Junior Museum purchased the Twin Oaks Mansion, today the current site of the museum. The mansion was previously owned by the Frelinghuysen family, a political family and members of the New York social scene. Constructed between 1910 and 1913, the Neo-Georgian mansion features frieze work that is still intact to this day. The new museum reopened its doors in 1965, then expanded in 1969 adding several galleries and a theater to the museum property. With this expansion came another name change, this time to the \\"Morris Museum of Arts and Sciences\\". The museum was officially accredited by the American Association of Museums in 1972. Due to increasing financial demands, the museum added an entrance fee in 1976. The museum changed its name again in 1985, taking its current name, the Morris Museum. The museum saw another expansion in 1989 with work finishing in 1990. The museum now encompasses 75,524 square feet, with several permanent collections and an active theater.  Exhibits and collections  The Morris Museum has several permanent exhibits, with collections focusing on local wildlife, musical boxes, automata and history. These include a fossil exhibit, a natural science exhibit, minerals, textiles, a Native American collection, and a model train room. There is also the Dodge Room dedicated to Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, a philanthropist and Morristown resident. The room features several paintings and sculptures relating to Dodge's philanthropy, especially surrounding her work with animals. Throughout the year, temporary and traveling exhibits can also be viewed, including several art galleries featuring local and enrolled student artists. The museum has several outreach programs, including a loan program for local educators. = Murtogh D. Guinness Collection = The museum was awarded the Murtogh D. Guinness Collection in 2003. The exhibit opened in 2007 and covers . The permanent exhibit displays 150 pieces, while the overall collection consists of 750 pieces of mechanical musical instruments and automata. Various pieces not currently on display are displayed in visible storage found in the museum's basement. A daily demonstration of the automata and music boxes is offered every day at 2:00 pm. A bi-yearly convention, AutomaCon, began at the museum in 2016. The convention centers around automata and their creation, and was hosted by the museum again in 2018. = Kinetic Art = In 2017 the museum announced its four-year exhibition series, \\"A Cache of Kinetic Art\\" focusing on kinetic and moving art. The exhibits feature art from new and established artists from around the world. The series opened in spring of 2018 with the \\"Curious Characters\\" exhibition, which focused on the expression of distinctive figural forms, from traditional to abstract.

Overview Ever since Stephen Hawking suggested information is lost in an evaporating black hole once it passes through the event horizon and is inevitably destroyed at the singularity, and that this can turn pure quantum states into mixed states, some physicists have wondered if a complete theory of quantum gravity might be able to conserve information with a unitary time evolution. But how can this be possible if information cannot escape the event horizon without traveling faster than light? This seems to rule out Hawking radiation as the carrier of the missing information. It also appears as if information cannot be \\"reflected\\" at the event horizon as there is nothing special about it locally. Leonard Susskind proposed a radical resolution to this problem by claiming that the information is both reflected at the event horizon and passes through the event horizon and cannot escape, with the catch being no observer can confirm both stories simultaneously. According to an external observer, the infinite time dilation at the horizon itself makes it appear as if it takes an infinite amount of time to reach the horizon. He also postulated a stretched horizon, which is a membrane hovering about a Planck length outside the event horizon and which is both physical and hot. According to the external observer, infalling information heats up the stretched horizon, which then reradiates it as Hawking radiation, with the entire evolution being unitary. However, according to an infalling observer, nothing special happens at the event horizon itself, and both the observer and the information will hit the singularity. This isn't to say there are two copies of the information lying about ‚Äî one at or just outside the horizon, and the other inside the black hole ‚Äî as that would violate the no cloning theorem. Instead, an observer can only detect the information at the horizon itself, or inside, but never both simultaneously. Complementarity is a feature of the quantum mechanics of noncommuting observables, and Susskind proposed that both stories are complementary in the quantum sense. An infalling observer will see the point of entry of the information as being localized on the event horizon, while an external observer will notice the information being spread out uniformly over the entire stretched horizon before being re- radiated. To an infalling observer, information and entropy pass through the horizon with nothing strange happening. To an external observer, the information and entropy is absorbed into the stretched horizon which acts like a dissipative fluid with entropy, viscosity and electrical conductivity. See the membrane paradigm for more details. The stretched horizon is conducting with surface charges which rapidly spread out over the horizon. Recently, it appears that black hole complementarity combined with the monogamy of entanglement suggests the existence of a \\"firewall\\".

He made his in-ring debut in late 2009. In early 2010, Andrews formed an alliance and tag team with Curt Hawkins, with the pair debuting as a tag team on February 18 by defeating The South Beach Boys (Darren Young and Percy Watson). The two began feuding with Hawkins' former stablemates The Dude Busters (Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta), who Hawkins had abandoned to ally with Andrews. Andrews went on to defeat both Croft and Barreta in singles matches in March. Over the next few months, Andrews and Hawkins went on to face The Rotundo Brothers (Bo and Duke), and the team of Eli Cottonwood and Wes Brisco. In November and December, Andrews appeared at several WWE house shows, losing to Goldust and defeating JTG.

Southern Cross 1932, price new ¬£225 The Triumph Super 9 was first introduced by the Triumph Motor Company in 1931 at a price of ¬£185. It continued through into 1933. It had an RAC rating of 8.9 hp. The Super 9‚Äòs were the first Triumphs to use 12-volt electrics (early Southern Cross‚Äôs still used 6-volt for a short period) and the first to be fitted with a Coventry Climax engine, which was made under licence by Triumph. Two 6-volt batteries were housed under the rear passenger floor, while the prototype had a single 12-volt battery on the bulk head. Many of the chassis and transmission components were left overs from the Super 7‚Äôs and 8‚Äôs. Engine The Coventry Climax engines are of the IOE configuration, with a bore of 60 mm and a stroke of 90 mm, giving 1018 cc. Generally a Solex side-draught carburettor was fitted. During 1931 the rear of the engine was supported on a 3/16-inch steel plate spanning across the chassis, consequently the gearbox bell housing was deep and with the starter alongside. Later cars had a cast-iron flywheel housing and a much shallower bell housing, the starter was then repositioned alongside the engine. This arrangement was used on later Super 9s & 10‚Äôs and on Glorias. The cooling water is circulated by thermal syphon aided by the sloping shape of the aluminium water manifold on the head. The dynamo is driven by a Duplex chain with the distributor mounted at the rear end of the dynamo. A top speed of 60 mph was obtainable with a cruising speed of 45 mph. Petrol consumption in the region of 35 mpg for a car weighing 19 cwt. unladen. Steering Steering is by worm and wheel, the drop shaft attached to the wheel is on three keyways so it can be turned through 120 deg. to compensate for wear. Also adjustment is provided for engagement of the worm to the wheel. Transmission and suspension Transmission is through a single -inch clutch plate along with a 4-speed-and-reverse gear box. The hand brake operated a transmission brake attached to the rear end of the gear box. A conventional Hardy Spicer prop shaft connected it to the axle. The rear axle is a worm and wheel with underslung worm, making for a low floor. Ratios 5.25, 5.75, 6.25/1. The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic acting on -inch drums with one leading and one trailing shoe on all 4 wheels. The petrol tank is at the rear, unlike Super 7‚Äôs which had a gravity tank. Fuel was pumped either by Autovac or SU Petrolift. Suspension consists of 4 semi-elliptic springs on rubber bushes damped by Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers. Cars after 1931 replaced the rubber bushes with bronze bushes and grease nipples. Wheels were of the Magnum type with 5 studs fitted with 4.50√ó19-inch pneumatic tyres. The car had a track of 3 ft in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in. Bodies There were three significant models on the same chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A sliding sun roof was standard, operated by a rotating handle above the driver. Folding rear arm rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings. Accessories Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system. The upholstery was leather cloth with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype; this also has a smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9‚Äôs. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, oil gauge and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a dash light, interior light, ignition, and a starter button, also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing were all at the centre of the steering wheel.

Settlers arrived about 1847, a number to work in the iron ore beds of Sharon Station. The Immaculate Conception parish in Amenia, originally included the parishes currently in Dover Plains, Pawling, Pine Plains and Millbrook. Parish records indicate that in 1844 the first priest known to attend the sick and say an occasional Mass in the area of Northeast and Amenia was Fr. Riordan of St. Peter's Church, Poughkeepsie. In Amenia, he first celebrated Mass in the home of Thomas McEnroe. Then, in 1859 Father Charles Slavin became responsible for early Catholics here by being given charge of the whole Harlem Valley. He resided at Dover Plains and built the church there. Fr. John Arsenigo followed him, in 1864, living at Croton Falls. He used to say Mass in the sheds at the railroad station in Amenia and in homes around Millerton. It was he who purchased the land and started to build the churches in Amenia and Millerton. During the pastorate of Fr. Orsenigo, masses were held in private homes around the village while preparations were made to build a church. Fr. Tandy became the first resident pastor in 1864 and established the first Immaculate Conception Church in 1868 presiding over the additional missions in Pawling, Dover Plains, Millerton and Millbrook for twelve years. According to his diary, Fr. Tandy was forced to resign in 1880 \\"under the strain of so many outlying missions\\"; a complaint which was echoed by many of the succeeding pastors.LaMorte, Rev.

For example, many Sunni ulema educated in the Chishti Order were educated in Delhi, where the tomb of Nizamuddin Auliya is and where his students are well established. Movements within the ulema, such as the Deobandi or Barelvi movements, are so named because they are associated with particularly influential seminaries and madrassahs (like the Darul Uloom Deoband in Deoband, or the Urs-e-Razavi in Bareilly, the latter of which is so named because it is located at the rauza of Imam Ahmad Raza Khan).

Completed in 1958, the building was the first commission of the noted Japanese-American architect Minoru Yamasaki marking his shift from traditional International Style to a style known as the New Formalism. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architecture in 2015. History McGregor Center Atrium The McGregor Memorial Conference Center was funded by the McGregor Fund, as a memorial to Tracy W. and Katherine McGregor who initiated the fund in 1925. The McGregor Fund specified that the building be used as \\"a community conference center for groups of citizens interested in exploring ways and means of being helpful to others.\\" To that end, Wayne State University hired architect Minoru Yamasaki in August 1955 to design the building. The commission came after Yamasaki's long convalescence and subsequent trip to Japan, and was his first opportunity to put into practice his re-envisionment of architecture. The Center was completed in 1958, and opened to immediate accolades from architectural magazines who called it \\"delightful\\" and \\"refreshing,\\" and from the American Institute of Architects who awarded Yamasaki a First Honor Award for the design. Over the next seven years, Yamasaki designed three more buildings for Wayne's campus: the Education Building, Prentis Hall, and DeRoy Auditorium. Description The McGregor Memorial Conference Center is a two-story symmetrical pavilion covered with travertine marble. It sits on a podium faced with Mankato stone, with integral reflecting pool and sunken garden wrapping around the building on two sides. The building exhibits a triangular design motif on the outside and inside. Inside, a skylit entry hall, dividing the interior space in two, is flanked by two levels of conference rooms. The McGregor Center contains 11 meeting rooms, a 600-seat auditorium, a reception area, and a exhibit space. The conference rooms can be combined to accommodate groups of various sizes.

It is the second oldest Catholic Church on the Hudson (after St. Mary's in Albany) and is considered the Mother Church of the Hudson Valley because from it all the parishes in Ulster and Dutchess counties were founded. The church is also referred to as Our Lady of Mount Carmel since 1965 when St. Peter's parish relocated to Hyde Park, New York and the parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel church (located a block away) relocated to site. History =Congregation of the Hudson= Twenty-two years after the Diocese of New York was founded in 1808, Bishop John DuBois, in 1830, authorized a Dominican, Father Phillip O‚ÄôReilly to establish parishes on the Hudson River north of Manhattan Island. The first congregation he ministered to was the small group of 28 Irish-born Catholic families, who on October 14, 1831 were organized as the Congregation on the Hudson. Philip O'Reilly O.P. was stationed at Newburgh, New York from 1830 to 1832 and would visit Poughkeepsie once a month in summer. Fr. Patrick Duffy was pastor of Paterson, New Jersey from 1823‚Äì1836, when he was sent first to Our Lady of Loretto in Cold Spring. From there he served congregations in West Point, Cold Spring, Newburgh, Saugerties, Rondout, and Poughkeepsie. When the house of Robert Belton became too small for the number attending, Mass was celebrated in the old brewery, near the Lower Landing at Pine Street. And later at the Hibbasus' hall on Market Street near Jay Street.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X.

(New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p. 426 =St. Peter's Church= By 1825 emigrants from Ireland were numerous enough in Poughkeepsie to form a well defined segment of the population. In 1837 a church building was erected on land donated by Peter Everett. When some bigoted individuals threatened to burn it down, a vigilance committee, made up of Catholics and Protestants, was formed to defend it. Dr. Pyne, a non-Catholic offered the defenders the loan of a small cannon. There was no further trouble. The church was dedicated by Bishop DuBois on November 26, 1837. The pastor at that time was Rev. Patrick Duffy, who was then transferred to Newburgh. Rev. John McGinnis succeeded Duffy. The missions at Saugerties and Rondout were made dependencies of St. Peter's with expectation that each would be attended at least once a month. In 1839 McGinnis was succeeded by Rev. John N. Smith. It was Smith who erected a small frame church at Rondout. He also made trips to Rosendale. In 1842 Smith was assigned to St. James in New York, and Rev. Myles Maxwell became pastor at St. Peter's. Smith died in February 1848, having contracted ship's fever while attending the deathbed of Father Mark Murphy who had been ministering to immigrants at the quarantine station on Staten Island.Burtsell, Richard Lalor. \\"The Roman Catholic Church\\", Clearwater, Alphonso Trumpbour.

The Apostolic Nuncio from Washington and Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York attended the dedication. Removed during subsequent renovation, they were discovered when Our Lady of Mount Carmel assumed occupancy of Old St. Peter's and restored.

Mission churches In those early days, the spiritual needs of the local Catholic community were met by priests riding circuit out of St. Peter‚Äôs in Poughkeepsie. Father Maginnis (1837) was pastor not only of all Dutchess County, but also of Rondout and Saugerties across the river. By 1840 St. Peter‚Äôs parish also included mission churches in Sylvan Lake and New Hamburg.

St. Peter's School St. Peter's School was established 166 years ago when Father Michael Riordan, Pastor of St. Peter's Church, saw a need for Catholic education in the Poughkeepsie area. The school was established in the basement of the Church, which was then on Mill Street in Poughkeepsie. By 1860, there was a great need to expand. It was around that time that the Sisters of Charity of Mount St. Vincent arrived to take charge of the girls' school on Clove St. In 1869, a boys' school was established across the street. In 1914 there were 325 boys enrolled in the school taught by five Marist Brothers, and 310 girls at the girls' school taught by six Sisters of Charity. In 1965, the school was relocated to its present location on Violet Avenue, where it remains to this day.St. Peter's School St. Peter's Cemetery Old St.Peter's Churchyard was located in the city of Poughkeepsie, NY on the east side of East Mansion St. and was in use from 1841 to 1884. The burying ground an East Mansion street, a parochial cemetery, was the resting place of a number of the first generation of Irish Immigrants to this locality. Subsequently, a second St. Peter's Cemetery was established on Salt Point Rd. in Poughkeepsie. =Celtic cross= On a prominent rise overlooking St. Peter's Cemetery is a World War I monument in memory of over 100 local men who served in World War I. The Celtic cross was originally built in 1917 of pre-cast concrete. By 1993 it was so badly deteriorated that it was dismantled and replaced the following year by one of solid granite approximately 30 feet tall.

The chapel is located on the grounds of the former Hudson River State Hospital and was a gift to the archdiocese by the Smith Brothers (of cough drop fame), in memory of their sister, Sister Mary Loretta Smith R.S.M. It was designed and built by Father John Casey S.J. in 1906. The altar is Carrara marble. The stained glass windows depicting the life of Mary and Jesus are all Lafarge, a prot√©g√© of Tiffany. The ceiling arches and pews are all hand-hewn oak. The Baptistery and Pulpit are from an 1880 Church in Philadelphia in which Mother Saint Katherine Drexel was baptized.

It is located in the center of a hollow with winding roads and a stone bridge all designed by the famous New York City Central Park architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The chapel has a seating capacity of about 400. All the statues and stations of the cross were created the year the chapel was built in 1906. The vacant chapel was ready for demolition in 1999 when Rev. James Garisto advocated for the NY Archdiocese to purchase the property located on the grounds of the old abandoned psychiatric hospital.

In those days, the spiritual needs of the local Catholic community were met by priests riding circuit out of St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie, which was founded in 1837. Tradition names Father Miles Maxwell as one of the first priests to minister to Catholics in the vicinity of Wappingers Falls. At that time, Mass was offered about once a month at the home of Mr. John Murray on Clinton Street near Pells Place. In 1841, a small frame church was built. Other priests who came into the Wappingers Falls area were Father Farrell, Father Sullivan, Father John Smith, and Father Michael Riordan, pastor of St. Peter's.History of St.Mary's In the summer of 1844 Father Sylvester Malone celebrated his first Mass in the mission church of St. Mary's.Malone, Sylvester.

In 1845 a parish, known as St. Mary's of Channingville, was founded to serve southern Dutchess County. In 1846 the Clinton Mill at Wappingers Falls was in the process of being built and soon after, the Hudson River Railroad was begun through this locality. These enterprises attracted many Irish and Italian immigrants to the area both as employees in the mill and as laborers on the railroad. Cholera was prevalent among the railroad workers and the presence of a resident priest became increasingly important. Archbishop John Hughes of New York sent Father J. Scollon. Being called to High Point (New Hamburg), Father Scollon labored unceasingly to relieve the sick and the dying. Father Scollon's tireless service during his year-and-a-half stay at St. Mary‚Äôs impressed itself upon the hearts and memories of the community. Rev. George Brophy was assigned as the first resident pastor in 1850. Mission parishes St.Mary's began as a mission church of St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie,Hasbrouck, Frank, ed.

George Brophy's parish extended from Poughkeepsie to Cold Spring. As pastor, Father Brophy divided his labors among St. Mary‚Äôs Wappingers, the ore beds at Sylvan Lake in Beekman, and Fishkill Landing. Anyone who wished to hear Mass more than once a month had to travel to where the priest was that week. People wishing to receive Communion had to fast from midnight and folks coming in from Sylvan Lake often brought a loaf of bread in their pockets to sustain them on the long way home. Rev. Denis Sheehan succeeded Father Brophy as pastor of Wappingers Falls, Fishkill Village, Sylvan Lake and the Beekman area in 1853. He was also responsible for ministering to the mission parishes in Fishkill Landing and Matteawan until the foundation in 1857 of what eventually became St. Joachim's in Beacon. It is reported that in winter, priests from Wappinger used to walk across the frozen Hudson River to say Mass in Marlboro and Milton. =19th century= Denis Sheehan was a great temperance man and organized St. Mary's Total Abstinence and Benefit Society which had a membership of 175 by the time of his death. This was a period of great growth in Wappinger and saw the founding of the first newspaper, the library, Drake School (the present VFW Hall), the Garner and Johnson Fire Companies, the establishment of Sweet Orr and Company, eighteen saloons, and the incorporation of the village. Father Sheehan died on October 27, 1875 and was buried in St. Mary's cemetery. On the day of his funeral, all the factories in Wappinger closed down and everyone turned out to honor him, including officials of the Garner Print Works. In July 1876, Father Charles M. O'Keeffe took charge of the parish and began construction of a new church to replace the original structure, which despite repeated additions, had become too small for the growing congregation. The excavation of the cellar was done by men of the parish under the leadership of Mr. James Campbell, a stonemason. Much of the stone was taken from a small quarry on Fulton Street. In appreciation, Father O'Keeffe placed their names in the cornerstone of the church with other records. The cornerstone was laid Saturday, September 27, 1877 by Cardinal John McCloskey. A popular and gifted administrator, O'Keeffe was elected a director of the Wappingers Savings Bank on January 26, 1877, second Vice President in January 1878, and first vice president in January 1880, a position he held until being transferred in 1885 to St. Charles Borromeo in New York City. The parish's certificate of incorporation was given on November 15, 1883. The first lay trustees were Peter Downey and William T. O'Rourke. Michael Power Fathers Sheehan, O'Keefe, and Mahoney were assisted by Father Michael C. Power from Cork, Ireland. Power had been pastor in Saugerties from 1852 to 1878, where he served the people working in the stone quarries. He built a church at Quarryville, where it was not uncommon to find one hundred men led by their foreman, marching eight to ten miles to attend Mass. In 1878 Father Power retired to Wappingers Falls to help his friend and classmate, Father Sheehan.Burtsell, Richard Lalor. \\"The Roman Catholic Church\\", Clearwater, Alphonso Trumpbour. The History of Ulster County, New York, W. J. Van Deusen, 1907 - Ulster County (N.Y.) Father Power served as a missionary priest to families in Stoneco and other outlying areas. He made quite an impression on his rounds, riding in on his horse from Sylvan Lake with his black cape billowing behind him. Father Power owned a tract of land on West Main Street just south of the Wappingers Rural Cemetery. This land, known as Power's Park, was enclosed by a board fence and contained a grandstand from which spectators could watch bicycle races which were run on a 1/4 mile track. This park was also the home field of the Wappingers Monitors baseball team and was the site of some of Dan Brouthers' most memorable hits. The local Ancient Order of Hibernians held their annual picnic there after they moved from O'Farrell's Point. =20th century= It was during the tenure of Father James Corridan's tenure that Catherine McCloskey had a grotto built between the church and school. Monsignor John J. Loughlin became pastor in 1928 and served for thirty-six years, through the Great Depression and the growth and prosperity that followed World War II. During his tenure, the parish, taking in 18 square miles, grew to about 6,000 parishioners. Monsignor Loughlin died on November 17, 1964 at the age of ninety. Loughlin had been chaplain of the Knights of Columbus for thirty-six years. When the Knights relocated from the old K of C building on West Main Street to the former Central Hudson Gas and Electric Co. building at the east end of the bridge, they dedicated the new meeting hall to Monsignor Loughlin. Rev. Monsignor Charles B. Brennan was next appointed pastor of St. Mary's. When he first came to Wappinger, Monsignor's duties as chief chaplain for the 42nd Infantry (Rainbow) Division necessitated his commuting to New York City for drills and Sunday Masses in the division's armory at 34th and Park Avenue. Prior to becoming division chaplain with the rank of lieutenant colonel, Monsignor Brennan served in the Pacific with the 25th division and was awarded the Bronze Star. As pastor of Our Lady of Loretto on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he became well known for his work on behalf of homeless men at the Holy Name Center on Bleecker Street. Monsignor also served for a time as Archdiocesan Director of the Holy Name Societies. The church endured a renovation during the latter 20th century which involved major changes to the sanctuary including the removal of the high altar and altar rail. =21st century= Monsignor Francis Bellew saw the church move into the 21st century and raised funds to for a further extensive renovation in 2001 shortly after the parish celebrated its 150th anniversary. Under Fr. James Cruz, the school was incorporated in the Archdiocesan Regional System and the growing Spanish- speaking community of Wappingers Falls was integrated into parish life with liturgies and catechetical programs. Description The church is English Gothic in design with finely worked North River blue stone trim and was built at a cost of approximately $30,000. When constructed, its spire was 145 feet high, but it was struck by lightning in 1894 and later replaced by a crown. Father O'Keeffe donated the stained glass nativity scene above the main altar. The rose window above the choir loft was donated by St. Mary's Temperance Society. Pastors * Rev. Sullivan (1841-1850)Archer, Edward D., History of St.Joachim-St. John the Evangelist (2007) * Rev.

Kumar was appointed as the national men's team captain in October 2016 at the age of 22. He bats right-handed and bowls right-arm off spin. After representing the country at the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in January, Kumar made his One Day International debut the following month, becoming the second-youngest player in the history of ODIs. When Canada participated in the 2011 World Cup Kumar became the youngest player to feature in the tournament. He played his first Twenty20 International in March 2012. Career On 14 August 2009 Nitish Kumar played in his maiden first-class match, debuting in the same match as teammate Jimmy Hansra. The match was part of the 2009‚Äì10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, and in the first innings against Kenya, Kumar made 12 runs before he was dismissed while in the second innings was out first ball. Kumar made his One Day International debut six months later in February 2010 against Afghanistan, becoming the second youngest ODI player. In January 2010, Kumar represented Canada in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup hosted by New Zealand. The team finished in 11th place out of 16 teams. Canada's participation in the 2009‚Äì10 ICC Intercontinental Cup concluded in September 2010, when they finished bottom of the seven-team group stage. Kumar played in four Cup matches, amassing 117 runs with a highest score of 74 against Afghanistan (the eventual Cup winners). Canada qualified for the 2011 World Cup held between February and April in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. The 15-man squad included five players under the age of 21 (including Kumar), all of whom had played in the Under-19 World Cup the previous year. At the age of 16 years and 283 days, he became the youngest player ever to play in a World Cup when Canada lost to Zimbabwe on 28 February 2011. As expected Canada failed to progress beyond the group stages of the tournament, but secured a victory against Kenya, the only other non-Test team in their group. In July Ireland hosted the 2011 Under-19 World Cup Qualifier. Canada finished 8th out of ten teams, thereby failing to qualify for the tournament the following year. Kumar was Canada's leading run-scorer in the qualifying tournament, and 4th overall with 370 runs including two centuries from nine matches. His off- breaks also claimed eight scalps at an average of 22.87, making him Canada's 4th-highest wicket taker. Canada's first match of the 2011‚Äì13 ICC Intercontinental Cup took place in August 2011. The World Twenty20 Qualifier was held in March 2012. During Canada's opening match against the Netherlands Kumar was one of thirteen plays to make their debut in Twenty20 Internationals. He was run out for a single. His second match of the tournament was more successful, and he registered his highest score in twenty20 matches (it did not have T20I status) scoring 57 runs from 44 balls to help Canada to a 6-run victory over Papua New Guinea. With 172 runs from 9 matches, Kumar was Canada's second-highest run-scorer in the competition. The 2013 matches of the 2011‚Äì13 ICC Intercontinental Cup offered Kumar further first-class experience, and he bettered his highest score in two consecutive matches. The first, against Kenya in March, saw Kumar score 89 which was the largest contribution to his team's score in the first innings, though Kenya went on to win the match. In August that year Kumar scored his maiden century, this time reaching 103 against the United Arab Emirates. In January 2018, he was named as the captain of Canada's squad for the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Toronto Nationals in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. In September 2018, he was named as the captain of Canada's squad for the 2018‚Äì19 ICC World Twenty20 Americas Qualifier tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker for Canada in the tournament, with eleven dismissals in six matches. In October 2018, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2018‚Äì19 Regional Super50 tournament in the West Indies. In April 2019, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Brampton Wolves franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament.

In September 2019, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2019 Malaysia Cricket World Cup Challenge League A tournament. In October 2019, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Canada won their first three matches of the tournament, with Kumar named as the player of the match in all three fixtures, after scoring three consecutive fifties. He was the leading run-scorer for Canada in the tournament, with 245 runs in six matches. Following the T20 World Cup, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2019‚Äì20 Regional Super50 tournament in the West Indies.

He rose to command a French cavalry regiment and later became a general officer. During the Napoleonic Wars he held important cavalry commands in three of Emperor Napoleon I of France's wars. In the early years of the French Revolution Sahuc was appointed to lead a Chasseurs √† Cheval regiment and later commanded a brigade. Under Napoleon, he commanded a cavalry brigade in the 1805 campaign. During the 1806-7 campaign he led a dragoon division. In 1809, he directed a light cavalry division in Italy and at the Battle of Wagram. For a few years afterward he served as a lawmaker but was recalled up to military duty. He died in the 1813 typhus epidemic in Germany. Sahuc is one of the Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe. Early career Sahuc was born on 7 January 1755 at Mello, Oise in France and joined the army of the Old Regime in 1772. At the beginning of the French Revolution he became an officer in the Army of the North. Later he transferred to the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse and was appointed Chef de brigade (colonel) of the 1st Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment on 10 July 1794. He became a g√©n√©ral de brigade on 21 April 1799 during the War of the Second Coalition. He fought at the Battle of Stockach on 3 May 1800.Mulli√© (1852) 1st Chasseurs √† Cheval At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December, Sahuc was a brigadier in Antoine Richepanse's division. The mounted regiments in the division were the 10th Cavalry, 1st Chasseurs √† Cheval, 20th Chasseurs √† Cheval, and the 5th Hussars. The division also included one battalion of the 14th Light Infantry and the 8th, 27th, and 48th Line Infantry Demi-Brigades.Arnold (2005), p. 275. It's not clear which units were specifically under Sahuc's orders. The 1st Chasseurs led Richepanse's flank attack and engaged in some of the first fighting.Arnold (2005), p. 239-242 Later, Sahuc and his fellow brigadier Jean-Baptiste Drouet were involved in the fighting against Johann Sigismund Riesch's corps. The French scored a decisive victory in the battle.Arnold (2005), p. 245 During the pursuit after Hohenlinden, Richepanse scored successes in a series of actions against the retreating Austrians. At Neumarkt am Wallersee on 16 December, while leading the 48th Line Infantry and the 1st Chasseurs, Sahuc inflicted 500 casualties on the Austrians. At Frankenmarkt on the 17th, the Austrians suffered 2,650 casualties, mostly prisoners. At Schwanenstadt on the 18th, 700 enemy cuirassiers were trapped against a river and taken. That same day at V√∂cklabruck, with Sahuc commanding the 48th Line and 14th Light Infantry plus the 1st and 20th Chasseurs, the French captured Austrian general Franz L√∂pper, two cannons, and many foot soldiers. On the 19th at Lambach, 1,450 troops of the Manfreddini Infantry Regiment No. 12 surrendered and 500 wagons were seized. At Lambach, Sahuc and Jacques Sarrut led the 14th Light and 27th Line Infantry, the 5th Hussars, and the 1st and 20th Chasseurs.Smith (1998), pp. 190-191 Empire Simeon Fort's painting shows a massed cavalry charge.Sahuc fought at the Battle of Eylau. Simeon Fort's painting shows a massed cavalry charge. Sahuc became a member of the Tribunat in 1801 and was an eager supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte, voting to establish the First French Empire. In 1803 he became a chevalier de l'empire, then in 1804, a commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur. In the War of the Third Coalition, he served in a division that included the 15th and 17th Dragoon Regiments, which lost their eagles and many troopers at the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October 1805. The 18th and 19th Dragoons of the division also fought on 14 October 1805 in the Battle of Elchingen.Smith (1998), p. 204 On 2 December 1805, Sahuc fought at the Battle of Austerlitz in Fran√ßois Antoine Louis Bourcier's 4th Dragoon Division. The 2,500-strong division included the 15th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 27th Dragoon Regiments and three cannon. The brigadiers were Sahuc and Jean Baptiste Antoine Laplanche.Duffy (1977), p. 180. Duffy also lists Verdi√®re as a brigadier.Smith (1998), p. 216. Smith omits the 27th Regiment. Napoleon promoted Sahuc to g√©n√©ral de division on 4 January 1806. He went on to serve as commander of the 2,600-strong 4th Dragoon Division during the War of the Fourth Coalition.Petre (1993), p. 176. Petre shows the strength. The division included the 17th and 27th Dragoons in the 1st Brigade, the 18th and 19th Dragoons in the 2nd Brigade, and the 15th and 25th Dragoons in the 3rd Brigade. Laplanche led the 2nd Brigade, while the other two brigadiers are not given in the sources.Chandler, p. 37 His troopers missed the Battle of Jena- Auerstadt because he marched with Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's I Corps.Petre (1993), p. 150 After the battle his division joined Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps for the pursuit.Petre (1993), p. 199 On 1 November his division was at Rathenow moving north to attack Gebhard von Bl√ºcher.Petre, p. 264 His division's strength at this time was estimated at 2,550.Petre, p. 258 On 6 November, Sahuc was present with Soult and Marshal Joachim Murat in the Battle of L√ºbeck where he was at the southeast gate.Petre, p. 275 Once the French seized the gate, the cavalry burst into the streets and helped capture the Owstein Infantry Regiment No. 7.Petre, p. 281 On 25 January, he was present at the Battle of Mohrungen with the 1st and 2nd Brigades.Smith (1998), p. 240 Napoleon appointed him a comte de l'empire in 1808. In 1809 Sahuc fought under Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, shown here by Andrea Appiani. In the War of the Fifth Coalition, Sahuc found himself leading the Light Cavalry Division of the Army of Italy under Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. The division included the 6th Hussars, 6th Chasseurs √† Cheval, 8th Chasseurs √† Cheval, 25th Chasseurs √† Cheval, and a 4-pounder horse artillery battery.Bowden & Tarbox (1980), p. 101 The 6th Hussars were in Sahuc's division in 1809. In the action at Pordenone, Sahuc was badly beaten. He commanded the 4,800-man army advance guard of two cavalry regiments and the 35th Line Infantry Regiment. At 6:00 AM on 15 April 1809, Johann Maria Philipp Frimont led 5,900 Austrians against the town. Sahuc maneuvered his cavalry north of the town but Frimont attacked his horsemen from the flank, routing them. The 35th, trapped in the town, was nearly destroyed with 500 killed and wounded. In addition, 2,000 men, an eagle, and four cannons were captured. The Austrians only reported 253 casualties.Schneid (2002), p. 71-72Smith (1998), p. 286 In the Battle of Sacile on 16 April, Eug√®ne refused to fully commit Sahuc's division because of the Austrian cavalry superiority. After Eug√®ne ordered a retreat, Sahuc demonstrated in front of the Austrians, assisting the withdrawal of the divisions of Paul Grenier and Jean-Baptiste Broussier.Schneid (2002), p. 74 At the Battle of Piave River on 8 May, the cavalry divisions of Sahuc and Charles Randon de Pully crossed the Piave to the right while Joseph Marie, Count Dessaix's converged voltiguer (light infantry) division crossed in the center. The two cavalry divisions drove back Johann Kaln√°ssy's brigade into two villages, then rode to Dessaix's rescue. The light infantry formed square and successfully repelled an Austrian cavalry division, but they were being pounded by a massed battery of 24 cannons.Schneid (2002), p. 80-81 The bombardment caused Dessaix's men serious loss and 20 French guns arrived just in time to reply to the Austrian artillery. In the meantime, Sahuc unwisely posted his division in such a way that some of the cannonballs missing the infantry squares hit his troopers.Arnold (1995), pp. 101-102 The second time the Austrian cavalry attacked, Sahuc's light horse and Pully's dragoons countercharged and routed them. Following up the Austrian cavalry, the French horsemen overran the battery and captured 14 guns.Epstein (1994), p. 91 The Austrian cavalry commander, Christian Wolfskeel von Reichenberg died at the hands of one of Pully's dragoons. After this brilliant success, Sahuc failed to rally his division and a Hungarian countercharge routed the 8th Chasseurs. His other three colonels rose to the occasion and drove off the Hungarians.Arnold (1995), p. 102 With his cavalry rendered impotent, Archduke John of Austria could only mount a passive defense, which resulted in his eventual defeat.Schneid (2002), p. 81-82 When Sahuc participated in the Battle of Raab on 14 June, only the 8th and 25th Chasseurs were present.Bowden & Tarbox (1980), p. 119Smith (1998), p. 315. Smith lists the 6th, 8th, and 9th Chasseurs. While Emmanuel Grouchy and Louis-Pierre Montbrun's cavalry on the right flank defeated the Austrians opposed to them, his division guarded the left. As the Austrian army withdrew at the end of the battle, Sahuc's cavalry launched a pursuit which soon came upon some Hungarian insurrection (militia) infantry formed in squares. Though the raw Hungarians fired a scattered volley, they managed to fend off the first charge because the French horsemen attacked in a disorderly fashion. The second charge was better organized. One Chasseur regiment concentrated on one side of a square and broke through. Furious at their earlier repulse, they butchered the helpless Hungarians without mercy, even cutting down those who tried to surrender.Arnold (1995), p. 112 At the Battle of Wagram, Sahuc led a division consisting of the 6th Chasseurs, 8th Chasseurs, and 9th Chasseurs.Bowden & Tarbox (1980), p. 149 Before crossing the Danube, he gave a bombastic speech to his horsemen.Arnold (1995), p. 122 His cavalry supported the evening attack on 5 July. At first the attack looked promising and Sahuc's chasseurs broke an Austrian battalion. Then the Vincent Chevau-l√©ger Regiment No. 4 caught his horsemen in flank and drove them off. Without cavalry support, the infantry faltered in the face of an Austrian infantry counterattack. The assault ended in failure with the French fleeing back to their starting positions after suffering heavy losses.Schneid (2002), p. 95-96 As dusk came on, Sahuc's troopers countercharged the Austrian cavalry, first firing a volley with their pistols and carbines before wading into them. In the gloom, the white-coated chevau- l√©gers presented obvious targets. Even so, Sahuc lost two of his colonels before the entire French force fell back.Arnold (1995), p. 132 On 6 July, his cavalry guarded the flanks of Jacques MacDonald's famous hollow square as it attacked the Austrian center.Schneid (2002), p. 97 From 1809 to 1812 he served in the Corps l√©gislatif as a deputy from Oise.

Patrick McSweeney, D.D., pastor of St. Peter's, Poughkeepsie purchased a former Universalist church building on Cannon St. The church was dedicated on July 20, 1873 by Cardinal McCloskey, and Father McSweeney's brother, the Rev. Dr. Edward McSweeney was appointed pastor. On May 18, 1886, Rev. Terence J. Earley was appointed pastor of St. Mary's. During his pastorate, John McCann, a feed and grain dealer and a founding member of the parish, deeded his property on South Hamilton Street to St. Mary's, and a Gothic-style church built there was dedicated in 1893.Burger, John, \\"It's a Family, Catholic New York November 13, 1998 A stone which had been removed from Poughkeepsie Bridge, Pier No.2 served as cornerstone, presented by The Bridge Committee. The new church was built and dedicated on October 22, 1893. The church was destroyed by fire in 1968. Msgr. Matthew J. Cox, pastor of St. Mary's from 1970 to 1982, guided the parish through the four-and-a-half-year process of rebuilding. James McCann, whose father had given the land for the church, died a year after the fire. Before his death, the younger McCann, who had been successful in the stock market, set up a philanthropic foundation. One of its first donations was $330,000 for the new church, which was more than matched by parish donations. John J. Gartland, an attorney and president of the foundation, salvaged the baptismal font, the only item from the old church still in use. He and his wife also donated a 34-foot-high mosaic of Christ Triumphant that serves as a backdrop to the altar. Incorporated into the mosaic design are the original church and the Mid-Hudson Bridge, which parishioners see as a symbol of their call to build bridges with others and spread the faith. The work was designed by American artist Lumen Martin Winter, who also sculpted the marble statue in front of the church depicting Mary holding the Christ Child above her head. Pastors School A Sunday school was conducted since the early days of the parish. In 1871, an industrial school for girls was established, which gave instruction in sewing, and was supervised by the ladies of the Sunday School. The parish school was erected on Hamilton Street in 1880, staffed by the Sisters of Charity.Smith, James Hadden, History of Dutchess County with Illustrations and Biographical Sketch, p. 429, Syracuse, D.

In 1897 the Maria of Czenstochan Society was formed, whose members attended St. Peter's on Mill St. In 1900 the societies joined to form their own parish with assistance of Rev. Franz Fabian, pastor of Immaculate Conception, the Polish church at Rondout. The building, a former Baptist church, was purchased from the Germania Singing Society. The first Mass was celebrated on March 17, 1901 by Father Fabian. The following October, Cardinal John Murphy Farley appointed Father Charles Galuzka, Father Fabian's assistant in Rondout, as the first pastor. During his tenure, a building was purchased for a rectory. Father Galuzka was followed by Rev. Ignatius Bialdyga, former pastor of St. Anthony's on Staten Island. In 1914 Rev.

In the story, Kurono is a teenager who feels forced to save a man from a subway train alongside his childhood friend Masaru Kato, but is killed in the process. He is revived by a being known as Gantz and with others is forced to fight aliens hiding in human society. Despite starting as a selfish character who does not care for others, Kurono feels more optimistic when he becomes the leader of the team and starts a romantic relationship with a teenaged girl named Tae Kojima. The character is also present in Gonzo's anime adaptation of the series, live-action films and a CGI film, Gantz: O, where his role and fate highly differ from the original manga. Kurono was created by Oku as a character that would be relatable to manga readers, resulting in his having multiple weaknesses; he is one of Oku's favorite characters, alongside Kato. He was voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and in English by Christopher Ayres. For the live-action films, he was portrayed by Kazunari Ninomiya. Both actors for the anime adaptation stated they enjoyed voicing the character to the point of relating with him. Critical reception to the character has been mixed. While multiple writers who review manga, anime and other media enjoyed his character traits and growth across the series, he has also been found as an unlikable character due to his indifference toward others and preoccupation with sexual relationships. Similarly, Ninomiya's acting has received mixed opinions by critics. Creation and development Hiroya Oku developed Kurono's character with the goal of having manga readers identify with him. He was also created to \\"make a synthesis of the basic conditions for a work of entertainment\\". Oku originally created Kurono as a character who would fit in a college comedy series. To make him the Gantz character readers would identify with, the author gave him traits such as his sense of insecurity, fears and other complexes. Before the manga started serialization, Oku told his assistants that with Kurono's exception, all the major characters from the series would die in order to surprise readers with plot twists. As the series continued, Oku felt that Kurono was his favorite character though he stated it might have been because he was the main character. In the making of the live- action adaptations, he felt that Kazunari Ninomiya fit the image of Kurono well. In another interview, Oku said Masaru Kato was his favorite character based on his heroic traits in contrast to Kurono who he felt was a more flawed character with conflicting thoughts. Gantz: O director Yasushi Kawamura said that as a result of Kato replacing Kurono as the protagonist of the film, he felt unsure of the audience's reaction even if they had not read the original manga. For the live-action series, director Shinsuke Sato said that Ninomiya was perfectly cast for the role, that he visually resembled the manga character and represented the current audience. According to Sato, Kurono goes through some \\"very subtle changes of the heart\\" in the manga and Ninomiya could portray those particular qualities. Kurono's Japanese voice actors were Daisuke Namikawa in the anime and Y≈´ki Kaji in Gantz: O. Namikawa stated that his first impression of Kurono was that of an attractive person. However, once reading his lines while interacting with other characters, Namikawa found Kurono cynical and later stated that Kurono was bold due to how he often spoke his mind. Because such people are rare, he felt that viewers would sympathize with Kurono. Due to the frequency of recurring characters dying in the anime, Namikawa joked to fellow actors if they would stop working together and feared Kurono might also die in the plot. He admitted wishing that Kurono would obtain a power to get through difficult situations, and enjoyed seeing Kurono surviving the action scenes in each story arc. Once doing so, Namikawa felt the character became a hero as well as a \\"great person\\". Despite liking his character, Namikawa felt it was challenging to voice Kurono. alt=Caucasian man with glasses and groomed beard Kurono's English voice actors were Christopher Ayres in the anime series and Lucien Dodge in Gantz: O. Ayres had previously worked with Matt Greenfield of ADV Films dubbing for Megazone 23. Ayres auditioned for Kurono and for Kato, and was given the former role the following day. He originally thought he was going to voice Kato, but the director felt he was more fitting for voicing Kurono, whom Ayres felt was a \\"jerk\\". Initially, most of Ayres's friends told him Kurono was a \\"jerk and an ass\\" which left an sudden impression on him. Greenfield did not want Ayres to know of his character online, instead wishing to learn of Kurono while working on the English dub. Upon working in the Gantz dub, he stated \\"I've always been drawn to anti-heroes and characters with an edge, and Kei is definitely both. I love the fact that he's flawed and makes mistakes [...] Perfect people are so much more boring to play as an actor.\\" He enjoyed working as the character to the point of relating with him. Appearances =In the Gantz manga= Introduced in Gantzs first chapter Kei is a 10th grader who, with his childhood friend, Masaru Kato, is struck by a subway train while trying to help a derelict who had passed out on the tracks. They are subsequently summoned by a being known as Gantz that has power over their lives and periodically enlists them on missions to kill aliens hiding amongst humanity. In the beginning, he is a fairly selfish character, with a penchant for sexual perversity with Kei Kishimoto, and often ends up being the reluctant hero. He lives alone in an apartment complex, as he was not on good terms with his family. Wielding Gantz's advanced weaponry such as a suit that increases his physical strength and a powerful gun, Kurono is able to fight enemy aliens targeted by Gantz, often employing unconventional tactics to great effect. However, Kurono remains depressed when Kishimoto starts caring more about Kato than him. On his third mission, Kurono starts a relationship with a woman but she dies alongside Kato and all of the others, leaving Kurono the sole survivor. Kurono is alone in his next mission in which he kills a large group of aliens, but one survives and kills Kurono's schoolmates in revenge. Kurono manages to save a girl named Tae Kojima and they begin a romantic relationship that gives him a more positive outlook. Kurono starts organizing others on Gantz's missions to avoid casualties, becoming the leader of Tokyo's Gantz Team. His innate skills and physical prowess eventually make him a hero to most of the other members. After building the team into a capable and successful unit and reviving some of his former friends, Kurono retires from the game at the request of his comrades. A group of aliens known as 'vampires' searches for and eventually finds Kurono, killing him. After the first mission of Phase 2 in the Gantz storyline, Kei is revived by Kato but remembers nothing beyond his choice to leave the game. Following another mission, Gantz revives an additional copy of Kurono for Reika, unknown to the others. After meeting the original Kurono, he decides to live with Reika. The original Kurono stays with Tae but both are separated when a new race of aliens invade and occupy the planet, abducting Tae. As the original Kurono searches for Tae, the copy assembles with other Gantz members from across the world who wish to save humanity from the aliens. During one of these fights, Reika dies while saving the copy, leaving him with a death wish; he dies when confronting the aliens responsible for the invasion and the Gantz network. The original Kurono manages to save Tae and a large group of humans from the invaders. However, the aliens demand to face Kurono, having labeled him as the strongest fighter on Earth. Kurono accepts the challenge and thanks to Kato and his other allies, he succeeds in defeating the aliens' champion. Following the final fight, Kurono and Kato are received on Earth as heroes. =In other media= alt=Actor in tuxedo In the anime adaptation of Gantz, Kurono becomes the target of the humans after becoming the sole survivor of the third mission. While trying to calm his new enemies, a duo of killers start taking down the people chosen by Gantz. Kurono defeats both of them but is unable to save the others. Gantz then forces him to face his own death again in the subway, ending the summoning of people to the room in the process. A PlayStation 2 game based on the series features Kurono as a playable character. In the live- action films, Kurono goes through many events from the original manga but is unable to remember Tae following his removal from Gantz's games. Kurono is briefly featured in the CGI film Gantz O facing an alien in the beginning, with both of them dying in the process. He also appears in the ending where it is revealed that Kurono encouraged Kato to abandon Gantz's missions. Reception Multiple reactions to Kurono were given by critics for anime, manga and other media. James Musgrove of IGN found his anime rendition to have ‚Äùall-too-human motivations‚Äù juxtaposed with an emergence of his ‚Äúhidden good side‚Äù as the story progresses, and implied that he was an unconventional protagonist. He praised Chris Ayres's acting on Kurono, finding him one of the anime's best voice actors despite it being one of his early works. In the live-action review, Otaku USA called the character an \\"uneven protagonist\\" similar to how Kurono is portrayed in the manga and praised his connections with Kato and Kishimoto. Despite criticizing his role, the site compared him with comic book character Peter Parker as both had yet to develop themselves. DVDTalk stated that while the character initially was introduced like a \\"jerk\\", he becomes more likable in the anime series as it progressed and liked his interactions with Kishimoto. Anime News Network found Kurono a more- attractive character stating that he \\"may be one of the freshest and most interesting anime protagonists of the past few years\\" and that he becomes more interesting across the action scenes, making his relationship with Masaru Kato better received. The anime's exclusive last story arc was noted to make Kurono a more-appealing individual. Fandom Post noted the contrast between the pacifist Kato and the berserker Kurono as the latter does not care about killing enemy aliens and ends up going through an entertaining growth during the final arc where he rejects being forced to fight human beings. Mania Entertainment stated that Kurono has \\"halfway decent hero material wrapped up in a slimeball package\\" for how he manages to fight his enemies based on his own childhood when he was used to face multiple challenges. However, Mania still stated that his portrayal of sexual desires might scare young viewers. The character also received a large number of negative comments. AnimeFringe described Kurono as \\"the token angst-filled high school student\\" and criticized his focus on puberty, finding Masaru Kato much more likable due to their differences. In a following review, the site also criticized Kurono's concerns shown in the anime series to the point that the reviewers might lose interest in the series. THEM Anime Reviews similarly found Kurono to be an unlikable character, described him as a \\"soulless monster\\" and went on to say \\"he's mean, extremely selfish, very cynical, and you almost get the feeling he's happy that way, or at least unapologetic. There is no fall from grace; he's already fallen, and has no desire to get back out.\\" A noted example was his inaction when Kei Kishimoto is nearly violated by a gangster in contrast with Kato who tries to save her. Another review from the site noted that despite Kurono's character arc across the series, his changes are brief and Kato was more likable. Anime News Network felt that while Kurono underwent multiple personality changes across the manga, the site stated Oku lacked the talent to make it appealing and heavily criticized his overshadowing relationships with secondary characters. Critics have also commented on Kurono's role across the live-action films. While noting that Kurono goes through a notable arc in the live-actions, Hobby Consolas found Ninomiya's acting too forced and at the same time his appearance was noted to lack Kurono's physical traits. UK Anime Network praised Kazunari Ninomiya's acting in the second live-action film which manages to make the character more appealing. While finding Kurono more likable than his manga persona based on his growth across the first film and his romantic relationship, Anime News Network stated that fans might miss his original character traits. However, for the second film, another writer for the site said he enjoyed Kurono's growth alongside his relationship with Tae. Japanator agreed with his comments regarding Ninomiya's role due to the notable growth he makes while also finding the actor attractive. Twitch Film stated that Ninomiya is a \\"standout\\" for the way he portrays Kurono's character development across the first film. The Japan Times found the relationship between Kurono and Tae simple, referring to them as \\"a hero (Kei) saving his princess (Tae) from the dragon (the black-clads).\\" References Gantz Fictional bounty hunters Comics characters introduced in 2000 Fictional mass murderers Male characters in anime and manga Teenage characters in anime and manga ","title":"Kei Kurono"},{"id":"30260124","text":"Matt Tee is the Chief Executive of the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

Randolph, 531 U.S. 79 (2000), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court. The case dealt with the enforceability of arbitration agreements that did not discuss the cost of the arbitration itself and with the finality of certain arbitration decisions. Background Larketta Randolph purchased a mobile home from Better Cents Home Builders, Inc., in Opelika, Alabama. This was financed through Green Tree Financial Corporation and its subsidiary, Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama. Randolph's Manufactured Home Retail Installment Contract and Security Agreement required that Randolph buy a specific type of insurance and that disputes about this provision would have to be settled by arbitration.531 U.S. 79 at 83 Randolph sued and sought a formal trial and not arbitration. However, Green Tree Financial Corporation asked the District Court to compel arbitration.531 U.S. 79 at 84 The District Court granted that motion to compel arbitration and Randolph appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit made two rulings. Firstly, it held that under the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the District Court was a \\"final decision\\", thus giving the appellate court jurisdiction. Secondly it held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was silent with respect to the payment of filing fees, arbitrators' costs and other arbitration- related expenses. Because the agreement would therefore force Randolph to pay the \\"steep\\" arbitration costs,531 U.S. 79 at 84-85 and thus was unfair and invalid. It was this point on which the Supreme Court split when they heard the appeal in 2000. Opinion of the Court Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court unanimously upheld the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to hear the case, saying that the order compelling Randolph into arbitration was a \\"final decision\\". However, the Court divided on whether the arbitration agreement was enforceable even when it was silent on arbitration costs and fees. Writing for the majority, Rehnquist wrote that \\"[a]lthough the existence of large arbitration costs may well preclude a litigant...from effectively vindicating [her statutory rights], the record does not show that Randolph will bear such costs if she goes to arbitration.\\"531 U.S. 79 at 91-92 =Dissent= Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a brief opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, arguing that the fact that Randolph had no idea how much the arbitration proceedings could cost her would cause the agreement to be unenforceable. The majority, in disagreeing, remanded the case back to the Eleventh Circuit with instructions to find the agreement valid under law. Subsequent History The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the original finding that Randolph was forced to go into arbitration.244 F.3d 814 (2001) Because the Supreme Court had upheld the provision of the arbitration agreement that was silent on the costs of arbitration proceedings, there was no way to vacate the initial judge's decision.

His brother is the footballer Juan Manuel Mart√≠nez. Club career Martinez was formed in the youth system of V√©lez Sarfield, in 2008 he was loaned to Almirante Brown a team in third category of Argentina. In 2009, he joined Independiente but he did not make his first team debut until the year 2010. On 19 December 2010, Mart√≠nez scored in 4‚Äì2 victory over Defensor Sporting in the Copa Sudamericana 2010, helping Independiente advance to the quarter finals. In 2011, he left Independiente and signed with Santiago Wanderers of Chile. In Santiago Wanderers is overshadowed by Tressor Moreno who held the same post in the field. The departure of the Colombian player gave him the chance to play a vital role for the club in Apertura 2012. When the year ends Santiago Wanderers did not take advantage of the purchase option and Martinez returned to Independiente. On August 1, 2012 is signed to Real Murcia. It started well gaining his role in the starting XI. In his second day in the club at Estadio El Molinon against Sporting Gijon scored a wonderful goal putting his name in the scoreboard. This match was eventually won by Real Murcia, but gradually the club lost the title. Eventually during the season lost his place and remained on the bench. He concluded his contract with the club on July 2013. On August 8, 2013 he signed for a year contract with San Mart√≠n de San Juan. =Panetolikos= On January 17, 2014 he signed a contract with Panetolikos and will play at Greek Super League till the summer of 2015. On September 2014, Martinez expands his contract with the club till the summer of 2016. The 27-year-old Argentine playmaker has been in excellent form since the start of the 2014/15 season and AEK are chasing his signature. AEK will consider to make a bid after the end of the season and the possibility of completing this transfer is highly likely as the two clubs share an amicable relationship. Branco Milovanovic, AEK's technical director, is in contact with Martinez's agent and it is likely that an offer to land Panetolikos attacking midfielder is on the cards. On the other hand, the Argentinian midfielder is linked with the Greek champion Olympiakos.According to Goal newspaper Panetolikos have accepted a bid in the region of ‚Ç¨600,000, as Olympiakos manager Vitor Pereira is a big admirer of Martinez. =Olympiacos= On 2 July 2015, Martinez signed a 4 years' contract with Greek champions Olympiakos for over ‚Ç¨600,000. Loan to Anorthosis A month after he signed a year contract for Cypriot First Division club Anorthosis Famagusta on loan from Olympiakos. Negotiations between the two clubs had finalized with media reports suggesting that the player will spend the season on loan at the club and that Anorthosis Famagusta FC will foot ‚Ç¨200,000 of his ‚Ç¨350,000 per year salary. According to club sources, a player of Martinez's quality was what was missing last season when Anorthosis Famagusta just about missed out on Europe after finish fifth at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. He finished the year as the udisputable leader of the club, but they still finish fifth. Loan to Western Sydney Wanderers On 31 August 2016, in the last day of the summer transfer window, Western Sydney Wanderers have reportedly come to terms with 28-year-old Argentinian attacking midfielder and signed him on a long season loan from Greek Super League club Olympiakos. As part of the loan deal with Western Sydney sources say that out of his current wages of $563,000 a season, the Wanderers have agreed to pay about $266,000 while Olympiakos will foot the remainder. Tony Popovic the coach of the club has placed his faith after signing on loan from Olympiakos. ‚ÄúWhen I came here the other players had been training for two months ‚Äì I had quickly to get used to the players and the intensity. Here they work very hard, it‚Äôs not like in South America where sometimes if you are not fit you can still play football.

Elsewhere similar practices are referred to as \\"pulling a fast one\\". Successfully pulling a stroke is often seen in a positive light and stroke pullers are often commended or thought of highly, even if the act involved illegal activities or serious rule-bending, and are sometimes seen as loveable rogues. Political Association The act of pulling strokes has a particular association with Irish politicians. For instance the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has a long list of questionable financial deeds to his name, yet maintains a popular public perception amongst many. His ability to survive in political life whilst maintaining high approval ratings, and stepping down as Taoiseach on his own terms quantifies a stroke. County Galway politician Michael Fahy is known publicly as \\"Stroke Fahy\\", or simply \\"the Stroke\\". After being convicted for illegal stroke pulling his popularity actually increased and he topped the polls in the Loughrea electoral area in the 2009 local elections.http://www.independent.ie/national-news/convicted-councillor-stroke- fahy-tops-the-vote-1765362.html Many have even argued that Stroke Fahy was somehow wronged, even though he was convicted of misappropriating County Council funds and attempted theft, for which he served 7 months in jail and was fined ‚Ç¨75,000.

Hull's Trace was the first military road and first federal road in the United States. This segment, the only known extant portion of the Trace, contains the remains of a corduroy road, and is located at approximately 36000 W Jefferson Avenue in Brownstown Charter Township, Michigan. The North Huron River Corduroy Segment of Hull's Trace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History At the beginning of the War of 1812, the United States was concerned about supplying Fort Detroit, then in American hands, and the surrounding Michigan Territory. Since Lake Erie was controlled by British forces, overland supply was the only option. In June and July 1812, troops under the command of General William Hull constructed what became known as \\"Hull's Trace,\\" a military road running from Urbana, Ohio, to Fort Detroit. The section of road represented here was constructed on July 4, 1812. The original trace included a wooden bridge over the Huron River and segment of corduroy road on the north side of the bridge. The corduroy construction stabilized the marshy soil into a usable roadbed. Hull's Trace ran close to both Lake Erie and the Detroit River, making it vulnerable to British attacks from the water. The first land-based skirmish of the war, the Battle of Brownstown, was fought on the road just north of this section of the road. The later battles of Maguaga and Frenchtown were also fought along the trace. At the end of 1815, cognizant of the poor condition of interior roads and the adverse impact it had on the outcome of the War of 1812, General Andrew Jackson suggested building a military road from New Orleans to the Tennessee River. The United States Congress approved Jackson's suggestion in 1816; but work on the New Orleans road was not started until 1817. In 1816, troops began improving the section of Hull's Trace from Detroit to Fort Meigs, making it the first federally supported military road in the United States. Support for these military roads gained steam, and in April 1818, the United States Congress instructed then-Secretary of War John C. Calhoun to form a plan \\"for the purpose of opening and constructing such roads and canals as may deserve and require the aid of the Government with a view to military operations in time of war.\\" Calhoun's plan included the then-ongoing improvement of Hull's Trace from Detroit to Fort Meigs. The trace was renamed the \\"Great Military Road\\". Major General Alexander Macomb was tasked with the work on the roadway. Around 150‚Äì200 soldiers worked to improve the roadway, and 1819 it was in a usable state. By 1822, the difficulties of maintaining the roadway through the low, wet land was apparent when it was \\"almost impossible for wagons (even in good weather)\\" and \\"in the fall and spring it [was] almost impossible to travel it on horseback\\". A replacement roadway was built by the military, inland starting in 1824 and completed in 1829. The route eventually morphed into a civilian road, serving as a major link between Detroit and Toledo. Much of the trace became what is now known as West Jefferson Avenue. The replacement road, called the \\"United States Road\\", the \\"Detroit‚ÄìFrenchtown Road\\" or the \\"Toledo & Detroit Turnpike\\" survives as River Road or US Turnpike in Monroe and Wayne counties.

The island was at the time and up to the early modern era commonly known as Candia after its capital, Candia or Chandax (modern Heraklion). In modern Greek historiography, the period is known as the Venetocracy (, Venetokratia or ŒïŒΩŒµœÑŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±, Enetokratia). The island of Crete had formed part of the Byzantine Empire until 1204, when the Fourth Crusade dissolved the empire and divided its territories amongst the crusader leaders (see Frankokratia). Crete was initially allotted to Boniface of Montferrat, but, unable to enforce his control over the island, he soon sold his rights to Venice. Venetian troops first occupied the island in 1205, but it took until 1212 for it to be secured, especially against the opposition of Venice's rival Genoa. Thereafter, the new colony took shape: the island was divided into six provinces (sestieri) named after the divisions of the city of Venice itself, while the capital Candia was directly subjected to the Commune Veneciarum. The islands of Tinos and Cythera, also under Venetian control, came under the kingdom's purview. In the early 14th century, this division was replaced by four provinces, almost identical to the four modern prefectures. During the first two centuries of Venetian rule, revolts by the native Orthodox Greek population against the Roman Catholic Venetians were frequent, often supported by the Empire of Nicaea. Fourteen revolts are counted between 1207 and the last major uprising, the Revolt of St. Titus in the 1360s, which united the Greeks and the Venetian coloni against the financial exactions of the metropolis. Thereafter, and despite occasional revolts and Turkish raids, the island largely prospered, and Venetian rule opened up a window into the ongoing Italian Renaissance. As a consequence, an artistic and literary revival unparalleled elsewhere in the Greek world took place: the Cretan School of painting, which culminated in the works of El Greco, united Italian and Byzantine forms, and a widespread literature using the local idiom emerged, culminating with the early 17th-century romances Erotokritos and Erophile. After the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571, Crete was Venice's last major overseas possession. The Republic's relative military weakness, coupled with the island's wealth and its strategic location controlling the waterways of the Eastern Mediterranean attracted the attention of the Ottoman Empire. In the long and devastating Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669), the two states fought over the possession of Crete: the Ottomans quickly overran most of the island, but failed to take Candia, which held out, aided by Venetian naval superiority and Ottoman distractions elsewhere, until 1669. Only the three island fortresses of Souda, Gramvousa and Spinalonga remained in Venetian hands. Attempts to recover Candia during the Morean War failed, and these last Venetian outposts were finally taken by the Turks in 1715, during the last Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War. History =Establishment= Venetian conquest of Crete Venice had a long history of trade contact with Crete; the island was one of the numerous cities and islands throughout Greece where the Venetians had enjoyed tax-exempted trade by virtue of repeated imperial chrysobulls, beginning in 1147 (and in turn codifying a practice dating to ) and confirmed as late as 1198 in a treaty with Alexios III Angelos. These same locations were largely allocated to the Republic of Venice in the partition of the Byzantine Empire that followed the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, in April 1204: in addition to the Ionian Islands, the Saronic Gulf islands and the Cyclades, she obtained several coastal outposts on the Greek mainland of interest as bases for her maritime commerce. Finally, on 12 August 1204, the Venetians preempted their traditional rivals, the Genoese, to acquire Crete from Boniface of Montferrat. Boniface had allegedly been promised the island by Alexios IV Angelos, but as he had little use for it, he sold it in exchange for 1,000 silver marks, an annual portion of the island's revenues totalling 10,000 hyperpyra, and the promise of Venetian support for his acquisition of the Kingdom of Thessalonica. Venice's gains were formalized in the Partitio Romaniae a few weeks later. To enforce their claim, the Venetians landed a small force on the offshore island of Spinalonga. The Genoese however, who already had a colony on Crete, moved more quickly: under the command of Enrico Pescatore, Count of Malta, and enjoying the support of the local populace, they soon became masters over the eastern and central portions of the island. A first Venetian attack in summer 1207 under Ranieri Dandolo and Ruggiero Premarino was driven off, and for the next two years, Pescatore ruled the entire island with the exception of a few isolated Venetian garrisons. Pescatore even appealed to the Pope, and attempted to have himself confirmed as the island's king. However, while Venice was determined to capture the island, Pescatore was largely left unsupported by Genoa. In 1209, the Venetians managed to capture Palaiokastro near Candia (Greek Chandax, ŒßŒ¨ŒΩŒ¥Œ±Œæ; modern Heraklion, ŒóœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩ), but it took them until 1212 to evict Pescatore from the island, and the later's lieutenant, Alamanno da Costa, held out even longer. Only on 11 May 1217 did the war with Genoa end in a treaty that left Crete securely in Venetian hands. Rocca al Mare fortress in Heraklion Organization of the Venetian colony Giacomo Tiepolo became the first governor of the new province, with the title of \\"duke of Crete\\" (), based in Candia. To strengthen Venetian control over Crete, Tiepolo suggested the dispatch of colonists from the metropolis; the Venetian colonists would receive land, and in exchange provide military service. The suggestion was approved, and the relevant charter, the , proclaimed on 10 September 1211 at Venice. 132 nobles, who were to serve as knights (milites or cavaleri) and 45 burghers (pedites, sergentes) participated in the first colonization wave that left Venice on 20 March 1212. Three more waves of colonists were sent, in 1222, 1233, and 1252, and immigration continued in a more irregular fashion in later years as well. In total, about 10,000 Venetians are estimated to have moved to Crete during the first century of Venetian rule‚Äîby comparison, Venice itself had a population of at this period. The colonization wave of 1252 also resulted in the establishment of Canea (modern Chania), on the site of the long abandoned ancient city of Kydonia. Venetians used Crete as a center for their profitable eastern trade. Furthermore, they established a feudal state and administered a strict capitalist system for exploiting the island's agricultural produce. Exported products consisted primarily of wheat and sweet wine (malmsey), and to a lesser extend of timber and cheese.Stallsmith (2007)Jacoby (1999) =Age of the Cretan rebellions, 13th‚Äì14th centuries= Venetian rule over Crete proved troubled from the beginning, as it encountered the hostility of the local populace. In the words of the medievalist Kenneth Setton, it required \\"an unceasing vigilance and a large investment in men and money to hold on to the island\\". No fewer than 27 large and small uprisings or conspiracies are documented during Venetian rule. Although the local Greeks, both the noble families and the wider populace, were allowed to keep their own law and property, they resented Latin rule and the strict discrimination between them and the Latin Venetian elite, which monopolized the higher administrative and military posts of the island and reaped most of the benefits of the commerce passing through it. During the early period of Venetian rule, the Venetian colonists consciously maintained themselves apart; until the end of the 13th century, even mixed marriages between native Cretans and Venetians were prohibited. First uprisings Already in 1212, the Hagiostephanites brothers rose in revolt in the Lasithi Plateau, possibly caused by the arrival of the first Venetian colonists, and the expropriation of the Cretan nobles and the Orthodox Church on the island. The rebellion soon spread throughout the eastern part of Crete, capturing the forts of Sitia and Spinalonga, and was only suppressed through the intervention of Marco I Sanudo, the Duke of Naxos. Sanudo and Tiepolo then fell out, and Sanudo attempted to conquer the island for himself. Sanudo enjoyed considerable local support, including the powerful archon Sebastos Skordiles. He even seized Candia, while Tiepolo escaped to the nearby fortress of Temenos disguised as a woman. The arrival of a Venetian fleet allowed Tiepolo to recover the capital, and Sanudo agreed to evacuate the island in exchange for money and provisions; twenty Greek lords who had collaborated with him accompanied him to Naxos. The failure of this first revolt did not reduce Cretan restiveness, however. In 1217, the theft of some horses and pasture land belonging to the Skordiles family by the Venetian rector of Monopari (Venetian Bonrepare), and the failure of the Duke of Crete, Paolo Querini, to provide redress, resulted in the outbreak of a major rebellion, led by the Greek nobles Constantine Skordiles and Michael Melissenos. Based in the two mountainous provinces of Upper Syvritos and Lower Syvritos, the rebels inflicted successive defeats on the Venetian troops, and the uprising soon spread across the entire western part of the island. As force proved unable to quell the rebellion, the Venetians resorted to negotiations. On 13 September 1219, the Duke of Crete, Domenico Delfino, and the rebel leaders concluded a treaty that gave the latter knightly fiefs and various privileges. 75 serfs were set free, the privileges of the metochi of the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian on Patmos were confirmed, and Venetian citizens became liable for punishment for crimes against the Cretan commoners (villani). In exchange, the Cretan nobles swore allegiance to the Republic of Venice. This treaty had major repercussions, as it began the formation of a native Cretan noble class, set on equal footing with the Venetian colonial aristocracy. However, the arrival of the second wave of Venetian colonists in 1222 again led to uprisings, under Theodore and Michael Melissenos. Once again, the Venetian authorities concluded a treaty with the rebel leaders, conceding them two knightly fiefs. A new rebellion broke out in 1228, involving not only the Skordilides and Melissenoi, but also the Arkoleos and Drakontopoulos families. Both sides requested external aid: the Duke of Crete, Giovanni Storlando, asked for the help of Angelo Sanudo, son and successor of Marco, while the Cretans looked to the Greek Empire of Nicaea for aid. A Nicaean fleet of 33 ships arrived on the island, and in the 1230s the Nicaeans were able to challenge Venetian control over much of Crete and maintain troops there. A series of treaties in 1233, 1234, and 1236, ended the uprising, with the concession of new privileges to the local nobility. Only the Drakontopouloi, along with the remnants of the Nicaean troops (the so-called \\"Anatolikoi\\") continued the fight, based on the fortress of Mirabello (modern Agios Nikolaos). It was only with the aid of the autonomous Greek lord of Rhodes, Leo Gabalas, that the Venetians were able to force their withdrawal to Asia Minor in 1236. The fate of the Drakontopouloi is unknown, and they are no longer attested thereafter. Uprisings of the Chortatzes brothers Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos Following the reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, and the restoration of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty, Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos endeavoured to recover Crete as well. A certain Sergios was sent to the island, and made contact with the Greek nobles Georgios Chortatzes and Michael Skordiles Psaromelingos. This led to the outbreak of another uprising in 1262, again led by the Skordilides, the Melissenoi, and the Chortatzes family, and supported by the Orthodox clergy. The rebellion raged for four years, but its prospects were never good; not only was Michael VIII unable to send any substantial aid, but the influential Greek noble Alexios Kallergis refused to support it, fearing the loss of his privileges. Finally, in 1265 another treaty ended the uprising, reconfirming the privileges of the Cretan nobles, awarding two more knightly fiefs to their leaders, and allowing the safe departure of Sergios from Crete. On the very next year, however, rumours spread that the Cretan nobles, including the Chortatzes brothers George and Theodore, but also Alexios Kallergis, were plotting another uprising. The dynamic intervention of the Duke Giovanni Velenio, and Kallergis' own misgivings, led to the failure of these plans. Michael VIII eventually recognised Venetian control of the island in treaties concluded in 1268 and 1277. In 1272 or 1273, however, George and Theodore Chortatzes launched another uprising in eastern Crete, centred on the Lasithi Plateau. In 1276, the rebels scored a major victory in an open battle in the Messara Plain, in which the Duke of Crete, a ducal councillor, and the \\"flower of the Venetian colony of Candia\\" fell. The rebels laid siege to Candia, but on the verge of success, the rebellion began to fall apart due to dissensions among the Cretan nobles: the Psaromelingoi fell out with the Chortatzes clan after one of their own killed a Chortatzes over the division of the spoils, while at the same time Alexios Kallergis openly collaborated with the Venetians. With the arrival of substantial reinforcements from Venice, the uprising was finally defeated in 1278. Unlike with previous rebellions, the Venetians refused a negotiated settlement, and suppressed the revolt with a campaign of terror involving mass reprisals. The Chortatzes family and many of their supporters fled to Asia Minor, where several entered Byzantine service, but the brutal repression of the Venetians created an unbridgeable gulf with the local population. Rebellion of Alexios Kallergis Despite his double-dealing and shifting allegiance between Venice and his own compatriots, the defeat of the Chortatzes brothers left Alexios Kallergis as the most prominent and respected of the Cretan nobles. His enormous wealth, as well as his strategically situated fief at Mylopotamos, also gave him great power. This led the Venetians to distrust him; their efforts to curb his power backfired, however, and provoked the start of the largest and most violent of all Cretan rebellions up to that point, in 1282. It is also likely that this uprising too was secretly encouraged by Michael VIII Palaiologos as a distraction for the Venetians, who were allied with his arch-enemy Charles of Anjou. Kallergis was joined by all the prominent families of the Cretan nobility: the Gabalades, Barouches, Vlastoi, and even by Michael Chortatzes, nephew of Theodore and George. The uprising quickly spread across the entire island. The Venetians tried to suppress it through reprisals: Orthodox monasteries, which were often used as bases and refuges by the rebels, were torched, and torture was applied to prisoners. In 1284, entry and settlement in the Lasithi Plateau, which in previous rebellions had served as a base for rebels, was declared completely prohibited, even for herding sheep. Despite the constant stream of reinforcements from the metropolis, the uprising could not be quelled. The Venetian authorities also tried to capture Kallergis and the other leaders, but without success. The situation became dire for Venice in 1296, following the outbreak of war with Genoa. The Genoese admiral Lamba Doria captured and torched Chania, and sent envoys to Kallergis offering an alliance, along with recognition as hereditary ruler of the island. Kallergis, however, refused. This act, together with the general war-weariness and the internal dissensions of the Cretan leaders, opened the path to ending the revolt and coming to terms with Venice. Peace treaty and aftermath The uprising was terminated with the \\"Peace of Alexios Kallergis\\" (), signed on 28 April 1299 between Duke Michel Vitali and the rebel leaders. In 33 articles, the treaty proclaimed a general amnesty and the return of all confiscated possessions and the privileges formerly enjoyed by the rebel leaders, who were also granted a two-year tax exemption for the repayment of any debts accrued. The decisions of the tribunals that the rebels had established during the uprising were recognized, and the ban on mixed marriages between Cretans and Venetians was lifted. Kallergis himself was given extensive new privileges: an additional four knightly fiefs, the right of granting titles and fiefs himself, the right of keeping war horses, the right of leasing the properties of various monasteries, and the right of appointing an Orthodox bishop in the diocese of Arios (renamed as Kallergiopolis), and of renting the neighbouring bishoprics of Mylopotamos and Kalamonas. The treaty left Kallergis as the virtual ruler of the Orthodox population of Crete; the contemporary chronicler Michael Louloudes, who fled to Crete when Ephesus fell to the Turks, calls him \\"Lord of Crete\\", and mentions him right after the Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos. Kallergis steadfastly honoured the terms of the treaty, and remained conspicuously loyal to Venice thereafter. His intervention prevented another revolt from breaking out in 1303, following the destructive earthquake of that year, that had left the Venetian authorities in disarray. Later, in 1311, a letter by the Duke of Crete requests of him to gather information about insurrectionist agitation in Sfakia. When another revolt broke out in Sfakia in 1319, Kallergis interceded with the rebels and Duke Giustiniani to put an end to it. On the same year, minor uprisings by the Vlastoi and Barouches were also ended after Kallergis' intervention. The Venetians rewarded him by inscribing his family into the Libro d'Oro of the Venetian nobility, but Kallergis' loyalty to Venice provoked the enmity of the other great Cretan families, who tried to assassinate him at Mylopotamos. Alexios Kallergis therefore spent his last years, until his death in 1321, in Candia. His enemies continued to try to assassinate him, but only managed to kill his son, Andreas, with many of his entourage. Uprisings of 1333‚Äì1334 and 1341‚Äì1347 The peace established by Kallergis lasted until 1333, when Duke Viago Zeno ordered additional taxes to finance the construction of additional galleys, to combat the ever-increasing threat of piracy and raiding along the Cretan coasts. The uprising began as a protest in Mylopotamos, but soon spread to the western provinces in September 1333, under the leadership of Vardas Kallergis, Nikolaos Prikosirides from Kissamos and the three Syropoulos brothers. Despite the participation of one of their relatives, the sons of Alexios Kallergis sided openly with the Venetians, as did other Cretans. The uprising was suppressed in 1334, and its leaders arrested and executed, with the crucial collaboration of Cretan commoners. The families of the rebels were exiled, but the brothers and children of Vardas Kallergis were condemned to life imprisonment as an example; and the entry of non-Cretan Orthodox clergy in the island was prohibited. In 1341, another uprising was launched, by yet another member of the Kallergis family, Leon. A grandson or nephew of Alexios, Leon was publicly loyal to Venice, but conspired with other Cretan nobles, the Smyrilios family of Apokoronas. The revolt broke out there, and soon spread to other areas, as other noble families joined it, including the Skordilides (Konstantinos Skordiles was Leon Kallergis' father-in-law), Melissenoi, Psaromelingoi, and others. Alexios Kallergis' namesake grandson, however, again provided crucial assistance to the Venetians: he captured the Smyrilioi, who in turn betrayed Leon Kallergis, whom the Duke Andrea Cornaro threw alive into the sea, tied into a sack. Despite his loss, the revolt continued under the Skordilides and the Psaromelingoi, who had seized control of the mountains of Sfakia and Syvritos. The rebels even besieged the younger Alexios Kallergis at Kastelli. The rebels suffered a major defeat, however, when the Duke managed to ambush the Psaromelingoi and their forces and destroy them at the Messara Plain. The loss of the Psaromelingoi was the prelude to the suppression of the rebellion in 1347, which was again characterized by great brutality and the exile of the rebels' families to Venice. Revolt of Saint Titus, 1363‚Äì1364 Apart from the Greek nobles, dissatisfaction with the Republic was also growing among the Venetian feudal nobility in Crete, who resented both the heavy taxation and their relegation to a second rank against the nobility of the metropolis. This resentment came to the fore in 1363, when new taxes for repairs in the harbour of Candia were announced. In response, the Venetian feudal lords, led by the Gradenigo and Venier families, rose in rebellion on 9 August 1363. This \\"Revolt of Saint Titus\\", as it became known, abolished the Venetian authorities in Candia and declared the island an independent state, the \\"Republic of Saint Titus\\", after the island's patron saint. The rebels sought the assistance of the Greek population, promising equality between Catholics and Orthodox. Several Greek nobles joined them, including the Kallergis clan, and the revolt spread quickly to the rest of the island: in all major cities, the Venetian authorities were overthrown. Illustration of a joust in the Piazza San Marco, celebrating the recovery of Candia, by Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri, 1863. Venice tried to negotiate with the rebels, but after this effort failed, it began assembling a large expeditionary force to recover the island by force. The army was headed by the Veronese mercenary captain Lucino dal Verme and the fleet by Domenico Michiele. Once news of this arrived in Crete, many of the rebels began wavering. When the Venetian fleet arrived on 7 May 1364, resistance collapsed quickly. Candia surrendered on 9 May, and most of the other cities followed. Nevertheless, on strict orders from the Venetian government, the Venetian commanders launched a purge of the rebel leadership, including the execution and proscription of the ringleaders, and the disbandment of the Gradenigo and Venier families, who were banished from all Venetian territories. The feudal charter of 1211 was revoked, and all noble families obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to Venice. The 10th of May was declared a local holiday in Candia, and celebrated with extravagant festivals. Rebellion of the Kallergis brothers, 1364‚Äì1367 The quick restoration of Venetian control over the cities did not mean the end of violence on the island, as several proscribed members of the rebel leadership continued to oppose the Venetian authorities. Prominent among them were the three Kallergis brothers, John, George, and Alexios, as well as the brothers Tito and Teodorello Venier, Antonio and Francesco Gradenigo, Giovanni Molino, and Marco Vonale. These launched another uprising in August at Mylopotamos, which quickly spread throughout the western half of Crete. The aims of the rebels had now shifted towards liberating the island and seeking unification with the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos also appears to have supported this uprising, sending the Metropolitan of Athens Anthimos to the island as proedros (ecclesiastical locum tenens) of Crete. Venice reacted by securing a declaration from the Pope granting absolution to any soldier fighting against the rebels, and engaging in extensive recruitment of mercenaries, including Turks. Nevertheless, the rebels managed to extend their reach into eastern Crete, with the Lasithi plateau once again becoming a base of operations for the rebels in their guerrilla warfare against the Venetian authorities. However, the famine of 1365 severely weakened the rebellion. The Venetian rebel leaders were captured through treason and tortured to death, with only Tito Venier escaping this fate by leaving the island. Hunger and fear forced the eastern part of the island to submit to Venice, but the rebellion continued in the west under the Kallergis brothers, based in the inaccessible mountains of Sfakia, until April 1367, when the Venetian provveditore Giustiniani managed to enter Sfakia and capture the Kallergis by treason. Venetian reprisals were extensive, leading to the virtual destruction of the native nobility. To further ensure that no other uprisings could take place, the mountainous areas of Mylopotamos, Lasithi, and Sfakia were evacuated and entrance into them prohibited for any purpose whatsoever. The Kallergis uprising was indeed to prove the last of the great Cretan rebellions against Venice: deprived of their natural leadership and naturally secure strongholds, and faced with the ever-increasing threat of Ottoman conquest, the Cretans, apart from some small-scale incidents, accommodated themselves to Venetian rule. =Under the shadow of Ottoman invasion: Crete in the 15th‚Äì17th centuries= The internal tranquility that followed the end of the large-scale uprisings led to considerable prosperity for the island, particularly during what the historian Freddy Thiriet labelled the \\"half-century of prosperity\\", 1400‚Äì1450. Engraving of Candia, 1595 Crete had always been of particular importance among Venice's colonies, but its importance increased as the Ottomans started wresting away Venice's overseas possessions in a series of conflicts that began after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. By the middle of the 16th century, Crete was the only major Venetian possession left in the Aegean, and following the loss of Cyprus in 1570‚Äì1571, in the entire Eastern Mediterranean. The emergence of the Ottoman threat coincided with a period of economic decline for the Venetian Republic, which hampered its ability to effectively strengthen Crete. In addition, internal strife on the island, and the local aristocracy's resistance to reforms, compounded the problem. The Fall of Constantinople caused a deep impression among the Cretans, and in its aftermath, a series of anti-Venetian conspiracies took place. The first was the conspiracy of Sifis Vlastos in Rethymno, which even included a fake letter by the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conspiracy was betrayed to the Venetian authorities by the priest Ioannis Limas and Andrea Nigro, in exchange for money and privileges. 39 individuals were charged with participation, among them many priests. In November 1454, as a retaliation, the authorities banned the ordination of Orthodox priests for five years. Another conspiracy was betrayed in 1460, causing the Venetians to launch a persecution of many locals, as well as Greek refugees from mainland Greece. The protopapas of Rethymno, Petros Tzangaropoulos, was among the leaders of the conspiracy. Although the revolutionary agitation subsided, the authorities remained nervous; in 1463, the settlement of the Lasithi plateau was allowed to produce grain in order to counter the famine, but as soon as the immediate danger had passed, it was banned again in 1471, and remained so until the early 16th century. In 1471, during the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, the Ottoman fleet plundered the eastern parts of the island around Siteia. It was not until 1523 that the first moves towards another Cretan revolt, under the leadership of Georgios Kantanoleos, started taking place. Exasperated by the heavy tax burden and the arbitrariness of Venetian government, about 600 men rose up in revolt around Kerameia. The Venetian authorities initially hesitated to move against the rebels, for fear of causing a wider uprising. In October 1527, however, Geronimo Corner with 1,500 troops marched against the rebels. The uprising was suppressed with great violence, and all the villages in the rebel area were destroyed. Three of the leaders, the brothers Georgios and Andronikos Chortatsis, and Leon Theotokopoulos, were betrayed in 1528 and hanged, while Kantanoleos himself was proscribed for 1,000 hyperpyra, and also betrayed. Altogether some 700 people were killed; many families were exiled to Cyprus, in the area of Paphos, but after about a decade many were allowed to return and even reclaim their possessions on Crete. During the Third Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, the Ottomans demanded the recognition of the Sultan's overlordship over Crete and the payment of an annual tribute. In June 1538, the Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa captured Mylopotamos, Apokoronas, and Kerameia, besieged Chania without success, and then marched to Rethymno and Candia. It was only the appeal of the Venetian authorities to the local population, offering amnesty and tax exemptions, that preserved the city, especially when the Kallergis brothers Antonios and Mathios used their fortune to recruit men and strengthen the island's fortifications. Nevertheless, the Turks ravaged the area around Fodele, and destroyed the forts of Mirabello, Siteia, and Palaiokastro. The Ottoman attacks resumed in 1539, when Selino was surrendered by its inhabitants and its Venetian garrison captured. The fortress of Ierapetra also fell, but Kissamos resisted successfully. In 1571, during the war for Cyprus, Ulu√ß Ali briefly captured Rethymno and raided Crete, resulting in widespread famine on the island. Some local inhabitants, resentful at Venetian misgovernment, even made contact with the Turks, but the intervention of the Cretan nobleman Matthaios Kallergis managed to calm down spirits, and restore order. Two years later, in 1573, the area around Chania was raided. Another conflict broke out in November 1571, when the Venetian governor, Marino Cavalli, moved to subdue the area of Sfakia. The isolated and mountainous area had always remained free of effective Venetian control, and their raids in the lowlands and the constant feuds between the leading Sfakian clans caused great insecurity in the wider area. After blockading all passes to Sfakia, Cavalli began laying waste to the region and killing large part of the population. The Sfakians were finally forced to submit, and delegations from the entire region appeared before Cavalli to swear allegiance to Venice. Cavalli's successor, Jacopo Foscarini, took measures to pacify the area, allowing its inhabitants to return to their homes, but soon Sfakia again became a hotbed of disorder, so that in 1608, the governor Nicolas Sagredo prepared to invade the area again, only for the plan to be dismissed by his successor, who restored order by personally touring the region. Administration The Venetian sestieri of Crete in the 13th century: 1. Santi Apostoli (Holy Apostles), 2. San Marco (St. Mark), 3. Santa Croce (Holy Cross), 4. Castello, 5. San Polo (St. Paul), 6. Dorsoduro The conquest of Crete brought Venice its first major colony; indeed, the island would remain the largest possession of the Republic until its expansion into the northern Italian mainland (the Terraferma) in the early 15th century. In addition to the unfamiliar challenges of governing a territory of such size and eminence, the distance of Crete from the metropolis‚Äîabout a month's journey by galley‚Äîraised dangers and complications. As a result, unlike other colonies, where the Venetian government was content to allow governance by the local Venetian colonists, in Crete the Republic employed salaried officials dispatched from the metropolis. This \\"made subjects of both the Venetian colonizers and the colonized Greek people of the island\\", and despite the privileges accorded to the former, their common position of subservience to the metropolis made it more likely for the Venetians and Greeks of Crete to rally together in support of common interests against the metropolitan authorities. =Central government and military command= The regime established by Venice in Crete was modelled after that of the metropolis itself. It was headed by a Duke (duca di Candia), and included a Great Council, a Senate, a Council of Ten, the Avogadoria de Com√πn, and other institutions that existed in the metropolis. The Duke of Crete was elected from among the Venetian patriciate for two-year terms, and was assisted by four, and later only two councillors (consiglieri), likewise appointed for two-year terms; of the original four, two were rectors of cities on the island. Together, the Duke and his councillors comprised the Signoria of Crete. There were also two, and later three, chamberlains (camerlenghi), charged with fiscal affairs, and each province had its own treasury (camera). The lower strata of the hierarchy were complemented by judges and police officials (the giudici and the Signori di notte), castellans (castellani) and the grand chancellor (cancelliere grande). As in most greater territories with a special military importance, military command was vested in a Captain (capitano). In times of crisis or war, a provveditore generale (the provveditore generale [del regno] di Candia) was appointed, with supreme power over both civil and military officials on the island. After 1569, as the Ottoman danger increased, the appointment of a provveditore generale became regular for two-year tenures, and the post came to be held by some of the most eminent statesmen of Venice. A further provveditore generale was appointed from 1578 to command the island's cavalry, and an admiral, the \\"Captain of the Guard [Fleet] of Crete\\" (Capitano alla guardia di Candia) commanded the local naval forces. =Provincial and local administration= Just like the city of Venice itself, the \\"Venice of the East\\" was initially divided into six provinces, or sestieri. From east to west these were: * Santi Apostoli (Holy Apostles) or Cannaregio, comprising the districts of Siteia, Ierapetra, Mirabello, and Lasithi; it was essentially coterminous with the modern Lasithi Prefecture. * San Marco (St. Mark), comprising the districts of Rizokastro (Ven. Belvedere) and Pediada. * Santa Croce (Holy Cross), comprising the districts of Monofatsio (Ven. Bonifacio), Kainourgio (Castelnuovo), and Pyrgiotissa. * Castello, comprising the districts of Mylopotamos, Arios, and Apano Syvritos * San Polo (St. Paul), comprising the districts of Kalamonas (i.e., Rethymno), Kato Syvritos or St. Basil's, and Psychros or Apokoronas (Ven. Bicorono). * Dorsoduro, comprising the districts of Chania, Kissamos, and Selino Map showing the four territoria of Crete From the early 14th century on, the island was divided into four larger provinces (territoria): * Territorio of Candia, by far the largest in area, roughly equivalent to the modern Heraklion Prefecture along with the Lasithi plateau and Mirabello Province * Territorio of Rethymno (Ven. Rettimo), roughly coterminous with the modern Rethymno Prefecture * Territorio of Chania (Ven. Canea), roughly coterminous with the modern provinces of Apokoronas, Kissamos, Kydonia, and Selino * Territorio of Siteia, roughly coterminous with the modern Siteia and Ierapetra provinces With the creation of the territoria, rectors (rettori) began to be appointed in their capitals, with civil and held limited military authority in their province: from 1307 in Chania and Rethymno, and from 1314 in Siteia. The rettore of Chania originally was one of the four councillors of the Duke of Crete. The rectors of Chania and Rethymno were also assisted by a provveditore and two councillors each. In addition, there was a special provveditore appointed over Sfakia, a region which in practice was mostly outside Venetian control. He was subordinate to Candia (but also sometimes to Chania). Provveditori were also appointed to the important island fortresses of Souda (since 1573), Spinalonga (since 1580), and Grambousa (since 1584). The island was further divided into castellanies and feudal domains held by the local aristocracy. Society During Venetian rule, the Greek population of Crete was exposed to Renaissance culture. A thriving literature in the Cretan dialect of Greek developed on the island. The best-known work from this period is the poem Erotokritos by Vitsentzos Kornaros (ŒíŒπœÑœÉŒ≠ŒΩŒ∂ŒøœÇ ŒöŒøœÅŒΩŒ¨œÅŒøœÇ). Another major Cretan literary figures were Marcus Musurus (1470‚Äì1517), Nicholas Kalliakis (1645‚Äì1707), Andreas Musalus (1665‚Äì1721), and other Greek scholars and philosophers who flourished in Italy in the 15-17th Centuries. Georgios Hortatzis was author of the dramatic work Erophile. The painter Domenicos Theotocopoulos, better known as El Greco, was born in Crete in this period and was trained in Byzantine iconography before moving to Italy and later, Spain.

Career  Her first success in attracting the attention of an employer was with Sir Ralph Freeman, a senior partner of Douglas, Fox & Partners. Freeman was providing consultancy advice, on steel design, to contractors Dorman Long. Having hired Buchanan, Freeman allowed her to transfer to Dorman Long where she served as part of the design staff for the Sydney Harbour Bridge but she remained under Freeman's supervision for the purposes of her training contract from April 1924. Her salary was ¬£4 per week plus overtime, the same as the ‚Äúboys.‚Äù She later worked on overseas bridges (Dessouk and Khartoum). Due to the Institution of Civil Engineers training requirement that design engineers also have site experience, Buchanan left London to go to work on the Belfast water supply scheme at the Silent Valley Reservoir project in Northern Ireland.Trevor Turpin, Dam (Reaktion Books 2008): 94-95. In Northern Ireland, her training supervision was undertaken by Sir Ernest Moir, a director of S. Pearson and Son (and husband of Margaret, Lady Moir, co-founder of the Women's Engineering Society). Buchanan is reputed to have avoided having to have a chaperone by simply and repeatedly departing for work before the chaperone arrived. After six months with the reservoir project, Buchanan had sufficient experience to fulfil that part of her qualification obligations and was able to return to Dorman Long in London to continue with their bridge design team, working on the George V Bridge (now usually called the Tyne Bridge) in Newcastle and the Lambeth Bridge in London. In 1929, she gave a lecture on the work required for the construction of \\"Some Modern Bridges\\". Buchanan pursued her professional qualification with the Institution of Civil Engineers and had to attend an interview at the ICE headquarters at One Great George Street, London (near Parliament Square) as part of the examination process. In an interview for the New Civil Engineer magazine in 1978, she recounted being surprised to find another woman in the waiting room, because she was aware that she would be the first female engineer to be recognised by the ICE if she were to be successful in the interview. The other woman in the waiting room transpired to be a chaperone brought in for the sake of decency. She was granted membership of the ICE in December 1927, as the only female amongst 9,979 men in the Institution. She later remarked, ‚ÄòI felt that I represented all the women in the world. It was my hope that I would be followed by many others‚Äô (New Civil Engineer, 6 July 1978, 15‚Äì16). Later life Upon marriage in 1930 to William H. Dalrymple Fleming, an electrical engineer, she retired from engineering. As Dorothy Fleming, she pursued interests in rock climbing and painting. She died in 1985, at age 85.Nina Baker, \\"Buchanan, Dorothy Donaldson,\\" in Elizabeth Ewan, Sue Innes, and Sian Reynolds, eds., The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women (Edinburgh University Press 2007): 52. In February 2019, to celebrate their first female member of the institution, the ICE named a room after her, at their headquarters (in the same building where she had not been allowed to be interviewed without the presence of a chaperone).

Early life He was son of William Herbert of St. Julians in Monmouthshire, then an estate lying between Caerleon and Newport. His mother was Jane, daughter of Edward Griffith. He was sole surviving legitimate heir-male of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, as the great-grandson of Sir George Herbert of St. Julians, the earl's third son. Born after 1552, he was a pupil of Laurence Humphrey, President of Magdalen College, Oxford, presumed to have been a private pupil. Herbert was a savant, and 1 May 1577 he sent John Dee notes for Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica. In 1581 he was residing at Mortlake, and enjoying Dee's learning. Thomas Churchyard the poet was another admirer, and Churchyard dedicated to Herbert his 'Dream,' which forms 'the ninth labour' of 'the first parte of Churchyardes Chippes,' 1575. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) for Monmouthshire and High Sheriff of Monmouthshire for 1579‚Äì80. He was elected a knight of the shire (MP) for Monmouthshire in 1584, 1586 and 1593. In Ireland On 14 February 1588 Herbert wrote to Francis Walsingham that he desired to show posterity his affection for his God and his prince 'by a volume of my writing,' by 'a colony of my planting,' and by 'a college of my erecting.' The first two objects he accomplished, the last he did not carry further than a plan to place a college at Tintern, where he owned a house and property. The colony was in Ireland. He was a relative and friend of Sir James Croft who had been lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1551‚Äì2. Herbert became an 'undertaker' for the plantation of Munster on 5 May 1586, and on 17 June applied for three 'seignories' in Kerry. In April 1587 he arrived at Cork, and was allotted many of the confiscated lands which had been the property of Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond. Herbert's property included Castleisland and its neighbourhood, and covered 13,276 acres. A vigorous colonist, he recommended that Desmond and Kerry should be combined into a single county; that the government should be wholly in English hands; that Limerick should be garrisoned and fortified, and that an army formed of Monmouthshire men should be maintained to resist foreign invasion. He also wished to see Kerry colonised by English gentlemen, and Irish customs such as tanistry abolished. Moderate in treating the Irish, he put into execution clauses of the statute against Irish customs, particularly forbidding the wearing of the native mantle. A zealous Protestant, had the articles of the creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the ten commandments translated into Irish, and also directed the clergy on his estate to read religious services in Irish. With the Dean of Ardagh, whom he describes as inclined to papistry, he held many conferences, directing his attention to passages in Augustine of Hippo and John Chrysostom, and to works by Whittaker and Sadaell, After nearly two years' residence at Castleisland, he acted as vice-president of Munster, in the temporary absence of Sir Thomas Norris, and sat on many commissions to settle disputes. But Herbert's work was severely attacked by Sir Edward Denny, high sheriff of Kerry, and owner of Tralee and the neighbourhood, who complained of Herbert's self-conceit, and declared that his constables were rogues, and that the native Irish under his care were ruthlessly pillaged. Herbert replied that Denny encouraged pirates on the Kerry coast, and did not treat with consideration Irish converts to Protestantism. Herbert finally returned to England in the spring of 1589. Meiler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel, wrote of Herbert in complimentary fashion. Adam Loftus, the lord chancellor, and Sir Warham St. Leger wrote in similar terms, and emphasised Herbert's success as a Protestant missionary. Later life and death On his return to England he entered the Middle Temple to study law. He provided his country house at Tintern for use as a religious college, dying before the project was due to start. He died at St. Julians on 4 March 1593 whilst still in office as an MP and Custos Rotulorum of Monmouthshire. Family He married early in life Florence or Florentia, daughter of William Morgan of Llantarnam, Monmouthshire, and left an only child, Mary, who was born about 1578. His two sons had been accidentally poisoned by poison set out by Sir William to kill rats. He settled by will, dated 12 April 1587, all his property, which included, besides St. Julians and his Irish estates, land in Anglesey and Carnarvonshire, upon his daughter, on condition that she married 'one of the surname of Herbert.' On 28 February 1599 she satisfied this condition by marrying her kinsman, Edward Herbert, afterwards Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who thereby came into possession of St Julians. On the petition of Herbert's widow and daughter, a new survey of his Irish property was made, and the rent reduced in 1596. Herbert's house at Castleisland was destroyed in the rebellion of 1598. Works Herbert was author of: *‚ÄòA Letter written by a trve Christian Catholike to a Romaine pretended Catholike, vppon occasion of Controuersie touching the Catholike Church; the 12, 13, and 14 chapters of the Reuelations are briefly and truelie expounded,‚Äô London (by John Windet), 1586, anonymous, with Sir William's arms on the back of the title-page. *‚ÄòA Poem intituled Sir William Herbertes Sydney‚Äô was licensed by the Stationers' Company to John Windet on 16 January 1587. This may be identical with ‚ÄòSidney, or Baripenthes; briefely shadowing out the rare and neuer ending landes of that most honovrable and praiseworthy Gent. Sir Philip Sidney,‚Äô London (by John Windet), 1586. *Herbert has been identified with the ‚ÄòSir W. H.‚Äô who signs a poor lyric in the ‚ÄòPh≈ìnix Nest,‚Äô 1593. * A reply in Latin prose by Herbert to Edmund Campion's treatise in favour of Roman Catholicism ('Decem Rationes,' 1587) was not printed (Brit. Mus. Lansd. MS. 27, No. 7). John Strype refers to it in his life of Matthew Parker. * 'Croftus; siue de Hibernia Liber;' an historical, political, and geographical treatise by Herbert on Ireland, also in Latin prose, and named in compliment to Sir James Croft, was first printed from a copy preserved among Earl Powis's manuscripts at Powis Castle for the Roxburghe Club, under the editorship of the Rev.

History In the early 1900s the Italian population of the city of Poughkeepsie had increased substantially, and Rev. Joseph F. Sheahan, pastor of St. Peter's recognized that these parishioners would be better served by a priest who spoke their own language and was familiar with the communities customs. Sheahan arranged for an Italian priest to come in and celebrate a separate mass for the Italians in the lower church. Unfortunately, this was interpreted by many in the Italian community as the Irish having relegated them to the cellar. This was a contributing factor in the Italian community organizing to build their own church. The parish was incorporated on February 19, 1908 out of the parish of St. Peter's, Poughkeepsie. Property was purchased June 1909 for the church from John I. Platt on the west side of Cataract Place, on what is now Mount Carmel Place.Hasbrouck, Frank, ed. The History of Dutchess County New York, p647, S.A. Mathieu, Poughkeepsie, NY 1909 and ground was broken the following March. The cornerstone was laid May 1, 1910 by Bishop Cusack and the church was dedicated on October 12, 1910 by the Mgr. Lavelle, V.G.. A rectory was built November 1913. The parish was built for the Italian population on Poughkeepsie and had (in 1913) 245 families of about 1,700 souls. The first pastor was the Rev. N. Pavone, who was born at Trivento, Italy, on August 18, 1878, ordained at a seminary there December 23, 1901, and studied at La Minerva University in Rome. From 1903 to 1904, he was a bishop's secretary in Trevienta, then he taught at the seminary at Larino before arriving in New York on December 20, 1905 where he was assigned to St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie. In 1932 Father Joseph Maria Pernicone was appointed pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1935 Father Pernacone established Our Lady of Mount Carmel School. The school closed in 2007 due to declining enrollment. Two years later, the school building was reopened under the direction of Astor Services and now functions as a school for special-needs students. In 1965, the congregation moved into the former St. Peter's Church at 97 Mill Street, when St. Peter's parish re-located to Hyde Park, NY. Astor Services also occupies the original Church building on Mount Carmel Place.Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish Many second and third generation Italians who grew up in the Mount Carmel neighborhood, moved into the Town of Poughkeepsie but continued to return to Mount Carmel as their neighborhood church. The area has been home to many of Poughkeepsie's new immigrant populations, starting with the Irish, later the Italians. Still home to several Italian restaurants and bakeries, the area is widely referred to as Poughkeepsie's Little Italy. Description Mt Carmel District \\"It is a brick and marble structure, in the Roman style, and seats 400.\\" Parish tradition holds that much of the brick for the church was actually acquired by the Italian laborers working on the railroad, although it unclear whether this is true and if so, if the bricks were left over, thrown away bricks, or bricks that were supposed to be used for a job.

Wing Commander, later Group Captain Brian Eaton commanded the wing. Soon after arrival, the wing came under the Air Officer Commanding Malta. The Wing was at RAF Hal Far (HMS Falcon), and then spent 18 months at RAF Ta Kali, moving there in June 1953.

It was later adapted into a manhua. Narrated by the eponymous Sun Knight, Grisia Sun, the story follows the exploits of the 38th generation of the Twelve Holy Knights. It takes place on a polytheistic, fictional continent during a pseudo-medieval time period, with a social structure similar to that found in high fantasy role-playing games. In this world, where gods are real and constantly striving for power, various religions have formed to worship the most powerful deities. The oldest and most respected of these religions is the Church of the God of Light, based in the Kingdom of Forgotten Sound. The Church of the God of Light was founded and led by the renowned Twelve Holy Knights, each of whom had a distinctive personality. The following generations of the Twelve Holy Knights are expected to have the same recognizable characteristics, forcing them to conceal their true selves. Plot A hotel lobby with posters of The Legend of Sun Knight. The corrupt king of Forgotten Sound attempted to weaken the Church of the God of Light by framing Grisia Sun, the 38th generation Sun Knight, for the murder of a royal guard. When the guard was resurrected as a Death Knight, a powerful undead creature, Sun investigated and discovered that the guard was his childhood friend Roland. With the help of Pink, the necromancer that resurrected Roland, and the rest of the Twelve Holy Knights, Sun revealed the truth behind Roland's death and overthrew the king. At the coronation of the crown prince, the Son of the God of War proposed to the princess, who was secretly in love with the Hell Knight. Sun arranged for a battle to be held for the hand of the princess, and with Roland's help made the Son of the God of War concede the match. Soon after this, Sun and Elmairy Leaf traveled to the Kingdom of Moon Orchid to attend a wedding, arriving to find that the bride had been kidnapped and they had to join a rescue team to bring her back. At one point, Sun was separated from the team in order to help the previous Sun Knight retrieve a treasure called the Eternal Silence. During his absence, Leaf was killed in a battle with the kidnapper. Upon his return, Sun successfully resurrected Leaf but permanently lost his sight as a result. When Sun hunted down the kidnapper to exact his revenge, the kidnapper revealed himself to be the Silent Eagle, a high-ranking official of the Cathedral of the Shadow God. Before Sun could kill him for harming Leaf, Pink stepped in, claiming to be one of the three lich acolytes of the Shadow God. Sun then named the Silent Eagle ‚ÄúAwaitsun‚Äù as a reminder to eternally await Sun's revenge. Following a confrontation with Pink, Sun woke up with amnesia in the Kingdom of Kissinger, where he joined an adventuring group as their cleric. The group attempted to capture a unicorn, only succeeding when a mysterious girl called Scarlet guided Sun to it. On their way to collect the reward, the group fought the Ice Knight and took him as a hostage. The remaining Twelve Holy Knights came together to stop them, unfortunately waking a dragon in the process. Sun regained his memories just in time to help the Twelve Holy Knights defeat the dragon. Upon returning to Forgotten Sound, the Twelve Holy Knights discovered that the capital, Leaf Bud City, was being overrun by undead creatures that shared a connection with Scarlet. To combat Scarlet, Sun asked Pink and a dark elf named Aldrizzt to teach him psychic magic. Using psychic magic, Sun and the Twelve Holy Knights managed to seal Scarlet inside the Eternal Silence. Sun was then summoned by the king to meet representatives of the Cathedral of the Shadow God, Awaitsun being one of them, who explained that a powerful dark creature called the Demon King would soon be awoken in Leaf Bud City. To Sun, Awaitsun privately revealed that Sun was one of the three candidates to become the Demon King. While searching for the other candidates, Sun met two of the other Cathedral representatives, Stephen and Charlotte Anastas, who revealed themselves to be one of the lich acolytes and the second candidate, respectively. After defeating them, Sun tried to contact Pink to concede his candidacy, only to be killed by Roland, Pink's candidate, who then left to take the throne. After recovering from his resurrection, Sun traveled to the Cathedral of the Shadow God to confront Roland, successfully convinced him to step down, and took up the mantle of the Demon King himself. To prevent the dark magic from corrupting Sun, the Twelve Holy Knights cast a spell sealing his power, thus allowing him to remain the Sun Knight. Characters =Forgotten Sound= The Church of the God of Light The Twelve Holy Knights (38th Gen) :The Twelve Holy Knights are the representatives of the God of Light, and the most powerful members of the Church of the God of Light. They‚Äôre evenly divided into two factions, ‚Äòwarm- hearted‚Äô and ‚Äòcold-hearted,' and their order of command is aligned accordingly. Each of the Twelve Holy Knights leads a platoon of one vice- captain and twenty-four unranked holy knights. Their faith allows them to use Holy Light, a magic unique to the followers of the God of Light. \\"Knight- Captain Sun\\" : The blond, blue-eyed Sun Knight is the elegant leader of the ‚Äòwarm-hearted‚Äô faction and the head of the Twelve Holy Knights. He is known for his devotion to the God of Light and his boundless compassion, granting forgiveness to even the most heinous criminals. However, he is merciless and lethal when dealing with dark creatures. He is the sole wielder of the Divine Sun Sword and possesses limitless Holy Light. Grisia Sun (The 38th generation Sun Knight & the 21st generation Demon King) :Unathletic and devious, Grisia uses his abnormal magical abilities to pull off outrageous schemes and defend the Sun Knight‚Äôs reputation. He is extremely loyal to the Twelve Holy Knights, even considering them to be his family, and would do anything to protect them. His independent nature makes him secretive and, at times, self-destructive. This has resulted in the permanent loss of his sight, among other things. Grisia also has a serious sweet tooth, and gives insulting nicknames to many of his companions. ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Storm‚Äù :A footloose charmer with bright blue hair, the Storm Knight represents freedom. He is a member of the ‚Äòwarm- hearted‚Äô faction and is well-known for his rebellious behavior, skipping out on work to flirt shamelessly with any and all women in his general vicinity. His friendly, outgoing nature makes him a natural diplomat, and he has a long history of supporting rebellions for the sake of freedom. The Storm Knight fights using a form of martial arts based on powerful kicks, and is the fastest member of the Twelve Holy Knights. Theo Storm (The 38th generation Storm Knight) :A pragmatic workaholic, Theo is almost solely responsible for keeping the Church of the God of Light functional. This leaves him in a constant state of exhaustion with little time to himself. Despite this, he makes an effort to support his fellow knights and is considered the head of the Twelve Holy Knights in the absence of Grisia and Lesus. He rarely has the patience for Grisia‚Äôs elaborate schemes, and generally tries to remain uninvolved. Grisia has nicknamed him ‚ÄúDeatheo,‚Äù much to his frustration. ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Leaf‚Äù :The kindest member of the ‚Äòwarm-hearted‚Äô faction, the Leaf Knight is sweet and never refuses to do anyone a favor. He looks after his fellow knights, going out of his way to cheer them up; he does the same for anyone else he encounters, his charitable nature making even complete strangers feel welcome. He wields the Divine Leaf Bow with such accuracy that he can shoot the wings off a butterfly 100 meters away. Like the Sun Knight, he is ruthless when confronting a dark creature. Elmairy Leaf (The 38th generation Leaf Knight) :Genuinely kind and helpful, Elmairy always steps in when his fellow knights disagree and often lends a hand with Grisia‚Äôs various schemes. He is a skilled cook, although his taste for extravagant spices leaves him chronically broke. When Grisia was blinded healing him, Elmairy gained superhuman eyesight, making him an even more formidable archer. He has extensive knowledge on the occult and uses voodoo as an anger management technique. Grisia has nicknamed him ‚ÄúStrawberry.‚Äù ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Blaze‚Äù :Loud and rambunctious, the hot-headed Blaze Knight is the most straight-forward member of the ‚Äòwarm-hearted‚Äô faction. His loyalty to the Twelve Holy Knights, and to the Sun Knight, is legendary. He specializes in exorcism, although he will eagerly battle against living (and undead) opponents as well. Given his skill in purification, he is often assigned missions in distant locations to deal with dangerous spirits. Chikus Blaze (The 38th generation Blaze Knight) :Reckless and quick-tempered, Chikus easily maintains his Blaze Knight persona, although he tends to awkwardly fuss over his fellow knights when they‚Äôre hurt. He is fiercely loyal to Grisia for having rescued him from Pink‚Äôs dungeon when they were young, and is the first to defend him in any situation. His relationship with Demos is strained, as Chikus instinctively tries to exorcise his ghostly companion on sight. He has been nicknamed ‚ÄúFreakus‚Äù by Grisia. ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Earth‚Äù :The Sun Knight‚Äôs closest friend, the Earth Knight is a member of the ‚Äòwarm-hearted‚Äô faction and renowned for his honesty. He is shy and stutters when he speaks, but his level-headed temperament and steadfast support makes him a trustworthy companion. The Earth Knight is second only to the Sun Knight in Holy Light, making him one of the most powerful members of the Twelve Holy Knights. He is the only Holy Knight capable of casting the ‚ÄúShield of Earth,‚Äù and is exclusively defensive when in battle. Georgo Earth (The 38th generation Earth Knight) :Georgo is an unapologetic playboy who uses his Earth Knight persona to appeal to women, although Grisia torments him by unfailingly interrupting any potentially romantic moments. This animosity is, in part, because Georgo is the only member of the Twelve Holy Knights who refuses to get involved in any of Grisia‚Äôs schemes. Due to their bitter rivalry, Georgo has also not received a nickname. His impatient personality makes him more aggressive than his defensive fighting style suggests. ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Cloud‚Äù :A free-spirited drifter, the Cloud Knight is the only Holy Knight capable of ‚ÄúCloud-Stepping,‚Äù a secret footwork technique that allows the user to smoothly evade incoming attacks and to strike unnoticably. His quiet demeanor makes him the calmest of the ‚Äòwarm-hearted‚Äô faction, and he spends his time sleeping under trees or reading in patches of sunlight. Demos Cloud (The 38th generation Cloud Knight) :A ghostly introvert, Demos enjoys hiding in cabinets and, later, in the library. He takes books very seriously, and usually will only appear when the bell on the library help desk is rung. His mastery of Cloud-Stepping is so complete that he can even dodge lines of sight. Before becoming the Cloud Knight, he had been enslaved by a group of bandits for three years. Grisia has nicknamed him ‚ÄúDeedee.‚Äù ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Judgement‚Äù :The Judgement Knight is the head of the ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô faction and second-in-command to the Sun Knight; he alone is responsible for the interrogation and conviction of those who have sinned. His cruel methods are widely known, as is his skill in wielding the Divine Judgement Sword. Although he‚Äôs technically under the command of the Sun Knight, there is unending friction between the two over the proper way of dealing with sinners, and they frequently disagree. Lesus Judgement (The 38th generation Judgement Knight) :Grisia‚Äôs best friend, Lesus is dependable and greatly respected by the Twelve Holy Knights. He specializes in solving crimes through meticulous investigation; despite his diligence, the gruesome sights he encounters during interrogations make him nauseous, and he has difficulty in maintaining the Judgement Knight‚Äôs cruel reputation. He is an expert swordfighter, to the point that he can identify others just by watching them fight. Grisia has never given him a nickname. ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Ice‚Äù :An aptly assigned member of the ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô faction, the Ice Knight is expressionless, unfeeling, and aloof. He wields the Divine Ice Sword, and is second only to the Judgement Knight in skill. His fighting style is passive in nature; the Ice Knight will wait patiently for his opponent to approach, watching closely for the moment they enter his range, where he finishes them off with a single, fatal thrust. It is unusual to hear the Ice Knight speak. Ecilan Ice (The 38th generation Ice Knight) :Reliable and patient, Ecilan comes from a family of bakers and enjoys making sweets for his fellow knights. He keeps detailed notes on their tastes, although he reserves the right to withhold these sweets from anyone who annoys him. Outside of baking, he is a dedicated swordfighter. Despite his chilly exterior, he gets quite flustered when his fellow knights are hurt. Grisia has nicknamed him ‚ÄúWastelan.‚Äù ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Moon‚Äù :A demanding aristocrat, the Moon Knight is prideful and rarely considers anyone worthy to be in his presence, forever looking down on others. Even his superiors, the Judgement Knight and the Sun Knight, are barely deserving of his respect. He is always regal, dignified, and extremely arrogant. The Moon Knight is a member of the ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô faction and wields a whip in battle. Vival Moon (The 38th generation Moon Knight) :A hopeless romantic, Vival yearns for a sweetheart of his own; unfortunately, looking down his nose at everyone has given him permanent neck cramps, so his only options are girls that match his impressive height. He treasures any gifts given to him by his lover, and takes break-ups very badly. Vival is earnest and unquestioningly loyal to Lesus; he is also quite talented with his whip. Grisia has nicknamed him ‚ÄúViola.‚Äù ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Metal‚Äù :The Metal Knight is known for his hostile nature and poisonous words, eagerly provoking anyone he encounters. Like his fellow ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô knight, the Moon Knight, he is disrespectful even to the Judgement Knight and the Sun Knight. He specializes in pursuit and concealment, and fights using a variety of knives. The Metal Knight is also skilled in thievery and assassination, giving him an unsavory reputation. Laica Metal (The 38th generation Metal Knight) :Laica shares the sharp tongue of his persona and often speaks without thinking, turning even his most sincere apologies into insults. He can be hotheaded, and doesn‚Äôt always get along with his fellow Holy Knights. His masochistic tendencies have led to Laica idolizing Lesus for his expertise in torture techniques. He enjoys playing with knives in his free time, and has spent hours practising with them. Grisia has nicknamed him ‚ÄúSlime.‚Äù ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Stone‚Äù :The Stone Knight is a member of the ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô faction and the most level-headed of the Twelve Holy Knights. In addition to having incredible strength, he is famous for being uncompromising and imperturbable. It‚Äôs been said that overthrowing the Church of the God of Light would be easier than trying to change his mind. Despite his obstinacy, the Stone Knight is the only member of the ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô faction to handle diplomacy. Aivis Stone (The 38th generation Stone Knight) :Stubborn as his persona, Aivis is amiable and enjoys teasing his fellow Holy Knights. In his training years, his charisma led to him nearly being deemed unsuitable as the Stone Knight‚Äôs apprentice and replaced. He is one of the strongest fighters among the Twelve Holy Knights, although he only engages in combat in dire circumstances. ‚ÄúKnight-Captain Hell‚Äù :The Hell Knight is the only member of the ‚Äòcold-hearted‚Äô faction who follows the command of the Sun Knight over that of the Judgement Knight, and specializes in espionage. He rarely makes public appearances, and little is known about him. Because of this, the Hell Knight is widely thought to be a false identity assumed by the Sun Knight during times of conflict. Elijah Hell (The 38th generation Hell Knight I) :Elijah was assigned by the Pope to go deep undercover as a member of the Royal Guard of Forgotten Sound, where he met and fell in love with Princess Jasmine. He trained under the guidance of the 37th generation Hell Knight for one year before entering the Royal Guard, later resigning as the Hell Knight entirely. His charming personality and easy-going nature allow him to fit in anywhere. Roland Hell (The 38th generation Hell Knight II) :Grisia‚Äôs childhood friend, Roland was runner-up at the Sun Knight selections and went on to become a well-respected captain of the Royal Guard. After attempting to expose the King‚Äôs misdeeds, he was tortured to death and resurrected as a Death Knight, later evolving into a Death Lord, and after that a Death Monarch. Stoic and commanding, he takes everything seriously and values integrity. Due to Grisia‚Äôs meddling, he took up the title of Hell Knight after Elijah stepped down.

It was established after a parish mergers of the Church of St. Joachim, (Beacon, New York) and St. John the Evangelist (Beacon, New York). The merged parishes share a pastor, clergy and administrative staff, and the two church buildings continued to be used for worship. History The history of St. Joachim ‚Äì St. John the Evangelist Parish begins with two contiguous villages - Matteawan and Fishkill Landing. St. Joachim's Parish began in the Village of Matteawan in 1853 and the church opened in 1861. The parish included the Village of Fishkill Landing. St. John the Evangelist began in 1887 in Fishkill Landing. Both parishes flourished. The two villages merged into the City of Beacon in 1913. Both parishes remained active and independent of each other until being merged into one on January 2, 2004.Archer, Edw. D.,Parish History (2007) =The Early Church in Dutchess County= The first recorded Catholic Mass in the Beacon, NY area was celebrated at Mt. Gulian during the Revolutionary War by a French priest from Rhode Island. The first resident pastor in Dutchess County was Rev. John Maginnis at St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie in 1837. St. Patrick's in Newburgh had been established in 1838, the first Catholic Church in Orange County. A number of residents in this area attended Mass at St. Patrick's in Newburgh as a matter of convenience.Briody, Rev. J.H. in Hasbrouck, Frank, ed. The History of Dutchess County New York, p634, S.A. Mathieu, Poughkeepsie, NY 1909 St. Mary's in Wappingers Falls was established in 1845 as a mission of St. Peter's, Poughkeepsie. In 1850, Rev. George Brophy became the first resident pastor at St. Mary's. That same year, Fr. Brophy celebrated the first Mass in Matteawan. St. Joachim's Church, Leonard St. =St. Joachim's= Rev. Denis Sheehan followed Fr. Brophy as pastor of St. Mary's in Wappingers Falls and continued to lay the groundwork for a new parish in the Fishkill Landing- Matteawan area and is considered the first pastor of St. Joachim's. He purchased property for a new church in Matteawan in 1855. The church was enclosed in 1857 and Mass has been said there ever since. In the fall of 1860 Rev James Coyle became the first resident pastor in Matteawan. the parish included congregations in Fishkill Landing, Low Point, and the village of Fishkill. The church was dedicated in 1861. In 1877 Father John C. Henry became pastor of St. Joachim's. Father Henry founded a parochial school, introduced the Sisters of Charity to teach there, enlarged the church and rectory, and paid off considerable debt.Nutt, J.J., Newburgh, her Institutions, Industries, and Leading citizens, Ritchie & Hull, Newburgh, NY, 1891, p.147 St. Joachim's held a year-long celebration of its 150 anniversary from December 2002 through December 2003. Mission parishes In 1861, Fr. Coyle established a mission church, St. Mary's, in Fishkill which was dedicated in October 1864. It remained a mission church for 92 years until Cardinal Spellman established it as a separate parish in 1953. To meet the increasing needs in the area, Rev. Terrence Kelly, pastor 1890-1900, established a mission church, St. Francis, in Timoneyville (now Dutchess Junction) in 1899. Francis Timoney owned four brickyards between Verplanck Point and Brockway, and built a church for the workers. St. Francis closed as a mission church in 1928 with the dwindling number of workers in the brickyards and the building was dismantled.Fishkill Historical Society. Around Fishkill, Arcadia Publishing, 1996, , p. 109 He was the first Catholic priest to offer Mass in Matteawan State Hospital, which came under the care of St. Joachim's in 1892. This meant that St. Joachim's now had three mission churches; St. Mary's in Fishkill, St. Francis in Timoneyville and Matteawan State Hospital. In 1924, priests from St. Joachim's began saying Mass in the Veterans‚Äô Hospital at Castle Point. St. Joachim's School A parochial school began in 1861. The Sisters of Charity of Mt. St. Vincent began teaching in the school in 1883. The Sisters of Charity served St. Joachim's School for just over 100 years, ending in 1984. Pastors *Rev. Denis Sheehan (1853-1860) *Rev.

(New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.403 The parish was formed in 1887. Rev. John Hurley was appointed as the first pastor. The first Mass was celebrated on that Christmas. The original St. John's Church was the old Swift's Hall. It was dedicated by Archbishop Corrigan in 1888, but burned to the ground in 1890. After the former opera house burned services were held for a time, in a printing-office and later over a livery stable. The \\"Elm Tree\\" property was purchased from Lewis Tompkins for the new church. Rev. John J. McGrath was appointed in 1890. The present St. John's Church was built in 1891. St. John's School A school was opened as soon as possible in the basement of the new church (1890s), but it didn‚Äôt succeed at that time. The Sisters of Charity of Matteawan conducted Sunday School until 1909 when a new school was built. The Sisters of Mercy first taught in the school, followed by the Sisters of Charity of Mt. St. Vincent until 1943 when the School Sisters of St. Francis replaced them. The school was renovated, expanded and rededicated by Cardinal Spellman in 1951. Cardinal Spellman was the first prince of the church to visit Beacon. The schools merged in 1990 and closed at the end of the school year in 2001. Pastors *Rev. John A. Hurley (1887-1890) *Rev.

Robert Carden (1957-1961) became the first Spanish-speaking priest assigned to the parish specifically to minister to the growing Puerto Rican population in Beacon. Mass began to be offered regularly in Spanish in the lower hall. Rev. Rogelio Cuesta, O.P., Director of the Newburgh ‚Äì Beacon Spanish Apostolate, ministered to the Spanish speaking community from 1972 to 1978. He was assisted by sisters of the Daughters of Jesus order. Fr. Fenlon was assisted in the Spanish Apostolate by the sisters of the Daughters of Divine Love. Merger The two parishes in Beacon were officially combined into one parish effective January 2, 2004, with Fr. Bisignano as pastor. To provide for additional priests for the parish, an agreement with the Diocese of Auchi in Nigeria provides two priests of that diocese to serve in the parish for as part of their development. =Pastors= *Rev.

Defending features were added including \\"New Defender AI\\" making defenders hold their positions naturally and no longer chasing balls that enter their area and forcing them into a mistake. \\"Improved Goalkeeping\\" was the second part to the defense features, adding players more control over their goalkeepers for more saves and accuracy. \\"Animation and Player Physics\\" adds players moving with more natural movements and acceleration. The physical looks of players is also improved. Excessive movement now looks much better, while there is a larger variety of convincing tackling styles. Realistic animation also adds to the atmosphere, as players move better. A new \\"Speed of Play\\" makes for a more considered pace.

The trading strategy is optimized with in- sample data for a time window in a data series. The remaining data is reserved for out of sample testing. A small portion of the reserved data following the in-sample data is tested and the results are recorded. The in-sample time window is shifted forward by the period covered by the out of sample test, and the process repeated. Lastly, all of the recorded results are used to assess the trading strategy. After the most suitable parameters are found, the system is run using another segment of data. The two segments of data do not overlap each other. It is the culmination of the following methods and aids in creation of robust systems. Past data is used for Backtesting of a trading system. It refers to applying a trading system to historical data to verify how a system would have performed during the specified time period and is useful if a system was not profitable in the past. Forward testing (also known as Walk forward testing) is the simulation of the real markets' data on paper only. One moves along the markets live and is not using real money, but virtually trading in the markets to understand their movements better. Hence, it is also called Paper Trading. Forward performance testing is a simulation of actual trading and involves following the system's logic in a live market. Overview One of the biggest issues with system development is that many systems do not hold up into the future. There are several reasons for this. The first is that the system is not based on a valid premise. Another is that the testing is not sound for reasons such as: * Lack of robustness in a system due to improper parameters. A system is considered robust if it runs well in any market conditions. * Inconsistent rules and improper testing of the system using 'out-of-sample' and 'in-sample' data. Walk Forward Analysis does optimization on a training set; test on a period after the set and then rolls it all forward and repeats the process. We have multiple out-of-sample periods and look at these results combined. Walk forward analysis was originally discussed by Robert E. Pardo. Walking forward can keep a trading model a step ahead. Walk forward is so called, as we have multiple walk training and testing periods is less likely to suffer from overfitting. Walk forward testing allows us to develop a trading system while maintaining a reasonable 'degree of freedom'. Walk-forward testing carries the idea of 'out-of-sample' testing to the next level. It is a specific application of a technique known as Cross-validation. It means to take a segment of your data to optimize a system, and another segment of data to validate. Hence, here you optimize a window of data say past 1000 bars, and then test it on next 200 bars. Then roll the whole thing forward 200 bars and repeat the process. This gives you a large out of sample period and allows you to see how stable the system is over time. Suppose you consider a strategy around a moving average. You take the first 3 months of data, and find that for that period a 20-minute moving average was optimal (using tick data). You then validate this rule by assessing its performance for the 4th month (i.e. profit, reward/risk or any other statistic of interest). Next, you repeat the optimization using data from month 2‚Äì4, and validate using month 5, and keep repeating this until you've reached the end of the data. The performance you get for the validation months (4-13) are your out-of-sample performance. =The basics behind the data used= Before doing the backtesting or optimization, one needs to set up the data required which is the historical data of a specific time period. This historical data segment is divided into the following two types: * In-Sample Data: It is a past segment of market data (historical data) reserved for testing purposes. This data is used for the initial testing and any optimization and is the original parameters of a system under test. * Out-of- Sample Data: It is the reserved data set (historical data) which is not a part of the in-sample data. It is important as this ensures that the system is tested on another period of historical data not earlier thus removing any bias or influences in the checking of the system's performance. The process is to first develop a trading system using in-sample data and then apply the out-of- sample data to the system. The results of both cases can then be compared and tested. =Conclusion= For a better understanding, please see the example here. In order to evaluate any system, one should check out its performance when using the \\"Out-of-Sample Data\\" (test data) and not the \\"In-Sample Data\\" (data used for optimization of the system). Thus, walk forward test determines the optimized system performance as follows: * Was it realistic? It is considered realistic if it could fit to the entire test data (or at least to a larger segment of the test data) used. It implies that the system has the characteristics of the real time markets and is robust. * Is it overfitting? If the system does not perform well using the test data and seems to fit only chance characteristics (not necessarily part of the test data), the system is considered to be overfitting. It is neither a robust nor reliable one and ought not to be used for trading. Hence, the out-of-sample data plays a crucial role in determining the validity and reliability of the system and is a realistic estimate of how a system should work in real markets.

Rivalries have arisen for many different reasons, the primary ones including geographic proximity, familiarity with opponents, various incidents, and cultural, linguistic, or national pride. Background In the \\"Original 16\\" era (1901‚Äì60), there were eight teams in each league and teams in each league played each other 22 times a season. With the second American League incarnation of the Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers) and the Los Angeles Angels entering play as expansion teams in , MLB increased the total number of games American League teams played to 162, which meant teams would play each other 18 times a season. The National League did not implement this until the following year when the New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s (now the Houston Astros) entered play. In , with the San Diego Padres, Seattle Pilots, Kansas City Royals, and Montreal Expos entering play as expansion teams, MLB split both leagues into two divisions with six teams each. Teams played a total of 90 intra-divisional games, playing teams within the division 18 times each and 72 inter-divisional games, playing each team in the other division 12 times. However, in , the addition of the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays reduced the number of intra-divisional games American League teams played to 78, as each team would play each team within the division 13 times. However, they still played each team in the other division 12 times, but the total number of inter-divisional games increased to 84. The National League did not institute this until , when the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies entered play. In , MLB split each league into three divisions, but kept the 1993 format in scheduling. In , with the MLB adopting interleague play, the schedules were changed. The schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series, namely six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of 16 NL teams. MLB changed its scheduling format in , further intensifying division matchups throughout the league. The new \\"unbalanced schedule\\" allowed for additional games in each season between divisional rivals, replacing additional series with teams outside the division. Due to the change, division rivals now played each other 17 or more times each season. The scheduling drew criticism both when it was enacted and after the fact, with some analysts even positing that the unbalanced schedule hurt intra-divisional play. With the Astros moving to the American League West in , MLB changed its scheduling formula as a result of each division having five teams. Teams play a total of 76 intra-divisional games, playing teams within the division 19 times each, and six or seven games against other teams in their leagues and 20 interleague games. The move of the Astros led to interleague play throughout the season. The number of interleague games against natural rivals was reduced from six to four. American League =American League East= Boston Red Sox vs. New York Yankees The Red Sox‚ÄìYankees rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous and fiercest rivalries in American sports. For more than 100 years, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees have been intense rivals. The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the Northeastern United States. Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series, the AL East rivals have squared off in the American League Championship Series three times, with the Yankees winning in 1999 and 2003 and the Sox winning in 2004. The two also faced off in the American League Division Series in 2018, with the Red Sox winning in four games. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in (when the Red Sox won) and (when the Yankees won). The teams also finished tied for first in , when the Yankees won a high-profile one-game playoff for the division title. The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, the 2004 ALCS is famous for the Yankees leading 3‚Äì0 and ultimately losing a best-of-7 series. The Red Sox comeback is the only time in baseball history to date that a team has come back from a 3‚Äì0 deficit to win a series. In 2019, the rivalry was showcased in the first London Series, with the Yankees winning both games. The rivalry is often termed the \\"greatest rivalry in all of sports.\\" Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. In the stands it is very common for Yankees fans and Red Sox fans to taunt each other and more than occasionally get into fistfights, so security at both Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park is heavy when either team comes to town. Boston Red Sox vs. Tampa Bay Rays Since 1998, the rivalry between the Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays has intensified, despite the fact that, as of 2020, the Rays have only existed for 22 years. The two teams met in the 2008 ALCS with the Rays winning the series en route to their first World Series appearance. The two teams have had many notable incidents over the years, including: * August 29, 2000: The Devil Rays' (as they were then known) Gerald Williams is hit by a pitch thrown by the Red Sox' Pedro Mart√≠nez. Williams charges the mound and lands a right hook on Martinez, and the benches clear (by the end of the game, multiple Rays hitters had been ejected). * September 29, 2000: Rays closer Roberto Hernandez strikes out the Red Sox' Trot Nixon, eliminating the Sox from playoff contention; Hernandez sarcastically waves goodbye to the Red Sox team as the Rays celebrate on the mound. * May 5, 2002: Nixon throws his bat at Rays pitcher Ryan Rupe, who had hit the Sox' Nomar Garciaparra and Shea Hillenbrand earlier in the game. Red Sox pitcher Frank Castillo dove into the ensuing melee, and was suspended for five games (as was Nixon, for four). Rupe got away with a fine. * April 24, 2005: The third game of a Rays/Red Sox series saw Bronson Arroyo hit Aubrey Huff; Rays starter Lance Carter retaliates by throwing at Manny Ramirez. Ramirez subsequently hit a home run off Carter, who then drilled David Ortiz, causing a melee in which six players were ejected. * March 27, 2006: Red Sox' Juli√°n Tav√°rez is suspended for 10 games following a brawl at the plate against Joey Gathright. * June 5, 2008: James Shields of the Rays throws at the Sox' Coco Crisp (in retaliation for an earlier play in which Crisp had slid hard into Akinori Iwamura at second base). Crisp charges the mound and brawls with Shields, and both benches clear. * May 25, 2012: Dustin Pedroia is hit by a pitch thrown by the Rays' Burke Badenhop; Franklin Morales retaliates by hitting Luke Scott. Benches clear, but no punches were thrown (although the Rays' B.J. Upton later exchanges harsh words with a Sox fan in the Fenway Park stands). * June 10, 2013: Matt Joyce of the Rays hits a home run off of the Red Sox' John Lackey. In Joyce's next at-bat, he almost hits another home run, but is eventually thrown out at first base; Lackey has some choice words for Joyce as the two teams walk off the field. Lackey then hits Joyce with a pitch, prompting a bench-clearing brawl. The acrimony even spilled over onto Twitter, where the two teams regularly traded barbs. * July 29, 2013: Umpire Jerry Meals incorrectly ruled Daniel Nava of the Red Sox out at home plate in the eighth inning against the Rays which would have tied the game. The Rays eventually held on for a 2-1 victory. Red Sox manager John Farrell was ejected for arguing the call, in which Meals later admitted was incorrect. * May 25, 2014: Yunel Escobar, who had just doubled home two runs to give the Rays an 8-3 lead, takes third base on defensive indifference. Red Sox catcher David Ross, in the Boston dugout, trades barbs with Escobar; Escobar retaliates and is then shoved by Red Sox left fielder Jonny Gomes, a former Ray, and the benches clear. Gomes, Escobar and Sean Rodriguez are all ejected. * May 30, 2014: In the first inning, David Price hits David Ortiz with a pitch; manager John Farrell comes out to argue and is quickly ejected. Three innings later, Price drills Mike Carp but is not ejected, and both benches clear. Red Sox bench coach Torey Lovullo, who had taken over for Farrell, is ejected, replaced by third base coach Brian Butterfield. In the top of the sixth inning, Sox reliever Brandon Workman throws behind Evan Longoria and is immediately ejected, as was Butterfield. * July 27, 2014: David Ortiz hits a home run in the 3rd inning at Tropicana Field, unleashing a bat flip towards the Red Sox dugout in the process. Rays pitchers David Price and Chris Archer take exception to Ortiz' actions, accusing him of showboating and thinking that he is \\"bigger than the game of baseball.\\" Ortiz retorts that Archer is \\"not the right guy to be saying that\\" and defends his own actions, saying that \\"It's pretty much what I do.\\" =American League West= Lone Star Series: Texas Rangers vs. Houston Astros The Silver Boot is awarded annually to the winner of the Lone Star Series The Lone Star Series (also, Silver Boot Series) is a Major League Baseball rivalry featuring Texas' two major league franchises, the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros. It is an outgrowth of the \\"natural rivalry\\" established by MLB as part of interleague play as the Rangers are a member of the American League and the Astros were a member of the National League until . During interleague play, the winner of the 6-game series was awarded the Silver Boot. A tall display of a size-15 cowboy boot cast in silver, complete with a custom, handmade spur. If the series was split (3-to-3), the winner was the club which scored the most runs over the course of the series. In , the Astros joined the American League West with the Rangers and changed their rivalry from an interleague to an intra-division rivalry, the Astros played their first game in the American League against the Rangers on Sunday Night Baseball that season. In 2015, both teams made the playoffs and were in a tight division race during most of the season. Los Angeles Angels vs. Texas Rangers The Rangers and Angels rivalry has developed in recent years due to the amount of former players from each team playing for the division rival. Angels players such as Mike Napoli, Darren Oliver, Vladimir Guerrero, Bengie Molina, Kevin Jepsen, Bartolo Col√≥n, and Texas players Josh Hamilton, C. J. Wilson, Ian Kinsler, David Murphy, and Yorvit Torrealba are all acquisitions the two division rivals made of former rival players. In 2012 C. J. Wilson played a joke on former teammate Mike Napoli in tweeting his phone number, causing Napoli to exchange words with Wilson. The feuds go back to Angels Adam Kennedy and Rangers Gerald Laird arguing leading to punches being thrown multiple times causing small fights between the teams in the past. =Inter-divisional= Seattle Mariners vs New York Yankees Teams met 3 times in postseason starting with a memorable 5-game series followed by 2 other semifinal battles for the pennant 2000-01, both won by the Yankees. In all 3 serieses, the Mariners were coached by former Yankee player Lou Pinella. Texas Rangers vs Toronto Blue Jays The Rangers-Blue Jays feud started in the seventh inning of Game 5 in the 2015 ALDS. With the score tied 2‚Äì2, two outs, and Rougned Odor on third base, Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin accidentally hit the bat of Rangers outfielder Shin Soo Choo on his throw back to the mound, and Odor came around to score on the error. After a lengthy review process, the umpires determined that Odor should be allowed to score, infuriating the Toronto crowd; Choo would strike out on the next pitch to end the inning. In the bottom half, with Martin leading off, he hit a ground ball that was bobbled by Elvis Andrus and reached base. The next batter, Kevin Pillar, hit a grounder to Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland who's low throw could not be handled by Andrus, leading to another error and two men on, nobody out, with Ryan Goins coming to the plate. Goins bunted the ball to the third base side, where it was fielded by Adrian Beltre, who threw to Andrus covering third base. Andrus again kicked the ball, his second error of the inning, to load the bases, with still nobody out. After Ben Revere hit a weak grounder which Texas cut down the run at the plate to get the first out, Sam Dyson came on to pitch with the bases still loaded, but one out. Jays third baseman and 2015 AL MVP Josh Donaldson hit a flare to the right side, and Odor misplayed the ball, leading to the tying run crossing the plate. However, on the same play, he was able to recover in time to throw to second base for the second out, bringing up slugging Jays outfielder Jos√© Bautista with runners on the corners and two outs. On a 1‚Äì1 count, Bautista smoked a line drive home run to left field to put Toronto ahead 6‚Äì3 and did a dramatic bat flip to celebrate. The Rangers took offense to Bautista's actions, and the benches cleared. The same score hold the rest of the game, sending the Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series, and the Rangers back home. The following season, on May 15, 2016, the two teams met again for the final time of the regular season, at Globe Life Park in Arlington, home of the Rangers. In the top of the eighth inning, with the Blue Jays batting, but the Rangers leading 7-6, pitcher Matt Bush hit Jose Bautista with a pitch. Two batters later, Justin Smoak was at bat for Toronto. With one out, and Bautista on first, Smoak hit a ground ball to Beltre at third base, who relayed to Odor at second, and then to Moreland at first to complete the inning ending double play. However, on that play, Bautista took a hard slide into Odor at second, which Odor took exception to. After some pushing and shoving, Odor punched Bautista in the face with a right hook, and the benches cleared. For their roles in the altercation, Odor was suspended eight games; Bautista one. Following the Blue Jays defeat of the Baltimore Orioles in the 2016 American League Wild Card Game, the Rangers and Blue Jays met once again in the 2016 American League Division Series where once again, the Blue Jays swept the Rangers 3‚Äì0. New York Yankees vs. Houston Astros While fairly new, the Yankees-Astros rivalry has quickly grown to the forefront of baseball. While their first postseason meeting was in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game, which Houston won 3-0, the rivalry didn't truly begin until they met in the 2017 American League Championship Series, which Houston also won in seven games. The two would later meet in the 2019 American League Championship Series, with the Astros winning in six games. The animosity between the two teams has only grown stronger in recent years, especially due to the revelations of the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal , which some believe cost the Yankees the 2017 pennant (and indirectly led to the ouster of Joe Girardi from his post as team manager), and players from both teams attacking each other in the media and on Twitter. During the 2019-2020 offseason, the Yankees signed pitcher Gerrit Cole away from the Astros. National League =National League East= Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets The Braves‚ÄìMets rivalry is a rivalry between the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets. Both clubs are members of Major League Baseball's National League (NL) East division. The rivalry between the two clubs was particularly fierce during the late 1990s and early 2000s. as both teams competed for postseason berths and, most notably, met in the 1999 NLCS. New York Mets vs. Philadelphia Phillies The Mets‚ÄìPhillies rivalry is a rivalry between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies. Both clubs are members of MLB's National League (NL) East division. The rivalry between the two clubs is said to be among the most fiercely contested in the NL. The two NL East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, division, and Wild Card races. Aside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained relatively low- key before the 2006 season, as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. A notable moment in their early meetings was Jim Bunning's perfect game on Father's Day of 1964, the first perfect game in Phillies history, which happened when the Mets were on a losing streak. The Phillies were near the bottom of the NL East when the Mets won the 1969 World Series and the National League pennant in 1973, while the Mets did not enjoy success in the late 1970s when the Phillies won three straight division championships. Although both teams each won a World Series in the 1980s, the Mets were not serious contenders in the Phillies' playoff years (1980, 1981, and 1983), nor did the Phillies seriously contend in the Mets' playoff years (1986 and 1988). The Mets were the Majors' worst team when the Phillies won the NL pennant in 1993, and the Phillies could not post a winning record in either of the Mets' wild-card-winning seasons of 1999 or 2000, when the Mets faced the New York Yankees in the 2000 World Series. As the rivalry has intensified in recent years, the teams have battled more often for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies' 2007 championship was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining. The Phillies broke the Curse of Billy Penn to win the 2008 World Series, while the Mets' last title came in the 1986 World Series. In 2015, the Mets won the National League Championship Series for their fifth pennant while the Phillies entered a rebuild phase. The Mets beat the Phillies 14 times and lost 5 for a lopsided season series. The season still provided contentious moments such as, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilling Phillies 2nd baseman Chase Utley in retaliation for Mets players getting hit by Phillies pitchers, a benches clearing argument between Phillies coach Larry Bowa in regards to a quick pitch by Hansel Robles and a bat flip by Daniel Murphy. =National League Central= I-94 Series: Chicago Cubs vs. Milwaukee Brewers The Brewers‚ÄìCubs rivalry (also known as the I-94 rivalry due to two ballparks being 83.3 miles from each other off Interstate 94) refers to games between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs. Chicago Cubs vs. St. Louis Cardinals The Cardinals‚ÄìCubs rivalry refers to games between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. The Cubs lead the series 1,091‚Äì1,044 through , while the Cardinals lead in National League pennants with 19 against 17 for the Cubs. However, the Cardinals have a clear edge when it comes to World Series successes, having won 11 championships, while the Cubs have only won 3. Cardinals-Cubs games see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis' Busch Stadium or Chicago's Wrigley Field. When the National League split into two, and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. They had 3 pennant races in 1930, 1935, and 1945. The two teams met in the World Series of the nineteenth century when the Cardinals, then known as the Browns, were part of the American Association. The teams tied in 1885 and St. Louis won in 1886. St. Louis, however, has officially vacated their history from the AA. The first modern postseason meeting between the two teams was the 2015 NLDS, which the Cubs won 3 games to 1 before losing the 2015 NLCS to the New York Mets. The Cubs would go on to win the World Series over the Cleveland Indians the following year. Ben Zobrist, who grew up a Cardinals fan in the Peoria area, was named the World Series MVP for the Cubs. Cincinnati Reds vs. Pittsburgh Pirates The rivalry between the Reds and Pirates is one of the most intense in baseball. The rivalry was really intense in the 1970s, when the two teams met in the NLCS four times with Cincinnati winning the first three in 1970, 1972, and 1975, before the Pirates finally beat the Reds in 1979. In the decade, the Reds and Pirates both won six division titles and two World Series championships each. The two teams would renew their rivalry in 1990, with the Reds winning in six games on their way to winning the World Series. The two teams would meet in the 2013 NL Wild Card Game. The Pirates won the game to advance to the NL Division Series, which they would lose in five games to the St. Louis Cardinals. =National League West= Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants The Dodgers‚ÄìGiants rivalry began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles for financial reasons, among others. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in economic, cultural, and political arenas, the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation. Each team's ability to have endured for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's growth from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history. Unlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers‚ÄìGiants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams. While the Giants have more wins, National League pennants and World Series titles in franchise history, the Dodgers have won the National League West twelve times compared to the Giants' eight. The 2014 World Series was the Giants' third championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers' have won five, the most recent in the 1988 World Series. Interleague =Background= Early discussions about interleague play Interleague or interconference matchups have long been the norm in other professional sports leagues such as the National Football League. Regular-season interleague play was discussed for baseball's major leagues as early as the 1930s. In December 1956, Major League owners considered a proposal by Cleveland general manager and minority-owner Hank Greenberg to implement limited interleague play beginning in 1958. Under Greenberg's proposal, each team would continue to play 154-games in the season, 126 of which would be within the league, and 28 against the 8 clubs in the other league. The interleague games would all be played during a period immediately following the All-Star Game. Notably, under Greenberg's proposal, all results would count in regular season game standings and league statistics. While this proposal was not adopted, the current system shares many elements. Bill Veeck predicted in 1963 that Major League Baseball would someday have interleague play. The concept did not take hold until the 1990s (at least in part as an effort to renew the public's interest in MLB following the 1994 players' strike). First Interleague games MLB's first regular season interleague game took place on June 12, 1997, when the Texas Rangers hosted the San Francisco Giants at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. There were four interleague games on the schedule that night, but the other three were played on the West Coast, so the Giants‚ÄìRangers matchup started a few hours earlier than the others. Texas' Darren Oliver threw the game's first pitch and San Francisco outfielder Glenallen Hill was the first designated hitter used in a regular-season game by a National League team. San Francisco's Stan Javier hit the first home run in interleague play, and the Giants won the game 4‚Äì3. For the first five seasons of Interleague Play, each division played against the same division from the other league (NL East vs. AL East, NL Central vs. AL Central and NL West vs. AL West), typically scheduled to alternate between home and away in consecutive years. However, in 2002, a new format to Interleague Play was instituted where teams play Interleague games against various divisions. Matchups which had been of particular interest prior to this format‚Äîmainly geographic rivals‚Äîwere preserved. This is expected to be the continuing format of the interleague schedule. Corresponding divisions however, were skipped once when this rotation began, but were put back in the rotation in 2006. From 2002‚Äì12, all interleague games were played prior to the All-Star Game. Most games were played in June, though May games have been scheduled since 2005. Among the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \\"home and home\\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these matches feature two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six are regional matches at greater distance, four of which are in the same state. =Battle of the Beltways: Baltimore Orioles vs. Washington Nationals= Known as the Beltway Battle and as the Battle of the Beltways, after Washington's Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) and Baltimore's Baltimore Beltway (I-695). The two teams first met in 2006, one year after the Montreal Expos relocated from Montreal to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals. Much of this rivalry is dominated by off-the field issues. Baltimore owner Peter Angelos publicly opposed relocating the Expos to Washington, which he believed was a part of his territorial rights after the departure of the second incarnation of the Washington Senators after the 1971 season. There are also controversies surrounding the value of the Nationals' television rights and their coverage on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. =Crosstown Classic: Chicago White Sox vs. Chicago Cubs= The White Sox-Cubs rivalry (also known as the BP Crosstown Cup, Crosstown Classic, The Windy City Showdown, Red Line Series, City Series, Crosstown Series, Crosstown Cup or Crosstown Showdown) refers to the rivalry between two Major League Baseball teams that play their home games in Chicago, Illinois. The Chicago Cubs of the NL play their home games at Wrigley Field located on the city's North side, while the Chicago White Sox of the AL play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field on the city's South side. The terms \\"North Siders\\" and \\"South Siders\\" are synonymous with the respective teams and their fans, setting up an enduring rivalry. The Chicago Transit Authority's Red Line runs north-south through Chicago's neighborhoods, stopping at Wrigley Field on Addison Street and Guaranteed Rate Field on 35th Street. Notably this rivalry actually predates the Interleague Play Era, with the only postseason meeting occurring in the 1906 World Series. It was the first World Series between teams from the same city. The White Sox won the series 4 games to 2, over the highly favored Cubs who had won a record 116 games during the regular season. The rivalry continued through of exhibition games, culminating in the Crosstown Classic from 1985‚Äì1995, in which the White Sox were undefeated at 10‚Äì0‚Äì2. The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 49‚Äì44. There have been nine series sweeps since interleague play began: six by the Cubs in 1998, 2004, 2007, 2008 and both series in 2013, and three by the White Sox in 1999, 2008 and 2012. =Battle of Ohio: Cincinnati Reds vs. Cleveland Indians= The Ohio Cup is between the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, and the Cleveland Indians of the American League. Both teams' cities are about 250 miles away via I-71. As of the end of the 2019 season, the Indians are ahead of the Reds by 7 with an all time rivalry record 60-53. =Show-Me Series: Kansas City Royals vs. St. Louis Cardinals= The rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League and Kansas City Royals of the American League is a Major League Baseball series sometimes known as the I-70 Series or the Show-Me Series. This rivalry is so called because the two cities are located in the state of Missouri, whose nickname is the \\"Show Me State\\", and both cities are located along Interstate 70. They played each other for the first time in the 1985 World Series, which the Royals won in seven games. Owing to their geographical proximity, the teams face each other every regular season in interleague play. This prominent rivalry began with Royals' successes in the early '80's and fueled by the Royals' victory over the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series. The series is still a source of contention among fans, notably the controversial call in the bottom of the ninth of game 6 in which Jorge Orta was called safe on a play that replays later showed him out. A Royals rally let them tie and later win the game and then later the series. =Freeway Series: Los Angeles Angels vs. Los Angeles Dodgers= The term Freeway Series refers to a series of baseball games played between Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels of the American League and Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The Freeway series is extremely popular in Los Angeles and normally sells out their games due to the close proximity of both teams and their fans. =Subway Series: New York Mets vs. New York Yankees= The Mets‚ÄìYankees rivalry is the latest incarnation of the Subway Series, the competition between New York City's Major League Baseball teams, the AL Yankees and NL Mets. Until Interleague play started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the teams have met in every season since 1997 and faced off in the 2000 World Series. =Bay Bridge Series: Oakland Athletics vs. San Francisco Giants= The Bay Bridge Series is the name of the games played between‚Äîand rivalry of‚Äîthe Oakland Athletics of the AL and San Francisco Giants of the NL. The series takes its name from the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco. Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to Cubs‚ÄìWhite Sox, or Mets‚ÄìYankees games where animosity runs high. While many fans have a very strong dislike for the other team, some others actually like both. Bay Area baseball fans tend to disagree with each other on this topic. The series is also occasionally referred to as the \\"BART Series\\" for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name \\"BART Series\\" has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the \\"Bay Bridge Series\\". Originally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training, immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series in which the Athletics won their most recent championship and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of interleague play in 1997. Through August 2015, the A's have won 53 games, and the Giants have won 50. =Citrus Series: Miami Marlins vs. Tampa Bay Rays= The Citrus Series is the name given to the interleague series between the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball. The Marlins broke into the league in 1993 as the Florida Marlins, while the Rays had their first season in 1998 as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first meeting between the two teams took place on June 22, 1998 at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida during the Rays' inaugural season. Beginning with the 2012 season, when the Marlins are the home team, games are played at Marlins Park. From 1998 to 2011, the games were played at the NFL's Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium (as it is currently named), though it has been known by several names in its existence. Overall, The Rays lead the series with 55 wins and the Marlins currently trail with 52 wins. Historical =Cincinnati Reds vs. Los Angeles Dodgers= The Dodgers‚ÄìReds rivalry was one of the most intense during the 1970s and '80s. They often competed for the NL West division title. From 1970‚Äì90, they had eleven 1‚Äìv2 finishes in the standings, with seven of them being within 5¬Ω games or fewer. Both teams also played in numerous championships during this span, combining to win 10 NL Pennants and 5 World Series titles from ‚Äì. Reds manager Sparky Anderson once said, \\"I don't think there's a rivalry like ours in either league. The Giants are supposed to be the Dodgers' natural rivals, but I don't think the feeling is there anymore. It's not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers.\\" The rivalry ended when division realignment moved the Reds to the NL Central. However, they did face one another in the 1995 NLDS. =Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Yankees= The Dodgers‚ÄìYankees rivalry is one of the most well- known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues. The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States. =New York Yankees vs. San Francisco Giants= The rivalry between the New York Giants and New York Yankees was intense as both teams not only inhabited New York City but also, for a time, the same ballpark. During that era the opportunities for them to meet could only have been in a World Series. Both teams kicked off the first Subway Series between the NL and AL in 1921. =Philadelphia Phillies vs. Pittsburgh Pirates= The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the NL. The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered play in 1887, four years after the Phillies. The Phillies and Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in . During the period of two-division play (1969‚Äì), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, the Pirates 9, the Phillies 6; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span. However, after the Pirates moved to the National League Central in , the rivalry ended. The teams have since faced each other only in two series per year and the rivalry has effectively died in the years since the Pirates moved out of the NL East. =Philadelphia Phillies vs. Oakland Athletics= The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and Oakland Athletics, also known as the Philadelphia City Series was at its most intense from 1901-1955, when the Oakland Athletics played in Philadelphia. The rivalry was significant not only because both teams played in Philadelphia, but because of the strong competition between the National and American Leagues. The competition between the leagues was so strong that the A's and Phillies did not play at all from 1901‚Äì02 because of legal warring between the two parties. Related to growing tensions between the rival leagues, superstar Nap Lajoie had played for several years on the Phillies, but was displeased with the salary cap of $2,400 placed by the National League. When the American League was formed in 1901 and the A's joined it, Lajoie was offered a contract by Frank Hough of the Athletics on behalf of A's manager Connie Mack. When asked by a reporter what motivated him to leave, he responded \\"[Frank] Hough offered me $24,000 ($682,656 in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry!\\" As a result, the Phillies filed a lawsuit to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court banning Lajoie from playing for any professional team. However, the decree only applied to teams in Pennsylvania, so Lajoie signed with the Cleveland Bronchos. When the decree expired, the Phillies chose not to file it again, and Lajoie left Cleveland to sign with the A's. When the National League and American League merged in 1903, the rivalry became more friendly. Games between the two teams were played in many different stadiums throughout Philadelphia as older ones fell into disrepair and newer ones were built. Stadiums included Shibe Park, Philadelphia Park, as well as others. The final City Series game was played in 1954. In 1955, the Athletics moved to Kansas City after another dismal season in Philadelphia. The rivalry continued in spring training games until the Athletics moved to their permanent spring training facility in Mesa, Arizona. The rivalry has effectively died since then. =Toronto Blue Jays vs. Montreal Expos= Being the only two Canadian baseball teams in the major leagues, a rivalry between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos was inevitable. This rivalry was assisted by the presence of the Pearson Cup, an award that was given to the winner of a special midseason match (later incorporated into the MLB interleague schedule). However, this rivalry was subdued, as the two teams played in different leagues. In 2004, the rivalry came to an end when the Expos moved to Washington to become the Washington Nationals. = St. Louis Cardinals vs. Houston Astros = From 1996 to 2006, either the St. Louis Cardinals or the Houston Astros won the National League Central every year except for 2003. In 2004 and 2005, both teams played each other in the NLCS. In the 2004 NLCS the St. Louis Cardinals won in seven game and in the 2005 NLCS the Houston Astros won in six games. The Houston Astros moved from the National League to the American League after the 2012 season.

The KD2C-1 first flew in 1947, however it was found unsatisfactory and the program was cancelled in 1949. Design and development The KD2C was a target drone, powered by a pulsejet engine and intended for air-launch for use in fleet gunnery training. The KD2C-1 was powered by a Continental pulsejet engine, in diameter; the KD2C-2 used a McDonnell J-9 or J-11 pulsejet of the same diameter. Control was provided by a radio command system, assisted by a gyrostabilizer. The KD2N could reach a top speed of and had an endurance of 30 minutes. Operational history Begun in August 1945, the first prototype KD2C flew for the first time in 1947. The Skeet's internally mounted pulsejet proved unsatisfactory, however, as it produced low speed and high fuel consumption in both wind tunnel and flight tests at the Navy's Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, California. As a result, the KD2C program was cancelled in 1949, and the last of the produced aircraft were out of service by 1951.

He was among the first in the academic law community to engage in human rights activism. Born and brought up in Newry, Boyle studied law at Queen's University Belfast. He was a lecturer in law at Queen's when he took part in the 1969 People's Democracy march from Belfast to Derry which was attacked by loyalists at Burntollet. He was later involved in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Boyle's brother, Louis Boyle, also an alumnus of Queen's, was at the time active as a Catholic Unionist, and unsuccessfully sought to be the Unionist and Conservative candidate for South Down in the 1969 Stormont elections. In the 1970s Boyle took up a post at University College, Galway (UCG, now the National University of Ireland, Galway). He became dean of the Faculty of Law in 1978, and in 1980 established the UCG human rights centre. In the 1980s he helped to develop the Essex Human Rights Law Centre, founded by Professor Malcolm Shaw, at the University of Essex in Colchester, England. Boyle was involved in several missions on behalf of Amnesty International in the 1980s. Later, he served as the first director of the human rights NGO Article 19 from 1986‚Äì1989. In 1990 he became director of the Human Rights Centre at Essex, holding that position until 2001.

Operational history Originating in 1949, the XK5DG-1 first flew in 1950, and was tested at the Naval Air Test Center in Point Mugu, California. By 1952, however, the speed requirements for target drones had increased to the point that the KD5G was considered too slow for operational service, while pulsejets also lost efficiency quickly at higher altitudes; as a result the XK5G-1 project was cancelled.

He writes about Jewish mysticism and is also known for his work in the field of addiction recovery.Parsons, Monique (March 12, 2009). \\"Inside Chabad's 'Jewish Recovery' Movement\\". NPR. He is a weekly columnist for Ami magazine. Early life and education Taub grew up in a Lubavitcher home in Chicago. His father is a psychologist and his mother a speech pathologist. As a teen, he studied in the Central Lubavitch Yeshiva in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and received his rabbinic ordination. Career Taub credits his father's work as influential in his decision to a pursue a career in addiction therapy. He entered this field without any prior training, first leading a recovery group for Jewish men at the Chabad House in Milwaukee in 2006. Afterwards he undertook his own research in the field and wrote his first book, God of Our Understanding: Jewish Spirituality and Recovery from Addiction, in 2009. In his 2009 book, Taub asserts that ancient Jewish principles relate to 12-step treatment programs.Howard, Aaron (Nov. 18, 2010). \\"The addict in recovery ‚Äì doing holy work\\". Jewish Herald-Voice. Publishers Weekly called the book \\"a thoughtful counter to one criticism occasionally heard‚Äîthat the 12 steps are implicitly Christian - and a singular and valuable resource for those in need.\\"Publishers Weekly (Dec. 13, 2010). \\"Religion review\\" Taub posits that drugs are the addict's solution rather than his problem, and that those people who turn to chemicals or other compulsive behaviors such as overeating or gambling are attempting to fill a spiritual void.The Oakland Press (Dec. 22. 2010). \\"Emotional sobriety is topic of presentation\\". He has compared his work to that of Abraham J.

Rabbi Taub has become a phenomenon. Even as he is anchored within the Hasidic world, he has transcended it, first by reaching unaffiliated and secular Jews and then, most unexpectedly, by finding an eager audience among Christians.\\" In that same article, Taub clarified his approach to teaching non-Jewish groups by saying, \\"It's not about interfaith ... I'm a Jew who's been able to study my tradition, and I have information, and I can be helpful to the extent I can share the information.\\" Other activities Rabbi Taub is an exponent of the foundational Hasidic spiritual text, Tanya, for which he composed Map of Tanya for Kehot Publication Society, as well as the curriculum for a survey course on Tanya for the Jewish Learning Institute.Cohen, Leon (Jan. 27, 2006). \\"Local rabbi provides map for foundational Chabad book\\" .

Plot As Victor Armstrong visits his uncle, Judge Wesley Armstrong, in San Francisco, he is knocked unconscious by an unknown attacker. When he wakes up, Victor finds out that his uncle has been stabbed to death. The judge's private secretary, Phyllis Powers, finds the two men and calls the police to the scene. When Victor wakes upm he has the knife that stabbed his uncle in his hand. In another part of the city, Tommy Chan and his chauffeur Birmingham, discover a man trying to burglar his way into a house as they are walking home from the movies. They make a citizens arrest of the man, who turns out to be the house owner, district attorney Frank Bronson, trying to climb in through the window. Tommy, Who is the son of private detective Charlie Chan, and his chauffeur are put in jail because of their unlawful action. Bronson is head of investigating the judge's murder, and hears from the judge's butler, Bates, that Victor wasn't allowed into the judge's home, and had to climb in through the window in the same way Bronson did. In an interview with the police, Phyllis also tells them that she her Victor, who is her boyfriend, argued with the judge about the purchase Victor had made of some stock worth $30,000. Phyliis also heard how the judge contacted his lawyer Ed Seward and asked for a meet the following day, in order to update his will, to exclude Victor. This information gives Victor the most plausible motive for murdering the judge. Famous detective Chan visits Bronson, his old acquaintance, to apologize for his son and Birmingham and their behavior the other night. At his visit, Chan overhears that two sets of fingerprints were found on the knife used to kill the judge; one set belonging to Victor and one to hardened criminal Tony Pindello. Chan happens to know that Pindello was executed for another murder at San Quentin six months earlier. Pindello got his death sentence from Judge Armstrong. Chan is then asked by police investigator Ruark to help the police out on the case. When district attorney Bronson is shot and killed soon after, Pindello's fingerprints are again found on the scene, on Bronson's desk. While investigating the case at judge Armstrong's office, Chan and Ruark catch the judge's clerk Walter Somervale looking through the judge's files. The two men also find out that Seward, the judge's attorney, defended Pindello in the trial which ultimately sent him to the gallows. From the judge's documents they find that Seward is also working on a commission against racketeering. A letter addressed to Victor, to be opened in case the judge died, states that the judge had found evidence that Pindello may have been innocent of the murder for which he was convicted, and that Bronson was to be informed of this. Chan and Ruark go to find Tony's buried body, but finds his coffin has been dug up and removed. Fearing that Pindello's murder trial is connected to the judge's murder and racketeering, Chan sees to it that all the jurors involved in the ruling is taken into protective custody for the time being. They locate everyone but one, Thomas Cartwright, who is attacked in his home and killed before the policemen get there. Pindello's fingerprints are once again found on the murder scene. Chan looks into the fingerprints and learns that it is in fact possible to forge someone else's prints. He gathers Phyllis, Victor and Seward at the judge's home to confront them about the fake fingerprints. When all are gathered in the judge's study, the power is cut and everything turns dark. They are locked in by an unknown man holding a gun, but manage to break out again, and find all documents related to the racketeering, insurance fraud and Pindello gone. Chan discovers that Pindello has a brother, Joseph, who got a letter from Tony when he was in jail, saying he was about to be sentenced to death for a murder he didn't commit. Chan tells everyone that Joseph, to revenge his brother, Joseph was planning on killing everyone involved in the wrong sentencing of his brother, and dug up his brother's coffin. While Chan explains this, Joseph enters the room with a gun and explains that his real purpose for digging up the coffin was simply to give his brother a proper burial. Joseph is then overpowered by Seward, who grabs Joseph's gun. Chan goes on to explain the real murderer is Seward, because he was involved in an insurance scam with Pindello and wanted all the money for himself, thus framing Pindello for a murder to get rid of him. Seward, sure to get away now that he has a gun, explains how he copied Pindello's prints to lead the police on a false trail. Chan tells Seward that the gun isn't loaded, since he gave it to Joseph earlier, and that it was all part of a set-up. Seward tries to flee but is stopped by Birmingham and arrested.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/89800/Shanghai-Chest/  Cast  *Roland Winters as Charlie Chan *Victor Sen Yung as Tommy Chan *Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown *Russell Hicks as Dist.

Bailey Science Center at Valdosta State University in Valdosta, Georgia serves as the home of the Biology and Chemistry Departments. The facility is named after former VSU President Hugh C. Bailey who served from 1978 to 2001. History Bailey Science Center came about as a means of dealing with overcrowding and the lack of space for future growth facing both the Biology and Chemistry Departments.Boyd, Thressea H. VSU Alumni Voice, Summer 2001, Vol.1, No.3, Office of University Relations for the Office of Alumni Relations, Colson Printing Valdosta, Ga. The new science building was designed to take pressure off of Nevins Hall which had served as the science building at Valdosta State for nearly 30 years. Nevins' remaining occupants, after the new facility was completed and the Biology and Chemistry departments had moved, included the departments of mathematics, computer science, physics, astronomy, and geo-sciences.English, Victoria. ‚ÄúFaculty Begins Move‚Äù. Valdosta Daily Times. November 21, 2000 =Construction= The formal ground breaking ceremony took place on Sept. 26, 1996. Construction on the approximately building did not begin until the summer of 1998. The construction contract was awarded to M.M. Parrish Construction, Inc. of Gainesville, Fla. and the building architecture was designed by Ingram, Parris Group (IPG) of Valdosta. IPG enlisted the assistance of Lord, Aeck and Sargent of Atlanta and Research Facilities Design of San Diego to lend their design expertise in the area of laboratory facilities. Contracted in 1998, the facility was scheduled to be completed by October 15, 1999 with a budgeted cost of $19,296,000. Delays and cost overruns resulted in a completion date in late 2000, at a final cost of $22.4 million. Faculty of the Biology and Chemistry departments began moving into the new structure in November 2000, with the first classes held in January 2001. The structure was dedicated on April 23, 2001 and renamed in honor of High C. Bailey, former VSU president. Expansion A ground breaking was held on August 8, 2011 for the construction of a two-story 15,000-square- foot addition onto the southern side of Bailey Science Center. The $5.5 million project, scheduled for completion before the fall of 2012, includes two 75-seat multipurpose laboratories, two 30-seat classrooms, and 20 faculty offices. The architecture firm responsible for the addition is Stanley Beaman & Sears, Inc. of Atlanta. The Savannah office of Elkins Constructors, Inc. is providing construction management. Valdosta State University held an official opening for the addition to the Bailey Science Center on June 27, 2012. The event was attended by faculty, staff, and students, and featured Interim President Louis H. Levy, Student Government Association President Graham Davis, and incoming VSU President William J. McKinney cutting the ribbon to the new facility. The student population of VSU grew from 9,000 to over 13,000 in the time since Bailey first opened in 2001. The number of biology majors had more than doubled and between 30 and 40 chemistry majors graduate each year compared to two or three in 2000. The new facilities will accommodate the growth in science students while existing facilities will be used more for faculty and student research. Features The Bailey Science Center has 22 teaching and 19 research laboratories that occupy the entire north side of the building. In addition, it has four greenhouses on the rooftop; 11 classrooms, including four 48 seat classrooms, and one 96 seat classroom; a large auditorium which seats 275, and a smaller auditorium which seats 148; two conference rooms and 41 offices.

Career in Argentina Jos√© Miguel Noguera was the first born to Emma Morrone and Jos√© Paolino Noguera in Mataderos, a suburb west of Buenos Aires, where he grew up. Noguera married Teresa Rosa Pi√±eiro in Buenos Aires, Argentina, December 1938. Jos√© Noguera and Teresa had two daughters born in Argentina and a son in 1947 in Mexico City, Mexico. Noguera later, in 1952, had another son born, of a different mother, in Los Angeles, California. Jos√© Noguera's only brother, Enrique, was also a professional soccer player. Jos√© and Enrique played two games together defending the Velez colors. Enrique played left wing and Jos√© could play either inside left or inside right in the forward line due to his superb skill with both feet. In today's modern soccer, the inside forward positions are referred to as the playmaker position. Although Noguera was a prolific goal scorer, his greatest contribution to the forward line was his ability to make the pass for the goal. He was more of a playmaker due to his extraordinary ability to elude his opponents. Noguera lacked power when shooting at goal but he had an extraordinary ability to place the ball where he wanted. This is why he was usually picked to take the penalty kicks. Enrique Noguera also played Fourth Division for Club Atletico Velez-sarsfield and won it with Miguel √Ångel Rugilo, \\"the Lion of Wembley\\", as goalkeeper. In his youth, Jos√© M. Noguera played for Villa Insuperable; Villa Madero; and San Lorenzo de Almagro. Noguera played professionally in Argentina from 1930 until 1943. Prior to the formation of the Argentine Football Association, AFA, in 1931, Noguera would play for the San Lorenzo de Almagro Fourth Division in the morning and for Nueva Chicago's First Division \\"B\\" league in the afternoon. This went on for approximately two years until the AFA was formed in 1931. The practice of playing for two clubs was banned and the player had to remain with the team of most participation, Club Atletico San Lorenzo de Almagro. Noguera had his debut, in First Division, playing for San Lorenzo against Club Atletico Platense who they beat 5-1. His debut was in the same game with the Paraguayans Villalba and Benjamin Laterza. Laterza scored 3 goals. The following players made up the forward-line: Susani; Villalba; Mendilarzu; Noguera and Laterza. San Lorenzo did not want to release Noguera to Nueva Chicago in 1932 but with some intervention from a top dignitary the transfer was consummated. Jos√© Noguera's debut in First Division with Nueva Chicago took place on September 10, 1932, against Defensores de Belgrano. Jos√© Miguel Noguera was very instrumental when Nueva Chicago won their only major competition to date, the \\"Torneo Competencia\\" on December 24, 1933, by defeating Club Atletico Banfield 1 to 0. Noguera took possession of a loose ball, a block by his goalkeeper, and after some give and take passing upfield with Vargas, Noguera gave Vargas the final pass which Vargas converted for the win. Nueva Chicago also finished second in the league standing that year. This would be the last time Noguera defended the black and green colors of Nueva Chicago. He played for Nueva Chicago's first division from 1932 until 1934 when his contract was sold to Velez Sarsfield for $1,200. It was during this period that Noguera was drafted and serving his military duty, attached to an artillery unit at Campo Cinco de Mayo, in Buenos Aires. Noguera was granted leave to travel to La Plata where he made his debut with Velez Sarsfield on July 1, 1934, in a losing match against Estudiantes de La Plata, 2-0. Noguera attributed his bad performance to fatigue imposed by the Army prior to the game. Noguera was granted leave to practice with the Argentina national team, of which he was one of the star players. He made the squad but he was denied leave to defend Argentina at the 1934 World Cup in Italy. Noguera had many First Division matches in 1936. In the six games at the start of the season, he scored a goal per match; he would be the lead scorer in Second Division with 20 goals. Once Cosso and Reuben left Velez Sarsfield, Noguera remained in the First Division permanently. Jos√© M. Noguera played in Second Division for Velez Sarsfield from 1940 to 1943, the only time that Velez has dropped from First Division in their 101-year history. One of the best seasons Noguera had with Velez was in 1937 when he was the team's second ranked scorer at 10 goals. Victorio Spinetto and Oscar DeDovitis were at first rank tied with 11 goals. There is conflicting documentation that indicates Oscar DeDovitis and Jos√© M. Noguera were both tied for leading scorer that year with 12 goals each. In 1937 Noguera was featured as the CENTERFOLD of the El Grafico magazine. Noguera also took part in the magnificent Velez Sarsfield 1938 and 1939 forward line. One of the most successful forward lines in the history of the club. In 1938 they played 72 games and scored 39 goals and in 1939 they held a 3.6 goal average per game. Jos√© Miguel Noguera had many great memorable matches with Velez. One match that still was talked about was the match that ended 5 to 4 between Boca Juniors and Velez. Noguera scored the second goal in that match which tied the score before halftime. Some matches were not so pleasant. Noguera, Antonio Battaglia and Miguel √Ångel Rugilo, played in the 1940 league tournament that was considered one of the saddest incidents in Argentine soccer history. Velez was on the receiving end of a fixed game between Independiente vs. Club Atletico Atlanta. Independiente, who ended as sub-champions and were prevented from winning the championship by their 6 to 4 loss to Velez, allowed Atlanta to win the game. Atlanta was the last place team in the standings with one point behind Velez. Club Atletico Chacarita Juniors was already relegated leaving it up to Velez and Atlanta to determine the second team to be relegated. Atlanta's win and Velez's loss to San Lorenzo 2-0, both goals scored by Isidro Langara, sent Velez to the Second Division where they stayed until 1943. Atlanta on the other hand remained in the prestigious First Division. Atlanta's center forward, Jos√© Battagliero, transferred to Independiente without a transfer fee as part of the deal. Jos√© M. Noguera was featured on the cover of La Cancha on several occasions. One of Noguera's last games playing for Velez Sarsfield was during the inauguration of the new Velez Sarsfield stadium, April 1943, against the reigning first division champion River Plate. The mascot Noguera is holding in the picture is his 3-year-old nephew, Enrique Noguera Jr. This is exactly the same location where the stadium is located today. River Plate, with the likes of Jos√© Manuel Moreno, had one of the best forward lines in Argentine history, dubbed the MACHINE by Borocot√≥. Velez played in second division that year and took first place in the standings which promoted it back to First Division for the 1944 season. The result of that Velez new stadium inauguration game was 2-2. Career in Mexico \\"Noguerita\\", the affectionate name given to him by the Mexicans, played in Mexico from 1943 until 1948. Velez toured Mexico, Chile and El Salvador in 1940 with a very successful campaign. They lost only 2 of the 10 games played. Noguera was one of the outstanding players of the tour. The Mexican fans loved Noguera's dribbling abilities and the press dubbed him the juggler. The newspapers published a cartoon of him flying as if he had wings with many legs and several soccer balls. Jos√© M. Noguera was given Mexican citizenship upon his arrival in Mexico for the 1943 season. His great performance in the 1940 Velez tour resulted in the Asturias F.C. team purchasing his contract to participate in the first Mexican Professional Soccer tournament. Club Atletico Asturias won that first championship in 1943 by beating Real Club Espa√±a 4-1, which had Isidro Langara on the team and for the following season acquired the services of Jos√© Manuel Moreno. Jos√© M. Noguera was considered the brains and soul of the Asturias forward line. Asturias had eleven foreign players on the 1943 team, seven of them Argentines, a record in Mexican soccer. The center forward was Roberto Aballay who along with Isidro Langara still hold the record for most goals scored in a season, 40 goals each. Once in Mexico, Noguera was the ambassador for Argentine players and served as an intermediary, signing a great number of Argentine players without any type of monetary compensation. In 1945 the Monterrey Football Club finally joined the ranks of professional soccer. They suffered a great tragedy on Mexico's Independence Day when they were refueling their bus, an incendiary device caused the bus to be engulfed in flames causing severe injuries to many of the players and a couple of them died later as a result of their sustained injuries. This prompted the League to loan the team several players without a fee. The League wanted Monterrey to finish the season. A player worth mentioning that played on this team with Noguera is Emilio Baldonedo. Jos√© Noguera was sent as a player-coach. He replaced Manuel Galan as the coach, making him the second coach in the Monterrey institution. Noguera set a couple of records with this Monterrey team. The first is being the team that received the most goals in a game, 14-0 against the Veracruz Sporting Club, in which Noguera missed a penalty. The second record is being the team that received the most goals in a season, 133 goals. Club Atletico Monterrey did not play in First Division the following year. After the disappointing season with Monterrey, Noguera transferred to Atlante F.C. of Mexico City and won the 1946-47 League Championship, the first ever in professional soccer for the mustangs. Atlante became the pride of Mexico City, even the Nation's President, Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s, became their fan, taking a picture with the team prior to a match. During the 1947-48 season, Noguera tied with Horacio Casarin for second place honors in the goal scoring department. Career in the United States Atlante went on a six-game tour of California playing two games in San Francisco and four games in Los Angeles between August 15 and September 6, 1948, winning all of their games. Atlante scored 41 goals and received 12. \\"Noguerita\\" stayed in 1948 and played as a professional in the Greater Los Angeles Soccer League (GLSL) from 1948 until 1954. During his stay in Southern California, Noguera became the propagandist for the sport of soccer and a mentor to the many young players around him. In California the newspaper reporters and public referred to Noguera as \\"el maestro\\" and \\"Mr. soccer\\" due to his superb dribbling and ball skills. Noguera was a player/coach for the Pan American Club that won the league Championship in 1948, becoming the first Latin team to win the \\"GLSL\\" title in 35 years. Tony Morejon was Noguera's soccer manager on both the San Pedro Yugoslavs and the McIlwaine Canvasbaks soccer teams. Mr. Morejon had an extensive history with the sport of soccer in Southern California. [36] Tony Morejon was very familiar with Noguera and his skills on the soccer pitch and considered Noguera one of the best players he had ever seen. Noguera was also a player/coach for the McIlwaine Canvasbaks during the 1954 soccer season. [37] It appears that after the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, where the USA defeated England, soccer in Southern California started to spark some interest. Some of the best players on that US 1950 National Team played with Noguera. Jos√© Noguera also won league Championships with the San Pedro McIlwain Canvasbacks in 1950-51 and 1951-52. The Canvasbacks went on to win the US National Challenge Cup in 1959. In 1953 Noguera almost had his leg amputated as a result of a bad foul during a crucial league game against the St. Stephens Club. His right shin was fractured three inches below the knee. Noguera never fully recovered from the leg fracture he sustained, leaving him with a noticeable limp. It was nothing short of a miracle that Noguera came back to play after his surgery and continued to have a big impact on the pitch right up to the month before his unexpected demise.[38] Jos√© Miguel Noguera resided in Los Angeles, California, when he unexpectedly died in Mexico City, Mexico, October 29, 1954, at 41 years of age. He was buried in the famous Panteon Jardin of Mexico City. where the likes of Jorge Negrete and Pedro Infante are buried.

Commissioner, 531 U.S. 206 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned a technical question of tax law dealing with the tax attributes of an S corporation. Background In 1991, P. D. W. & A., Inc., an insolvent corporation taxed under Subchapter S, excluded its entire discharge of indebtedness amount from its gross income.. David Gitlitz and other shareholders were assessed tax deficiencies because they used the untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in S corporation stock and to deduct suspended losses. Eventually, the Tax Court held that Gitlitz could not use the S corporation's untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in corporate stock.531 U.S. at 211. In affirming, the Court of Appeals held that the discharge of indebtedness amount first had to be used to reduce certain tax attributes of the S corporation and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase their basis.531 U.S. at 211-212. Gitlitz appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear the case. Opinion of the Court Justice Thomas wrote the decision of the Court which reversed the Court of Appeals. He wrote that excluded discharged debt is an \\"item of income\\",531 U.S. at 217. which passes through to shareholders and increases their basis in an S corporation's stock and that pass-through is performed before the reduction of an S corporation's tax attributes. He wrote that it \\"simply does not say that discharge of indebtedness ceases to be an item of income when the S corporation is insolvent. Instead it provides only that discharge of indebtedness ceases to be included in gross income.\\" \\"In order to determine the 'tax imposed,' an S corporation shareholder must adjust his basis in his corporate stock and pass through all items of income and loss. Consequently, the attribute reduction must be made after the basis adjustment and pass-through.\\"531 U.S. at 216-218. Only Justice Breyer did not join Thomas's opinion. He disagreed with the statutory interpretation of the decision, believing that examining the direct language of the provision would have led the Court to a contrary result.531 U.S. at 221 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

Plot Detachment is a chronicle of one month in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). Barthes' method of imparting vital knowledge to his temporary students is interrupted by the arrival of three women in his life‚Äîthe damaged and naive prostitute Erica (Sami Gayle), a fellow teacher (Christina Hendricks), and a troubled teen named Meredith (Betty Kaye). These women all have profound effects on Barthes' life, forcing him to both re- discover aspects of his own personality, and to come to terms with both the tragic suicide of his mother and the impending death of his grandfather (Louis Zorich). The film is punctuated with flashbacks of scenes of Barthes' young childhood and his mother's suicide. Sub-plots include the struggles of Dr. Parker (Lucy Liu) within her role as the school counselor and the painful torment of Principal Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), who faces her dismissal as head of this deeply flawed school.

In March 2012, cast member Bryan Cranston was asked about Detachment during an interview for Collider. The reporter told Cranston that he loved the movie and then started to ask his question. \\"Wait,\\" Cranston said, \\"did you like 'Detachment'?\\" The reporter said again that he loved it, and Cranston seemed surprised. \\"I haven't seen it,\\" he told the assembled press. \\"I'm surprised to hear that actually.\\" When asked to clarify, he continued, \\"Because I felt that Carl Lund, the writer of 'Detachment,' wrote a really beautiful, haunting script. And I didn't feel that it was honored.\\" Shocked by Cranston's frankness, the reporters pushed him for more on that disagreement. \\"I was upset with that. I really was. And so I didn't see the movie.\\" He sighed, resigned, and continued, after searching for the right way to phrase himself, \\"Tony Kaye is a very complicated‚Ä¶ interesting fellow.\\" He smiled as he chose his words carefully. \\"I don't believe that I'll be working with him again. I didn't not get along with him on a personal level. But I just honor the writing. I really think that writing is the most important element there is. It is the springboard. It is where everything starts. And if you don't honor that -- which I didn't feel it was -- then where are you?\\" He leaned in as if telling everyone a secret. \\"And I'm not the only actor on that film to feel that way.\\" In the same month, director Tony Kaye touched upon the issue in a separate interview. \\"My agent sent me this fantastic piece of writing by a guy called Carl Lund. A writer. One of the things that I felt was how real it was. And writing is really about research and speech and I thought this guy‚Äôs really done his homework. In fact it turned out that he had been a teacher. So then it all became very clear. And then when it really began, if you like, really really began was when Adrien Brody sort of popped up and said I‚Äôll do this. A couple of weeks before we were supposed to start to shoot. And then I decided myself at that point I‚Äôm gonna hang the whole thing on you [Brody]. And try to build out your character of Henry much more and make it all everything about you. Just you.‚Äù The interviewer then asks Kaye if he rebuilt the script at that point. Kaye responds, ‚ÄúWell I reinterpreted it, yeah. When Carl first wrote it, I believe it was a very vignette ensemble thing.\\" ‚ÄùCarl's script was very impressionistic, and [a] part of what I do, sometimes, [is] very impressionistic storytelling. I used that to its full, here, to try and make sense of it all.... There's more [footage] of Marcia Gay Harden and Bryan Cranston [which] I've got in the hard drives, and I'm hoping to [get] it out, in maybe a longer cut.\\" Release Detachment premiered on April 25, 2011, at the Tribeca Film Festival.Gordon, Cox (April 4, 2011). \\"'Detachment', Rocker Doc Join Tribeca\\".

On its broad peak stands a solid summit cross, the panorama is comprehensive and there are particularly good views of the Ellmauer Halt, the highest mountain in the range, the Treffauer and Lake Hinterstein.  Location  The Sonneck rises in the western part of the Wilder Kaiser on the main crest between the Hackenk√∂pfe and Kopfkraxen in the west and Ellmauer Halt and Treffauer further east. It is one of the higher Kaiser peaks, but is rarely climbed.  Routes  The Sonneck is one of the easiest, but also rather unknown summits in the Kaisergebirge. It may be tackled by experienced and fit mountaineers either from the south or the north on two different routes. * South route: 4 hours to ascend, 3 hours to descend, 1,350 metre height difference The start point for this route is Scheffau am Wilden Kaiser. Cars may taken as far as the Gasthaus J√§gerwirt (910 m). Thereafter the route continues on foot, initially quite gently through woods and meadows reaching the Kaiser Hochalm meadow after just under 2 hours. After that it becomes steeper, running past the southern side of the Sonnenstein, then across slopes of mountain pine and open schrofen terrain, a demanding section up to the Kopfkraxen, a lower peak. On sunny, warm days it is essential to set off early otherwise the ascent will be tortuous. From the Kopfkraxen the route becomes more challenging along the airy, but secured ridge with a short climb up to the summit of the Sonneck. The last section requires sure-footedness and a head for heights.SONNECK (2260 M) at www.planetoutdoor.de. Starts from B√§rnstatt. Accessed on 1 Jan 2011. * North route: 6 hour to ascend, 4¬Ω hours to descend, 1,750 metre height difference The base for this route is Sparchen, a suburb of Kufstein. Initially this route involves a long approach march, but it is very scenic nevertheless. The trail runs through the Kaisertal valley past the Pfandlhof farm and St. Anthony's Chapel (Antoniuskapelle) and reaches the Anton Karg Haus in Hinterb√§renbad after 2¬Ω hours. It is possible to stay overnight here. The marked, but rarely used route now follows the \\"Beggar's Trail\\" (Bettlersteig)for half an hour towards the Kaindl Hut, until the route to the Sonneck branches off. The trail climbs a continuously steep slope, which is none too exciting, high into the \\"Chamois Cirque\\" (Gamskar, which is aptly named) and runs along the Gamskark√∂pferl finally crossing a scree cirque painstakingly to reach the summit of the Sonneck.Sonneck (2260 m) at www.hoehenrausch.de. Starts from Oberndorf. Accessed on 1 Jan 2011 * Ridge crossing It is possible to follow the entire ridge from the Sonneck over the Kopfkraxen, Wiesberg and Hackenk√∂pfe to the Scheffauer. This route is, however, energy-sapping, lengthy, unmarked and unsecured and, in places, very exposed and laced with quite a few ascents. It may only be tackled by surefooted mountaineers with a head for heights and local knowledges and Alpine experience. The whole crossing from the Sonneck to the Scheffauer takes about 3 hours; and must be followed by a descent to the Kaindl Hut or to Lake Hinterstein. This ridge crossing may also be done in the opposite direction, but its length and difficulty is frequently underestimated.

It was formed out of the 1910 union of Pankow 08 and Adler Pankow. Both of these sides, as well as their successor, played in the Verband Brandenburgischer Ballspielvereine (VBB, en:Association of Brandenburg Ball Clubs) one of several top flight leagues in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. TOC History Following World War I, Adler became part of the Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund (ATSB, en:Worker's Gymnastics and Sports Association), a nationwide leftist sports organization that became home to a large number of worker's clubs. The ATSB ran a separate competition from that of the DFB (Deutscher Fu√üball Bund, en:German Football Association) and staged its first national championship in 1920. Adler won the ATSB title in 1928 by beating VfL 88 Naumburg 6:3 in their semifinal match up before defeating ASV Westend Frankfurt 5:4 in the finalGr√ºne, Hardy (2001).

In 1933, the Nazis banned worker's clubs alongside other clubs with political or faith-based affiliations. The membership of the Pankow club joined Berliner SC . In addition to its footballers, Adler brought to Favorit its ground at K√ºhnemannsta√üe and strong hockey and handball departments. Favorit was a lower tier local side through to the end of World War II. After the conflict, occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of de-Nazification. New clubs soon emerged and the former membership of Favorit became part of Sportgruppe Nordbahn Berlin, formed in 1945. It was renamed VfL Nord Berlin on 21 May 1947, which eventually joined current-day club SV Nord Wedding 1893, making Adler part of the tradition of that club alongside several other neighbouring associations.

He also served as the ambassador to Russia and the United Kingdom, and was the main Iranian delegate at the signing of the notorious Treaty of Gulistan (1813) with neighbouring Russia.  Family  Abolhassan was born in 1776 at Shiraz; he was the second son of Mirza Mohammad-Ali, a secretary of Nader Shah, and a daughter of Ebrahim Khan Kalantar, thus making him part of the influential Qavam family of Jewish origins.Modern Iran Dialectics, By Michael E. Bonine Nikki R. Keddie, SUNY Press, 1981, page 293.  Exile and return  As a young man, Mirza Abolhassan was appointed as the governor of Shushtar. In April 1801, however, the family lost much of its power and influence during the downfall of Ebrahim, and thus all members of the family were persecuted by the Iranian government. While many were blinded or killed, some managed to flee. Mirza Abolhassan, however, was captured by Iranian troops, and was exiled in his native Shiraz. Abolhassan shortly afterwards fled from Shiraz, reaching Basra, where he then took a vessel to Hyderabad in India. Luckily, he was some time later pardoned, and went back to Iran, where he served Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, and quickly rose to high offices.  Later life  Abolhassan was chosen in 1809 as ambassador to lead a diplomatic mission to London at the court of the British king George III to seek support against growing ambitions of Russia in Caucasia. His escorting officer or \\"mehmandar\\" in the United Kingdom was Sir Gore Ouseley, who later encouraged Abolhassan to join the Freemasons which he did in 1810. During his trip, Abolhassan kept a diary that was later published under the title, Heyratnameth (the book of wonders). This book, in which Abolhassan formulated his perception of Europe's modern achievements, was read widely in the Qajar court and later inspired sociopolitical movements, such as Iran's constitutional revolution.Vahid Vahdat. 'Occidentalist Perceptions of European Architecture in Nineteenth-Century Persian Travel Diaries: Travels in Farangi Space Routledge, 2017 Upon his return of that mission, Mirza Abolhassan obtained the title \\"Khan\\" and \\"Ilchi\\" (envoy). Abolhassan was later appointed as the main delegate for Iran in the Gulistan of 1813 and Turkmenchay treaties, under which Iran lost most of her Caucasian territories to Russia. In 1835, Abolhassan sealed himself in the Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine as a protest to Prime Minister Ghaem Magham Farahani. Abolhassan Khan later died in 1845.

Their exchange was published in New Left Review, beginning with Poulantzas's review of Miliband's 1969 work on bourgeois democracies, The State in Capitalist Society. The exchange is typically characterized as a debate between Miliband's instrumentalist model of the capitalist state and Poulantzas' structural position; however, Bob Jessop argues that this account is misleading. In The State in Capitalist Society, Miliband presents his theory of how the state functions to serve capitalist interests. It does so, he claims, because of (1) the social origins of members of the government and (2) the personal ties and influence between members of the government and ruling-class elites. Poulantzas disagrees with Miliband's approach, adopting a structural position. He claims the state is objectively a capitalist entity, which can serve no purpose other than preserving the capitalist mode of production. Furthermore, he argues that if members of the ruling class are the same people as those who manage the state, this is merely a coincidence: the state reproduces capitalist relations regardless of who is in charge. In his critique, he claims: > The relation between the bourgeois class and the state is an objective > relation. This means that if the function of the state in a determinate > social formation and the interests of the dominant class coincide, it is by > reason of the system itself: the direct participation of members of the > ruling class in the state apparatus is not the cause but the effect. In a response to Poulantzas's criticisms, Miliband counters that Poulantzas's position allows no room for agency and is therefore too limiting. His point of view does not allow individuals to make decisions based on their own free will; rather, their decisions are determined solely by the structure of society: > For what his exclusive stress on 'objective relations' suggests is that what > the state does is in every particular and at all times wholly determined by > these 'objective relations': in other words, that the structural constraints > of the system are so absolutely compelling as to turn those who run the > state into the merest functionaries and executants of policies imposed upon > them by 'the system'.

She mostly wrote under the name Hilma Strandberg of the pseudonym Lilian. Life She was the daughter of Justice and member of the Swedish Academy Carl Gustaf beach Berg (1825‚Äì1874) and his wife Eva Helleday (1830‚Äì1869). She attended an ordinary school in Stockholm, but later took private lessons with EM Rappe in Sm√•land. In 1876 she completed training as a telegraph operator and worked as such from 1883 to 1888 in Fj√§llbacka. During that time she wrote alleged correspondence to a newspaper at which she was later employed. In 1886, she became a co- founder of the radical feminist women's paper Fram√•t ('Forward') of the Gothenburg's Women's Association alongside Mathilda Hedlund and Alma √Ökermark. She married the artist Hjalmar Angered and emigrated with him to the United States, where they lived from 1888 to 1894 and she wrote articles in the form of letters to Swedish newspapers. At the World Exhibition in Chicago in 1893, she was responsible for presenting a Swedish textile company's work to the world, during which time she continued her work as a newspaper correspondent. From 1904 to 1914 she undertook long study trips to the Switzerland and from Italy, continuing to report back to Swedish newspapers and magazines. Books Her debut book was a collection of poems, published under the pseudonym \\"Lilian.\\" Under the same pseudonym, she began to write novels which appeared in e.g. the Gothenburg magazine √•ret om Illustrated. This early work was markedly romantic. In her Swedish-American life she found useful themes for some strange, pessimistic colored descriptions as in her works the nya v√§rlden (The new world). In her books she criticized double standards and dogmatism, as in the novel P√• Prairies (The Plains) and in her autobiography Lydia Vik.

The internal taxonomy of the family and the number of genera varies greatly between sources leading to considerable discrepancy across the literature. This is currently in the process of reorganization on the basis of phylogenetic studies but knowledge is still incomplete, especially in light of recent studies of larval characters suggesting relationships which don't correspond with the phylogeny based solely on adult characters. The current classification is therefore still based on the morphology of adults and basically refers to the taxonomic scheme adopted by Thompson & Rotheray in the Manual of Palaearctic Diptera (1998), which divides the family into three subfamilies and fourteen tribes. The nomenclature given here is derived partly from the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera (BDWD), and a working classification created by a group of molecular biologists which no doubt will alter greatly in the future.Lifedesks: Classification of Syrphidae http://syrphidae.lifedesks.org/node/1476 The distribution of genera in biogeographic realms is derived from the biosystematics BDWD.

Early life Patch was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in 1781. His father Nehemiah was a Yarmouth sea captain who died in a shipwreck at Seal Island, Nova Scotia soon after John Patch's birth.\\"John Patch\\", Famous, should-be Famous and Infamous Canadians retrieved 31 Dec 2010. Fishing career Earning a living as a mariner and fishermen, Patch observed the efficiency of small boats propelled by single oar sculling and began to experiment with a propeller based in the motions of a sculling oar. During the winter of 1832-1833 he built a hand-cranked version of a doubled-bladed fan-shaped propeller. He demonstrated his propeller during the summer of 1833 before crowds watching as his small boat moved, seemingly magically, across Yarmouth Harbour. Patch further experimented by attaching his invention to a 25-ton coastal schooner named Royal George in the Bay of Fundy. The propeller allowed Royal George to enter Saint John Harbour in a calm which stranded other sailing vessels. Patch's invention was 4 years before John Ericsson's famous patent on the screw propeller in Britain. Patch lacked the funds to travel to Britain for a patent but instead tried to patent his propeller in the United States in 1832. However his application was refused as he was not an American citizen. Patch continued to improve his propeller and when American laws changed to permit patents by non-citizens, he received an American patent in 1849.Patent No. US6,914, Nov. 27, 1849 in Mario Theriault, Great Maritime Inventions Goose Lane Publishing (2001) p. 58-59 Patch's propeller received some recognition, including praise for its efficiency in Scientific American magazine. However, by 1849 there were multiple competing versions of the screw propeller in Europe and America. Patch never received money or recognition. Later life and death A petition by Yarmouth citizens to reward his innovation with a pension from the Nova Scotia government in the 1858 was unsuccessful and he died a poor man at Yarmouth in 1861.\\"John Patch\\", Famous, should-be Famous and Infamous Canadians retrieved 31 Dec 2010. Recognition Although Patch's invention was well documented at the time, his invention was overlooked amidst the many developers of the screw propeller and he has received few tributes. His invention is presented at an exhibit at the Yarmouth County Museum & Archives and a propeller-driven lifeboat in the collection of the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia is named in his honour.

Early life and education Rinaldo Cuneo was born in San Francisco on July 2, 1877, part of an Italian American family of artists and musicians. Rinaldo was the second of Giovanni (John) Cuneo and his wife Annie's seven children. Rinaldo and his brothers Cyrus (1879‚Äì1916) and Egisto (1890‚Äì1972) all became artists. Their sisters Erminia, Clorinda, Evelina, and Clelia were interested in music and opera. The family lived on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco's Italian American neighborhood of North Beach. As an adult, Rinaldo's home and studio, on a cliff with unobstructed views of the bay, was just a block from his childhood home. Cuneo enlisted in the Navy at age twenty, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and served for three years aboard the Oregon as a gunner. He then worked at the family business, a steamship ticket agency, and began his art studies, taking night classes at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art under Arthur Frank Mathews, Arthur Putnam, and Gottardo Piazzoni. Among his classmates were Ralph Stackpole and Maynard Dixon. His art education continued in London, and at Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris (1911‚Äì1913). He studied under James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Art The Embarcadero at Night, circa 1927-1928, Los Angeles County Museum of Art Perhaps best known for his oil paintings depicting landscapes of the San Francisco Bay Area and for his murals, Cuneo also painted cityscapes, marine scenes, and still lifes. His first exhibition, in 1913, was in San Francisco at the Helgesen Gallery, and his work was also shown at the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition and in virtually every subsequent major Bay Area art exhibit until his death. A reviewer wrote that Cuneo's paintings \\"leave a mellow glow in one's heart. They portray not merely places, but mood and atmosphere.\\" His early color palette reflected that of Tonalism, with earthy, dark, neutral hues. One of his teachers, Whistler, was a leading Tonalist. Cuneo later adopted the lighter pastel palette associated with the Impressionists. Still later in his career, he used a palette which \\"vibrated with low-keyed, intense colors and radiance.\\" His painting style also evolved throughout his career, and he integrated innovations which he came across into his own style, including aspects of Tonalism, Impressionism, and Modernism. From 1916 to 1917 Cuneo worked for a tugboat service while living in San Anselmo, painting maritime scenes in his spare time. He taught at the California School of Fine Arts during the summer sessions of 1920, 1925, 1935, and 1936. Bay Area Hills, 1934, 108 x 54 inches For his many exceptional paintings of the Bay Area, Cuneo was known as The Painter of San Francisco. Arthur Millier of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Cuneo's landscapes \\"breathe the essential strength and poetry of his region.\\" Another critic noted that \\"they are the very soul and essence of California materialized in line and color.\\" In addition to his California landscapes, in 1928 he also painted scenes of the Arizona desert. Cuneo said that \\"a landscape should embrace volume, simplicity, unity, a good sense of color values, rhythm of line, and above all, light.\\" In 1934 Cuneo received a commission from the Public Works of Art Project to paint two lunette murals of Bay Area Hills in the foyer of Coit Tower. A number of Cuneo's paintings were featured in the 1935 inaugural exhibition of the San Francisco Museum of Art. One of them, California Hills, was honored with the Museum's Purchase Prize award. After a brief illness, Cuneo died in San Francisco on December 27, 1939. Although he had been a popular artist with many well-received exhibits throughout his life, Cuneo had found himself unable to successfully market his paintings due to the economic conditions created by the Great Depression. This led to feelings that he had failed. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote that the artist's wife found \\"more than one hundred hitherto unseen Cuneo paintings, hidden in his two studios ‚Äì in corners, in trunks, under books (some even hanging turned to the wall by the artist).\\" Many of these paintings were subsequently displayed in solo exhibitions, in 1940 at the San Francisco Museum of Art, in 1949 at the de Young Museum, and in 1961 at San Francisco's Gallery of Fine Arts. A critic wrote in 1991 that Cuneo \\"was a Cezannesque purist worth remembering\\". Exhibitions and collections Cuneo's numerous solo exhibitions included ones in London, Paris, Rome, New York, and Los Angeles. His work was featured in exhibits at the Helgesen Gallery (San Francisco) (1913), Metropolitan Museum of Art (1933), Museum of Modern Art (New York), San Francisco Art Association (1916‚Äì34), Golden Gate International Exposition (1939), California Palace of the Legion of Honor, and the de Young Museum. A 2009 exhibit at Museo ItaloAmericano, Cuneo: A Family of Early California Artists, presented a retrospective of the work of Rinaldo, Cyrus and Egisto Cuneo. It was the first exhibit to display the work of the three brothers together. His work is also in many museum collections, including Oakland Museum of California, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Sierra Nevada Museum (Reno), de Young Museum, Laguna Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Huntington, and Museo ItaloAmericano.

Early life Anne Shannon Monroe was born in Bloomington, Missouri, the daughter of William Andrew Monroe (1842-1889), M.D., and great-granddaughter of George Shannon of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jean M. Ward, Elaine A. Maveety, Pacific Northwest Women, 1815-1925 (OSU Press, 1995) 'Oregon Historical Quarterly', 1942, p. 43:374 She had 4 siblings: Louise Harrison Walton (1868-1940), Andrew Monroe (1872-1924), Margaret Monroe (1879-1938), Mary Elizabeth Story (1883-1953). She moved with the family to Yakima, Washington where her father started a medical practice. After the death of her father, the family moved again to Tacoma, Washington. Career Monroe started as a teacher in 1899 in Tacoma, but she soon moved to Chicago, Illinois, to try her hand as a writer. Her first book, Eugene Norton: A Tale of the Sagebrush Land, was published in 1900 by Rand McNally. She worked for six years as editor of Common Sense at the Chicago Daily News. After that she returned to the West Coast and from 1907 to 1911 she managed her own advertising office in Portland, Oregon. She wrote popular press articles on a wide variety of subjects, including an early portrayal of a (fictional) female business tycoon and a notable 1904 study of Mary MacLane's literary inspiration (which Monroe found in Sei Shonagon's work). Many of her books are based on her childhood experiences growing up in the semi-arid, cold ranch-lands of eastern Washington state. In 1911 she moved to New York City and contributed to The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal and other magazines. She travelled extensively and spoke frequently before woman's clubs, chambers of commerce, colleges, schools and churches. She was a member of the Authors' League of America and Pen and Brush, New York. In 1913 she moved back to Oregon where she bought 300-acre homestead for 16 dollars. Her most successful book was the 1930 biography of Oregon rancher William \\"Bill\\" Hanley, Feelin' Fine, of which Monroe was the ghost- writer.

But when they get to the island they discover conditions are harsh for the boys and that Preacher John, the head of the Eck family is a religious fanatic. After some of the work boys die and Preacher John's sermons start emphasising sacrifices to God, they decide to build a bomb and destroy the boat then return to the mainland by dinghy. The bomb is planted on the boat but the next day Ray has gone missing, Baz will be going on the boat and the crew has decided to take the dinghy with them, leaving some to guard the boys. On the boat, Preacher John makes Baz pray to God, his eldest son, Isaac, then intervenes and threatens to shoot his father who tells him that he planned to kill him as the ultimate sacrifice to God. Preacher John then shoots him and throws Baz overboard who lands in the dinghy. He then causes the bomb to explode, sinking the boat. Baz manages to return to Eck's Isle, Ray reappears and after fighting with the remaining adults let them return to the mainland by the dinghy. The youngsters decide to stay and make a life on the island. Reception Patrick Ness of the Guardian said that 'X Isle is a strong tale, well told, if perhaps lacking quite enough incident to fill 477 pages... It's a surprisingly upbeat story that boys should like.'

On 24 July 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired Geraldine from her owner, Frederick S. Fish of South Bend, Indiana, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. Fish delivered her to the Navy at Chicago, Illinois, on 8 September 1917, and she was commissioned as USS Geraldine (SP-1011) on 13 September 1917 with her owner, Ensign Frederick S. Fish, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the 9th Naval District and based at Great Lakes, Illinois, Geraldine patrolled in Lake Michigan until late in 1917, when she was laid up at Chicago for the winter because of the annual icing over of the Great Lakes. Returning to service on Lake Michigan on 6 April 1918 after the spring thaw, Geraldine resumed her patrol and guard ship duties for the rest of World War I. She also served as a dispatch boat in the Sault Ste, Marie, Michigan, area from 12 May 1918 to 19 August 1918.

While compensation and benefits are tangible, there are intangible rewards such as recognition, work-life and development. Combined, these are referred to as total rewards.WorldatWork certification course GR1: Total Rewards Management defines total rewards as \\"the monetary and nonmonetary return provided to employees in return for their time, talents, efforts and results.\\" The term \\"compensation and benefits\\" refers to the discipline as well as the rewards themselves. The basic components of employee compensation and benefits Employee compensation and benefits are divided into four basic categories: 1. Guaranteed pay ‚Äì a fixed monetary (cash) reward paid by an employer to an employee. The most common form of guaranteed pay is base salary. Guaranteed pay also includes cash allowances (housing allowance, transport allowance, etc.), differentials (shift differentials, holiday differentials) and premiums (night shift, etc.) 2. The Variable pay ‚Äì a non-fixed monetary (cash) reward paid by an employer to an employee that is contingent on discretion, performance, or results achieved. The most common forms of variable pay are bonuses and incentives. 3. Benefits ‚Äì programs an employer uses to supplement employees‚Äô compensation, such as paid time off, medical insurance, company car, and more. 4. Equity-based compensation ‚Äì stock or pseudo stock programs an employer uses to provide actual or perceived ownership in the company which ties an employee's compensation to the long-term success of the company. The most common examples are stock options. Guaranteed pay Guaranteed pay is a fixed monetary (cash) reward. The basic element of guaranteed pay is base salary which is paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly rate. Base salary is provided for doing the job the employee is hired to do. The size of the salary is determined mainly by 1) the prevailing market salary level paid by other employers for that job, and 2) the performance of the person in the job. Many countries, provinces, states or cities dictate a minimum wage. Employees' individual skills and level of experience leave room for differentiating income levels within a job-based pay structure. In addition to base salary, allowances may be paid to an employee for specific purposes other than performing the job. These can include allowances for transportation, housing, meals, cost of living, seniority, or as payments in lieu of medical or pension benefits. The use of allowances varies widely by country, as well as job level and the nature of job duties. Variable pay Variable pay is a non-fixed monetary (cash) reward that is contingent on discretion, performance, or results achieved. There are different types of variable pay plans, such as bonus schemes, sales incentives (commission), overtime pay, and more. An example where this type of plan is prevalent is how the real estate industry compensates real estate agents. A common variable pay plan might be the sales person receives 50% of every dollar they bring in up to a level of revenue at which they then bump up to 85% for every dollar they bring in going forward. Typically, this type of plan is based on an annual period of time requiring a \\"resetting\\" each year back to the starting point of 50%. Sometimes this type of plan is administered so the sales person never resets or falls down to a lower level. It also includes Performance Linked Incentive which is variable and may range from 130% to 0% as per performance of the individual as per his key result areas (KRA). Benefits There is a wide variety of benefits offered to employees such as Paid Time-Off (PTO), various types of insurance (such as life, medical, dental, and disability), participation in a retirement plan (such as pension or 401(k)), or access to a company car, among others. Some benefits are mandatory which are regulated by the government while others are voluntarily offered to fulfill the need of a specific employee population. Benefit plans are typically not provided in cash but form the basis of an employees' pay package along with base salary and bonus. In the United States, \\"qualified\\" employee benefit plans must be offered to all employees, while \\"non-qualified\\" benefit plans may be offered to a select group such as executives or other highly-paid employees. When implementing a benefit plan, HR Departments must ensure compliance with federal and state regulations. Many states and countries dictate different minimum benefits such as minimum paid time-off, employer‚Äôs pension contribution, sick pay, among others. Equity-based compensation Equity- based compensation is an employer compensation plan using the employer‚Äôs shares as employee compensation. The most common form is stock options, yet employers use additional vehicles such as restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSU), employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), performance shares (PSU) and stock appreciation rights (SAR). A stock option is defined as \\"a contract right granted to an individual to purchase a certain number of shares of stock at a certain price (and subject to certain conditions) over a defined period of time.\\" Performance shares (PSU) awards of company stock given to managers and executives only if specified organization performance criteria are met, such as earnings per share target  Intangible benefits  An employee may receive intangible benefits, such as a desirable work schedule. That could be a schedule that is controlled by the employee and can be adjusted to accommodate occasional non-work activities, or one that is highly predictable, which makes it easier for the employee to arrange childcare or transportation to work. Access to training programs, mentorship, opportunities to travel or to meet other people in the same field, and similar experiences are all intangible benefits that may appeal to some employees.  Pay aggregates  Various combinations of the above four categories are referred to as pay aggregates. Common aggregates are explained below. Together, guaranteed and variable pay comprise total cash compensation. The ratio of base salary to variable pay is referred to as the pay mix. For example, a person receiving a bonus equal to 25% of base salary would have an 80/20 pay mix. Organizations often set the total cash compensation for sales people at a market level, then they split the total cash compensation into the base salary component and the incentive component following a 70/30 pay mix, while other (non-sales) employees may have a 90/10 pay mix. Total guaranteed package or fixed cost to company are aggregates that include guaranteed pay and benefits. This represents the total fixed cost of the reward package and is useful for budgeting. All forms of variable pay (annual bonus and equity compensation) are excluded from this aggregate. Total direct pay refers to total cash compensation plus equity compensation. Benefits are excluded from this aggregate. Total direct pay includes all the elements that may be negotiated by a job candidate, especially for senior executive positions where annual and long-term incentives are more substantial. Total compensation would include all four categories: guaranteed pay (salary and allowances), variable pay, benefits and equity compensation. Remuneration is a term often used to refer to total cash compensation or total compensation. As noted above, total rewards would include total compensation as well as intangible benefits such as culture, leadership, recognition, workplace flexibility, development and career opportunity. =External equity= External equity refers to the similarity of the practices of other organization of the same sector. If perceived like this, it can be said that the program is considered competitive or externally equitable. Usually, these comparisons are done in external labor markets where the wages vary. There are various factors that contribute to create these differences, for example, geographical location, education and work experience. =Internal equity= Internal equity is employees' perception of their duties, compensation, and work conditions as compared with those of other employees in similar positions in the same organization. As this comparison is always made within the company, problems with internal equity can result in conflict among employees, mistrust, low morale, anger and even the adoption of legal actions. Workers can make the evaluation of internal equity regarding two main points. On the one hand, procedural justice is the person‚Äôs perceived fairness of the process (assigned tasks) and procedures used to make decisions about him/her. On the other hand, distributive justice refers to the perceived fairness in the distribution of outcomes (salaries). The classic objectives of equity based compensation plans are retention, attraction of new hires and aligning employees‚Äô and shareholders‚Äô interests with the long-term success of the company. Organizational place In most companies, compensation & benefits (C&B;) design and administration falls under the umbrella of human-resources. HR organizations in large companies are typically divided into three sub- divisions: HR business partners (HRBPs), HR centers of excellence, and HR shared services. C&B; is an HR center of excellence, like staffing and organizational development (OD). Main influencers Employee compensation and benefits main influencers can be divided into two: internal (company) and external influencers. The most important internal influencers are the business objectives, labor unions, internal equity (the idea of compensating employees in similar jobs and similar performance in a similar way), organizational culture and organizational structure. The most important external influencers are the state of the economy, inflation, unemployment rate, the relevant labor market, labor law, tax law, and the relevant industry habits and trends. Bonus plans benefits Bonus plans are variable pay plans. They have three classic objectives: 1. Adjust labor cost to financial results ‚Äì the basic idea is to create a bonus plan where the company is paying more bonuses in ‚Äògood times‚Äô and less (or no) bonuses in ‚Äòbad times‚Äô. By having bonus plan budget adjusted according to financial results, the company‚Äôs labor cost is automatically reduced when the company isn‚Äôt doing so well, while good company performance drives higher bonuses to employees. 2. Drive employee performance ‚Äì the basic idea is that if an employee knows that his/her bonus depend on the occurrence of a specific event (or paid according to performance, or if a certain goal is achieved), then the employee will do whatever he/she can to secure this event (or improve their performance, or achieve the desired goal). In other words, the bonus is creating an incentive to improve business performance (as defined through the bonus plan). 3. Employee retention ‚Äì retention is not a primary objective of bonus plans, yet bonuses are thought to bring value with employee retention as well, for three reasons: a) a well designed bonus plan is paying more money to better performers; a competitor offering a competing job-offer to these top performers is likely to face a higher hurdle, given that these employees are already paid higher due to the bonus plan. b) if the bonus is paid annually, employee is less inclined to leave the company before bonus payout; often the reason for leaving (e.g. dispute with the manager, competing job offer) 'goes away' by the time the bonus is paid. the bonus plan 'buy' more time for the company to retain the employee. c) employees paid more are more satisfied with their job (all other things being equal) thus less inclined to leave their employer. The concept saying bonus plans can improve employee performance is based on the work of Frederic Skinner, perhaps the most influential psychologist of the 20th century. Using the concept of Operant Conditioning, Skinner claimed that an organism (animal, human being) is shaping his/her voluntary behavior based on its extrinsic environmental consequences ‚Äì i.e. reinforcement or punishment. This concept captured the hearts of many, and indeed most bonus plans nowadays are designed based on it, yet since the late 1940s a growing body of empirical evidence has suggested that these if-then rewards do not work in a variety of settings common to the modern workplace. The failings of the bonus plan often relate to rewarding the wrong behaviour. For example, managers who keep to the status quo, fire valuable (expensive) employees, and engage in immoral business practices can achieve better short- term financial outcomes (and therefore a bonus) than a manager who is attempting to innovate his or her way to higher profits. When bonus plans are poorly thought out, they have the potential to damage employee performance and cause regulatory headaches. However, despite their failings, employees (and many employers) still view an effective bonus plan as the single greatest motivator in the workplace.

Of the Late Cretaceous epoch, the unit consists predominantly of clay shale with some beds of sandstone. A particularly erosion-resistant sandstone within the unit forms the scenic Nojoqui Falls, in the Santa Ynez Mountains south of Solvang. Type locality and description The type locality of the Jalama Formation is in southwestern Santa Barbara County on the low ridgeline between Santa Anita and Bulito Canyons, within Hollister Ranch, near the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains, and near the headwaters of Jalama Creek. The formation is found from this area eastward along the Santa Ynez Range in periodic outcrops, underlying either the Anita Shale (in the western portion of its range) or the Juncal Formation Shale (in the east). The largest outcrop in the Santa Ynez Range is along the north slope of the mountains near Santa Ynez Peak, where it is exposed for approximately six miles.Dibblee (1966) 19 Other outcrops occur north of the Santa Ynez Fault, in the San Rafael Mountains along the Little Pine Syncline and along the Hildreth Fault.Thomas M. Dibblee, 1986. Geologic Map of the Little Pine Mountain Quadrangle, Santa Barbara County, California. California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology. Dibblee Foundation Map DF#05. Characteristic shale beds within the Jalama are dark gray to black, micaceous, and often carbonaceous. Sandstones interbedded with the shales are arkosic, light gray to tan, and sometimes massive, as at the base of the type section on Hollister Ranch. Another interbedded unit occasionally encountered is a cobbly conglomerate, which outcrops on the north slope of the Santa Ynez Mountains south of Gibraltar Reservoir. The cobbles in this unit are detritus from a granitic source rock in a gray to brown matrix.Thomas M. Dibblee, 1986. Geologic Map of the Santa Barbara Quadrangle, Santa Barbara County, California. California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology. Dibblee Foundation Map DF#06. The overall Jalama Formation varies in thickness from around 2,000 feet near the Romero Saddle north of Carpinteria, to about 4,000 feet at the type location more than forty miles to the west. Deposition environment and geologic history Sandstone unit within the Jalama Formation. The region of present-day Santa Barbara and Ventura County during the Late Cretaceous was submerged, and the depositional environment was one of a narrow shelf and submarine fans. The previously exposed Espada Formation, after a period of erosion, was now underwater, and began to receive layers of sediment which would become the Jalama Formation. Periodic episodes of deeper and shallower water resulted in finer and coarser sediments, respectively ‚Äì shales versus sandstones.Marilyn E. Tennyson and Caroline M. Isaacs, \\"Geologic setting and petroleum geology of Santa Maria and Santa Barbara Basins, Coastal California.\\" In: Isaacs, Caroline M. and Rullk√∂tter, J√ºrgen. The Monterey Formation: From Rocks to Molecules. Columbia University Press, 2001. p. 219. The crustal block on which the Jalama formation was deposited has been inferred to have rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise and moved northward along the coast from its former position nearer San Diego. This motion took place beginning in the early Miocene, during a period of deformation along the boundaries of the Pacific and North American Plates, a boundary represented today by the San Andreas Fault. The unit lies unconformably on the Espada Formation, also of Cretaceous age, and in places on the older Franciscan Formation, which is probably of Jurassic age.Dibblee (1966) 21-24 In one location, in Nojoqui Canyon near the Nojoqui Falls, the Jalama is in conformable contact with the underlying Espada, indicating one area that remained submerged through the era. The Jalama formation is separated by overlying sedimentary layers by an unconformity most everywhere it has been found, as the Paleocene is unrepresented in the fossil record in southern Santa Barbara County, and the stratigraphic sequence goes directly from the Cretaceous Jalama to Eocene units, including the Anita and Juncal Formations.Norris, 77-78 In his 1966 book on the geology of the central Santa Ynez Mountains, Dibblee finds the Cretaceous Jalama Formation to be in conformable contact with the Eocene Juncal in the eastern part of the Santa Ynez range, without mentioning the intervening Paleocene; in this portion of the unit there are no fossils to provide clues as to date. Paleontology While the eastern part of the Jalama Formation is almost without fossils, some localities in the western part are richly fossiliferous, with Campanian age foraminifer and molluscan assemblages. AAPG Datapages/Archives Abstract: \\"Stratigraphic Paleontology of Jalama Formation, Western Santa Ynez Mountains, Santa Barbara County, California\\" At least one species ‚Äì Lysis jalamaca, from an extinct genus of shallow-marine gastropod ‚Äì has been named for the unit. Lysus jalamaca has been dated to between 70-75 million years before present, in the late Cretaceous.Saul L. R. & Richard L. Squires R. L. (2008). \\"Cretaceous trichotropid gastropods from the Pacific slope of North America: Possible pathways to calyptraeid morphology\\". The Nautilus 122(3): 115‚Äì142, 2008. PDF. Other fossils found in the Jalama Formation, listed in Dibblee's 1950 book include six species of bivalves and one species each of gastropod and cephalopod. All of these are described as \\"abundant\\", with numerous others not listed; all are indicative of upper Cretaceous.Dibblee (1950). 24.

The fort of Bregille is a fortification located in the French city of Besan√ßon.  History  After two wars (in 1674 when Louis XIV of France took the city from the Spanish, and in 1814 when Austria declared war on Napoleon I), the French military decided to build a fort on Bregille hill, to defend the old city of Besan√ßon. This hill is higher than the principal fortification of the city, the citadel of Besan√ßon. Because the hill's strategic position had been used against the city in the past, the necessity for a real military defense there had become evident, and so the fort was built. In 1831, the king Louis Philippe I visited the building. The fort of Bregille wasn't utilised in the Franco-Prussian War or World War I, because the Franche-Comt√© was saved from these wars. During World War II, the fort housed an anti-aircraft battery. After the war, the building is reserved for the associations. Now, the inside of the fort is closed to tourists because it is in use by the police and by an animal protection society, but hikers may view the ramparts, and the hill provides a panoramic view of the town.

In the United States, the service is known as HondaLink, or sometimes MyLink. It provides mobile connectivity for on-demand traffic information services and internet provided maps displayed inside selected Honda vehicles. The service began August 1997 and was first offered in the 1998 Honda Accord and the Honda Torneo sold only in Japan starting July 1998. The service received a revision to services offered October 2002, adding traffic information delivery capabilities for subscribers to the Internavi Premium Club, and was optional on most Honda vehicles sold in Japan. VICS was integrated into the service starting September 2003. Membership in the service has steadily grown to exceed 5 million subscribers as of March 2007. The subscription service replaces the need to periodically update in-car navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the drivers cellphone with a data download plan associated with the cellphone. The service is available without having to purchase a Honda vehicle installed with the technology; The Internavi LINC is available at both the Apple App Store and Android Market and can be installed on compatible mobile devices. One of the features offered is the ability to overlay weather information on the in-car map screen in 3D. Route guidance is provided in conjunction with VICS provided information so as to display a large weather disturbance approaching, such as a snow storm or typhoon, allowing drivers to take alternate routes. Internavi (with VICS)  The following is a description of the various elements that comprise Honda's \\"Internavi\\" information service, including integration of the Japanese governments nationally offered service VICS, or Vehicle Information and Communication System Press release for Internavi introduction = On-demand VICS = The technology is dependent on the user's cell phone service, and uses the data download plan associated with the users account. Once connected, one of the services available is route calculations towards a specific destination. The navigation technology interface connects to the server automatically at the Internavi Information Center, calculations and route planning is then determined towards establishing the quickest route towards the selected destination. The identified route also takes into consideration all currently known traffic and local transportation issues that may affect the plotted course from the VICS center, which is updated every five minutes based on reports from various sources. As travel begins towards the destination, any updated conditions are instantly relayed to the vehicle in real time. If cellphone service connection is lost, information will be updated as the connection is reestablished. Under normal navigation conditions, FM-multiplex broadcast VICS will prompt when specific conditions become aware, such as traffic congestion. The plotted course is then modified based on new information received to adjust travel time information, to include inter-city motorway links. Information received to vehicles installed with Internavi technology are installed with an antenna externally installed. Information is also transmitted by transmitter towers located throughout Japan, identified with a \\"Beacon Light\\" located on main urban roads. In this manner vehicles with Internavi receive information from both the \\"beacon light\\" towers and by individual cellphones paired up' with vehicles, providing highly accurate information in real time. = Internavi \\"floating car\\" system = As the vehicle travels, either on a planned destination or unguided autonomous driving, the vehicle installed with Internavi records the vehicle's GPS position and speed onto the vehicle's hard disk drive, and periodically updates to the Internavi Center Information Server. This autonomous information is then retransmitted towards other users, notifying of road conditions. Vehicles installed with previous internal maps utilizing a DVD are not given updated traffic conditions.29 March 2006 Honda's press release date Speed conditions are then displayed in three colors‚Äîred, orange and blue‚Äîto signify traffic congestion conditions, overlaid with updated VICS known conditions. This feature can be deactivated by the driver if position and speed of the individual vehicle does not want to be transmitted, however by doing so, road conditions can not be shared unless the tracking system is activated. Reports will then be limited to VICS information only. Road conditions can be specifically defined towards individual lane conditions, as opposed to general road conditions, such as to identify a traffic incident in a particular lane. As the information is stored by various contributing vehicles, congestion prediction can also be provided. Road conditions are transmitted by the VICS system, however, Internavi provides additional and more specific road and traffic conditions based on individual lane conditions provided by vehicles recording Internavi \\"floating car\\" conditions, specifying which lane and the direction of the road itself. Internavi supporting traffic information is transmitted by individual driver's cell phones, and if cellphone conditions are disrupted, the information is recorded onto the vehicles HDD, so that when cellphone reception is restored, all recorded information is then transmitted and updates are sent towards participating vehicles. =Parking selection function= Internavi participating vehicles also benefit from available parking spaces, whether it be on the street or in parking structures, public or private parking, from Internavi-equipped vehicles having made available a parking space. The space is also defined by the size of the leaving vehicle so that vehicles looking for a parking space can be reasonably confident the vacant space will accommodate the arriving vehicle. =Internavi Weather Features = As of October 2004, inclement weather conditions are overlaid onto the Internavi display map when the orientation of the map is displayed in 3D. This ability displays weather fronts as they approach the vehicles current position.2004 to display the information near the typhoon's path and destination weather \\"Honda Inter Navi System\\" was installed after the A new feature addition. =Information and CDDB music downloads = When playing a CD, the Internavi operating system provides the ability to save a particular song or the entire contents of the CD onto the hard disk within the vehicle. Information about the CD is then provided by Gracenote.  Other Services  = Map Update Service = The HDD map data is automatically updated for 24 months from registration, or up to 3 times map data on DVD sourced information before the first Japanese Government mandated vehicle inspection. After the time period has lapsed, map data updating is a supplementary service. If the vehicle has been sent to Honda dealers for repair, the HDD map data is completely upgraded to the most current data available. Any music files stored in the HDD will be safeguarded to prevent accidental deletion. = Personal Home Page= The Member ID and password issued at the time of admission, which provides a personal home page in conjunction with the car navigation features. Key features, drive information, drive configuration spot, and notification of when maintenance is based on information sent from the car navigation system mileage. Users can plan ahead drive on a personal website, on a list that you have a destination, it is possible to easily perform the setting operation in the car destination. In addition, in June 2005 \\"Departure Time Traveller\\" is added a feature called, departure city, destination, and enter the desired arrival time, departure time and route recommendation, etc. To display the toll charges due. = QQ Calls = Internavi also offers a hands-free phone call service to call for assistance, such as an accident, or a road emergency. The service also provides a 24-hour roadside assistance service and vehicle towing service. The service is an additional ¬•2,000 enrollment fee, plus an JAF enrollment with an annual fee ¬•4,000 \\"Confederation of Japan Automobile\\". The service is three years complimentary for owners of the Honda Legend and the Honda Elysion with the V6 engine. This service also provides a live operator who can provide additional road assistance services in comparison to other points and to ensure alternative means of transportation and lodging expenses when it becomes impossible to continue driving. = Eco-Index = Honda's hybrid vehicles Honda Insight, the Honda CR-Z, and the Honda Fit Hybrid provide information such as Internet navigation information, and it records the accumulated mileage of the vehicle, which can be compared to other Hybrid owners vehicles and comparisons made towards other driver's habits. Membership System When a Honda product with an Internavi compatible navigation system installed is purchased, the new owner can have the system activated by visiting any Japanese Honda dealership. The new owner then completes an application form to register the vehicle and pertinent information about the owner of the vehicle. Once completed, a PIN and activation instructions are sent to the owner. Compatible navigation systems Gathers model VXH-072CV navigation unit Older vehicles that were not sold with Internavi installed, but were compatible with the technology can be retrofitted with the system by visiting any Honda dealer, or by visiting \\"Honda Access\\" accessories retailers and have Internavi installed. In Japan, an automobile parts retail chain called \\"Autobacs\\" sells an in-dash navigation system built by Honda called \\"Gathers\\" that is compatible with the Internavi technology, and can install the equipment into any vehicle. Previous navigation technology that uses either DVD loaded maps or use a Hard Disk Drive may be compatible with Internavi. In addition, the DVD navigation system installed in the JDM Honda MDX can be upgraded and made compatible with Internavi. The JDM Honda Odyssey, Elysion, and the Honda Edix also have older versions of in-car navigation systems that can be upgraded. Pioneer \\"Carrozzeria\\" products are also found to be compatible. Compatible mobile phone When Internavi was introduced, NTT DoCoMo's \\"mova\\" (Link to Docomo Glossary) and \\"au\\" phone, using CDMA 1X WIN technology was compatible. Phones that are identified with 3G technology can be paired with Internavi using a Bluetooth connection. In Japan, telecom company WILLCOM offers flat-rate telecommunications services, depending on the type of third generation mobile navigation what can be connected directly to telephone or cable for in home use on personal computers.

Edward Coke from 1728 to 1744, was a British Member of Parliament. He represented Norfolk in Parliament from 1741 to 1747 and Harwich from 1747 to his death. He was the only child and heir of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, and his wife Margaret Coke, 19th Baroness de Clifford. The family estate was at Holkham Hall, Norfolk. He was married on 1 April 1747 to Lady Mary Campbell (6 February 1727 ‚Äì 30 September 1811), the fifth and youngest daughter of the soldier and politician John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1680‚Äì1743), and his second wife, Jane (c.1683‚Äì1767), a maid of honour to Queen Anne and Caroline, Princess of Wales. Their courtship had been strained, and in retaliation Edward left her alone on their wedding night and from then on virtually imprisoned her. She reacted by refusing to have sex with him. She never used the title Viscountess Coke. Their families went to litigation, and eventually produced a settlement in 1750 whereby Lady Mary could live with her mother at Sudbrook but had to remain married to Edward until his death. He died in 1753, when Mary was 26, predeceasing his father. They had no children and the earldom thus became extinct when his father died in 1759. His father's estate, including Holkham Hall, went instead to Edward's cousin. Lady Mary never remarried.

Newellton Elementary School (Pre-K through grade 8) Newellton gymnasium and auditorium (renovated 1976) 1957 cornerstone; updated in 1976 Graves of the Reverend and Mrs. Aubrey Denson Foster; he was a former pastor of the First Baptist Church of Newellton, recently renovated, and a science instructor and then principal at the former Newellton High School. Grave of George H. Prince, a former Newellton High School business teacher from St. Joseph, is located in Legion Memorial Cemetery north of Newellton. Grave of former Tensas Parish School Superintendent Charles Ed Thompson; Mrs. Thompson died on January 2, 2010. Newellton High School was a rural public high school in Newellton in northern Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana located near the Mississippi River. NHS operated throughout most of the 20th century until its closure in 2006 due to declining parish population and student enrollment. Located at 400 Verona Street adjacent to Depot Street, the NHS campus is now the site of Newellton Elementary School, which houses pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade. Background Newellton High School was twice renovated. A second structure was completed in 1957 under Superintendent A. E. Swanson.Plaque at Newellton High School, H.H. Land Architects, 1957 Another major renovation followed in 1976, as parts of the preceding facility were torn down and rebuilt, and the gymnasium/auditorium was refurbished. During its existence, NHS first served grades one through eleven. In 1948, the twelfth grade was added throughout Louisiana. During the 1960s, Newellton High School won two district football championships and was the runner-up at the state competition in its division. Later Mayor Edwin G. Preis (1916-2011) and another businessman, Orrice R. Barnes (1921-1996), the Western Auto dealer, were the announcers for the home football games. In August 1970, NHS was desegregated by federal court order, following the ruling by the US Supreme Court that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. By the 1970s and 1980s, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten were added. Reasons for closing At the close of the 2005-2006 academic year, there were only seventy-four pupils in the high school grades. On May 18, 2006, the Tensas Parish School Board voted by a four-to-three margin to keep Newellton High School open for at least one additional year. However, parish Superintendent Carol Shipp Johnson had proposed that Newellton grades 9-12 be reassigned to St. Joseph, the parish seat, where they would attend Joseph Moore Davidson High School, which served grades 7-12 and also had a low enrollment. Grades 7-8 attend Tensas High School except for the pupils in those grades in Newellton, who remain with the elementary campus there. The former Davidson High School was named for Joseph Moore Davidson (born 1894), who died in battle shortly before the armistice was signed in 1918 ending World War I. Ultimately, financial considerations compelled the consolidation of Newellton and Davidson schools into the rearranged Tensas High School at the Davidson campus in St. Joseph. It is located across the highway from the St. Joseph Baptist Church and near the central office of the school board. Violence broke out at the consolidated school on November 2, 2006, and fourteen male students were arrested by the office of Sheriff Rickey Jones.Monroe News Star, 3 November 2006: Newellton High School lost a popular English teacher in the spring of 2006, when William Randolph \\"Randy\\" Achey(born 1952), a native of Virginia and former Alabama resident, died of heart failure. His memorial service was held in the school gymnasium. Newellton High School had a relatively new facility and the board was reluctant to abandon a structure still in good condition, even though enrollment numbers were too low. The athletic teams known as \\"The Bears\\" drew enthusiastic support from the community for many years. The football teams usually played rivals at Davidson High School or other schools in Tallulah, Mangham, or Delhi. For years, Edgar Allan \\"Jack\\" Poe (1916-1994) of Newellton wrote the \\"Our Bears\\" column in the parish weekly newspaper, The Tensas Gazette. Citing low enrollments, the school board had already closed Waterproof High School, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and Lisbon Elementary School, both in the economically depressed town of Waterproof in the southern part of Tensas Parish. In 2011, the remaining Newellton Elementary School, which is 85 percent African American, enrolled 219 of the approximately 760 public school pupils in Tensas Parish. Every child in the school is eligible for federal Title I assistance. Notable alumni *C. B.

Following this, a lieutenant was suspended from duty and the regiment was removed from patrol duties in Coalisland. =17 May= On the evening of 17 May, a fist-fight began at Lineside Road, where a group of young men were having a drink. A passing four- man patrol of the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) regiment was challenged to a 'boxing match' by the residents. The soldiers set aside their weapons and engaged the youths. Injuries were reported on both sides, none critical. The official claim was that the patrol was attacked by a mob of at least 30 people.Alsing-B√∏rgesen, Kai (1993).

The Moral of Coalisland. Spare Rib (issues 231‚Äì39), p. 47 Two KOSB soldiers were hospitalised. The Parachute Regiment was called to the scene again, and at 8:30 p.m., a major riot started outside The Rossmore pub between local people and about 20 to 25 paratroopers. The soldiers claimed one of their colleagues was isolated and dragged by the crowd. Some witnesses claimed paratroopers were in a frenzy, showing their guns and inviting civilians to try to take them. Suddenly, shots were fired by the troops ‚Äîfirst into the air and then towards the people outside the pub. Three civilians were rushed to hospital in Dungannon with gunshot wounds, while the soldiers returned to their barracks. Another four civilians suffered minor injuries. The paratroopers claim that a \\"member of the growing crowd\\" attempted to fire the stolen machine gun at them, but the weapon jammed. One of the wounded was the brother of IRA volunteer Kevin O'Donnell, who had been killed by the Special Air Service (SAS) in February during an ambush at the nearby hamlet of Clonoe, shortly after carrying out a machine-gun attack on the local RUC base. Aftermath One of the roads to Coalisland centre, which was blocked by British paratroopers on 12 May 1992 About 500 people attended a protest rally in Coalisland on 19 May, and the wisdom of deploying the troops to patrol the town was questioned by members of the D√°il in Dublin. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Ireland, David Andrews, asked the British Government to withdraw the regiment. As a result, the paratroopers were redeployed outside the urban areas.The Irish Emigrant, \\"Paratroopers remain in North\\". Issue No. 277, 25 May 1992 The RUC claimed that the stolen machine gun was found 11 days later at a farmhouse near Cappagh, along with another light machine gun and an AK-47 rifle.Fortnight, issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 24 Author Steven Taylor claims that the stolen GPMG and other weaponry was recovered following an aborted IRA attack against a Wessex helicopter. Republicans questioned whether the weapon had really been stolen, suggesting this was merely an excuse for the soldiers' rampage in Coalisland. Bernardette McAliskey went even further, suggesting that the recovery of the machine gun near Cappagh, where the initial IRA attack had taken place, was actually staged by the security forces as a publicity stunt. British officials accused Sinn F√©in of being the instigators of the riots, while Michael Mates, then Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, stated that the incidents were due to \\"a gang of thugs motivated by the IRA\\".House of Commons, Thursday, 21 May 1992 Eventually the battalion's 1992 tour in Northern Ireland was scaled down, with the patrols suspended before the official end of the deployment.

The Ulster Television documentary Counterpoint of June 1993 claimed that Northern Ireland's Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Alisdair Fraser returned the case file to the RUC recommending no prosecution. The programme also interviewed Alistair Hodgson, the soldier maimed at Cappagh, who said that \\"had another member of my unit been injured in the way that I was, I would have been with the rest of the lads attacking the locals\\". Authors Andrew Sanders and Ian S. Wood suggested that the deployment of the battalion in Coalisland and elsewhere hindered the British policy of police primacy in Northern Ireland.

History  The island was originally known as Hunt's Island. Following US independence, the Royal Navy, deprived of its continental bases between Nova Scotia and the West Indies, established the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island. In addition to Ireland, Boaz, and Watford islands at the West of the Great Sound, the Admiralty purchased most of the small islands in the Great Sound and Hamilton Harbour. Over the following century, the Royal Navy and the British Army found various uses of these smaller islands. = US Naval use = White's Island served as a United States Navy base (Number 24) during the closing years of the First World War, being used as a staging point for anti-submarine vessels deploying to the European theatre of operations during their trans- Atlantic crossings. New Bases Extend From Arctic Down to Tropics, The Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, USA. Tuesday, 8 October, 1940  Controversies  White's Island currently belongs to the Bermuda Government, assigned to its Department of Youth, Sport and Recreation, which has permitted its use for many years by youth charities. The Bermuda Sailing Association (BSA) had an informal lease, which it lost on September 28, 2010, when a minister of the Progressive Labour Party government granted a 21-year lease to a new charity, CARTEL (Challenging and Reclaiming the True Essence of Life), for use in its youth rehabilitation programme. The government of Bermuda closed the Training School, its last facility for juvenile delinquents (a youth prison that had been located on Paget Island, Bermuda, in St. George's Harbour), two decades before. BDA Sun - White's Island Leases of government land for twenty-one years or longer require parliamentary approval. The PLP government avoided this by granting a lease for one day short of twenty-one years. The BSA was forced to relocate its youth sailing programme to Darrell's Island. The Bermuda Amateur Swimming Association (BASA), which had also long had free use of White's Island for its own youth programme, was advised it would have to pay CARTEL $10 per child per week for its continued use of the island. The Bermuda Rowing Association was permitted to continue its use of the island for its youth programme at no charge. The granting of a lease to CARTEL, which is controlled by PLP party officers, is tied to wider accusations of the misappropriation of government revenues and assets by the PLP, which was defeated in the parliamentary election of 2012. The association typically welcomes 80 to 120 children a week to the camp, meaning it could have to pay CARTEL as much as $7,200 before the end of the summer.

While it is difficult to truly control WOM, research has shown that there are three generic avenues to 'manage' WOM for the purpose of WOMM: 1.) Build a strong WOM foundation (e.g. sufficient levels of satisfaction, trust and commitment), 2.) Indirect WOMM management which implies that managers only have a moderate amount of control (e.g. controversial advertising, teaser campaigns, customer membership clubs), 3.) Direct WOMM management, which has higher levels of control (e.g. paid WOM 'agents', \\"friend get friend\\" schemes). Proconsumer WOM has been suggested as a counterweight to commercially motivated word of mouth. History George Silverman, a psychologist, pioneered word-of-mouth marketing when he created what he called \\"teleconferenced peer influence groups\\" in order to engage physicians in dialogue about new pharmaceutical products. Silverman noticed an interesting phenomenon while conducting focus groups with physicians in the early 1970s. \\"One or two physicians who were having good experiences with a drug would sway an entire group of skeptics. They would even sway a dissatisfied group of ex- prescribers who had had negative experiences!\\" With the emergence of Web 2.0, many web start-ups like Facebook, YouTube, MySpace, and Digg have used buzz marketing by merging it with the social networks that they have developed. With the increasing use of the Internet as a research and communications platform, word of mouth has become an even more powerful and useful resource for consumers and marketers. In October 2005, the advertising watchdog group Commercial Alert petitioned the United States FTC to issue guidelines requiring paid word-of-mouth marketers to disclose their relationship and related compensation with the company whose product they are marketing. The United States FTC stated that it would investigate situations in which the relationship between the word-of-mouth marketer of a product and the seller is not revealed and could influence the endorsement. The FTC stated that it would pursue violators on a case-by-case basis. Consequences for violators may include cease-and-desist orders, fines or civil penalties. The Word of Mouth Marketing Association, a US American trade group that represents hundreds of companies, has adopted an ethics code stating that manufacturers should not pay cash to consumers in return for recommendations or endorsements. Research firm PQ Media estimated that in 2008, companies spent $1.54 billion on word- of-mouth marketing. While spending on traditional advertising channels was slowing, spending on word-of-mouth marketing grew 14.2 percent in 2008, 30 percent of that for food and drink brands. Word of mouth marketing today is both online and through face-to-face interaction. The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science has shown that to achieve growth, brands must create word of mouth beyond core fan groups‚Äîmeaning marketers should not focus solely on communities such as Facebook. According to Deloitte, further research has shown that 'most advocacy takes place offline'‚Äîinstead it happens in person. According to the Journal of Advertising Research, 75% of all consumer conversations about brands happen face-to-face, 15% happen over the phone and just 10% online. On the other hand, some see social media interaction as being inextricably tied to word of mouth marketing.. In 2003, Fred Reichheld implemented the strategy of word-of-mouth marketing by introducing Net Promoter Score, which analyzes the number of Promoters a brand has, who recommend the brand to other people they know through such marketing tactic. What Drives Word of Mouth  According to academic research and Jonah Berger's bestselling book Contagious: Why Things Catch On, there are six key factors that drive what people talk about and share.https://www.fastcompany.com/3006693/fifty-percent-of-the-tipping-point- is-wrong-jonah-berger-shows-you-which-half They are organized in an acronym called STEPPS which stands for: * Social Currency - the better something makes people look, the more likely they will be to share it * Triggers - things that are top of mind (i.e., accessible) are more likely to be tip of tongue * Emotion - when we care, we share. High arousal emotions increase sharing * Public - the easier something is to see, the more likely people are to imitate it * Practical Value - people share useful information to help others * Stories - Trojan Horse stories carry messages and ideas along for the ride Another Key psychological Driver of Word-of-Mouth is interest.Berger, Jonah A. and Schwartz, Eric M., What Do People Talk About? Drivers of Immediate and Ongoing Word-of-Mouth (April 25, 2011). Journal of Marketing Research, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1822246 As Sernovitz suggests ‚Äúnobody talks about boring companies, boring products, or boring ads,‚Äù. Concepts/models  =Three models= When further research went into developing the concept word-of-mouth marketing, many models behind the word of mouth strategy also developed. These models include the organic inter consumer influence model, the linear marketer influence model and the network coproduction model. When dealing with the initial and simplest form of word of mouth Marketing it is related to the model of the organic inter-consumer influence model. This means that organisations having no direct input of what is being said about the particular product, it is just one consumer talking to another about product reviews and or customer service experience. The main motivation behind this model is for others to warn and inform potential consumers of a product out of their best interest not for personal gain. This model is referred to being organic because it occurs naturally, meaning it is not planned by the firm and occurs when the consumer wants to share their experience with a certain brand or product. As research started to progress, marketers found the importance of \\"influential consumers\\". So the linear marketer influence model was adopted. The linear marketer influence model introduces the idea of influential customers creating conversations with potential customers and consumers about how a certain product can be beneficial for them to purchase. This model allows organisations to make sure that credible influential sources are spreading the word/ message of the organisation and presenting the value proposition of the organisation successfully and accurately to the target consumer. This can be done through \\"targeted advertisements and promotions through credible sources that review the product\\". Marketers found this model to be an effective model of word-of- mouth marketing and it decreased the chances of negative opinions and attitudes from being spread about a particular product of the organization. The Network Coproduction Model: This saw marketers introduce \\"one to one seeding and communication programmes\\". This model encourages conversations between customers about the certain product through releasing information on a particular product. This word-of-mouth model is more focused on online activities, using blogs and online communities as sources in communicating the message of the product. The network coproduction model gives marketers the opportunity to control and manage word of mouth activity online. * Seeding is one example of how Marketers use the network coproduction model of word-of- mouth marketing. With seeding marketers can use various techniques and approaches these approaches can be indirect like engineering WOM conversations and direct approaches * The engineering approach consists of marketers constructing conversations, so there is more buzz created and the number of conversations based on an organisations product increases. * A direct approach to seeding is targeting special selected consumers and allowing them to sample products that an organisation has. This allows these selected customers to present their feelings towards these products through online communities or blogs. * Seeding campaigns can offer marketers the ability to reach a new set of consumers. It is most effective when the product is at the beginning stage of its product life style and helps to set the reputation of the brand and product into motion. =Buzz= Marketing buzz or simply \\"buzz\\" is a term used in word-of-mouth marketing‚Äîthe interaction of consumers and users of a product or service serve to amplify the original marketing message. Some describe buzz as a form of hype among consumers, a vague but positive association, excitement, or anticipation about a product or service. Positive \\"buzz\\" is often a goal of viral marketing, public relations, and of advertising on Web 2.0 media. The term refers both to the execution of the marketing technique, and the resulting goodwill that is created. Examples of products with strong marketing buzz upon introduction were Harry Potter, the Volkswagen New Beetle, Pok√©mon, Beanie Babies, and the Blair Witch Project. =Viral effects= Viral marketing and viral advertising are buzzwords referring to marketing techniques that use pre-existing social networks to produce increases in brand awareness or to achieve other marketing objectives (such as product sales) through self-replicating viral processes, analogous to the spread of virus or computer viruses. It can be word-of-mouth delivered or enhanced by the network effects of the Internet. June 23, 2005, 2005 Viral promotions may take the form of video clips, interactive Flash games, advergames, ebooks, brandable software, images, or even text messages. The goal of marketers interested in creating successful viral marketing programs is to identify individuals with high social networking potential (SNP) ‚Äì and have a high probability of being taken by another competitor‚Äîand create viral messages that appeal to this segment of the population. The term \\"viral marketing\\" has also been used pejoratively to refer to stealth marketing campaigns‚Äîthe unscrupulous use of astroturfing on-line combined with undermarket advertising in shopping centers to create the impression of spontaneous word-of-mouth enthusiasm. May 8, 2007 = Analyzing WOM= Consumers may promote brands by word-of-mouth due to social, functional, and emotional factors. Research has identified thirteen brand characteristics that stimulate WOM, namely: # Age of the brand in the marketplace: A long history of a brand or product can create an emotional relationship between the consumer and itself. This can stimulate WOM if the brand is known to be reliable or effective evident by the existence of its place in a market, this can be effective for companies for communicating their strength to other competitors. # Type of good: Depending on the type of product, experiences customers have with a product may mean that WOM can be used to suggest brands and products to others when in different forms of situations. An example of this could be a household or garden object. # Complexity: WOM is used in this instance to help explain the use of a product or its effectiveness to whether of not it will serve its purpose or need. # Knowledge about a brand: Similar to complexity, WOM can be used to describe the effectiveness of a brand, the history behind it and what the main purpose of the product is. WOM is also used to identify a company's future whether it be positive or negative. # Differentiation: An experience with different products within a market can mean that WOM can offer solutions to others and explain which products and brands could be more effective than others when looking at similar products serving the same need. Previous consumers can help describe strengths and weaknesses of products and help make the correct decision. # Relevance of a brand to a broad audience # Quality: esteem given to a brand # Premium: WOM regarding premiums can refer too different packaging of a brands products e.g. during Easter or over Christmas. Different and exciting packaging and deals can stimulate a huge source of WOM communication and can lead to brands becoming extremely popular over short periods of time. An example of this would be supermarket 'bulk buy' deals over the Christmas holiday period. # Visibility # Excitement: WOM can be used to promote up and coming products which results in huge amounts of excitement. An example of this could be new technology being released to the public and advances in medical technology and vehicles. These examples are best used to demonstrate excitement as a result of word of mouth marketing. # Satisfaction # Perceived risk: WOM can be used to warn other potential buyers that a product is not what it claims to be. An example of this may be online buying as a result of marketing strategies from phony companies who focus on producing fake goods that look and seem like the legitimate product. An example of this would be fake iPhones and clothing (most significantly shoes and sports wear). # Involvement This research also found that while social and functional drivers are the most important for promotion via WOM online, the emotional driver predominates offline. =Advantages and disadvantages= Word of mouth marketing can be very effective in the communication of the advertising campaign as it can offer a solution to \\"penetrating consumers guards\\" to get them talking about a particular product. Many marketers find this type of marketing strategy advantageous to the entire advertising campaign of a certain product. One positive aspect of this marketing strategy is that sources of this word-of-mouth advertising are mostly personal. This means that they are not subject to persuasion from the organisation for personal gains or subject to being bias. This has a positive effect on the advertising campaign as it shows what consumers honestly think about a product and the motivation to try the particular product or services increases, due to the consumer being recommended by a trusted reliable source. However, there are some disadvantages and criticisms with word-of-mouth marketing. Word-of-mouth marketing is subject to a lot of clutter. Unlike traditional word of mouth, electronic WOM is able to include not only positive reviews but also negative reviews made by former, actual and potential customers online in a timely manner. As a result, word-of-mouth marketing may sometimes not be beneficial in changing or influencing consumer's attitudes and perception especially from an organic source as negative conversations may be held about the brand. This is due to the organic source not finding the product beneficial and therefore has a negative perception of the product, which is then shared. Although positive word-of-mouth positively influences purchase intention while negative word-of-mouth decreases customer purchase intention, the effect is asymmetric. Compared with positive word-of-mouth, negative word-of-mouth has a larger effect on purchase intentions. One more criticism about this marketing strategy is that people tend to be offput and feel deceived when they find out that a person who influenced their attitude about a product has been working towards or benefiting from doing that. This ultimately has the potential to make consumers change their attitude, which can have a negative impact on the firm's product reputation. This may be the case as consumers feel that it wasn't in the source's interest to tell what their full perceptions were of the brand. Similarly, engineered word of mouth by internet-campaigns companies can be seen as artificial and sometime based on information considered private.

A business survey conducted by the Norman Arts Council during the same year estimated the economic impact of NMF to the city of Norman to be in excess of $2.5 million. NMF is held annually on the third Thursday through Saturday of April; if the traditional festival weekend conflicts with the Easter holiday then NMF shifts to the fourth weekend of the month to avoid conflicts with other Norman festivities. Norman Music Festival Founded as a one-day event, NMF has grown to encompass three full days of music and arts in the downtown Norman area with attendance growing significantly each year. Beginning in 2009, the NMF logo added a number to the end of its acronym to denote the number of occurrences of the festival. For example, the 2009 NMF was known as NMF2, 2010 was NMF3, and so on. NMF is organized by volunteers and funded via donations from private citizens and nearby businesses. The festival is now sponsored by the Norman Arts Council. =2008= NMF was first held in 2008 and at that time was a single-day musical event; it was not yet known if the festival would be a reoccurring phenomenon.

Dick, first published in 1954 in Thrilling Wonder Stories and later in The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, Volume One: Beyond Lies The Wub and later trade editions of the collected stories.  Plot summary  The story is set several hundred years into the future, when a space portal vital to Earth's colonies in the far reaches of space is taken over by the hostile species Ganymedes, who threaten to blow it up unless Earth starts paying them a tax on everything that passes through the portal. Earth ponders whether to go to war with them, but they manage to capture a Ganymedean space ship, which they think can help them in the upcoming war. A group of four military and scientists take the ship, which resembles a globe, on a test run, and find themselves in a foreign land which looks like Earth. They encounter people living there, who are a few inches tall, and live in miniature society. The crew goes back to the ship, and sets the instruments to take them the opposite way, there they find themselves in a world where humans are a lot larger than them, and barely make it back to Earth. They conclude that the space ship is useless, and decide to hand it back to the Ganymedes, who reveal to them that it is in fact not a space ship, but a time machine. The scientists conclude that the observed differences in size were caused by the expanding universe. Expanding Universe The fanciful abuse of the concept of expanding universe that has ordinary objects such as human beings, horses and buildings becoming larger over time, instead of its usual meaning that certain celestial objects become more distant from each other over time, is also used in the later short story \\"Prominent Author\\". 1954 short stories Short stories by Philip K.

He was a knight of the Order of Calatrava. He also appeared as a character in the 2007 film Elizabeth: The Golden Age, played by the British actor Will Houston. Life John Man, English ambassador in Madrid, had called the pope a sanctimonious little monk and so Philip II replaced the priest Diego de Silva y Guzm√°n with Esp√©s as ambassador to England. Due to his hostility to the English, Esp√©s described William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, one of the most powerful and influential noblemen in England at that time, to Philip II as In the Spanish Netherlands the Geuzens' Revolt began and in November 1568 the royal treasury in Seville sent five ships with 40,000 pounds of gold, with which Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba was to raise troops in the Netherlands to quell the revolt. These ships were attacked by Huguenot privateers and sought protection in British waters. Esp√©s told Elizabeth that the gold belonged to Philip's bankers and was being sent to Antwerp and asked that Elizabeth protect the ships. She agreed and most of the ships anchored in English ports. However, news then reached Elizabeth of a Spanish attack on the British ships in San Juan de Ul√∫a port and in reprisal ordered that the Spanish ships be confiscated and their gold moved to the Tower of London.Colin Martin, Geoffrey Parker, The Spanish Armada S.61 On Esp√©s's advice, Alva then seized the goods of English merchant ships anchored at Antwerp.http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/elizabeth_spain.htm In a letter dated 14 February 1569 Esp√©s wrote that John Hawkins had founded a colony in Florida in lieu of that lost at San Juan de Ul√∫a.http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/search?id=8225Letter of August 1569 He was finally expelled from England for his alleged complicity in the Ridolfi plot.Henry Kamen, Who's who in Europe, 1450-1750, Volume 158James Anthony Froude, History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada S.17 He also had a surviving correspondence in April 1571.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=86978 Notes 1524 births 1572 deaths Ambassadors of Spain to England 16th-century diplomats 16th-century Spanish people ","title":"Guerau de Esp√©s"},{"id":"30264478","text":"Alt er tabt is an album by Under Byen released in 2010.

It is Kudo's last single to be released in 7-inch vinyl format. The song, which has never appeared on an original album, was included in the compilation album, Harvest. It was featured on commercials for Taiyo Yuden That's cassette tapes. \\"K≈çsa ni Fukarete\\" was the last song to top the charts of the TBS music show The Best Ten on its final broadcast on September 28, 1989. At the 4th Japan Gold Disc Awards, \\"K≈çsa ni Fukarete\\" was one of the five recipients of the award for Best Single of the Year, which Kudo also won that same year for her single \\"Arashi no Sugao\\". In 2015, DAM asked their users to select their favorite Shizuka Kudo songs to sing karaoke to and compiled a top ten list; \\"K≈çsa ni Fukarete\\" came in at number one. Background and composition  \\"K≈çsa ni Fukarete\\" marks the first collaboration between Kudo and Nakajima since \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\". The song was written by Miyuki Nakajima and Tsugutoshi Got≈ç. Got≈ç composed the melody and produced the track before sending it to Nakajima, who then wrote the lyrics. Lyrically, Nakajima employs an exotic imagery of Arabian sandstorms to convey the sentiment of feeling lost after a breakup. She describes the perspective of a woman abandoned by her lover who finds comfort in the fact that there are \\"as many kind men as there are grains of sand\\". Critical reception The song has been praised as being a \\"relatable anthem\\" to entire generations, present and future, of heartbroken women, who are also as \\"numerous as grains of sand\\". Cover versions In 1989, Nakajima recorded a cover for her third self-cover album, Kaikinetsu. Nakajima's version contains slight changes to the lyrics and is also lowered by two whole steps. Kudo has performed the Kaikinetsu version on the Fuji TV music show Music Fair. In 2015, Kudo performed the song on the same program with Leo Ieiri, Trustrick and Mariya Nishiuchi. In 1993, Krisdayanti recorded a cover of the song in English, dubbed \\"Lost in the Storm\\", which was included on the compilation album The Best of Asia Bagus. In 2013, Japanese model and singer Y≈´ki Akimoto recorded a cover for Tsugutoshi Got≈ç's concept album, King of Pops.

It logged a total of 22 weeks in the top 100 and sold over 500,000 copies. The song was recognized by Oricon as the best-selling single for September and October 1989.

The half-hour series was broadcast weekdays at 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) from 1 April to 7 October 1969. Premise Contestants consisted of teams of couples who were situated on a large circular maze covering the studio floor. Their goal was to move towards the centre of the maze by correctly answering questions during their turns. Contestants could be set back by their opponents by being blocked or by landing on booby traps which were secretly laid on the maze. Couples won by reaching the centre of the maze or by being the closest to the centre at the end of the program time. Winning contestants did not return for successive episodes, in contrast with typical American game show practice, nor did winners return for a later championship series. Part of the strategy of the game involved deciding where and when to place blocks or booby traps. Time was limited for each step towards the centre of the maze. This was exciting for the contestants, but perhaps less so for the television viewer, who could not observe the alternatives considered by the contestants. Substantial prizes such as furniture and appliances were awarded, which were unusually generous by Canadian game show standards.

It can be considered an experiment of computer-aided literature, where the techniques of combinatorics and constraint-based writing developed by the French writers' gathering Oulipo are applied to the narrative structure rather than just to the syntactic arrangement of a text.  Story/plot  A computer analyst and programmer is hired by an insurance company to reconstitute antecedents and circumstances of a boarding house that has mysteriously burnt to the ground. All four tenants of the house died in the blaze : the Widow Roessler (house owner), her adoptive daughter Ogiva, the young Inigo, and the Uzbek wrestler Belindo Kind. While the police have dismissed the investigation since all the persons involved are dead, the insurance company is determined to investigate the circumstances behind the blaze as each tenant took out life insurance with the company. The only available clue is the charred copybook found in the ruins of the house of which the cover alone has survived. Written on the front is the title, \\"An Account of the Abominable Deeds Committed in this House\\" while on the back is an index with twelve entries in alphabetical order: * Blackmail * Drugging * Incitement to Suicide * Knifing * Prostitution * Threatening with a Gun * Tying and Gagging * Rape * Seduction * Slander * Snooping * Strangling To solve the enigma, the computer programmer approaches it in formal terms: each of the four characters can be at the same time the object and the subject of the 12 possible acts mentioned in the notebook's index. Taken two per time, these can configure 12 different transitive and non-reflexive relations each, resulting in a total of 12 power 12 (874.296.672.256) possible relations. In order to narrow down the number of possible hypotheses, the programmer needs to define a system of filters and selection rules that can allow the computer to automatically exclude those hypotheses that seem to be physically or logically impossible.  History  Oulipo member and ALAMO (Atelier de Litt√©rature Assist√©e par la Math√©matique et les Ordinateurs) founder Paul Braffort explained that Calvino initially published a shorter version of the story in the Italian edition of Playboy magazine in 1973. Calvino later expanded the text with the view to turning it into a novel titled, L‚Äôordre dans le crime ( literally \\"The Order in Crime\\" and L‚Äôordine del delitto in Italian). Braffort was asked by Calvino to write an editing and filtering program. This collaboration resulted in a presentation made on 15 June 1977 at the \\"Atelier de Recherches Avanc√©es\\" at the Pompidou Centre (Centre for Art and Culture) in Paris.

After the dough is mixed and cooled, it is pressed into fluted tins. Children as young as two or three can help with this phase, so it is a first baking experience for many. After ten minutes in the oven, popping the cookies out of the hot tins is best left to adults. In 1845 a recipe for sandbakelse appeared in a Norwegian cookbook, but they were not widespread until later in the 19th century. They became popular later than the similar krumkake because sandbakelse required fine flour, which was not yet widely available.Stokker, Kathleen (2001).

In 1970, during a training exercise, it made an unpiloted landing in a farmer's field in Montana, suffering only minor damage, after the pilot had ejected from the aircraft. The aircraft, recovered and repaired, was returned to service, and is currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. History The underside of 58-0787, showing the damage it received during its belly landing The individual aircraft was manufactured by Convair in 1958 and received the tail number 58-0787. It served with 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron based at Malmstrom Air Force Base adjacent to Great Falls, Montana. During a routine training flight conducting aerial combat maneuvers on February 2, 1970, the aircraft entered a flat spin. The pilot, Captain Gary Faust, attempted to recover, deploying the aircraft's drag chute as a last resort; recovery proved to be impossible. Faust fired his ejection seat and escaped the stricken aircraft at an altitude of . The reduction in weight and change in center of gravity caused by the removal of the pilot, coupled with the blast force of his seat rocketing out of the plane pushing the nose of the aircraft down, which had been trimmed by Faust for takeoff and idle throttle, caused the aircraft to recover from the spin. One of the other pilots on the mission was reported to have radioed Faust during his descent by parachute that \\"you'd better get back in it!\\".Grier 2009 From his parachute, Faust watched incredulously as the now- pilotless aircraft descended and skidded to a halt in a farmer's field near Big Sandy, Montana. Faust drifted into the nearby mountains. He was later rescued by local residents using snowmobiles. Shortly thereafter the local sheriff and local residents arrived at the scene of the crash. The thrust from the still-idling jet engine allowed the aircraft to slowly drift on its belly along a field. The sheriff, having contacted the air base, was informed that he should simply allow the jet to run out of fuel, which occurred an hour and forty-five minutes later without further incident. A recovery crew from McClellan Air Force Base arrived on the scene and began to dismantle the aircraft, removing its wings for transport aboard a railroad flat car. The damage to the aircraft was minimal; indeed, one officer on the recovery crew is reported to have stated that if there were any less damage he would have simply flown the aircraft out of the field. Preservation The aircraft at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in 2005 Following its misadventure, the \\"Cornfield Bomber\\" was repaired and returned to service, operating with the 49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, the final Air Force unit to operate the F-106. Faust flew the aircraft again in 1979 while training at Tyndall Air Force Base.

Derived from Martin Marietta's work on the cancelled ASALM missile, SLAT proved to have severe difficulties in flight testing, and the project was cancelled during 1991. Design and development Development of what became the YAQM-127 was initiated in 1983 following the cancellation of the BQM-111 Firebrand. A replacement for the MQM-8 Vandal target drone was still required, and a specification was developed for a target drone, capable of being recovered via parachute and reused, for launch from a variety of aircraft.Parsch and Caston 2006 Bids for the contract were submitted by Martin Marietta, Ling-Temco-Vought, and Teledyne Ryan, with the Martin Marietta design being judged the winner of the design competition in September 1984.Munson 1988, p.206. Derived from the cancelled Advanced Strategic Air- Launched Missile developed by Martin Marietta for the United States Air Force, the missile utilised a Marquardt hybrid rocket-ramjet propulsion system, with a solid rocket booster providing initial thrust, with the rocket's chamber, following burnout, becoming the combustion chamber for a ramjet sustainer. The AQM-127 was designed to fly at speeds of Mach 2.5 at an altitude of , following a pre-programmed course on autopilot. The SLAT was to be fitted with radar signature augmentors and a radar seeker emulator; initial operational capability was projected for 1991. Operational history The first test launch of the fifteen YAQM-127A pre-production test missiles produced was conducted on November 20, 1987. A further five test flights were conducted between then and January 1989; however only one of the six tests proved a success. Following a twenty-two month stand-down to reassess the program and modify the missile design, flight testing resumed in November 1990; this test also was a failure, as was a final attempt at a test in May 1991. With the SLAT proving a consistent failure and the cost of the project increasing dramatically, the United States Congress stepped in, and during the summer of 1991 the AQM-127 program was cancelled. The Navy, still requiring a new high- speed target drone to replace the Vandal, would turn to a drone conversion of a Russian missile, the MA-31, as an interim solution.

History and overview The theatre resulted from a provincial project for the creation of a hub for tourism along Independence Square, downtown. The initiative, enacted by the reformist Governor Carlos Washington Lencinas in 1922, led to the opening of the Plaza Hotel, in 1924, and subsequently to a contract for the construction of the first opera house in Mendoza Province. The contract was awarded to Faustino and Mauricio da Rosa, who at the time managed the renowned Teatro Col√≥n of Buenos Aires by concession.Historia del Teatro Independencia Supervised by the nation's Ministry of Public Works, the project was commissioned to architect Alfredo Israel, and its plans were approved in October 1923. The theatre was, as were many public works of this type in Argentina at the time, designed in a French Academy style. Its fa√ßade included a Neoclassical frontis featuring four Corinthian columns on a green marble base, a rococo frieze, the provincial escutcheon in bas-relief, and a balustrade above.Ministerio de Educaci√≥n del Gobierno de Mendoza: Historia de la Remodelaci√≥n del Teatro Independencia The design for the interiors was based on those prevailing in Italian opera houses, and the formal vestibule is overlooked by grand marble steps leading to the concert hall. The auditorium itself includes four tiers of balconies, and its seating capacity is 730. The theatre serves as the home of the Provincial Philharmonic Orchestra. Following a pre-inaugural festival organized by the Ladies' Brigade of the right-wing Argentine Patriotic League, the Independenicia was inaugurated on November 18, 1925, with the premiere of La Emigrada (The Emigr√©e), an opera by Argentine librettist Vicente Mart√≠nez Cuiti√±o; the work was performed by the Compa√±√≠a Argentina de Dramas y Comedias, and featured Camila Quiroga (one of the leading opera performers in Argentina, at the time). Cinema installations were added to the theatre in 1944, and these were inaugurated with a showing of Casablanca. The building suffered from a massive fire in 1963, and reopened in 1965 with a performance by the Col√≥n Theatre Ballet Company. Further renovations begun in 2000 included the construction of a 5-story annex, and on September 21, 2003, the theatre was re-inaugurated with a performance by Mendoza-born soprano Fabiana Bravo.

After completing this voyage, she underwent repairs at Norfolk, Virginia, then served briefly as station tug at New London, Connecticut, before arriving at Bermuda on 18 May 1918 to serve as station tug there. As her machinery was considered too unreliable for convoy work, Sea Rover remained at Bermuda for over a year, primarily engaged in towing in the harbor and near the islands. However, on 2 September 1918, she departed Bermuda to escort the destroyer USS Barry (Destroyer No. 2) to Charleston, South Carolina. Barry released the tug from escort duty on 3 September 1918 and directed her to return to Bermuda, but on 4 September 1918 Sea Rover ran into a hurricane. During the next two days, Sea Rover cracked a seam in a fuel tank, developed a severe list which caused her to send an SOS, and finally took refuge in the Bahama Islands on 7 September 1918. Bermuda did not hear of her arrival at the Bahamas and, after an unsuccessful search for her, mistakenly reported her lost at sea on 9 September 1918. Sea Rover underwent repairs at Jacksonville, Florida, and returned to Bermuda on 14 October 1918, where she remained as station tug through the end of the war on 11 November 1918 and into 1919. =Postwar= Sea Rover next left Bermuda on 10 May 1919 to escort 40 submarine chasers to Charleston, South Carolina, but suffered a boiler failure during the voyage and had to be towed there herself. After repairs, she returned to duty at Bermuda on 10 June 1919, but was detached from duty there on 1 July 1919. Departing Bermuda on 14 July 1919, Sea Rover towed a gunnery target to the United States West Coast and arrived at San Francisco on 27 September 1919. There she was drydocked and then laid up in reserve with a caretaker crew. While in reserve, Sea Rover was reclassified as a fleet tug (AT) and redesignated AT-57 on 1 JulyThe Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s8/sea_rover.htm states that the reclassification occurred on 1 July 1920 and NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive SP-1014/AT 57 Sea Rover repeats this assertion, but the U.S. Navy did not put its modern hull number system into effect until 17 July 1920, so 17 July 1920 is the more likely date and the \\"1 July 1920\\" date may simply be a typographical error in the original hard-copy publication of the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. 1920. Disposal and later career Sea Rover was decommissioned on 4 March 1921 and stricken from the Navy List effective on the date of her final sale. This proved to be 25 February 1922, when she was sold to R. W. Greene of San Francisco. Once again SS Sea Rover, the tug returned to commercial service with the Shipowners and Merchants Tugboat Company of San Francisco until scrapped in 1949.

He later entered politics, initially in two minor right wing parties before becoming a Conservative Party member of parliament. British North Borneo Company Flag of British North Borneo He was the eldest son of Captain Vincent Jesson Applin, Military Train, of \\"Exeview\\", Alphington, near Exeter. Following education at Sherborne School, he initially sought employment as a stage actor. However, in December 1889 he became a cadet with the British North Borneo Company. He continued to serve in the company's administration of the protectorate, becoming successively a police magistrate and justice of the peace for Labuan and a District Officer. He was involved in the suppression of the Mat Salleh Rebellion from 1895‚Äì1897 and was awarded The British North Borneo Company's Medal and clasp. After eight years service Applin had reached the rank of Captain Superintendent in the British North Borneo Armed Constabulary, but was forced to resign due to ill health and returned to England. He wrote an account of his years in North Borneo entitled Across the Seven Seas. Military service =Second Boer War= In November 1898 Applin obtained a commission as a captain in the 6th (Militia) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. With the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War in 1899 the battalion was mobilised and sailed to South Africa. He was appointed District Commissioner at Bloemfontein in June 1900 and acting Provost-Marshal for the Orange River in October of the same year. He subsequently saw active service in the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, and was twice mentioned in despatches. In April 1902 he was granted the local rank of Captain in the Army whilst serving with a provisional battalion, and the following August he transferred to the Royal Garrison Regiment. For his service in the war, he was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the October 1902 South African Honours list. The following year he was appointed Brigade Major of Royal Artillery at Gibraltar. =Development of machine gun tactics= In July 1905 he transferred to a regular line regiment, the 14th (King's) Hussars. In August of the same year he was seconded to the General Staff and was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General for Musketry in Malta. In December 1906 Applin returned to his regiment, and in June 1911 promoted to major. During this period he was involved in developing tactics for the use of the machine gun, and in 1909 published one of the first books on the subject, Machine Gun Tactics. =First World War= During the First World War Applin became an instructor in the use of the machine gun, and was attached to the Machine Gun Corps Training Centre in July 1916. In November 1916 he was appointed temporary lieutenant-colonel, and commanded the machine guns of the II ANZAC Corps at the battles of Messines and Passchendaele. With the entry of the United States into the war, Applin was part of a British mission to the country, and gave lectures on machine gun tactics. He remained with the MGC until July 1919. In January 1919 Applin was given the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel and in February was made commanding officer of the 14th Hussars. He retired from the army in January 1921. Politics With the ending of his military career, Applin entered politics. After making two unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament with minor parties, he became the Conservative MP for Enfield. =Dartford by-election 1920= Applin was originally a member of the National Party, a xenophobic party that broke away from the Conservatives in 1917. He stood at the parliamentary by-election at Dartford in April 1920. The party came in a poor fourth place, with Applin losing his deposit. The intervention of the National Party and an Independent candidate split the Conservative vote and allowed John Edmund Mills of the Labour Party to secure an unexpected victory. The National Party was disbanded a year later. =Abbey by-election 1921= In August 1921 a parliamentary byelection was held for the constituency of Westminster Abbey. Applin stood as the candidate of Anti-Waste League, a right-wing party formed by Lord Rothermere in opposition to the spending plans of the Lloyd George Coalition government. Such was the unpopularity of the government that all three candidates, including the winner Brigadier-General John Nicholson of the Conservative Party (who formed part of the coalition), claimed to be \\"anti- waste\\". Applin finished in second place, receiving 34.9% of the votes cast. =Member of Parliament for Enfield= In September 1924 Applin was chosen as the Conservative Party's candidate to contest the north London seat of Enfield. The seat had been won by William Henderson of the Labour Party at the general election of 1923. When a further election was held in October of that year, he was elected with a majority of 2,079 votes in a straight fight with Henderson. At the next general election in 1929, Applin again faced Henderson as well as a Liberal candidate. Henderson regained the seat for Labour by the narrow margin of 258 votes. Following the collapse of the minority Labour Government, a National Government was formed in August 1931 and an election was held in October of the same year. Applin was the Conservative and National Government candidate, and was returned to the Commons when he defeated his Labour opponent by the large majority of 10,886 votes. He retired from parliament at the 1935 general election. Later life In 1935 he emigrated to South Africa. He died at his home in Howick, Natal in April 1957 aged 87. His medals were auctioned in 2009.

Biography =Life= He was born in Pescia on 11 November 1911, where his father was the Director of the local agricultural school.The contents of this section are mainly sourced from reference . His family later went to Rome, where his father ended his working career as the Director-general of the Italian Ministry of Public Education. Enzo Martilnelli lived in Rome almost all of his life: the only exception was a period of nearly eight years, from 1947 to 1954, when he was in Genova, working at the local university.See , and . In 1946 he married in Rome Luigia Panella, also her a mathematician, who later become an associate professor at the faculty of Engineering of the Sapienza University of Rome, and who was his loving companion for the rest of his life. They had a son, Roberto, and a daughter, Maria Renata, who later followed her parents footsteps becoming also her a mathematician:According to , around 2002 she worked as a research fellow at the faculty of Engineering of the Sapienza University of Rome four grandchildren completed their family.According to . =Academic career= In 1933 he earned his laurea from the Sapienza University of Rome: the title of his thesis was \\"Sulle funzioni poligene di una e di due variabili complesse\\",An English translation reads as \\"Polygenic functions of one and of two complex variables\\". and his thesis supervisor was Francesco Severi.See reference . From 1934 to 1946 he worked as an assistant professor first to the chair of mathematical analysis held by Francesco Severi and then to the chair of geometry held by Enrico Bompiani. In 1939 he became \\"Libero Docente\\" (free professor) of Mathematical analysis: he taught also courses on analytic geometry, algebraic geometry and topology as associate professor.See references and . In 1946 he won a competitive examination by a judging commission for the chair of \\"Geometria analitica con elementi di Geometria Proiettiva e Geometria Descrittiva con Disegno\\",According to references and . An English translation reads as \\"Analytic Geometry with elements of Projective Geometry and Descriptive Geometry with Drawing\\". awarded by the University of Genova: the second place and the third place went respectively to Giovanni Dantoni and Guido Zappa.As himself remembers. See also the official communication in the , where all the winners of the chairs are listed, irrespectively of their placement. Martinelli held that chair from 1946 to 1954, teaching also mathematical analysis, function theory, differential geometry and algebraic analysisAccording to : this topic is not the modern algebraic analysis founded by Mikio Sato, Masaki Kashiwara and collaborators, but an old standard Italian course topic in mathematics. as associate professor. In 1954 he went back in Rome to the chair of Geometry at the university, holding that chair up to his retirement, in 1982: he also taught courses on topology, higher mathematics, higher geometry upon charge. In the years 1968‚Äì1969, during a very difficult period for the Sapienza University of Rome,It was the season of the protests of 1968: a few more detail about Martinelli's work during this season can be found in the section describing his personality. he served the university as the director of the Guido Castelnuovo Institute of Mathematics. He attended various conferences and meetings. In 1943 and in 1946 he was invited in Zurich by Rudolf Fueter, in order to present his researches: later and during all his career he lectured in almost all Italian and foreign universities.According to : Rizza also lists a few universities where Martinelli lectured. He was also a member of the UMI Scientific Commission (from 1967 to 1972), of the editorial boards of the Rendiconti di Matematica e delle sue Applicazioni (from 1955 to 1992) and of the Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata (from 1965 to 1999).See . =Honors= According to , Enzo's talent for mathematics was already evident when he was only a lyceum student. While still attending the university, he won the Cotronei Foundation prize, and after earning his laurea, the Beltrami Foundation prize, the Fubini and Torelli prizes, and the Prize for Mathematical Sciences of the Ministry of National Education: this last one was awarded him in 1943, and the judging commission consisted of Francesco Severi (as the president of the commission), Ugo AmaldiUgo was a noted Italian mathematician, a collaborator of Tullio Levi-Civita and Federigo Enriques, and the father of noted physicist Edoardo Amaldi. and Antonio Signorini (as the supervisor of the commission).See the inventory of the Reale Accademia d'Italia by : this reference lists and briefly describes the contents of the documents of fascicle 207 of box (Busta) 104 of section VII, titled \\"Premi di Incoraggiamento e Sussidi\\" (). In 1948 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Accademia Ligure di Scienze e Lettere:There is a discrepancy in the date of election reported by (1948) and (1986): however, Dionisio Gallarati published his commemoration of Martinelli in the journal (Atti) of this Academy, and therefore his date is reasonably believed to be correct. in 1961 and in 1977 he was elected respectively Corresponding and Full Member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and from 1982 to 1985 he was \\"Professore Linceo\\".See : the \\"Professore linceo\\" () is a professor which is in charge to the Accademia dei Lincei as a distinguished lecturer. Finally, in 1980 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino and then, in 1994, Full Member. Also, in 1986, the Sapienza University of Rome, to which Enzo Martinelli was particularly tied for all his life, awarded him the title of professor emeritus. =Personality traits= He is unanimously remembered as a real gentleman,See and : the exact Italian word they use to characterize him is signorilit√†, which is somewhat untranslatable in its exact meaning. gifted by a caring attention, politeness, generosity and the rare ability to listen to colleagues and students alike:See . and remember long conversations with him on various mathematical research topics,They mean \\"mathematical research\\" in a broad sense: precisely states that Martinelli was interested in all fields of mathematics, not only the ones within his personal research interest. and his disposability to give help and advice to whoever asked for it. In particular recalls the time when he was his doctoral student at the University of Genova: they meet every Sunday in the afternoon at Martinelli's home, since Martinelli was not able to meet him during the week. During one of their meetings, lasting a little more than two hours, Martinelli taught him √âlie Cartan's theory of exterior differential forms, and Rizza used successfully this tool in his first research works.See and the entry about him for more details. Another episode illustrating this aspect of Martinelli's personality is recalled by Gaetano Fichera.Fichera sketches the episode in his \\"last lesson\\" : see also and the entry about Gaetano Fichera for further information. When he was back in Rome in 1945, at the end of the Second World War, he exposed to Martinelli a theory identical to the theory of differential form: he developed it while being prisoner of the nazists in Teramo during wartime. Martinelli, very tactfully,According to himself. told him that the idea was already being developed by √âlie Cartan and Georges de Rham. An excellent teacher himself, capable to arose curiosity and enthusiasm by his lessons,Some information on his teaching commitment can be found in the \\"Teaching activity\\" section of this entry. he admired and respected much his own:According to . however, this was quite common for the Italian scientists of the same and the preceding generations, who were advised in the early days of their scientific career by some of the best Italian scientists ever.See the entries about Italian mathematicians and physicists of that period, for example the entries about Renato Caccioppoli, Gaetano Fichera, Francesco Severi. His doctoral advisor was Francesco Severi: other great Italian mathematicians where among his teachers. Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques, Enrico Bompiani, Tullio Levi-Civita Mauro Picone and Antonio Signorini were all working at the Sapienza University of Rome when Enzo Martinelli was a student there, following their lessons: describes the activity of the institute of mathematics during that period as extremely stimulating.See also the description sketched by . Another central aspect of his personality was a deep sense of justice and legality: Martinelli was very careful in performing his citizen and university professor duties, and he was also ready to fight for his own rights and for the needs of higher education. Concerned by the growing interference of bureaucracy in university education, already in the 1950s he was heard by complaining that: \\"In Italia mancano le menti semplificatrici\\".\\"Italy lacks of simplifying minds\\"An Italian translation. Martinelli was also free from every kind of authoritarianism to the point that when, during the protests of 1968 in Italy, many newspapers accused the Italian university scientific community of being so, all the assistant professors and students of Martinelli (and perhaps Martinelli himself) were perplexed.According to . In the same period, while performing his duties as the director of the Guido Castelnuovo Institute of Mathematics at the Sapienza university of Rome, his rare intellectual honestyAccording to and to . and rigorous rationality, according to Rizza, caused him troubles when dealing with many who \\"believed in everything except the cold light of reason\\".\\"... che in tutto credevano salvo nella fredda luce della ragione.\\", as precisely stated by .  Work  =Research activity= He is the author of more than 50 research works, the first of which was published when Martinelli still was an undergraduate student:According to . precisely, his research production consist of 47 papers and 30 between treatises, textbooks and various other publications.For a complete list of his works, classified between research notes and memoirs or treatises, textbooks and various writings, see the paper : a strictly shorter, chronologically ordered list appears also in the paper . According to , his research personality can be described by two words: \\"enthusiasm\\" and \\"dissatisfaction\\":Precisely, states the words \\"entusiasmo\\" e \\"insoddisfazione\\". enthusiasm is meant as his steady interest in mathematics at all levels, while dissatisfaction is meant as the desire to going deeper into all mathematical problems investigated, without stopping at first success and expressing all the results in a simple, elegant and essential form. =Teaching activity= The aspects of his personality described before and his deep professional commitment also made him a great teacher:See references and . at least fifteen textbooks on geometry, topology, complex analysis testify his didactic activity. Those books appear as models of clarity and mathematical rigour, particularly praises this way the various geometry lecture notes redacted by Martinelli himself. and also offer insights on more complex theories and problems to the clever student: indeed, it was one of Martinelli's concerns to teach mathematics showing its lively development and its attractiveness in term of interesting difficult problems offered, in order that no gifted student would abandon the idea to do mathematical research.

Early life Osborne was the son of an Irish farmer. He had an elementary education in County Tyrone and inherited his father's property. In 1829, on the advice of two brothers who had already emigrated to New South Wales, he liquidated his assets for ¬£3000 and invested in a consignment of Irish linen which he exported to Sydney. From the proceeds of the linen he acquired a land grant of 2,560 acres and established a dairy farm at Marshall Mount near Dapto. By 1850, Osborne had acquired further substantial property in the Illawarra and Murrumbidgee districts and had also developed coal mines at Mount Keira and Maitland. Colonial Parliament In 1851, prior to the establishment of responsible government, Osborne was elected to the semi-elected Legislative Council. He represented the electorate of East Camden until the granting of self-government in 1856. Subsequently, at the first election under the new constitution he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as one of the two members for the same seat. He was subsequently defeated at the 1858 election and then retired from public life. He did not hold a parliamentary or ministerial position. His brother Alick was an elected member of the Legislative Council from 1851 to 1855. while his sons Patrick, and James, were also members of the Legislative Assembly.

He was an undergraduate (BA 1961), graduate student (DPhil, 1964), and lecturer at Merton College, Oxfordhttp://diversity.psy.ox.ac.uk/research-team/ceri-peach/ Retrieved 1 January 2011 before being appointed to a lectureship in geography at St Catherine's College, Oxford (known colloquially as St Catz) in 1965 at the age of 26.St. Catherine's College: The Ceri Peach Trust Fund, St Catherine‚Äôs College Development Office, 2007 He held this post jointly with a lectureship at Keble College, Oxford and a Faculty Lectureship at the University of Oxford.St Catherine's College Year, 2007; St Catherine's College Development Office, 2007 He was elected as a tutorial fellow (teaching fellow) in geography at St Catherine's in 1969 and also held various non-teaching posts, including several college offices: Domestic Bursar, Senior Tutor, Finance Bursar and Acting Master. During his tenure as Senior Tutor, women were first admitted to the college. As Domestic Bursar, he negotiated college charges with the then Junior Common Room President, Peter Mandelson. He was Professor of Social geography at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford from 1992 to 2007 and on retirement from his Oxford chair he was appointed Professor of at the Institute for Social Change at the University of Manchester. Time at St Catherine's College Peach found the move from Merton, Oxford's oldest college, to St Catherine's (known as St Catz), Oxfords newest college, to be liberating: During his time at St Catherine's the number of undergraduate geographers accepted by the college increased from 4 each year to between 10 and 12. The University Schools results also became some of the best in the arts subjects at the college. Notable students taught by Ceri Peach include Denis Cosgrove, who went on to become Alexander von Humboldt Professor of Geography at University of California, Los Angeles; Mike Walker and Geoff Duller, who went on to become professors of geography at the University of Wales; Mike Summerfield, Professor of Physical Geography at the University of Edinburgh; Vaughan Robinson, professor at King's College London; Michael Keith, professor of sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London; Gary Bridge, professor at Cardiff University, Chris Keylock, professor of fluid mechanics at Loughborough University, and Dr Margaret Byron, teaching fellow at the University of Leicester. St Catherine's College, Oxford Other graduates in geography taught by Peach at St Catherine's have achieved success in other fields and include Matthew Pinsent, who received four gold medals for rowing in successive Olympic Games. Field of research Peach's main field of research is human migration and the racial segregation of minority groups, ethnic groups and religious groups in the United Kingdom, the United States and Western Europe. During his sabbatical at the Demography Department of Australian National University, in 1973, his understanding of the relationship between spatial patterns of residential segregation was transformed. This led him to investigate ethnic intermarriage as an index of social interaction. During his next sabbatical at Yale University, in 1977, he disproved the 'triple melting pot theory' of American cultural assimilation which, based on data collection in New Haven, Connecticut, argued that while national ethnic identity in the United States would dissolve, it would do so within maintained religious boundaries of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. His research proved that while the so-called 'Protestant pot' seemed plausible, a 'Catholic-pot' seemed unlikely: His research in the 1970s and 1980s focused on housing tenure and segregation in the United Kingdom and the United States and during this time he worked closely with Dr Samir Shah and later with Dr Margaret Byron. In the 1990s and 2000s Peach continued his research on issues of segregation with particular focus on the dynamics relating to, and the arguments surrounding, Ghetto formation and White flight. This included differences between British and American cities and whether British cities had become more segregated than Chicago. He also examined the growth of the Muslim population in Europe, and particularly in Britain, and this has developed into a large scale study of the cultural geography of Muslim mosques, Sikh Gurdwaras and Hindu Mandirs on the landscape of Britain. His Economic and Social Research Council funded project on ethno-religio-linguistic sub-communities links his database on Muslim, Hindu and Sikh places of worship in the United Kingdom, completed as a millennium project, and funded by the Leverhulme Trust, with the United Kingdom Census 2001 data on ethnicity and religion. The Leverhulme survey photographed and collected data on religion, tradition, movements, vernacular language, date of foundation and other variables on nearly 1,000 buildings. Peach is a member of the Advisory Board of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies.http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/cpeach.html Retrieved 1 January 2011 Retirement On 22 September 2007 Ceri Peach retired from St Catherine‚Äôs College and became an emeritus fellow at the College. a series of talks were given by former pupils and colleagues at the Oxford University Centre for the Environment on 22 September followed by a reception and speeches by professors Ron J. Johnston and Gary Bridge. St Catherine's has created the Ceri Peach Trust Fund to honour the 40 years' contribution Peach has made to the study of geography, and to ensure that geography continues to flourish at the college. Recalling his time at the college Peach remarked: Subsequent career In 2008, the BBC reported that, along with Ludi Simpson and Danny Dorling, Peach is considered to be one of the top three British thinkers in the field of racial segregation.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5304276.stm Retrieved 3 February 2017 In the same year, he was nominated as \\"Ethnic Geography Distinguished Scholar of 2008\\" by the Association of American Geographers at their April meeting in Boston. In 2016, Peach was awarded a Doctorate of Letters by the University of Oxford, which is one of the highest academic honors that the University may confer. It was given in recognition of contribution he has made to academia throughout his career, particularly to his main field of research in human migration and the racial segregation of minority groups, ethnic groups and religious groups in the United Kingdom, United States and Western Europe.Catz Eye, the St. Catherine's College newsletter, Michaelmas 2016 Publications Selected publications include:http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/cpeach.html Retrieved 3 February 2017 *Urban Social Segregation (1975)() *The Caribbean in Europe, contrasting patterns of migration and settlement in Britain, France and the Netherlands (1991) () *West Indian Migrations to Britain: A Social Geography.

Location  The Treffauer seen from the Tuxeck The Treffauer rises south of the main ridge and is therefore the most striking mountain in the Wilder Kaiser. Somewhat separated to the north of the Treffauer the long main ridge runs from west to east between the Scheffauer, Sonneck and Zentralkaiser around the Ellmauer Halt. In front of it to the south is the Tuxeck ().  Routes  Amongst mountaineers the Treffauer is considered an arduous, but nevertheless worthwhile and not especially difficult tour. However, Alpine experience, good fitness, dry conditions, sure-footedness and a head for heights are necessary. The designated normal route to the Treffauer begins in Scheffau and runs via the J√§gerwirt, the Alpine meadow of the Kaiser Hochalm, the Snow Cirque (Schneekar) and the shaded western flank taking around 4 hours to reach the summit cross. This route is the easiest by far and, unlike the neighbouring Ellmauer Halt, less challenging. Popular, but not to be underestimated is the crossing to the Tuxeck with its succeeding descent to the Grutten Hut. This requires difficult and unsecured climbing sections of up to UIAA grade III to be overcome; in addition there is a high risk of rock falls in the confusing terrain.

The attack was the deadliest act of violence against Egypt's Coptic Christians in a decade, since the Kosheh massacre in 2000 left 20 Copts dead. The target of the bombing was the Saints Church, a Coptic church located across the street from the Masjid Sharq El-Madina mosque. Background Copts in Egypt complain of increasing persecution, from attacks by Muslim extremists and what they see as official discrimination by the state. Copts celebrate Christmas on 7 January. This was the second consecutive Christmas with violence. On Christmas Eve in 2010, a Muslim gunman fired on worshipers leaving a church in Upper Egypt, killing 7 people. In the months prior to the incident, the religious ambiance in Egypt had been clouded by anti-Church sentiment, in particular regarding the public allegation made by Mohammad Salim Al-Awa that the Coptic Orthodox Church was storing weapons in churches and monasteries. In November, a group calling itself Al-Qaeda in Iraq announced that all Christians in the Middle East would be \\"legitimate targets.\\" The Alexandria bombing occurred almost two months to the day after the attack on Our Lady of Salvation church in central Baghdad in what militants called a response to the mistreatment of Muslim converts by Egyptian Copts. Al-Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate claimed responsibility for that attack and made new threats against Christians. The group threatened to attack Egyptian Copts if their church did not free two Christians, it said had been \\"imprisoned in their monasteries\\" for having converted to Islam. The two women were Camilia Chehata and Wafa Constantine, the wives of Coptic priests whose claimed conversion caused a stir in Egypt. Two weeks before the bombing an Islamist website called for attacks on a list of Egypt's churches, and included the church that was hit.\\"Suspected suicide bomber kills 21 in attack on Egyptian church\\". By Bill Roggio. 1 January 2011  Bombing  An explosive device detonated in front of the Coptic Orthodox church of Saint Mark and Pope Peter in the Sidi Bishr neighbourhood in Alexandria. Initial reports stated that it was a car explosion, however an Interior Ministry statement later declared that it was a suicide attack, through the Egyptian official news agency. At the time of the blast, several thousand Coptic Christians were attending midnight prayer service at the church at the occasion of the new year. The explosion resulted in scattered body parts, destroyed cars and smashed windows. 21 Coptic Christians were killed immediately following the explosion, or soon after, and about 97 people ‚Äì most of them Christians ‚Äì were injured. The remains were covered with newspapers until they were brought inside the church. Two more Copts died in the hospital over the few days following the attack, raising the total number to 23, all of whom were Coptic Christians. According to one eyewitness report, the first victim was a Muslim salesperson who sold Quran books across the street from the Saints Church. Forensic testing confirmed that the explosive device used was homemade and contained nails and ball-bearings. The Interior Ministry stated that the bomb was filled with small pieces of metal to serve as shrapnel, and that a foreign-backed suicide bomber may have been responsible. Responsibility Egypt's former Interior minister Habib Ibrahim El Adly said on 23 January that evidence proved that the Gaza-based Army of Islam planned and executed the attack. The group, which has received sanctuary from Hamas and earlier collaborated in the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit, quickly denied the charge, while also reportedly expressing support for the bombing. In July 2011 however, nobody had yet been brought to trial and the Coptic Church threatened to sue the Interior Ministry. On the other hand, various reports claim that Habib Ibrahim El Adly himself was involved in the bombings. Reactions =Coptic community in Egypt= Copts were deeply aggrieved by this attack, many believing that the Egyptian state security's failure to deal firmly with past attacks on Christians in Egypt contributed to this attack, while others went as far as to directly blame the State Security for the bombings. One member of the Coptic community declared, \\"The government is the reason this happened. They are the terrorists who attack us every day.\\" Following the bombing, several thousand Copts took to the streets in protest. Furious Christians clashed with Egyptian police and Egyptian security forces.\\"Deadly church blast sparks Christian rage in Egypt\\". Euronews, 1 January 2011 Christians and Muslims pelted each other with rocks, and cars were torched. After these overnight protests, more than 100 Christians protested the following morning near the church that was attacked, chanting \\"We sacrifice our souls and blood for the Holy Cross\\" and \\"O Mubarak, the heart of the Copts is on fire\\". The Egyptian police reacted by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the Christians. In Cairo, about 4,000 Christians and Muslims demonstrated against terrorism in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Shubra. (in Arabic) The demonstration lasted for six hours and was joined by both government and opposition members of the Egyptian parliament and a number of political figures, including a former minister and Tomorrow Party founder Ayman Nour. In the same neighborhood of Shubra, thousands of Coptic Christians clashed with riot police for three consecutive days, resulting in injuries to both Coptic civilians and riot police soldiers. Thousands of Copts demonstrated at the Monastery of Saint Simon the Tanner in Cairo. The demonstrators called for the resignation of the Egyptian government. They chanted, \\"With our souls and blood we redeem our Cross\\". They then clashed with the Egyptian security forces, resulting in injuries to 12 of the Coptic demonstrators. In addition, thousands of Coptic Christians demonstrated outside the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs and the state television buildings for two consecutive days. Pope Shenouda III strongly condemned the \\"criminal assault\\", blaming it on \\"forces that wish no good for Egypt\\". The Pope also called upon the government to \\"speedily arrest and prosecute the perpetrator of this criminal act.\\" His personal secretary said the incident had \\"severely grieved us, because it is very alien to the love and harmony in which the nation lives\\". The top cleric in Alexandria, the Patriarchal Vicar Hegumen Ruweis Marcos, said that the Egyptian government and security forces wanted to blame the bombing on a suicide bomber instead of a car bomb in order to write off the crime as something carried out by a lone attacker. He also denounced the lack of protection in front of the church, stating he was surprised to find only three soldiers and one officer guarding the church at such a sensitive time in spite of the recent numerous threats against Copts. The Synod of priests in Alexandria unanimously criticized the lax attitude of the Egyptian authorities towards the public expression of hatred against Coptic Christians. In a statement issued by the Synod, the priests said that the attack on the church was \\"the result of anti-Christian mobilization and the lies recently propagated against the Coptic Orthodox Church.\\" On the Sunday following the bombings, Coptic parishioners at the bombed church of Saint Mark and Pope Peter expressed anger, and protested discrimination that Christians in Egypt are facing. One of the parishioners declared \\"in this country, we cannot even pray in churches.\\" Another blamed the anti-Coptic sentiments spread by the Islamic mosques. The priest of the church blamed \\"Islamic fanaticism\\" and \\"Islamic extremism\\". He called upon the Egyptian government to ensure the rights of the Christians in \\"life, prayer and work\\". Officials of the Coptic Orthodox Church announced that prayers for Eastern Christmas would still be held, but that celebrations would be canceled. = Coptic community in the diaspora = Memorial services were held in Coptic churches across Europe in memory of the victims of the bombing. The Coptic Orthodox Church in Britain issued an official statement condemning the massacre, and expressing concern that incidents of violence and terror against Christians in Egypt were increasingly spiraling out of control. The statement also criticized the fact that crimes against the Copts in Egypt were going unchecked and unresolved, and their perpetrators were not brought to justice. In Montreal, Quebec, Canada, all five Coptic churches in the city decided to proceed under tightened security with the Eastern Christmas Eve mass on the eve of Eastern Christmas but decided not to hold any celebrations. The celebrations were canceled in honor of the victims of the Alexandria massacre, and money that was to be spent on the celebrations was sent to the families of the victims in Alexandria. About 4,000 Coptics and some Muslim supporters marched on 19 January in central Sydney, calling on Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd to address the issue of persecution of Copts in Egypt. = Domestic = The Egyptian government issued a statement immediately following the bombing blaming \\"foreign elements\\" for the planning and execution of the bombing. President Hosni Mubarak promised in a televised address that terrorists would not destabilize Egypt or divide Christians and Muslims. He said the attack \\"carries evidence of the involvement of foreign fingers\\" and vowed to pursue the perpetrators. Many doubt that the perpetrators will be pursued, citing the Mubarak regime's preference for handling violence against the country's Christian minority through a reconciliation process between the perpetrators and the victims, rather than prosecution of the perpetrators. The governor of Alexandria, Adel Labib, accused Al Qaida of planning the bombing, without giving any further details. Many Egyptians expressed their disappointment regarding the government's claims that Al Qaida and foreign elements were behind the massacre, seeing those claims as a way for the government to evade the issue of growing sectarian divisions in the country. In a message to Pope Shenouda III, Patriarch Theodore II of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria strongly condemned the \\"brutal criminal attack\\" against a church \\"where prayers were being recited for the peace of Egypt, for the peace of those in power, and for the peace of the world.\\" Patriarch Theodore II also described the victims as \\"Martyrs of the Church\\". Refaa al-Tahtawi, spokesman for Al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's main institution based in Cairo, appeared on television to denounce the attack, which he said targeted \\"Egyptian national unity\\". He also appealed to Christians and Muslims for calm. The attack was also condemned by the Muslim Brotherhood, who also called upon Muslims to protect Christian churches. On the eve of the Coptic Christmas on 6 January 2011, Egyptian Muslims showed up at churches during mass service offering to serve as a \\"human shield\\" against any possible further attacks. Both government and independent newspapers warned that civil war could break out in Egypt unless Muslims and Christians close ranks. Newspapers also urged the Egyptian government to focus on the situation of the Copts, who often complain of discrimination. Interior minister Habib al-Adly said on 23 January that evidence proved that the Gaza-based Army of Islam planned and executed the attack. The group quickly denied responsibility, while also reportedly expressing support for the bombing. In an interview that aired on Al-Fareen TV (Egypt) on 3 January 2011 (as translated by MEMRI), Former Egyptian Deputy Minister Abdallah Al-Ash'al stated that: > Today, many young people in Egypt are unhappy. They flee the country and > prefer to die on the shores of the Mediterranean, because they have no job > opportunities here...The Mossad has exploited this. The people who carried > out this attack are Egyptians, but the Mossad exploited them...Are these > nothing but theories? No. When Israeli military intelligence chief Amos > Yadlin submitted a report about the past four and a half years, he stated > clearly that Israel was exploiting the peace treaty in order to infiltrate > Egypt.Egyptian Intellectuals Accuse the Israeli Mossad for the Alexandria > Church Bombing, MEMRI TV, Clip No. 2747, 2‚Äì3 January 2011. Egypt's general prosecutor opened probe on former Interior Minister Habib el- Adly's reported role in the New Year's Eve bombing. = International community = * In the days following the attack, Pope Shenouda III met with the ambassadors of the US, the UK and Bosnia and Herzegovina, who expressed the condolences of their respective countries to the Pope and to the Coptic Church. * Pope Benedict XVI of the Roman Catholic Church denounced the attacks in his New Year address.

Such bloody acts, resulting in the death and suffering of innocent people and provoking interconfessional strife are unjustifiable\\" * On the same day, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sent his condolences to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak saying: \\"It was with a deep sorrow that I learned about the criminal blast near the Christian church in the city of Alexandria on the night of 1 January 2011. Please convey my sincere condolences to the relatives of the victims and my wishes for a fastest recovery to the injured.

A spokesman of the Movement of the Future condemned the massacre as a delegation from the movement visited the Coptic church in Beirut to offer their condolences to members of the Coptic community. Maronite Archbishop of Byblos, Bchara al-Raii, condemned the massacre, and called for a Muslim summit to condemn attacks carried out by radical movements against Christians under the guise of Islam. He also urged the Egyptian government to protect Christians and ensure equal treatment for them. Separate condemnations came from the Sunni Mufti of the Republic Mohammad Qabbani and Deputy Head of the Shiite Supreme Council Abdul Amir Qabalan. * In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his \\"great shock\\" and reaffirmed his conviction of \\"the need for a common front by all countries that believe in freedom in the face of terrorism.\\" * In Syria, an official source spoke against \\"such terrorist crimes\\" and expressed \\"condolences to Egypt and the families of the innocent victims\\".

No! No!\\" as bishop Youanis attempted to thank Mubarak for his condolences and his statement regarding the bombing. In addition to Bishop Youanis, Pope Shenouda III delegated Metropolitan Bakhomios to preside over the funeral of those killed in Alexandria. Further threats In Europe, Coptic churches have been threatened with further attacks. Coptic bishops and priests in France and Germany filed complaints and called for governmental protection. In the UK, officials reported that threats were outlined against two Coptic churches in the country. In Canada, Coptic churches were on high alert following threats by Al Qaida against Copts in Canada. All five Coptic churches in Montreal decided to proceed under tightened security with the Eastern Christmas Eve mass on the eve of Eastern Christmas. Following Coptic Christmas, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper met with Coptic Christian leaders to condemn the Alexandria massacre and to confirm that Canada stands behind the right of the Copts to safely practice their faith. He also declared that the international community must stay vigilant against such violence against Coptic Christians. The bombing also raised fears that jihadists would increase violence against Christians worldwide. Radical Islamic hostility to the Copts has been an ongoing problem. A \\"death list\\" of the names and personal information of more than a hundred Copts, many of whom live in Egypt, Europe and North America, was published in 2010 on an Al Qaida-affiliated website. The website called for the murder of all those whose names appear on the list, accusing them of defaming Islam and converting Muslims to Christianity.

Vocalista de Rata Blanca felicit√≥ a su imitador de \\"Yo Soy\\", El Comercio(26 Jan 2012). Adri√°n Barilari , El Diario (Argentina) He also has his own solo band. Biography Barilari was involved with music from an early age as his uncle was executor of bandoneon and tango singer, and taught him to sing when he was 4 or 5 years old. Soon his mother began taking him to television show to sing in front of cameras, at only 7 or 8 years old. At 13 he began composing his first songs and his mother inspired him to study the accordion, but he ended up learning to play the guitar. His first bands were named Topos Urbanos, Cobalto, Vietnam, and Dias de Gloria. Career =Rata Blanca (1989 - 1993)= It was then that the singer Sa√∫l Blanch left Rata Blanca, and the group began searching for new singer. Although Barilari intended to continue in Dias de Gloria, his own colleagues urged him to bring it into the band. After his admission to the impressive success achieved Magos, espadas y rosas (Wizards, Swords and Roses), and was even present at the stadium of Velez Sarsfield as a major group. However, success began to wane after Guerrero del Arcoiris (Rainbow Warrior), as well as relations among the members. Still out on tour and in 1992 edited En Vivo en Buenos Aires (with Bach Soloists Chamber Orchestra), it would not be released until 1996. Finally, with the release of mini album El Libro Oculto (Book of the Occult), and to the wishes of Walter Giardino to bring the band to a heavier style, Adrian left the band to not agree with the new direction set by the guitarist. =Alianza (1994 - 2000)= With the keyboardist Hugo Bistolfi, who also left Rata Blanca, form Alianza, with many musicians sessions, which were the only members permanently was Barilari and Bistolfi. The duo explore ballads sound with more keyboard presence than Rata Blanca. Alianza did not have much impact in Argentina, but in other Latin American countries. They edited three albums Sue√±os del Mundo (1994), Alianza (1997), and Huellas (1999). =Rata Blanca (2000 - Present)= On September 2, 2000 announced in Bolivia to build again soon called Rata Blanca and her partner in Alianza for holding back the band on keyboards. Left for a Latin American tour and closed on 19 December at the Teatro Coliseo. Days later, Alianza presented in Acatraz. Rata Blanca already back to life, edited Grandes Canciones, a compilation with some of the most classical of the group, including an acoustic version of \\"Mujer Amante\\" with the current formation. Subsequently, released El Camino del Fuego who was the sequel to Temple, but with the new formation of Rata Blanca. Also released two singles from the latter, the first was titled Highway on fire with the songs \\"Master of the Highway\\", \\"Back Home\\", \\"Fire dance (a instrumental of Temple). In 2003 edited \\"Poder Vivo\\". In 2005 he edited La llave de la puerta secreta a disc inspired by the book The Da Vinci Code and in 2008 released his latest album El Reino Olvidado always remained in force in the scene in Argentina. El Reino Olvidado was also edited in English as The Forgotten Kingdom but Barilari refuse to record this version, finally Doogie White (Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force) record the album. =Barilari (2001 - Present)= Besides his work in Rata Blanca, Adri√°n Barilari begin a solo career as a side project, he recorded an EP with four tracks ahead of the main cd \\"Barilari\\". \\" Barilari, and released as an album, with the participation of distinguished musicians from Stratovarius, Jens Johansson on keyboards, who also contributed string arrangements, guitars Emppu Vuorinen, Jukka Nevalainen on drums and Sami V√§nsk√§ on bass (all except the last, Members of Nightwish, V√§nsk√§ and is not). In guitars, in addition, the Argentine Daniel Telis and Gonzalo Ledesma. The album was recorded in Finland, Sweden, Germany and Argentina and has a string section recorded in Germany. The compositions are borne by Adrian Gonzalo Ledesma and Daniel Telis, Jens Johansson and Emppu Vuorinen. It highlights the cover of the classic Rainbow, \\"Stargazer\\", in a brilliant adaptation to Castilian. The album was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila in the legendary Finnvox Studios in Finland where today produces much of the heavy rock worldwide. Then released a live DVD, and recently edited covers CD called Canciones Doradas. In 2009 Adrian brings to light the third disc Abuso de Poder, this is a very powerful and dark album, this album was released via internet by page dontpaymusic.com in early June, the first cut is the song that gives title track. Influence and Technique One could mention as his main influences include Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan although some style Barilari treated with singers more cutting power and lyrical as Michael Kiske, Tobias Sammet and Bruce Dickinson. Likewise, in his 20-year career he has also been the inspiration for many artists who today belong to outstanding Hispanic bands. Until the time of admission to Rata Blanca in the late '80s, had not appeared on the scene arguably Argentina and throughout Latin America also a vocalist of heavy metal and hard rock with the technical quality and influence classic hit which he learned in those years, so it may be cited as the spearhead of the genre. Holder of a record and a unique flow and an ability to reach very high tones with complete ease and pitch and also able to interpret from an epic theme to a ballad or rocker has kept intact his voice to today as also his popularity.

Archie MacLaren said of him, \\"Compared to Victor I was a cab-horse to a Derby winner\\". Trumper was also a key figure in the foundation of rugby league in Australia. He was the first cricketer to score 7 and 8 centuries in Test match cricket. Life and career =Early Life= Trumper was probably born in Sydney;Bede Nairn, 'Trumper, Victor Thomas (1877‚Äì1915)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 12, MUP, 1990, pp. 269‚Äì272. retrieved 13 January 2010 no definite record of his birth exists. Trumper's parents are believed to be Charles Thomas Trumper and his wife Louisa Alice \\"Louie\\", n√©e Coghlan.Ancestry.com.au Stanford Family Tree by Thomas H Stanford Trumper was educated at Crown Street Superior Public School and showed early ability as a batsman. When only 17 years old Trumper made 67 runs for a team of promising juniors against Andrew Stoddart's touring English team at Sydney Cricket Ground. =Early First Class Cricket= In 1894/95 he played for New South Wales against South Australia but made only 11 and 0 runs in his two innings. At his next attempt he also failed with the bat and was left out of representative cricket for two years. He resumed first class cricket in 1897-98, making 192 runs at an average of 16.5 with a top score of 68. Trumper's breakthrough season was in 1898-99, when he made 873 runs at 62.35 with a top score of 292 not out. =1899 Ashes= M. A. Noble, always a good judge, was confident about young Vic's ability, but it was only after some controversy that Trumper was made a last minute selection for the 1899 Australian team to England. He soon showed his ability, scoring 135 not out against England at Lord's Cricket Ground and 300 not out against Sussex. After the Lord's innings in June 1899, the great English batsman W. G. Grace approached the Australian dressing room and presented Trumper with his own bat, declaring, \\"From the present champion to the future champion.\\" That bat now belongs to the Australian Museum collection in Canberra. In Trumper's test debut, he scored 0 and 11. In the second test, his innings of 135 was crucial in helping set up an Australian victory. In the third test, Trumper scored 12 and 32. In the 4th he made 14 and 63, the latter helping stave off an Australian defeat. In the fifth test, Trumper scored 6 and 7. Trumper made 1,556 runs that tour at 34.57. =1899-1900 Season= Trumper maintained his good form over the 1899-1900 Australian season, scoring 721 first class runs at 72.1 with a top score of 208. =1900-01 Season= The following summer Trumper made 458 runs at 65.42 with a top score of 230. =1901-02 Ashes= In the 1901-02 Ashes, Trumper played all five tests. In the first he made 2 and 34, in a game Australia lost by an innings. In the second he scored 0 and 16. In the third he made 65 and 25. In the fourth he made 7 and 25. In the fifth he scored 27 and 18. He made only 486 first class runs that summer at 27 with a top score of 73. =1902 Ashes= Trumper's most remarkable Test season was played in England in 1902. It was one of the wettest summers on record, yet Trumper in 53 innings scored 2,570 runs, and without a single not out had an average of 48.49. Harry Altham wrote: \\"From start to finish of the season, on every sort of wicket, against every sort of bowling, Trumper entranced the eye, inspired his side, demoralized his enemies, and made run-getting appear the easiest thing in the world.\\"Quoted in The Cricket Captains of England, Alan Gibson, 1989, The Pavilion Library, , p. 76. C. B. Fry added, \\"He had no style, and yet he was all style. He had no fixed canonical method of play, he defied all orthodox rules, yet every stroke he played satisfied the ultimate criterion of style ‚Äì the minimum of effort, the maximum of effect.\\" \\"No one,\\" wrote Plum Warner, \\"ever played so naturally. Batting seemed just part of himself, and he was as modest as he was magnificent.\\" Trumper was modest, retiring and generous. A teetotaller and non-smoker, his general conduct was an example to his fellow players, and he was a great favourite with the public both in England and Australia. Monty Noble had no hesitation in calling him the world's greatest batsman, a genius without compare. He scored 18 and 14 in the first test and did not bat in the second test. In the third test he made 1 and 62. In the fourth test, in arguably his greatest innings, he became the first player to achieve the very rare feat of making a century on the first morning of a Test match, scoring 103 before lunch against England at Old Trafford. He only scored 4 in the second innings. In the final test, narrowly won by England, he scored 42 and 2. He made 2,570 first class runs at 48.49 with 11 centuries and a top score of 128. =1902 vs South Africa= Australia stopped off in South Africa on the way home to play three tests against South Africa. Trumper made 63 and 37, 18 and 13 and 70 and 38 not out. He scored 307 first class runs at 43.85. =1902-03 Summer= That summer, Trumper played 5 first class games at home, scoring 446 runs at 49.55 with a top score of 178. =1903-04 Ashes= Trumper played all five tests during the 1903-04 Ashes. In the first test he scored 1 in the first innings but 185 in the second. In the second he made 74 and 35, Australia's top score in both innings. His good form continued in the third test where he made 113 and 59. In the fourth test he scored 7 and 12, and made 88 and 0 in the last game. \\"Jumping out for a straight drive\\", George Beldam, c. 1905 ‚Äì arguably the most famous photograph in the history of cricket\\"Cricket‚Äôs Victor Trumper master of his field, just like Gideon Haigh\\" by Catherine McGregor, The Australian, 5 November 2016 He made 990 first class runs that summer at 55, with a top score of 185. In August 1904, Trumper, with Hanson Carter, opened a sports store in Market Street, Sydney. =1904-05= The following summer Trumper only played two first class games in Australia making 198 runs at 49.5. He also played four first class games in New Zealand, making 436 runs at 109 with a top score of 172. =1905 Ashes= Trumper made 13 retired hurt, 31, 8 and 0, 11 and 30 and 4 and 28. He made 1,597 first class runs on the tour in England, at 36.29, with two centuries. =1905-06 Summer= At home, Trumper made 250 first class runs at 41.66 with one century. The following summer he made 23 runs at 7.66 only playing two games. =Rugby League= Although he is best known for his prowess as a cricketer, Trumper was also a competent rugby player and can lay claim to being the prime mover in the development of rugby league in Australia. He hosted meetings at his store during 1907 as discontent amongst players with the game's administration grew louder. On 8 August 1907 at Bateman's Crystal Hotel, George Street, Sydney independent politician Henry Hoyle chaired a meeting of fifty, comprising several leading rugby players and officials. The New South Wales Rugby Football League, the body that would go on to conduct the major national rugby league premiership of Australia, was founded and Trumper was elected its first treasurer. =1907-08 Ashes= During the 1907-08 Ashes, Trumper made 43 and 3, 49 and 63, 4 and 0, 0 and 0 and 10 and 166. He scored 797 first class runs that summer at 41.94. Trumper's health during this period declined to the point where he missed the 1908/09 season due to illness. At the beginning of the 1909 NSWRFL season the League, which was almost broke, had met and kicked out its founders, Trumper, Hoyle and J J Giltinan. =1909 Ashes= In the 1909 Ashes, Trumper scored 10 and 1 in the first test, 28 in the second, 27 and 2 in the third, 2 and 48 in the fourth and 73 and 20 for the fifth. Trumper scored 1,424 first class runs on tour at 34.73 with a top score of 150. =1909-10 Summer= Trumper ony played one first class game in the 1909-10 Australian summer, scoring 105. =1910-11 vs South Africa= In the first test Trumper made 27. In the second he made 34 and 159. In the third test he scored 214 (then a record for an Australian test innings ) and 28. In the 4th he made 7 and 87 and in the fifth he scored 31 and 74. He made 1,246 first class runs that summer at 69.22. =1911-12 Ashes and \\"Big Six\\" Dispute= In the first test Trumper scored 113 and 14. His scores for the rest of the series were 13 and 2, 26 and 1, 17 and 28, and 5 and 50. Trumper was part of the Big Six cricket dispute of 1912 which meant he boycott the 1912 tour to England. In 1912 Trumper opened \\"Victor Trumper and Dodge Ltd.\\", a sports and mercery store in George Street, Sydney. Some notable highlights of Trumper's career include scoring 292 against Tasmania, including a century before lunch (1908); scoring 100 in 58 minutes against Victoria (1906); 201 against South Australia (1913). His innings of 293 for an Australian XI against Canterbury (1914), scored in a little over three hours, was made in partnership with Arthur Sims (184 not out), and their stand of 433 still remains the record for the eighth wicket in first-class cricket, and Trumper's innings remains the highest score by a number nine batsman. His last 68 first-class innings, from 1910 to 1914, gave him an average of 60. His ability as a batsman, however, cannot be valued by averages or the number of runs scored. His mastership was shown on bad wickets, for when other batsmen were struggling merely to keep their wickets intact, he was still able to time the ball and execute strokes all round the wicket. =1911-12 Summer= In 1911-12 Trumper made 583 first class runs at 34.29. =1912-13 Season= In 1912-13 Trumper scored 843 runs at 84.3 including a top score of 201. In February 1913 a match was played for his benefit between New South Wales and the rest of Australia which, with subscriptions, yielded nearly ¬£3000. =1913-14 Season - Tour of New Zealand= In Trumper's last season in Australia he made 107 first class runs at 21.40 with a top score of 32. However he also toured New Zealand, making 628 runs at 69.77 with a top score of 293. =Death= Trumper's health declined rapidly in 1914 and he died as a result of Bright's disease in Darlinghurst, Sydney, on 28 June 1915, aged 37. Trumper was buried in Waverley Cemetery after the largest funeral procession ever seen in Sydney (with 250,000 mourners lining the route) and was survived by his wife Sarah, his son Victor and daughter Nancy. Trumper's son, Victor Trumper Jr (1913‚Äì1981), played seven first-class games for New South Wales in 1940‚Äì41; he was also the uncle of Admiral Sir Victor Smith (1913‚Äì1998), the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of admiral. Victor Thomas' maternal ancestry was of the Coughlin family which also included NSW's first female statistician and Australia's Northern Territory's Chief Minister Clare Martin. The family was originally from County Offaly, Ireland until the Cromwell invasion then left County Cork in the 1850s just after the Great Famine. Recognition Victor Trumper's career performance graph. Trumper was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1903. He was awarded Life Membership of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1914. In the 1963 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Trumper was selected by Neville Cardus as one of the Six Giants of the Wisden Century.Six Giants of the Wisden Century Neville Cardus, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1963. Retrieved on 8 November 2008. This was a special commemorative selection requested by Wisden for its 100th edition. The other five players chosen were Sydney Barnes, Don Bradman, W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs and Tom Richardson. In 1981 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post depicting a cartoon image by Tony Rafty.AustralianStamp.com In 1996 he was made one of the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, the others being Fred Spofforth, John Blackham, Clarrie Grimmett, Bill Ponsford, Sir Donald Bradman, Bill O'Reilly, Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, and Dennis Lillee. The Sydney Cricket Ground Trust announced on 12 June 2008 that the new grandstand on the old hill at the SCG was to be named in Trumper's honour. On 2 November 2008 the SCG Trust hosted the first 'Victor Trumper Day', a sporting and cultural retrospective organised by Sydney school teacher David Strange to honour the life of Trumper on the 131st anniversary of his birth. Former internationals and celebrities including Greg Matthews, Stuart MacGill, Greg Page, Mick Molloy and Tim Farriss wore slatted pads, sausage gloves and 1907 skull caps to recreate the Golden Age of cricket and raise money for charity in Trumper's name. On 30 September 2009, Victor Trumper was one of five new members announced as part of the growing class of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. On 4 January 2010, he was formally inducted into the Hall of Fame. Trumper Park Oval in Paddington, New South Wales is named in his honour, as is the Trumper Pavilion at Chatswood Oval.

The Thunder Agents Companion\\"Thunder Agents Index\\" Born in Brooklyn, Brown began working in the Product Development Department of Topps Chewing Gum shortly after he graduated from high school. As a creative editor, working with department head Woody Gelman, Brown developed ideas for both sports and non-sports cards, a position which put him in contact with leading comic book artists, who illustrated Topps humor cards. During his 41 years at Topps, Brown contributed to such series as Civil War News, Garbage Pail Kids and Wacky Packages. Mars Attacks In 1962, inspired by Wally Wood's cover for EC Comics' Weird Science #16, Brown pitched the idea of Mars Attacks to Gelman. Gelman and Brown devised the storyline of a Martian invasion. They recruited Wood to visualize situations in rough sketches and hired Bob Powell to pencil the project. Norman Saunders painted the 55-card set, later adapted into the 1996 feature film.Stewart, Bhob, editor. Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood. TwoMorrows, 2003. T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents To launch the bimonthly comic book, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents (Tower Comics) in 1965, Wally Wood and Brown discussed a superhero concept Brown had outlined to Wood a year earlier. Brown recalled, \\"Wally had remembered my concept and asked me to write a 12-page origin story. I submitted a Captain Thunderbolt story in which he fought a villain named Dynamo.\\" To write the story, Brown drew on his memories of both Captain Marvel and the Thunder Riders in the 1935 serial The Phantom Empire, as he recalled, \\"I had always loved the old Phantom Empire serial with Gene Autry in the 1930s. I remembered that the Thunder Riders were the agents of the evil queen in the serial. I always loved the name, the Thunder Riders, so I recommended Thunder Agents to Wally.\\" With a few changes by Wood and a title obviously inspired by the success of the spy-fi TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the then current James Bond film Thunderball, the series got underway.T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents Archives Vol. 4, DC Comics, 2004. In addition to his scripts for T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, Brown was a contributor to Creepy, Skywald's Nightmare and other comic books. He scripted for Mars Attacks when Topps introduced its line of comics in the 1990s. He also wrote several paperbacks about trading cards, country music and rock, including the Encyclopedia of Country and Western Music (1971). Radio His interest in classic country music led him into DJ work with several New Jersey radio stations (WTTM, WNJN, WDVR). In 2000, Brown and his wife Abby relocated to Dripping Springs, Texas, where he launched classic country music programs on KDRP-FM and Austin's KOOP (FM).

November in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"November 16 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"30265714","text":"Electronovision was a process used by producer/entrepreneur H. William \\"Bill\\" Sargent, Jr. to produce a handful of motion pictures, theatrical plays, and specials in the 1960s and early 1970s using a high-resolution videotape process for production, later transferred to film via kinescope for theatrical release. Releases More than half a dozen films were produced in this fashion, including the production of Richard Burton in Hamlet (1964), the concert film The TAMI Show (1964),\\"TAMI Show\\" and the Magna Film production of Harlow (1965), starring actress Carol Lynley as Jean Harlow. Process background Electronovision was an entirely separate and more advanced process from the earlier Electronicam, used by the DuMont Television Network in the 1950s to telecast live TV shows with electronic cameras, while simultaneously filming the production with a film camera attached to the side of the video camera. That process had been used on TV series broadcast by DuMont as well as the \\"Classic 39\\" half-hour version of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS in the 1955‚Äì56 television season, allowing the producers to archive a high-quality film negative for reruns. While the press releases on Electronovision were deliberately vague, perhaps to add more mystique to the process, it used conventional analog Image Orthicon video camera tube units, shooting in the B&W; 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard. This standard was used as Ampex high-band quadruplex video tape recorders (VTR) were able to record it when equipped with proper version of Intersync module.Intersync module 1021 service manual, scanned document in PDF. The promoters of Electronovision gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless the advances in tape-to-reel time were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, raw tape could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used RCA TK-60 image orthicon video cameras, which have a characteristic white \\"glow\\" around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was an inherent flaw of image orthicon video camera tubes called \\"blooming.\\" Later vidicon and plumbicon tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures, as well as a higher resolution of 1400 lines. Electronovision as used to capture a live stage performance and then record to film for theatrical release. Videotape editing of the period was very primitive, which forced Electronovision producers to approach their productions essentially as if they were live TV broadcasts. Whole scenes were shot in long blocks, typically at least 5 or 10 minutes, and segments were physically cut together using mechanical 2\\" videotape splicing blocks. A special chemical solution and magnetic powder, applied to the videotape and viewed under a microscope, allowed the editor to see the video pulses and precisely align them for glitch-free editing. However, the technique was hit-and-miss and made it difficult to make accurate, fast edits. Sargent's original Electronovision empire went out of business around 1966, following the release of Stop the World ‚Äì I Want to Get Off. The producer revived the idea in 1975 with newer, color video equipment, and was able to mount a critically acclaimed independent release of James Whitmore's one-man show Give 'em Hell, Harry!, a biographical play based on the life of U.S. President Harry S. Truman. Two years later, Sargent had his most successful production, Richard Pryor's early 1979 live stand-up comedy performance Richard Pryor: Live in Concert, which received wide distribution in theaters as well as on cable TV and, later, home video. Decline Health and business problems forced Sargent to retire in the 1980s. The process became a footnote in history, though several other attempts were made to revive the essential concept‚Äîa higher-resolution videotape system, using modified video cameras, recording to videotape and then making a kinescope for theatrical release. Rival processes Avant- garde musician Frank Zappa co-directed and co-wrote 200 Motels (1971), which was shot on PAL color videotape at Pinewood Studios in England. The production featured dazzling graphics, video feedback, and chromakey visual effects, and is considered a precursor to the music videos of the 1980s. The production was electronically edited using early Ampex equipment, then transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release. The Vidtronics Company, a division of Technicolor, had developed a process for transferring color videotape to film, and to demonstrate its potential produced The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler (1971), a combination science-fiction and political conspiracy thriller, starring Leslie Nielsen and Angie Dickinson. The picture was shot by the Madison Productions crew from the TV series Death Valley Days, transferred and processed by Technicolor, and distributed by a Technicolor subsidiary, Gold Key Entertainment. It was not successful in theatres, but was frequently shown in TV syndication and 16mm rentals. In 1973, Hollywood actor/producer Ed Platt, made famous by his role as \\"The Chief\\" in the NBC-TV series Get Smart, raised the money to produce Santee, starring Glenn Ford. Platt saw the advantages of using videotape over film, and used the facilities of Burbank's Compact Video Systems to shoot the western on location in the California and Nevada deserts. The motion picture was shot with Norelco PCP-70 portable plumbicon NTSC cameras and portable Ampex VR-3000 2\\" VTRs, then transferred to film at Consolidated Film Industries in Hollywood. The film was not commercially successful. Platt died about six months after the film was released. In 1976, TV producer George Schlatter, known for his successful NBC- TV series Laugh-In and many TV comedy specials, wrote and directed the motion picture Norman... Is That You?, based on the controversial Broadway play. Also recorded on NTSC videotape, the film starred comedian Redd Foxx and Pearl Bailey. The film enjoyed some critical success, but was Schlatter's only foray into feature films. Los Angeles video post-production company Image Transform specialized in creating very high-quality recordings using 3M EBR film recorders that could perform color film-out recording on 16mm by exposing three 16mm frames in a row (one red, one green and one blue) during the 1970s and 1980s. Their Image Vision process used modified 24fps 10 MHz Bosch Fernseh KCK-40 cameras. This was a custom pre-HDTV video system. Image Transform used specially modified VTRs to record 24fps for their \\"Image Vision\\" system. The modified 1 inch type B videotape VTRs would record and play back 24fps video at 10 MHz bandwidth, at about twice the normal NTSC resolution. The Image Vision process was used on several minor shorts and theatrical releases, including Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982). Image Vision was superseded by the analog NHK Hi-Vision high definition system of the early 1990s.

Carpenter, biography posted at URL http://airforce.dtic.mil/news/biographies/carpenter_jw.html, 6 May 2000; http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=4930, updated 2010. NOTE: This reference is a public document, but has been quoted on the internet verbatim without reference to the original source, obscuring its primary source and implying it is copyrighted by the secondary source. Education Carpenter studied engineering at Oklahoma A&M; University and Mississippi State College before entering the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1935, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in military science in 1939. After graduation, he attended the U.S. Army Air Corps flying schools at Tulsa, Oklahoma, Randolph Field, Texas and Kelly Field, Texas, receiving his pilot wings in June 1940. Military career Carpenter's first flying assignment was with the 19th Bombardment Group at March Air Force Base, California, where he served as a heavy bombardment pilot, navigator and bombardier. In May 1941 he participated in the first mass flight of B-17s from Hamilton Field, California, to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. In October 1941 he flew with the 19th Bombardment Group as navigator on a B-17 from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Clark Field, the Philippine Islands, where he was assigned as squadron intelligence officer and combat crew commander. 19th Bombardment Group attacking Japanese-held Lae Airfield, New Guinea on 26‚Äì27 June 1942.

Afterwards it was flown to Brisbane, Australia for scrapping in May 1945 =Combat 1941-1942= When the Japanese attacked Clark Field on December 8, 1941, then- Lieutenant Carpenter was airborne on a reconnaissance mission. His aircraft survived several passes made by 5-10 Japanese fighter aircraft and he then maneuvered to avoid contact until the attack on the field ended.William H. Bartsch: December 8, 1941: MacArthur's Pearl Harbor, Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, Tex., p. 331. His aircraft was one of the first to land at Clark Field after the attack.Gene Eric Salecker: Fortress Against the Sun: The B-17 Flying Fortress in the Pacific. Da Capo Press, Cambridge, Mass. and New York, 2001, p. 43. The following day he flew the first reconnaissance mission to Formosa (now Taiwan), in place of the B-17 destroyed in the previous day's attack while by while being prepared for the same mission. He was forced to abort the mission due to generator problems.Salecker, op. cit. After flying several missions against the Japanese forces, he was ordered to Bataan where he commanded the ground echelon of the 19th Bombardment Group. After serving with the Infantry for two months he was evacuated to Java by submarine and rejoined his unit. He continued to fly combat missions until the 19th Bombardment Group returned to the United States in December 1942. =Post-combat 1943-1944= Command Pilot Badge, WWII Army design and currently Air Force regulation After returning to the continental U.S., Carpenter served on tours of duty at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; Headquarters Army Air Forces Bombardment Training Division, Washington, D.C.; and Headquarters Twentieth Air Force in Washington and the Mariana Islands. B-29s The new B-29 Superfortress had serious teething problems and General Arnold became alarmed at the situation and directed that his assistant, Major General B. E. Meyer, personally take charge of the entire modification program. The resulting burst of activity that took place between 10 March and 15 April 1944 came to be known as the \\"Battle of Kansas.\\" Carpenter, with many others, played an important part in getting the B-29s ready for combat duties.Birdsall, Steve. Saga of the Superfortress: The Dramatic Story of the B-29 and the Twentieth Air Force. London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1981. . Twentieth Air Force 110px The Twentieth Air Force was brought into existence on 4 April 1944 specifically to perform strategic bombardment missions against Japan. This was done at the insistence of General Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, commander of the USAAF, mainly to avoid having the new B-29 Superfortress being diverted to tactical missions under pressure from the China Burma India Theater commanders. Twentieth Air Force was to be commanded by General Arnold himself at Joint Chiefs of Staff level. Carpenter had been involved in the training division for the B-29s then assigned to the Headquarters of the Twentieth Air Force in Washington. The Twentieth Air Force was completely autonomous and its B-29s were to be completely independent of other command structures and would be dedicated exclusively against strategic targets in Japan.Rust, Kenn C. Twentieth Air Force Story...in World War II. Temple City, California: Historical Aviation Album, 1979. . B-29s of the 58th Bomb Wing on a mission to Rangood, Burma, 1944 In addition Twentieth Air Force was chosen (secretly) to be the operational component of the Manhattan Project in 1944, and performed the atomic attacks on Japan in August 1945. In 1944, one of Carpenter's duties was to help oversee the personnel selected for the 509th Composite Group and to support the independence of this unit. Initially under the command of General Hap Arnold, and later under operational command of General Curtis LeMay and General Nathan Twining. In August 1945 the Twentieth Air Force was placed under the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific which was commanded by General Carl Spaatz. Operation Matterhorn Operation Matterhorn was the name for the Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress offensive against the Empire of Japan from airfields in China. On 10 April 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) informally approved Operation Matterhorn. The operational vehicle was to be the 58th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy) of the XX Bomber Command. Twentieth Bomb Wing B-29s flying near Mount Fuji, Japan, 1945 By late 1944, it was becoming apparent that B-29 operations against Japan staged out of bases in China and India were far too expensive in men and materials and would have to be stopped. In December 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff made the decision that Operation Matterhorn would be phased out, and the 58th Bombardment Wing's B-29s would be moved to newly captured bases in the Marianas in the central Pacific. Carpenter moved there to help expedite the Twentieth Air Force mission and to help prepare for the movement of the 509th there. The Marianas chain of islands, consisting primarily of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, were considered as being ideal bases from which to launch B-29 operations against Japan. The islands were about 1500 miles from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, they could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship. =Post war= Later tours included Air Command and Staff College as a student and then instructor, a tour in the Philippine Islands, first as commander, 5th Reconnaissance Group, and later as vice commander, Thirteenth Air Force. In 1951 he was transferred to headquarters of Air Research and Development Command (now Air Force Systems Command), Baltimore, Maryland. After completing Air War College in July 1954, he became vice commander of Arnold Engineering Development Center at Arnold Air Force Base (Station, at the time), Tullahoma, Tennessee. He returned to Air Research and Development Command headquarters in March 1955 and later became chief of plans and programs. In March 1959 he assumed command of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In July 1961 he was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C.. In August 1965 he was appointed commander of Air University, where he served until July 1968 when he returned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel. In August 1969 he was appointed assistant Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, with additional duty as senior Air Force member, Military Staff Committee, United Nations, in which positions he completed his active duty military service. =Retirement from Active Duty= Carpenter retired in the rank of Lieutenant General on August 1, 1970.

The city has a much improved infrastructure with new healthcare facilities, sanitation, etc. Streets and Thoroughfares Traditionally the streets in Warsaw, unlike in many other cities in Poland, are named with adjective forms rather than in simple nouns in nominative case. For instance, the street named after Saint John is named ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska (literally Saintjohnian Street) in Warsaw and ≈öwiƒôty Jan (Saint John) in Pozna≈Ñ. In modern times the tradition is not closely observed and most streets named after personalities or groups are named with nouns in genitive case, thus the forms correspond roughly to the English prepositional phrases (Polish Plac Zwyciƒôstwa means literally Square of Victory rather than Victory Square).  Sanitation  = Water supply = Lindley Water Filters. Three supply systems serve Warsaw inhabitants. WodociƒÖg Centralny (Central Water Main) is the oldest. It was built in the 19th century. After many renovations, it is still functioning and providing water for more than half of Warsaw's residents. The other supply systems are WodociƒÖg Praski (Praga Water Main) and WodociƒÖg P√≥≈Çnocny (Northern Water Main). = Sewerage = Warsaw's sewer system was installed in the second half of the 19th century, at the same time as the water supply system. Currently the waste water collectors are 2,020 km long and serve over 90 percent of inhabitants. A new sewage treatment plant is planned for the south of the city on the left river bank.  Health system  The first hospital in Warsaw was established in 1353 by duke Siemowit III and his wife Eufemia and named the Hospital of the Holy Spirit after the Holy Spirit intra muros. In 1571, the famous Wojciech Oczko, an author of extensive treatises on balneology and syphilidology, was made a doctor there. It was previously located on Piwna, Przyrynek and Konwiktorska streets, and from 1861 on Elektoralna Street, where it was destroyed during the siege of Warsaw in 1939. Children's Memorial Health Institute. The Medical University of Warsaw, the largest medical school in Poland, has 16 affiliated hospitals including the largest clinical hospital in Poland - the Public Central Teaching Hospital at Banacha Street, where students are trained in almost all fields of medicine. Warsaw is home to the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), the highest-reference hospital for all of Poland, as well as an active research and education center. CMHI was founded by Poles living in Poland and abroad in 1968. It is a huge complex of newly designed buildings, with the most up-to-date equipment and a group of leading authorities in pediatrics and their co-workers. At present, the CMHI covers an area of 20 hectares and employs almost 2,000 people, making it the largest pediatric center in Poland. Funds come from the government, health insurance and other sources. The Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology is one of the largest and most modern oncological institutions in Europe. The clinical section is located in a 10-floor building with 700 beds, 10 operating theaters, an intensive care unit, several diagnostic departments, and an outpatient clinic. Each floor forms separate departments with surgical, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy wards. Each department provides the full range of combined treatment in a particular field. Although the healthcare system in Poland is free for persons covered by the general health insurance, it is sometimes slow. For those who wish to avoid queues of public hospitals, there are many private medical centers and hospitals in Warsaw.

Background Adams was 19 when he began working to raise the money to create the film. During filming, Adams travelled to Germany in 2000 and interviewed former Prison Pastor Hans Freitag about the performances. Freitag stated on camera that inmates were allowed to leave the prison to perform Godot in a Jewish Cultural Building in Frankfurt and provided documentary evidence to support his claim. Adams himself later cross-checked the inmate names with names collected in the Holocaust Registry of Nazi officers and found two highly likely matches. The film posits this irony. The film was dealt a budgetary setback by Swedish theatre director Jan Jonson in 2001 when Adams had travelled to New York City to meet Jonson for an interview. Jonson failed to show and the travel expenditures cost the project $2,000. Production was then suspended until 2006 before continuing with funds provided through the director's student loans. In total, it took 9 years to complete all the interviews and editing. The film's original version was completed in 2008. Synopsis The film documents the 1957 San Francisco Actor's Workshop production of the Samuel Beckett's play Waiting For Godot which was performed live before inmates at San Quentin Prison. The film also examines a 1953 performance of Godot by inmates at the Luttringhausen Prison in Germany, providing new scholarship material on those performances. Cast The documentary features interviews with former S.F. Actor's Workshop members Herbert Blau, Alan Mandell, Eugene Roche, Robert Symonds, Robin Wagner, Joseph Miksak, Tony Miksak, and David Irving as well as former prison inmates Rick Cluchey, Ed Reed, Professor John Irwin and Prison Recreation Supervisor Clem Swagerty. Release The documentary qualified for Academy Award consideration as a documentary short subject in 2008 but failed to gain a nomination. After 2008, the film was lengthened and distribution began in 2010, finding a home in such universities as Stanford, Duke, Berkeley, UNC, USC, Kansas State and many others.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1878 and 1885. He was also a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for two terms from 1856 until 1859. Early life Marks was the son of an Irish farmer who emigrated, with his family, to the Illawarra district when Marks was a few months old. After an elementary education in Sydney he became a successful farmer in Jamberoo near Kiama. By 1860, Marks had acquired substantial property in Sydney and had become independently wealthy. He was an alderman on Kiama Municipal Council between 1868 and 1874 and was the Mayor in 1870. Marks was also involved in numerous local organisations including the Presbyterian Church, Aboriginal Protection Board and Agricultural Society. He was a nephew of Samuel Charles who was also a Mayor of Kiama and a member of the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. Colonial Parliament In 1856 Marks was elected as one of the two members for East Camden in the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly under responsible government. He was re- elected at the next election in 1858. Marks was a supporter of Charles Cowper but became disillusioned with him when Cowper failed to support the construction of a breakwater in Kiama. He did not stand as a candidate when his electorate was abolished before the 1859 election and he declined Cowper's invitation to join the Legislative Council in 1861. Government On 23 January 1878 Marks became a life appointee to the Legislative Council when James Farnell appointed him to the position of Vice President of the Executive Council and Representative of the Government in the Legislative Council. In this position he was responsible for ensuring the passage of government legislation, including a contentious land bill, through the upper house. Marks lost the position when Farnell's government fell in December 1878 but he continued to attend the Legislative Council until his death. His infrequent speeches were noted for their moderation and 'gentlemanly style'.

He was rumored to be married to an illegitimate child of king George IV, later but historians consider it to be \\"improbable\\". As consul he played an important role in assisting British exploration of the Niger river. Biography Hanmer Warrington's private villa near Tripoli known as the \\"English Garden\\" hosted lavish parties. Warrington was the son of a country parson and grew up in Denbighshire. At age 16 he joined the 1st Dragoon Guards and saw service in Spain. He retired a Colonel in 1812 and married and had ten children. He became Consul-General in Tripoli in 1814. A possible mystery surrounds Warrington's wife, Jane-Eliza Pryce, who was rumoured to be the illegitimate child of the Prince Regent, later George IV.Thorn, Dorothy M., The Four Seasons of Cyrene, Studia Archaeologica, L'Erma di Bretschneider, Rome, 2007 This was never proven, and later historians see it as \\"improbable\\". Some have used the theory to explain why Warrington held his position in Tripoli for so long, and why Whitehall was so tolerant of his abuses there. In fact Warrington did receive patronage from the Duke of York, and it was later said he lost 40,000 pounds to George IV in a night of gambling, so he had some connections to the Royal Family, but to what extent is unknown. It does not require a royal scandal to explain events. He was continually rebuked by his masters at Whitehall due to complaints from foreign embassies about bad behavior. He was described as being \\"fanatically patriotic, consumed with vanity, and deficient in both intelligence and imagination, and a sore trial to other consuls.\\" He was a heavy drinker, had a violent temper and surrounded himself with a clique of local Arabs of ill- repute. Nevertheless he had a charisma and often found a way to make up and become chummy with those he quarreled with. He wore the unusual costume of a \\"red coat with blue facings and collar, richly embroidered in gold, French epaulets, and a cocked hat profusely decorated with ostrich feathers.\\" Warrington was often remembered for the villa he built about two miles outside the walls of Tripoli. It was informally known as the Garden or English Garden, located in the present suburb of Mensia. It was described as a \\"splendid horticultural development, containing the choicest fruit-trees of North Africa, with ornamental trees of every shape, hue ... the spot, in the middle of a waste, is now the fairest, loveliest garden in Tripoli.\\" It was known by guests who stayed there for lavish parties. It cost more than Warrington could afford and he unsuccessfully lobbied the English government to purchase it as an official residence. Role in the exploration of the Niger At a time when British influence on the Barbary Coast was overshadowed by that of France, Hanmer Warrington nevertheless succeeded in developing a close relationship with the local ruler, known as the bashaw, Yusuf Karamanli.De Gramont, Sanche, The Strong Brown God, The Story of the Niger River, Hart Davis, MacGibbon, London, 1975 In 1817, at the instigation of John Barrow, the Second Secretary of the Admiralty, it was decided to attempt a mission to the Niger River via Tripoli. Two men were chosen to lead the expedition, Joseph Ritchie and George Francis Lyon. Due to the unpredictable nature of the tribal groups likely to be encountered, particularly the Tuareg, it was essential to obtain some measure of protection from the bashaw, at least as far south as his influence would reach. Warrington was able to convince the bashaw to give his permission for the expedition and enabled the explorers to accompany a caravan leaving in the general direction of Timbuktu. This expedition, which resulted in the death of Joseph Ritchie, failed even to reach Timbuktu. Second Niger expedition from Tripoli John Barrow resolved to undertake a second expedition in order to build on the small achievements on the first. Warrington wrote to encourage this idea, saying that he would not hesitate to go himself, a challenge from which he was soon to demur. In 1822, Walter Oudney, Hugh Clapperton and Dixon Denham set out after much delay, once again with the help of Warrington who was able to convince a now doubtful bashaw that he should provide an armed escort. When the expedition faltered at the town of Murzuk, Warrington was called upon to provide more funds and once again use his influence with the bashaw. This expedition also broke down, leaving Oudney dead and Clapperton and Dixon at loggerheads.Fleming, Fergus, Barrow's Boys, Granta Books, London, 1998 Third Niger expedition from Tripoli The third and last Tripoli-based expedition was undertaken by Alexander Gordon Laing in 1825, once again with Warrington's considerable assistance. Several days before he left on what was to prove a fateful expedition, Laing married Warrington's daughter Emma. Laing succeeded in reaching the Niger and Timbuktu, but still could not ascertain the river's ultimate destination. At about the same time, Hugh Clapperton returned to the region, determined to beat Laing in finding the outlet of the Niger. Clapperton was accompanied by Richard Lemon Lander, whom he had hired as a servant and it was Lander who finally solved the puzzle of the Niger by sailing all the way down from Timbuktu to the Gulf of Guinea and the Niger delta. Final retirement Hanmer Warrington finally retired in 1842. He died in Patras, Greece in 1847.Lockhart, Jamie Bruce, A Sailor in the Sahara: The Life and Travels in Africa of Hugh Clapperton, Commander RN, , I B Tauris & Co Ltd, London, 2007 His son Frederick Warrington succeeded him as British Consul in Tripoli and in 1845 played a role in one more expedition led by James Richardson, who was accompanied by the German geographer Heinrich Barth.

He was injured in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when a Mauser bullet broke his thighbone. Wint, along with John D. Miles, selected the site of Fort Reno in Indian Territory in July 1874. Situated on the south side of the North Canadian River five miles west of present-day El Reno, Oklahoma, this fort was established after the Cheyenne uprising of 1874 to protect Darlington Indian Agency (located directly north across the river).Forts of the West: Military Forts and Presidios, and Posts Commonly Called Forts, West of the Mississippi River to 1898.

He became the Member of Parliament for Ballynakill in 1756 and Lisburn in 1768. He was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1764 and became Chief Justice of Common Pleas in 1770. He held office until his death although he had been contemplating retirement due to ill health. He was a native of Ennis, County Clare; and was the third son of Montrose Paterson. The Paterson family settled in Ennis in the eighteenth century and became substantial landowners in the area. He went to school in Limerick and graduated from the University of Dublin. In character he seems to have been a typical eighteenth-century rake: he was famed for his hospitality, shortened his life by heavy drinking and fought numerous duels. John Scott, 1st Earl of Clonmell called him one of those old men who die because they insist on living like young men. On the other hand, he was a considerable scholar, a fine lawyer and a diligent and zealous law officer. He was married and had a son, also called Marcus (c.1744-1768). The younger Marcus joined the British Army and was sent to America, where he died of a fever at Fort de Chartres, on the Mississippi River. The judge's estate passed to his nephew, yet another Marcus Paterson.

It is composed of three round barrows and possibly a long, chambered barrow. The site was excavated in 1931 by George Gray. The name \\"Battlegore\\" comes from this site being attributed to the location of a Danish raid in 918 AD or 988 AD. At least as early as the 14th century, the site was referred to as \\"Bytelgore\\", a predecessor of the word \\"Battlegore\\". Along with three nearby round barrows it has been scheduled as an ancient monument.  Description  The most northernly of the barrows is around in diameter and high. It is partially surrounded by a shallow ditch with a radius of . east of this barrow is a small mound about wide and high. Gray found four other mounds in addition to this small one, but he was unable to find anything that would indicate the importance of these small mounds. A large urn, found to the east of the center of the barrow, contained the cremated remains of a human. Just south of this is another one of the three major round barrows, and it was around high as of 1969. Between this and the southernmost of the three major barrows is a ring ditch, which might be another barrow. The final, southernmost barrow is around in diameter and in height. Unlike the previous barrow, this one has not been ploughed, and as such it is in better condition. The chambered barrow is composed of three stones. The largest is long, wide, and deep; the second-largest is long, wide, and deep; and the smallest is long, wide, and deep. According to legend, the devil and a giant's quarrel caused these stones to be thrown there.  Artifacts  Neolithic pottery and flint artifacts have been found at this site. Archaeologists also found bronze items, including a \\"knife dagger\\", a broken dagger, a rapier, a spearhead, and a winged axe. A field of Mesolithic flint artifacts has been found to the north of Battlegore.

Development  Model of Indonesian Aerospace N-219. In 2003, after the IPTN N-250 program halt, Indonesian Aerospace (IAe) wanted to develop a 19-seat aircraft to offset the IPTN NC-212 end of production. In early 2004, IAe was discussing with Malaysian aerospace companies and was estimating the N219 development at $60-80 million to fly a prototype in April 2006 and certify it in August 2007. In 2006, the $65m funding for the 19 seat N-219 development was proposed under the Qatar-Indonesia Joint Investment Fund, funded by Qatar for 70% and by Indonesia for 30%, for a prototype within two years. In June 2011, its price was forecast to be US$4 million each and it was expected to fly in 2014. The Industry Minister requested Rp59 billion to build the prototype. In January 2012, the predicted development budget was about $30 million for 15 aircraft. In August 2013, Lion Air was to sign a memorandum of understanding for 100 $4.5-5 million N219s. The total market for the N-219 was forecast as 97 civil and 57 military aircraft. In August 2014, the forecast price rose to $5 million. The first metal was cut in September 2014, before a planned roll-out in August 2015 and certification in 2016, before EASA certification with Airbus support for export. First deliveries were scheduled for 2017. On 13 April 2015, three memoranda of understanding were signed: with Nusantara Buana Air for 20 aircraft and ten options, with Aviastar Mandiri for 20 aircraft and ten options and with Trigana Air Service for ten aircraft and five options. The roll-out was then scheduled in November 2015. It was then waiting for the President Jokowi. In August 2016, Airbus was to help for certification. The prototype was then entering testing after the November 2015 public introduction. The first prototype construction was planned to be completed in mid-2016 for a maiden flight at the end of 2016, but this first flight was delayed to March 2017 for certification in the same year and production start in 2018. In February, it was delayed again to April. After a series of high-speed taxiing runs on 11 August 2017 at Husein Sastranegara International Airport in Bandung, it took off from there on 16 August 2017 shortly after 9 am before returning at its origin after 26 minutes. It is the eve of the 72nd anniversary of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. Indonesia has signed deals with China and Mexico to export N-219 to those countries. Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Myanmar are also interested in the aircraft. Turkish Aerospace Industries could produce the N219 to market it in Africa. At least Rp 200 billion is needed to complete 200 hours of flight tests for certification from the Indonesian Transport Ministry before it can be sold. By October 2018, domestic airline Avistar signed a memorandum of understanding for 20 more while the N219 had 120 orders and was due to be certified in April or May 2019. Other customers include Lion Air, Trigana Air Service, Nusantara Buana Air, Pelita Air, Air Born and the government of Thailand. Production could begin with six aircraft in 2019, increasing to 16 in 2020 towards 36 per year in a new $90-100 million facility raised through equity participation, private-public partnerships, manufacturing subsidiaries, and joint ventures. Design The N-219 is twin-engine, 19-seater transport aircraft designed for multi-purpose missions in remote areas. It is intended to operate in and out of remote, semi-prepared airstrips; suitable to conditions in Indonesia's archipelago. It was developed from the CASA C-212 Aviocar and, like that design, is also of all metal construction. It is claimed that it will have the largest cabin volume in its class (6.50 x 1.82 x 1.70m). A flexible door system to allow a multi-purpose missions for transporting passengers and cargo. The aircraft is designed to comply with FAR 23 (commuter category aircraft). Priced at $5.8-6 million, slightly lower than the Viking DHC-6 Twin Otter, the cruise aircraft is intended for cargo and passenger transport, troop transport, military surveillance, search and rescue, and medevac operations, with a possible amphibian version later. Sixty percent of the materials are domestically produced and local suppliers produce landing gear parts, rubber components and tooling.
