He is particularly known for his book American Holocaust (Oxford University Press, 1992), in which he argues that the genocide against the Native American population was the largest genocide in history. Early life He was born in a Jewish household to Florence E. Harwood Stannard and David L. Stannard, a businessman. He served in the armed forces and worked in the publishing industry between 1959 and 1968. In 1966, he married Valerie M. Nice. The couple, subsequently divorced, have two sons. Career After returning to college in 1968, Stannard graduated magna cum laude from San Francisco State University in 1971. He then went to Yale and obtained an M.A. degree in history (1972), a Master of Philosophy in American Studies (1973), and a Ph.D. in American Studies in 1975. He has taught at Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Colorado, and the University of Hawaii. He has lectured throughout the United States, in Europe, and in Asia. He is currently a writer and professor in the Department of American Studies at the University of Hawaii, where he was awarded the Regents' Medal for Excellence in teaching. He has contributed dozens of articles to scholarly journals in a variety of fields. =American Holocaust= Stannard's research on the indigenous peoples of North and South America (including Hawaii)INTERVIEW: David Stannard. has produced the conclusion that Native Americans had undergone the \\"worst human holocaust the world had ever witnessed, roaring across two continents non-stop for four centuries and consuming the lives of countless tens of millions of people.\\"Were American Indians the Victims of Genocide? While acknowledging that the majority of the indigenous peoples fell victim to the ravages of European disease, he estimates that almost 100 million died in what he calls the American Holocaust.Stannard, p. x (quotation), p. 151 (death toll estimate). In response to Stannard's figures, political scientist Rudolph Rummel has estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls democide, which excludes military battles and unintentional deaths in Rummel's definition. The vast majority of the victims of democide were in Latin America. \\"Even if these figures are remotely true,\\" writes Rummel, \\"then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history.\\"Cook on Stannard, p. 12; Rummel's quote and estimate from his website, about midway down the page, after footnote 82\\\\. Rummel's estimate is presumably not a single democide, but is a total of multiple democides, since there were many different governments involved. According to Guenter Lewy, Stannard's perspective has been joined by scholars Kirkpatrick Sale, Ben Kiernan, Lenore A. Stiffarm, Phil Lane, Jr., and Ward Churchill. Samuel R. Cook of The American Indian Quarterly wrote: Alfred Crosby of The Boston Sunday Globe wrote: Personal life Stannard is the longtime partner of Hawaiian nationalist, University of Hawaii professor emeritus, and author Haunani-Kay Trask.

Shrinking History, published in 1980, was chosen by Psychology Today as one of the 'best books of the year'.STANNARD, David Edward His other writings have been translated into German, French, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, and Japanese. In American Holocaust, he argues that the destruction of the aboriginal peoples of the Americas, in a \\"string of genocide campaigns\\" by Europeans and their descendants, was the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world.David Stannard (1992). American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World, Oxford University Press, .\\"far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world.\\" Although praised by Howard Zinn, Vine Deloria, Dee Brown and others, Stannard's argument generated a great deal of critical commentary. He responded to much of it in a lengthy essay entitled \\"Uniqueness as Denial: The Politics of Genocide Scholarship\\", published in Is the Holocaust Unique?, edited by Alan S. Rosenbaum (Westview Press, 1996). Before the Horror has focused on Hawaii and the Pacific. Having dramatically and upwardly revised the estimated population of Hawaii at the time of Western contact from about 200,000 to between 800,000 and 1,000,000‚Äîa change that forced major rethinking about the entirety of Hawaii's history‚Äîthat work is now being used as the foundation for re-examinations of indigenous population histories throughout the Pacific.(See, for example, Patrick V. Kirch and Jean- Louis Rallu, eds)., The Growth and Collapse of Pacific Island Societies (University of Hawaii Press, 2007) In 2005 Stannard's book Honor Killing used an infamous rape and murder case of the 1930s‚Äîone that involved Clarence Darrow arguing his final spectacular defense‚Äîto open up a detailed social and political examination of the Hawaiian Islands under US colonial rule. In its review The New York Review of Books described Honor Killing as \\"finely written and meticulously researched... a biopsy of the racist and imperial arrogance that are an integral, though seldom acknowledged, motif of the history of America.\\" Awards Stannard was the recipient of Guggenheim, Rockefeller, American Council of Learned Societies and other research fellowships and awards.

The earliest evidence of the existence of Martaban in Myanmar history was revealed in an inscription erected by King Sithu II of Pagan (Bagan) Empire in 1176. In the 13th century, Martaban was a southern provincial capital in the Pagan Empire. After Pagan's collapse in 1287, King Wareru founded the Martaban Kingdom based out of Martaban. The city was the capital of a Mon-speaking kingdom from 1287 to 1364. Nominally it was a vassal state of the Thai Sukhothai Kingdom until 1314. From 1369 onwards, the Hanthawaddy kings ruled the kingdom from Bago (Pegu).Harvey 1925: 368 From 1364 to 1388, Martaban was under the de facto independent rule of Byattaba.

The town also boasts of producing maize, mangoes, root crops, sweet potatoes, legumes, bamboo, coconuts, as well as high yielding crops such as carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and strawberries thus the nickname Strawberry Capital of Iloilo as they produce substantial amount of strawberries in their strawberry farms. Etymology The name of the town was named after this plant alimodia or alimodias, the old Visayan name for Coix lachryma-jobi. The name of the town was actually derived from alimodia or alimodias, the old Visayan name for Coix lachryma-jobi, a grain- bearing tropical plant of the grass family ubiquitous in the town. It is so called Job's tears because of the shape of its hard-shelled pseudocarps which are made by some into necklaces or rosary beads. History =Spanish colonial period= Alimodian was formerly an arrabal of the town of Ogtong. The town was founded in 1754 by Capitan Agustin Magtanong. On August 20, 1756 Alimodian was officially separated from Ogtong. The original church of Alimodian was first constructed in 1754. It was agreed that the site of the church would be on the place where the rope that pulled the tablon (a huge timber) would break. The tablon came from the shore of Ogtong (now Oton) and it was pulled by a pair of carabaos. Thus the site was decided and the people built a chapel of bamboos, cogon and logs. The plan to build a permanent church made of bricks and rocks plastered with lime was initiated in 1780 by then gobernadorcillo Marcos Gregorio and incumbent priest Fr. Francisco Monasterio and was moved on the northwest of the church's cemetery on Nichols St. It was completed in 1784 but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1787. The cornerstone of a permanent stone was laid on December 5, 1859 through the efforts of parish priest Fr. Florencio Martin and gobernadorcillo Don Timoteo Amarra. It was well attended by Spanish dignitaries from Manila, Cebu and Iloilo. It was completed in 1864 and was formally opened to public on December 22, 1864 amidst a colorful ceremonies. The first permanent municipal hall was constructed in 1872 more than a century after its foundation since the first municipal building was built. It was completed in 1873 at a cost of 300 pesos during the incumbency of Capitan Marcelo Tolentino y Alger. Calamities during the 19th century The last half of the 19th century has been infamously remembered as one of the most disastrous and disturbing period in the annals of Alimodian. It started in December 1851 when it rained tremendously for over a week with some gusty winds. The heavy downpour causes deluge on the rivers uprooting huge trees carrying them from the banks of the river to the plains. No official record of casualties existed. Another typhoon happened in May 1866 struck several towns including Alimodian. During its full strength a lightning struck the giant cross on the belfry of the new church toppling it to the ground. A strong earthquake jolted the church on June 29, 1869 a feast day of St. Peter and St. Paul and many pious devotees who flocked to the church at 7 am mass suffered broken limbs during a commotion. A big fire took place at around 1 pm April 25, 1877 and at least 17 houses made of bamboo and other light materials reduced to ashes while an old woman caught fire and left several families homeless. July and August 1877 were months ravaged with typhoon and severe flooding causing many trees to be uprooted. The heavy downpour in those months caused nature to exhaust its supply that from September 1877 to May 1878 not a single drop fell from heaven. There is a severe drought and the town suffered almost 10 months of arid climate people are parched and feel the searing heat pierced their bodies and crops were devastated and no single harvest took place in 1878 because it was a toxic year of famine, disease and death. On March 1, 1878 at eight in the evening, a huge fire reduced to ashes some 180 houses in Balud and Dawis (now Liboon and Rodriguez Streets respectively) just near the town plaza. Many got sick and perished in the dreaded months of August to December 1878 due to low resistance brought by deficient food intake. Almost 3,000 elderly people and children died on this tragic period and anemia and gastroenteritis were the leading cause of their early deaths. Another pestilence happen in August 1882 and according to the records some 900 people perished. A strong earthquake shook the town on February 2, 1887 which caused the stone image of St. Augustine which sits on top of the main door of the church to fell. The turn of the century with the coming of the American doesn't augurs well to the town. On September 8, 1900 tragedy struck with the outbreak of the cholera and the epidemic according to the official records took the lives of at least 700 people and this does not include those in the remote villages. =American colonial period= The turn of the century, with the coming of the Americans, didn't augur well for the town. On September 8, 1900, tragedy struck with the outbreak of cholera. The epidemic according to the official records took the lives of at least 700 people, which does not include those in the remote villages. In 1902 Wilford Nichols, an American teacher arrived in Alimodian to teach the English language. Those who were already proficient in Spanish were required to attend school first so they could in turn teach other citizens how to read and write in English. The first principal was Justo Puga, and the first teachers were Felicidad Alingasa Santa Cruz, Venancia Santa Cruz Edurese and Concepcion Alfante Akol. Alimodian became an arabales of the town of Leon in January 1904. Executive Order No. 45 signed by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison separating Alimodian from Leon effective December 31, 1918. By the first day of 1919 Alimodian elevated its status from just an arrabal of Leon to a fully independent municipality. =Japanese occupation and World War II= The Japanese Imperial Army first passed by Alimodian on April 19, 1942 from Maasin aboard their trucks and bicycles. They left the town peacefully and without any incidents since there were no combat forces in the area as they camped out in the mountains like in Cabacanan way before the Japanese arrived except for the intelligence operatives of the G-2 section and other units were in the town center to monitor covertly the movements of the invading enemy forces. The operatives included Sgt. Marcelo Tolentino, Conrado Norada, former Iloilo governor, and Sgt. Alfredo Galon. It was learned based on the intelligence reports gathered by the military that there were Japanese sympathizers among the evacuees at the convent of Fr. Mariano Perez, who was the parish priest at the time Sgt. Galon was planted as a houseboy at the convent. The information he gathered was relayed to Maj. Rafael Almacen, chief of the G-2 Intelligence Section operative during the war. In May 1942, an order was received from Major Rafael Almacen to round up Filipino soldiers who escaped being a prisoner of war and convince them to join Panay Free Forces organized in the mountains of Lambunao by Panay movement led by Col. Macario Peralta, Lt. Col. Leopoldo Relunia, Maj. Jose Alvior, Lt. Col. Julian Chavez and other responsible officers of the disbanded USAFFE. Refusal to join means the firearms would be confiscated. The designated town officer, First Lt. Marcelo Tolentino organized the Alimodian chapter of the movement in June 1942. This was a sub-unit of the First Iloilo Sector consisting of southern towns of Iloilo. Major Almacen was assigned as sector commander by Col. Peralta. During the first few months of guerilla warfare, Sitio Taban became the center of activities of guerillas, Japanese spies and civilian. After the Japanese eventually landed in Iloilo, the town's public market was transferred to Sitio Taban. Taban massacre This tragic infamous incident etched in the annals of Alimodian history and forever ingrained in the memories of the townsfolk took place in the early morning of August 17, 1942. It was a fine busy Tuesday morning and people were busy trading and buying and selling of farm produce were briskly done and people of all ages and gender crowded the marketplace. All of a sudden the Japanese appeared in a flash. The first impulse is to escape but it was too late for most of the people there to get out. The preconceived plan of getting all the able bodied men from the crowd was carried out, seizing them and tied their hands and feet by the Japanese forces. About 50 men were captured after all the rest successfully eluded the Japanese while those who were left in the scene were women. Bayonets and sabers were immediately put into action after lining up the captured 50 men who were securely tied up. One by one, the captives were made to stand against the trunk of a coconut tree. Immediately, each one of them was subjected to bayonet thrusts and later beheaded with sabers. The massacre is completed and the severed heads of the victims were left scattered around to be eaten and taken cared of by the dogs after the murderers had gone. On May 7, 1942 the first ambush on the Japanese Imperial forces took place in Barangay Balabago led by Col. Macario Peralta, commander of the Panay Guerilla and Free Panay Movement. Meanwhile, Col. Julian Chavez, the 63rd Regiment Commander established his command post in Barangay Dalid in preparation for the landing of the American forces in Parara Sur, Tigbauan. The 63rd Regiment Hospital headed by Capt. Alejandro Nery Cruz, MD was housed in the old central school building now the site of Alimodian Water District and Municipal Library. US navy pilot, Ensign William G. Shackleford was safely brought in Alimodian after his forced landing in Barrio Bangkal, Tigbauan, Iloilo due to engine trouble during an air raid of Iloilo City on September 13‚Äì14 and 24, 1944. He was saved by the guerillas and able to dismantle six machine guns and hundreds of ammunitions. He also burned his plane by firing a tracer bullet before the Japanese arrives. Shackleford was brought by Lt. Marcelo Tolentino to the command post in Inocencio St. He was welcomed cheerfully and treated like a hero and offered a sumptuous meal by the Segovia sisters, Luisa, Carolina and Maria who were evacuees from the city and signed autographs in emergency notes by those present. In turn he distributed chewing gums and candies. =Post-war reconstruction And developments= Alimodian was a no man's land after the war. Houses were burned and demolished. When the people returned to the town after the war, they have to contend to live in makeshifts houses made of bamboo and nipa for their shelter. The American government has its fair share of damages during the war. The American government paid the people in the form of reparation. In addition, guerilla notes issued during the war were also redeemed. Mayor Felix Altura who was the town's mayor before and after the war came back to office in March 1945 to have a responsive government immediately act on the people's needs. The military government appointed Simeon Ca√±onero as municipal mayor on May 15, 1946. The vice mayor was Anacleto Amparo and the councilors were Gelacio Allones, Wenceslao Anino, Teodosia Amarra, Pablo Albeza and Clara Alegrado. Mayor Simeon Ca√±onero is the longest-serving mayor of the town. He served for two years as a military-appointed mayor after the war and was elected for three terms of four years. Many buildings and structure in the town were destroyed and ruined during the Japanese occupation mostly from Japanese attracks, arson attempts of retaliating Filipino forces and series of lootings by deprived citizens and evacuees. During the term of Mayor Ca√±onero, roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure ruined by the war were reconstructed and made completely functional. School buildings in the town and barrios were rebuilt funded from the Philippine War Damage Claim. Rehabilitation of school buildings were given importance and priority due to an increase of enrollment after the war. Alimodian High School was founded in 1947 paving the way for secondary education for the young citizens of the town. Street lighting system was first introduced in the town after the war provided by Alimodian Electric Light Service, an electric plant owned by the prominent family of Mrs. Natalia Amparado. On November 9, 1966 a boundary dispute between Alimodian and Cabatuan was resolved. The popular Holy Week pilgrimage site Agony Hill was blessed and inaugurated at 3:30 in the afternoon of May 3, 1967 by then Jaro Auxiliary Bishop, most Reverend Jaime L. Sin, D.D.. This project was initiated and completed by Reverend Father Nicolas Caberoy. Rural Bank of Alimodian Inc. was established in 1973 during the incumbency of Mayor Miguel Anas. It was inaugurated on December 31, 1974. ALEOSAN (initials of Alimodian, Leon and San Miguel being serviced by the hospital) hospital was founded in April 1968 through Republic Act No. 4854 authored by late Congressman Ramon Tabiana. The town was first energized on May 5, 1975 by Iloilo Electric Cooperative I with its main office in Tigbauan, Iloilo. Three hundred fifty households in the town proper and forty-two households in the barangays of Balabago, Bancal, Buhay and Lanot were the first recipients of the electrification. Aganan River flood control was constructed. Five policemen, patrolmen Silvio Amaguin, Bernardo Alinday, Agustin Alitre, Romeo Alipat and Florencio Aligor, were killed on the spot by an ambush of the anti-government forces while on their way home after performing their mission in Barangay Tarug on the tragic day of August 20, 1978. Geography Alimodian is from Iloilo City. The rugged terrains of the Seven Cities in the northwestern hinterlands or upland communities of the town is part of the Bucari mountain ranges which lies mostly in the town of Leon. Bato Dungok of Mount Agua Colonia in the seven cities is the highest point in Alimodian. Aganan river the main tributary which passes through and serves several barangays is the longest and only river in the town.

It is home to Ritz School of Integrated Studies, a co- educational Montessori & elementary school and English institute for Korean students. Buses arrive at Balasan bus station, a kilometre to the Balasan's town centre, every fifteen minutes. Taking a tricycle is the most convenient way for newcomers to travel around Balasan. In 1950, the barrio of Zarragoza was transferred from the town of Batad. Etymology Balasan derived its name from \\"Balas\\" meaning sand which are still found in abundance along the Banks of Bangon River where the first settlement was founded. History Sometime in 1846, Francisco Ariola, son of the datu from Jolo, together with his men, found themselves in the shores of Carles. He immediately organized the early settlers who later mingled with his men at Punta Bulakawe, a plateau just 330 meters north of the Poblacion (town proper). The settlers extended their clearing up the jungles and virgin lands for development. The Provincial Governor of Capiz commissioned Ariola to facilitate transportation of families recruited from Antique and Aklan. Soon afterwards, more settlers came. The Punta Bulakawe settlement, thus formed was included under the Pueblo de Pilar, Capiz.http://www.oocities.org/dost6/iloilo/carles.html It was in 1857 when Don Juan Silverio granted Francisco Ariola permission together with 50 families to go in a boat southeastwards from Barrio Sumagbong Cogon, Nabas, Capiz (Aklan) to the unfamiliar lands in the eastern portions of Panay Island. They soon landed in what was then known to be Punta Bulukawe, Capiz (Punta Badaiang, Carles). They were granted a full tax exemption for three years if they cultivated the new land. Towards 1856, as the general clearing progressed, Francisco transferred Bulakawe to the lowland south of the settlement. The settlement was named BADIANG, which means \\"wild giant gabi variety\\" because of the abundance of this plant in the vicinity of the new site. As streets were laid out Ariola, caused the equal distribution of the home lots to settlers alongside the new created streets. Some settlers however, built their homes near farms. This later led to the formation of other barrio settlements.http://www.oocities.org/dost6/iloilo/carles.html After making a settlement, Francisco Ariola quickly appointed an exploration team to survey the new land further south. The team was led by Vicente Navales-the existing perpetual index of the leaders of Balasan started with the first teniente del barrio absolute, Vicente Navales in 1852. They immediately set forth southeastward to a river where they rested for the night. The morning was when the river got its name when the first man to awaken called out: ‚ÄòBangon!‚Äô which meant ‚ÄòArise!‚Äô The land after the river was a beautiful grassland full of sparrows ‚Äì probably the Paser montanus (maya bongol), Lochura malacca (maya pula), or the Padda oryzivora (maya costa) which was from which the place got its name, Maya. They went further off to such places which are now known as Barangay Bulac, Batad, and Lanubo (Estancia). After being gone for quite some time, the folks in the settlement began to worry so a search party was formed to bring them back. They met with the former party in a place which was from then on known to be Tabuan (a place where people meet). The accounts of Vicente Navales made some of the folks decide to make a sister-settlement in Maya. The place did prove promising and it expanded northeastward to a place with a river which was very ideal as a channel for sea trade and source of industrial sand (baras). The place was from then until such a time was known as Barasan. It eventually expanded and soon such area which was once the extension of the maya settlement became known until now as Mamhut. In January 1860, the leaders of the Barrio Badiang headed by Francisco Ariola went to Capiz to petition the provincial government to make Barrio Badiang a municipality. The governor denied the petition on the ground that Barrio Badiang was only newly created and was not yet capable of becoming a pueblo. Not discouraged by their first failure, the petitioners traveled for days to Iloilo City, to bring this petition to Governor Jose Maria Carles, a Spanish Governor. After studying the case, Governor Carles approved the petition and thus, Barrio Badiang became a \\"pueblo\\".http://www.oocities.org/dost6/iloilo/carles.html The jubilant people of Badiang, in gratitude to Governor Carles for his approval of this petition, presented another petition to change the name Badiang to Carles in honor of the Governor. This petition was approved and on July 1, 1862, Carles was inaugurated as a new Pueblo with Alenjandro Buaya as the first Gobernadorcillo del Pueblo made Carles.http://www.oocities.org/dost6/iloilo/carles.html On January 1, 1904, the Municipio de Carles was demoted from a status of a Barrio to the status of a Barrio Balasan. This incident disheartened some Carlese√±os who migrated to other towns and provinces. But among those who stayed on were the strong willed ones who struggled hard to make Carles an independent municipality. Headed by Casimiro Andrada, the Carles Separation Movement succeeded in getting the approval of the Carlese√±os petition for separation from Balasan on January 1, 1920.http://www.oocities.org/dost6/iloilo/carles.html The records show that former Badiang (Carles) then later known as Balasan became large enough that it even covered the areas which now are separate districts such as Carles, Balasan, Estancia, and Batad. The writings of Douglas Malunda tell about a treasure that the settlers of Ariola stored in one wooden chest to make it easier to protect from thieves from both land and sea. It was said such chest of silver, gold and pearls was buried in a dried well somewhere in Balasan with only a large tree to mark its location. The most accurate knowledge of its location was known by Ariola's only son who unfortunately became one of the casualties of a cholera epidemic. With his death, the knowledge of the location of the treasure vanished. As yet, the treasure awaits its very fortunate hunter. Geography Balasan is in northeast Iloilo, from the provincial capital, Iloilo City, and from Roxas City, with a regular bus service from these 2 cities. =Barangays= Balasan is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Balasan, Iloilo, was people, with a density of . Healthcare The town has two hospitals: Jesus M Colmenares District Hospital (government-owned, bed capacity 283) and Loida Sterner Hospital Facility (privately owned by a foundation, bed capacity about 100); and a Diagnostic centers: Medicus and Health Link.

Banate is well known for Kasag (crabs), krill or shimp paste called ginamos, and the fresh fish, which local entrepreneurs take to and sell in the capital of the province, in many of the non-coastal towns, and even in Manila. Geography Banate is from Iloilo City. =Barangays= Banate is composed of 18 barangays, 7 of which are along the coast and the rest are in the interior uplands. =Climate= History =Banate during the Pre-conquest Period= The settlement in Banate is of ancient origin. It was among the ancient organized territories of the Confederation of Madja-as in Panay (also called by the ancient Bornean migrants, the island of \\"Madya- as\\"),Cf, Sebastian Santa Cruz Serag, The Remnants of the Great Ilonggo Nation, Sampaloc, Manila: Rex Book Store, 1997, p. 21. which the Spaniards found when they came to the Island. It was known to Spanish missionaries during the earliest dates of the colonization as Bobog.Cf. Archivo Hist√≥rico Hispano- Agustiniano y Boletin Oficial de la Provincia del Smo. Nombre de Jes√∫s de Filipinas, 1922: Imprenta del Monasterio de El Escorial, Vol. XVII (Enero- Junio de 1922), pp. 292-293. The Spanish Augustinian historian, Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, mentions it in an account about Dumangas and other coastal towns of the island, where in ancient times there was a principality and trade center that had the most illustrious nobility in the whole island of Panay. Bobog (Banate), Araut, Anilao, and Hapitan were among the ancient coastal civilizations in Panay.\\"Tambi√©n fund√≥ convento el Padre Fray Martin de Rada en Araut- que ahora se llama el convento de Dumangas- con la advocaci√≥n de nuestro Padre San Agust√≠n‚Ä¶ Est√° fundado este pueblo casi a los fines del r√≠o de Halaur, que naciendo en unos altos montes en el centro de esta isla (Panay)‚Ä¶ Es el pueblo muy hermoso, ameno y muy lleno de palmares de cocos.

There are theories that settlers from the powerful ancient thalassocratic Malay empire based on the island of Sumatra, modern-day Indonesia (which influenced much of Southeast Asia) arrived in Banate in around 600 A.D., during the second wave of migration from the Sulawesi Island of the southern archipelago of Southeast Asia. First, the most northern part of Iloilo, Estancia, was settled. Some migrants moved to Batad, Balasan and Carles. Then, Ajuy was settled, and from there communities spread to inhabit the present Conception and San Dionisio area. In time, communities of Ajuy spread upland to populate the hamlet of Sara. The families of Sara spread to Lemery. Other families inhabited the coast of Bobog (Banate-Viejo), and traversed the mountain now called San Rafael. Some families settled near the River Jalaud. Others moved further South and settled in Irong-irong and finally stopped at Ogtong. These independent coastal settlements were engaged in fishing, and settled near rivers. The Maragtas of Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro mentions that the area near the Alakaygan River was among the first areas to be exploited by the early Malay settlers for agriculture. In these places they cultivated the land, planting kauayan, mabulo, hidiok, bagtikan, sibukao, buri, niog, kulo, kalamansi, paray, batad, kahangkugui and other seed, which they brought from Borneo.Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro, Maragtas. Janiuay: 1854 (translated in English by Esther Abiera, et al., and currently in the Library of the University of Michigan), pp. 17-18. Alakaygan and Bubug (Bobog), which gave its name to the ancient society and where the future Spanish population would develop, were among the first settlements established by the Malays in Panay.Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro, Maragtas. Janiuay: 1854 (translated in English by Esther Abiera, et al., and currently in the Library of the University of Michigan), pp. 21-22. As a side note, Alakaygan is the only place in Banate where, until recent years, Tapukal (krill or hipon smoked in the bark of a native tree) was produced. It is a delicacy that can be found only in Banate. =Banate during the Spanish Regime= Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map of the Philippines showing Banate as one of the ancient towns on the island of Panay. Origin of the Town's Name At the beginning of the Christianisation of Panay, Bobog was a visitaCf. Sub-section \\"The Residencia and The Visita\\" of the History of the Philippines (1521‚Äì1898). of the Augustinian parish and monastery of Dumangas. Gaspar de San Agustin mentioned the existence of the town in his book Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565‚Äì1615). Another Augustinian historian Fray Juan Fernandez, in his Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay, affirms that Banate was known in the ancient times as Bobog or Bog-og. The Augustinian friar says that the modern name Banate might have been derived from some flora that abundantly thrive in the town. One possibility is the Butacea, named by Carl Linnaeus as Murraya exotica. If the spelling and the pronunciation are corrupted, and instead of Banate what is written or pronounced is Bangate, it would therefore be the leguminous papilion√°cea called in botany as Abrus praecatorius.Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay in Monographs of the Towns of Panay, Jose Espinosa, Jr., trans., Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 2006, pp. ---. To the inhabitants, the town's modern name is commonly attributed to the presence of many Bangate trees in the area. According to a local legend, when the Spaniards arrived, all the inhabitants of Banate fled away for safety. An old man, however, failed to escape because he was of advanced age and was already so weak. It was raining then. So, the old man took shelter under the Bangate tree where a Spanish officer found him later on. The white man asked the native; \\"Come se llama esto pueblo?\\", The old man, uncertain what to say, merely said \\"Bangate\\" thinking that the Spaniard was asking him about the name of the tree. Unable to understand clearly what the old man mumbled, the Spaniard thought the native had said \\"Banate\\". While such legend sounds too absurd to be true, it is the only explanation often given by people when asked why their town is called Banate. Indeed, 'Bangate' trees still abound within the territorial limits of the municipality. Banate at the Beginning of the Colonial Period The Map of Panay, with data about the bastions of its coastlines, c. 1797, drawn under the direction of Don Santiago Salaverria, Teniente Coronel graduado de Batallon de Milicias de la Laguna de Bay, y Corregidor de la Provincia de Tondo. The map shows the three bastions of Banate. Bobog, in the early part of its history as a Christian settlement and a Visita of Dumangas, was placed under the advocation of St. John the Evangelist.Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565‚Äì1615), Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas: Madrid 1975, pp. 374-375. In the early part of the 1700s, it was called \\"Banate Viejo\\" by the Spaniards. A map of the Philippines, made by the Jesuit priest Fr. Murillo Velarde and published in Manila in 1734, shows Banate Viejo among the ancient towns of the island.The ancient towns and their visitas explicitly illustrated in the map are: Arevalo, Iloilo (extends to Pavia Santa Barbara , Cabatuan and Maasin), Molo, Jaro ( stretching to current Lapaz and Leganes), Guimbal, Tigbaun, Oton, Dumangas, Anilao, Banate, Barotac (Nuevo), Ajuy Dulano, Laglag, Pase, Alimodian. Cf. Inset for Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map. The appelative \\"Viejo\\", which the Spaniards attached to the early hispanized name of the town, indicates the ancient origin of Banate. Fr. Juan Fernandez says that Banate was formally established as a municipality in 1763. By then, it acquired as its Visita the settlement of Sinaba-an.Cf. Archivo Hist√≥rico Hispano-Agustiniano y Boletin Oficial de la Provincia del Smo. Nombre de Jes√∫s de Filipinas, 1922: Imprenta del Monasterio de El Escorial, Vol. XVII (Enero- Junio de 1922), p. 293.The logical location of \\"Sinabaan\\" would be what is now Barotac Viejo. The fact that this town had a history of being attached to Banate, also during the American period, as well as its proximity to Banate support to this theory. Besides, Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map shows the name \\"Banate Viejo\\" extending also over areas where the present Barotac Viejo is located. Another possibility could be San Rafael or San Enrique. However, in Banate's history, there seems to be no reference to this old town's close interaction during the previous centuries with the other two new towns in Iloilo. In a private definitory of the Augustinian Order, on 31 October 1763, Fr. Alejandro Arias was appointed as Vicar for the town.Cf. Libro de Gobierno de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jes√∫s de Filipinas, Augustinian Archives in Valladolid and Madrid, Spain, VI, fol. 75v.Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay (Monographs of the Towns of Panay), Jose G. Espinosa, Jr. (trans.), with Introduction of Fr. Policarpio Hernandez, O.S.A., Iloilo City: Panorama Printing, 2006, pp. 64 and 158. Being a coastal village with a rich fishing ground, Banate is naturally inclined to flourish. However, it was also a natural target to invaders. In 1764, many people would leave the town because of a disastrous incursion and pillage of the Moros from Mindanao. R. P. Fray Arias, O.S.A., the town's priest who was at the same time the parish priest of Guimbal,Cf. Elviro J. Perez, Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 262. was escaping this raid when he was captured by Moro pirates in that year at the Port of Tayabas.

Consequently, after the Muslim pillage, Banate was re- annexed to Dumangas.As of 1833, Banate was still a visita of Dumangas. Cf. Fr.

It later became a Visita with its own teniente de justicia, dependent to Barotac Nuevo for its civil and ecclesiastical government until 1843,Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas, Madrid: 1850, Vol. I, p. 339. when it was declared an independent municipality again. By the end of the 1700s, the inhabitants of Banate have already finished building three stone bastions located at its shores, which defended the town from marauding moros of Mindanao.\\"Est√° situado en la playa, y tiene tres baluartes de piedra que le defienden.

The three stone structures are prominent in the 1797 Map of Panay drawn under the direction of Don Santiago Salaverria, Teniente Coronel graduado de Batallon de Milicias de la Laguna de Bay, y Corregidor de la Provincia de Tondo (cf. Illustration). By beginning of the 1800s, the Spaniards noted that Banate profited from the benefit of its good bastions that the native residents built to defend themselves from the moro pirates. Because of this advantageous situation, in a short time, the town was developing again. The Spanish observers foresaw that soon Banate would be a notable town again. It enjoyed good ventilation and healthy climate. Though the houses were of simple construction, but the community had good defenses to protect itself against the frequent Moro incursions. People were engaged in agriculture, which constituted their main occupation. Fishing was also a very important trade because of the abundance of the harvest from Banate Bay.\\"Banate - una visita bastante considerable con su teniente de justicia, en la isla de Panay, provincia de Iloilo, di√≥cesis de Cebu, dependiente en lo civil y eclesial de Barotac Nuevo, hallase situada en la playa del mar, en la parte oriental de la isla... disfruta de buena ventilaci√≥n, y clima saludable.

Antiguamente esta visita y la de Anilao formaban un pueblo considerable que se deshizo por motivo de las frecuentes incursiones de los piratas moros. En la actualidad, a beneficio de los nuevos baluartes que sus naturales han levantado para defenderse de aquellos vuelven a tomar incremento, y es de esperar que aprovech√°ndose de su ventajosa situaci√≥n dentro de muy breves anos sera otra vez un pueblo notable.

Erection as a Town and Parish There is no extant document or act of legislation recording the date of the formal reestablishment of Banate as a municipality in the year 1843. It could be noted, however, that the town had its first duly appointed Gobernadorcillo in the person of Don Felix Baviera, in 1837. Included within the territorial jurisdiction of the town of Banate during that time were Barotac Viejo and Anilao. The original site of the Poblacion of Banate was in what is now known as Bularan. The small Church there, around which the town grew, was then situated near the shore. Nearby, towards the North, the town cemetery was located. For the market place, nipa and bamboo shacks were constructed near the area where the first Church used to be. During the later part of the 19th century the present Roman Catholic stone Church was constructed in the adjacent barangay which subsequently became the Poblacion or the capital of the town. An extant record published by the Augustinians Friars states that in the year 1845, the town had 1,464 tributaries. It was described as follows: \\"It is located by the shore, and has three stone bastions that defend it. Its climate is one of the best in the province. In addition to agriculture, the natives devote themselves to fishing, and export fish to many towns in the province; and women engage themselves in making fine fabrics from pineapple fiber. Its interim parish priest is R. P. Fray Bartolom√© Villa,O.S.A., 27 years of age and 4 years in the ministry.\\" \\"Est√° situado en la playa, y tiene tres baluartes de piedra que le defienden.

Manila: 1845, Imprenta de D. Miguel Sanchez, p. 64. Fray Villa, the interim parish priest, came to manage Banate in 1843. He was given charge of Antique in 1847, and was transferred to Manila for health reasons, in 1856.\\"Terminada su carrera literaria en Manila, pas√≥ √° Bisayas, donde regent√≥ las parroaquias de Banate y Antique en 1843 y 1847 respectivamente.\\" Elviro J.

The document can be found in the Archives of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain. Thirteen years after the first Gobernadorcillo of Banate was appointed, Governor General Antonio Blanco declared Banate as an independent parish on 5 April 1850, at the same time as that of Anilao. In his decree, the Governor General noted that Banate was already separated from Barotac Nuevo in its temporal administration, and after consulting with the various Spanish colonial authorities, including the Bishop of Cebu (who had ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the entire Visayas) and the Governor of the Region, he deemed it opportune to decree the separation of the town's spiritual care from its mother Parish of Barotac Nuevo.The text of the Decree reads: ‚ÄúInstruido espediente en el Gobierno Yntendencia de Visayas sobre separacion espiritual de las visitas de Anilao y Banate de su matres Barotac nuevo de la Provincia de Yloilo;he decretado en el con esta fecha lo que sigue.

Dio que a V.R.ma. Manila 5 Abril de 1850. Antonio M. Blanco In 1854, R. P. Fray Nicolas Calvo, O.S.A., the first full-time parish priest was assigned in Banate.Cf. Elviro J. Perez, Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 468. With his stable presence, the town's status as a pueblo was confirmed and, the following year (in 1855), Governor General Blanco's decree of 1850 was implemented, formally erecting Banate as a parish under the patronage of St. John the Baptist.Cf. Report of R. P. Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A, Parish Priest of Banate, dated 1 January 1897. The document was signed in the Parish Rectory and was later sent to the Augustinian Archives in Valladolid, Spain. After mentioning the year 1854 in the previous clause referring to the establishment of the town as parish, Fr. Arquero says: \\"... y fue erigido en parroquia bajo la advocacion de San Juan Bautista en el siguente a√±o\\". The clause \\"en el siguente a√±o\\" (the following year) indicates the establishment of the patronage in the year 1855. In that year, the elected Gobernadorcillo of Banate was Capitan Don Tomas Juanico, and the following were the other town officials: D. Alfonso Arroyo- Primer Teniente, Pablo Becenra- Segundo Teniente y Juez mayor de Ganados, Sabino Apacible- Juez mayor de Sementeras, Claudio Juanico- Juez de Policia, Fabiano Baquisal- Primer Alguacil, Tobias Bacabac- Segundo Alguacil, Luis Banbeno- Tercer Alguacil.Cf. Official local election results record for the year 1855 found in the National Archives entitled: Relacion nominal de los Gobernadorcillos y demas Ministros de Justicia que quedan en ejercicio en el a√±o coriente y el entrante de 1856 y con titulos del Superior Gobierno in Elecciones de Gobernadorcillos: Iloilo (1838‚Äì1893), p. 51. Because of the benefit of good bastions, the inhabitants benefited more and more from its advantageous internal situation. Within very short years after the resettlement of the town, Banate recovered to be a notable community with plenty of rice, sugar, tobacco, and pineapple fiber fabrics, which the women produced. The present Church of the parish was built in 1870 by R. P. Eustaqiuo Tor√©s, O.S.A.Fr. Eustaqiuo Tor√©s took the Augustinian habit in Valladolid in 1861 and professed his simple vows in 1862. He went to the Philippines in 1868 while still a deacon. He exercised his ministry in Iloilo in the curates of Banate and Baotac Nuevo in 1870 and 1882 respectively. Fr. Tor√©s constructed in these towns the Churches of stone bases and of wood. He died in Barotac Nuevo on May 4, 1888. Cf. Elviro J. Perez, Catalogo Bio- Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 535. It was made of stone and wood during the Spanish time. His successor, Fr. Manuel Santos,Fr. Manuel Santos was born in Burgos in 1853 and professed his vows in the college of Valladolid in 1870. He was parish associate in Santa Barbara in 1878 and became parish priest of Banate in 1882. He was constructing the parish rectory of Banate from 1883 until his death on June 29, 1889. Cf. Elviro J. Perez, Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 595-596. built the convent made of wood in 1883.Galente, Pedro G., O.S.A., Angels in Stone: Augustinian Churches in the Philippines, Manila: San Augustine Museum, 1996, p----After the World War II, significant renovations and repairs of the Church were made possible through the efforts of several parish priests, like Rt. Rev. Mons. Panfilo T. Brazil, H.P., J.C.D., and Rev. Fr. Quirino Palma, Jr., who succeeded to complete the roof project in 1996. The Bell tower on the right was constructed by Fr. Celda in 1975; and the bigger one on the left, by Rev. Fr. (Col.) Nicasio Lisondra (former Chief of the Philippine Army Chaplains, who became acting parish priest of Banate from 2000‚Äì2002) and by the current pastor, Fr. Winifredo H. Losaria, who also led the Banatenhons in building the present parish rectory. On 28 October 1898, during the Revolution for Philippine Independence, Banate (which remained loyal to Spain) was reduced to ashes by the rebels under the ill-mannered Juan Maraingan -Cf. R. Morales Maza, The Augustinians in Panay, Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 1987, p. 332. a leader of one of the bandit groups or \\"aggraviados\\" (boyongs, pulahanes, and tulisanes), who took advantage of the unsettled times to come down and attack the Spanish forces and unprotected towns and villages. The revolutionaries welcomed cooperation with these groups, but would later make a clear distinction between the two movements. The relationship between the Principal√≠a-led revolutionaries and the agraviados was marked by distrust and conflict. In the eyes of revolutionaries like Martin Delgado, Ananias Diocno, and Leandro Fullon, the agraviados were outcasts, religious fanatics. Towards the end of the Spanish rule, Banate had 6,285 residents. All of whom were baptized Catholics, except for 5 of the 6 Chinese residents. At that time, there were 3,145 persons paying tribute (\\"de pago\\"), and 256 or around 12.29% classified as exempted or \\"de privilegio y gratis\\" (principales).The original manuscript of the report of R.P. Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A., dated 1 January 1897, on the statistical data and historical information of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in Banate, Iloilo (Philippines). The first column of the document (Personas con Cedula Personal) identifies the number of persons paying tribute (\\"de pago\\") and the number of exempted Principales (\\"de privilegio y gratis\\"). The Spanish Friars Who Evangelized Banate The Parish Priests played important roles in the life of towns of the Philippines during the Spanish Regime. Many of them were the builders of public structures and defenses of colonial towns. Having its own parish priest added prestige to the status of a municipality during that period. Banate had its first priest in 1763. Below is the list of Spanish Augustinian Friars who served the town during the colonial era:Cf. Elviro J. Perez, Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 595-596. * R. P. Fray Alejandro Arias, O.S.A.The Archivo Hist√≥rico Hispano-Agustiniano y Boletin Oficial de la Provincia del Smo. Nombre de Jes√∫s de Filipinas of 1922 (p. 293) identifies the first name of Fr. Arias as ‚ÄúAlejandro‚Äù. However, the more detailed work of Fr. Elviro Jorde Perez, the Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, published in Manila in 1901, gives ‚ÄúMiguel‚Äù as the first name of Fr. Arias. This is also the name used by Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo in their Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas, which was published in Madrid, in 1850-1851. (1763) This religious was a native of Villarodrigo, province of Leon. He entered the convent of Valladolid in 1734, at the age of seventeen. He was a missionary of the Italones in 1740, and Minister of P√≥rac (1744), Magalan and Tarlac (1747), S. Miguel de Mayumo (1747), S. Jos√© de los Montes (1750), Anilao (1759), and Guimb√°l with Banate (1763). He was captured by the Moros in 1764, in the port of Tayabas, and was killed by them.\\"ARIAS (Fray Miguel).

On 4 March 1836, he was given the Royal Mandate by Queen Isabela II, together with 23 other Augustinian missionaries, to evangelize in the Philippines. He was 21 years old upon receipt of the mission order, and was still a theologian in the Order of sub-deacons.Isacio Rodriguez Rodriguez, OSA, Historia de la Provincia Agustiniana del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas, Manila: 1980, p. 195. Fray Villa arrived in the Philippine Islands in November 1836. After finishing his studies in Manila, he went to Visayas, where he held the parishes of Banate and Antique in 1843 and 1847 respectively. In 1856, he came to Manila and, taking sick leave in the town of Gap√°n, died on May 2 in the same year (1856).\\"VILLA, (Fr. Bartolom√©).

An extant document of the Report made by Fray Lope regarding the description of the Parish and its people, as well as describing the Church properties in Banate, exists in the custody of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain.The Report says: Brief report about the parish of Banate (Philippines) The undersigned Fr. Agapito Lope, Augustinian, who was parish priest of the town of Banate, Province of Yloilo (Philippines) at the time of the Spanish Government declares the following: 1Àö That time in this town of Banate, there was a parochial church of strong materials up to the tower, with zinc and galvanized iron cover; it had three naves with a transept and three altars. It had lands that could serve as an orchard and, in fact, a part of these was used for vegetables and for forage during the time when this writer held the honor of governing the said parish. They did not have any fence. These lands covered an extension of some two hundred meters long by a hundred and twenty wide, from the beach following a drain and outlet next to the house of Do√±a Vicenta Baban and crossing the royal road until behind the church. The aforementioned parish house held a dozen molave harigues of extraordinary magnitude of eighty centimeters in diameter; the zinc cover. Up to the year one thousand eight hundred ninety and nine, there was a parish house by the beach made of strong materials (up to the upper floor) and wood, with Nipa roof. From this house the harigues or pillars were taken to raise the new parish house. 2Àö There was no chapel in the neighborhoods. 3Àö There was a fenced cemetery with a short wall about five hundred meters distant from the housing of the Poblacion, on the road that leads to the mountain near the hill called Cambang-bat√≥. 4Àö That time, the church had no other known assets than those mentioned above. 5) There was above all (I say in order to inform if asked about the truth), the distinguished residents of the said town: Don Eugenio Badilla, Do√±a Carmen Baban, Don Marcelo (La) Madrid, Don F. Villaluz, Do√±a Nicolasa Badilla, Do√±a Apolonia Baban. And in truth I sign in Cornago, on August 4, 1911. Fr. Agapito Lope The document, which was written and signed in Cornago, La Rioja (the hometown of the Spanish Friar) is dated 4 August 1911.Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 1. Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 2. At the end of the document, Fray Lope mentions the \\"vecinos distinguidos\\"In the context of the colonial rule in municipalities of the Spanish Empire, the phrase \\"vecinos distinguidos\\" were attributed to residents to whom the honorific address \\"Don\\" and Do√±a were strictly limited. In the colonial Philippine context, this phrase refers to the Principal√≠a. The authors Schr√∂ter and B√ºschges say: \\"Tambi√©n en este sector, el uso de las palabras do√±a y don se limito estrechamente a vecinas y vecinos distinguidos.\\" Benem√©ritos, arist√≥cratas y empresarios: Identidades y estructuras sociales de las capas altas urbanas en Am√©rica hisp√°nica, BERND SCHR√ñTER and CHRISTIAN B√úSCHGES, eds., Acta Coloniensia: Estudios Ib√©ricos y Latinoamericanos, no. 4.

(distinguished residents) of the Banate: Don Eugenio Badilla, Do√±a Carmen Baban, Don Marcelo (La)Madrid, Don (Florencio) Villaluz, Do√±a Nicolasa Badilla, and Do√±a Apolonia Baban.The presence of the document indicates that Fray Lope was still alive in 1911, and was still in good health 18 years after his mandate in Banate, as manifested by his hand-writing and signature. However, as regards his memory of the names of distinguished town residents, the Report shows that he was beginning to forget certain details of information: He wrote the surname of Don Marcelo Madrid as \\"Lamadrid\\". He also forgot the first name of Don Florencio Villaluz, simply writing \\"D. F. Villaluz\\". Both persons were, together with Don Eugenio Badilla (also mentioned by the Friar), among the town's officials, when order was restored after the Filipino-American War in 1901.

Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A. (1893) He was born in the town of Oca√±a, province of Toledo, on August 20, 1864. He was professed in Valladolid in 1880, and was ordained a priest in the following year upon his arrival in the Philippine Archipelago. He was parish priest of Due√±as in 1889, and of Banate from 1893 to 1898. Afterwards he served as professor of the Seminary of Manaus, of the State and Diocese of Amazons (Brazil).\\"ARQUERO (Fr.

His name is cast on the largest bell of Banate. Fray Arquero is also known for the manuscript he redacted on 1 January 1897, regarding the statistical data and historical information of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in Banate, Iloilo (Philippines)at the later part of the Spanish rule. The document can be found in the Archives of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain.Fray Bernardo Arquero Manuscript 1897. =Banate during the American Regime= Ludovico Arroyo Ba√±as, (standing in the middle) with his staff at the Office of the Telecommunications Bureau, Region IV, in Iloilo City, c. late 1950s. When the Americans seized control of Panay at the later part of 1899, Banate was among the first settlements they bombarded and chosen as landing spot for their forces. On October 27, 1899, General Diocno informed General Delgado of the docking at Iloilo of the USS Concord. On board were 3,000 troops and 200 horses. On November 2, two American gunboats bombarded the town of Banate. On the 5th, American forces began their advance outside the frontlines toward San Miguel. Landings were made in Banate on November 25, in Capiz and Calivo in December, and in San Jose de Buenavista in January 1900. Unable to resist the American advance, the Filipino revolutionaries retreated to the mountains of Panay. Delgado retreated to the mountains of Lambunao, Diocno to the hills of Aclan, and Fullon to the vicinity of Mt. Madia-as. By July 1, 1900, the Panay defenders had opted to shift to guerrilla tactics.Folio 886/11, Francisco Jalandoni describes formation of the guerrilla bands in Iloilo Province, July 1, 1900, Selected Documents, Philippine Revolutionary Records (PRR), National Library.Cf. Jose Manuel Velmonte, Ethnicity and the Revolution in Panay in Kasarinlan, Volume 14 No. 1. The author is an Associate Researcher at the UP-Center for Integrative and Development Studies. By the beginning of 1901, the disenchanted revolutionaries had run out of men, ammunition, and food. In February, Delgado surrendered to the Americans. On March 1, Fullon followed suit, and on March 21, Diocno signed the Paz de Aclan. Colonel Salas continued the fight until October. When the American rule was established, the town's population was 6,250 (2973 males and 3277 females).Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States, Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 587. When the Revolution broke out in 1898, Ciriaco Fuentes, more popularly known as Capitan Takong, was the Gobernadorcillo. He was succeeded by Don Eugenio Badilla as the first local President shortly after the town became part of the United States territory in 1901, upon the arrival and takeover of the American soldiers under the command of Commander Brunnel, who established the American rule in Banate. The town's first officials under the American Regime were the following:Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States, Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 130. *Don Eugenio Badilla, President *Don Marcelo Madrid *Don Florencio Villaluz *Don Ciriaco Fuentes *Don Fortunato Perez *Don Nemesic Badilla N.

From 1 October 1901, an American teacher was also stationed in Banate.Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States, Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 514. During this American, Barotac Viejo and Anilao were reduced as districts under Banate. The Administrative Act No. 2657 of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, dated 31 December 1916, shows Banate as one of the 24 Municipalities in Iloilo,The Province of Iloilo consists of territory on the southeastern part of the Island of Panay and includes the Island of Guimaras and other adjacent islands. It comprises the following municipalities: Arevalo, Balasan, Banate, Barotac Nuevo, Buenavista, Cabatuan, Dingle, Due√±as, Dumangas, Guimbal, Iloilo (the capital of the province), Janiuay, Jaro, Lambunao, Leon, Miagao, Oton, Passi, Pototan, San Joaquin, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Sara, and Tigbauan. Administrative Act No. 2657, dated 31 December 1916 and of the five towns belonging to the Fifth District of the Province.Iloilo: First district ‚Äì Composed of the municipalities of Guimbal, Miagao, Oton, San Joaquin, and Tigbauan. Second district ‚Äì Composed of the municipalities of Arevalo, Buenavista, Iloilo, and Jaro. Third district ‚Äì Composed of the municipalities of Cabatuan, Leon, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara. Fourth district ‚Äì Composed of the municipalities of Barotac Nuevo, Dumangas, Dingle, Janiuay, Lambunao, and Pototan. Fifth district ‚Äì Composed of the municipalities of Balasan, Banate, Due√±as, Passi, and Sara. Administrative Act No. 2657, dated 31 December 1916 On 1 January 1918, Barotac Viejo was separated through the Executive Order No. 84 of the American Governor General. On that occasion, the majority of the town Officials of Banate were Barotacnons. As a consequence, there came about a succession of appointed Presidents in Banate, until the time of the next election.This section was transferred from what was before the introductory part for the section about the Presidents of Banate during the American Regime. During the term of Benjamin Buyco as President of the town (1936‚Äì1939), Anilao was separated from Banate. Afterwards, Benjamin Buyco also became the first Mayor of Anilao. During this period, a Banatenhon - Ludovico Arroyo Ba√±as - was chosen as one of the ten personnel of the American government telegraph service in the Philippines to compose the first and only group of Filipino pensionados who, in 1919, underwent advanced training in wireless telegraphy (radio), at the US Naval Radio School in Cavite. The training of the ten Filipinos was made possible through a special arrangement between the U. S. Naval Authorities in the Philippines and the Insular Government. To select the trainees, a special examination was conducted among the 398 students of the Post-Telegraph School.Telecom Standout in The Telecom News, Philippines: 31 March 1959, p.2.Policarpio Y. Cuanico, Ba√±as in Personality Section, The Telecom News, Philippines: 31 March 1959, p.missing. Later, Ba√±as (who is one of the prominent figures in the history of Philippine Telecommunications) became the Regional Superintendent of the Bureau of Telecommunications (BUTEL) in Region IV (Panay, Negros, Romblon, and Palawan), at the time of his retirement, on 16 February 1966.Telecom Standout in The Telecom News, Philippines: 31 March 1959, p.2.Policarpio Y. Cuanico, Ba√±as in Personality Section, The Telecom News, Philippines: 31 March 1959, p.missing. Demographics In the , the population of Banate, Iloilo, was people, with a density of . The 1995 National Census on Population and Housing shows that Banate had a total population of 24,976 excluding those residing in Fuentes (a contested barangay between Banate and Anilao). However, if Fuentes is included, the total population would be 25,597. Banate has average annual population growth rate of 1.21% based on the population change within the years 1990‚Äì1995. In the year 2010, the town's population reached 29,543. = The Natives of Banate = Sunrise at Banate Bay As any other old Spanish town in the province of Iloilo, the natives of Banate were given surnames starting usually with the letter BA, BAL, BAS, etc. after the name of the town itself. This is also true for Barotac Viejo which was once a part of the pueblo which is why one can notice even up to the present that both towns share some families/clans with the same surnames. = Municipal income = Being a very versatile town with livelihood income both coming from the sea and the farmlands, Banate has generated actual income from calendar year 1995 to calendar year 1999 reaching up to P82,167,999.30. The increase of the town's income was mainly due to the increase in revenue allotment, tax, and operating revenue of the municipality. It could be observed that Banate is increasingly growing in commerce and industry. = Household = Barangay Carmelo, Banate The 1995 Census of Population and Housing (which includes Fuentes) recorded a total of 4,761 households with an average household size of 6 person per household for the urban area, and 5 persons per household for the rural area. The urban area, comprising Poblacion, Alacaygan, Bularan, Carmelo, Talokgangan and Zona Sur, had a total household of 1,653. The 12 rural barangays had a total of 2,908 households with San Salvador having the highest number households (480). The 12 barangays belonging to the rural area had a population of 15,772 or about 62% of the total population of Banate. Of the 12 barangays, San Salvador had the highest population (2,380 or 9.31%), while Fuentes, (a disputed barangay between Banate and Anilao) had the least population of only 621 persons or 4% of the rural population, since some residents considered themselves residents of Anilao. = Population density = Banate has an A & D area of 5,240.849 and a population of 25,597 as of 1995. The municipal gross density is 500 people/km¬≤. Urban density is 1600 people/km¬≤, of which Bularan is the highest having a density of 15,700 people/km¬≤. In the rural area, population density is 300 people/km¬≤. As projected, within the twelve (12) year period (1999‚Äì2010), the municipal gross population density will increase from 500 to 600 people/km¬≤. = Age-sex distribution = Of the 25,597 (as of 1995), the male population has numbered 12,949 or 50.59% with those in the age bracket of 5 ‚Äì 9 years old having the highest population (1,743 or 13%). The age bracket with the lowest percentage are those with the age ranging from 85 years old and above (30 or 0.23%).On the other hand, female population has reached to 12,648 or 49.41% with those in the age range of 5 ‚Äì 9 years old having the highest number (1,649 or 13%). The female residents with age range of 85 and above number 48 or 0.38%. The date of the census of 1995 shows that the ratio of male and female residents is 102:100. = Religion = Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary is popular among the Roman Catholics who compose the majority of the residents in Banate, as well as among the members of the Aglipayan denomination, which has a considerable number of followers in the town. Based on the 1990 record, the majority of the Banatenhon's are Roman Catholics (16,338 or 70%); the next religious denomination with the second highest number of adherence are the Aglipayans or the members of the Philippine Independent Church (5,057 or 22%); there are 750 Protestants who comprise 3% of the population; Iglesia ni Kristo has 203 churchgoers or 1% of the population; and members of other religious sects like United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, Muslims, etc. number 1,012 or 4% of the local population. = Statistics on marriage = A greater percentage of the population 10 years old and over are single (49.32%) than married (45.75%). About 3.73% are widowed; 0.37% are separated; and 0.82% are common law partners and unknown. The number of unmarried persons is higher among the adult males (4,840) as compared with those who are married (4,174). Among adult females the proportion of married persons is higher (4,253 or 23.09%) than those who are unmarried (4,245 or 23.05%). = Language = Majority of the people living in Banate speak Hiligaynon or 99.54% and 0.46% of the population speaks other Visayan dialects. English and Tagalog are also understood and spoken, and are also used in school, business, and government day to day transactions. It is notable that when Banatenhons speak Hiligaynon, people from other places could easily distinguish the accent, most of the time dismissing the Banatenhons as Dumangasanons. Among the towns in the surrounding area, only Banate and Dumangas speak pure Hiligaynon, as opposed to other towns whose native tongue is Kinaray-a. = Economic dependency ratio = As of 1995, a total of 10,711 persons with ages below 15 and over 64 years old are considered dependents; 14,625 belong to the working population with ages 15‚Äì65 years old. Hence, there are 7 dependents out of 10 working persons. = Labor force = As of 1990 the labor force numbered 13,643 persons or 57% of the total population. Of these, there are 6,747 or 49.45% male and 6,896 or 50.55% female ranging the age 15 years old and above. Of the 13,643, 7,886 have stable employment. 5,239 of these are male and 2,647 are female. Population projection shows that from 1995 to the year 2010, the population growth rate is 1.21%. This means an additional potential work force for the municipality, which when properly exploited will generate a maximum income to the town of Banate. The labor force within the twelve (12) year period (1999‚Äì2010) will reach to 18,683 and 11,527 of these, will be economically active labor force (15 years old and over). Historical landmarks =Landmarks during the Colonial Period= Three Stone Bastions located at the shore that defended the town of Banate, from marauding Muslims of Mindanao. Municipal Hall made of wood. Parochial Church made of strong materials up to the tower, with zinc and galvanized steel roof.

School made of (bamboo) cane. Parochial House made of chosen woods. The aforementioned parish house was supported by a dozen molave harigues of extraordinary enormity of eighty centimeters in diameter. It had zinc roof. Until the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety and nine, there was another parish house that existed next to the beach. That, too, was made of strong materials until the upper floor, and the roof was made of wood with covered of nipa. From this house the harigues or pillars were removed to build the new parochial house.\\"Tenia una casa parroquial nueva de maderas escogidas.

The Catholic community was established in Banate by the friars of the Augustinian Order in 1763, when Fray Alejandro Arias was assigned to in the town.Cf. Elviro Jorde Perez, Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 262. The present church was erected under the supervision of Fray Eustaqio Tor√©s, OSA in 1870. But was left unfinished when Fray Tor√©s was transferred to Barotac Nuevo, where he also built another church.Cf. Elviro Jorde Perez, Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas, Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 535. This probably explains why there is no particular architectural style found in the edifice. Nevertheless, the church of Banate withstood the tests of time, from fires to the bombings of the war. Built in the shape of a Latin cross, it is one of the old churches in Iloilo, still intact and whole from the narthex to the apse and transepts unlike some churches which were either cut into half or damaged either by nature or war. It is made of corals, limestone and rocks and put together through a mixture of Apog and Eggs. The first detailed description of the church building can be found in the 1911 Report of Fray Agapito Lope, parish priest of Banate in 1893. It is also one of the widest, in terms of space, having three spacious naves all in all surpassing even that of Santa Barbara or Lambunao.Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 1.Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 2. The last Augustinian curate of Banate, Fray Bernardo Arquero, OSA, commissioned the three bells donated by Do√±a Carmen Baban and cast by the renowned bell-caster Hilario Sunico. The campana mayor is one of the largest in the island but it is, unfortunately, broken. It is the last existing old Augustinian-built church in the north. It was built under forced-labor. The parish also boasts of having the complete old baptismal, marriage and death records dating back to the early 1900s which can be found in the parish office. Parish and Assistant Priests who served the Parish of Banate from 19-present (records from 17631898, 18991909, 194144 [World War II Era] are perhaps gone already). After the revolution against Spain, the parishes under the friar orders, Banate being one (under the Augustinians), were handed over to the care of the secular clergy of the dioceses. The following are the names of the priests who had performed their ministry in Banate, as retrieved in the parish register of baptisms:Cf.

The Dolorosa is one of the centuries-old cultural patrimony icons of Banate, seen only during the Good Friday procession. The Christian faithful waiting their turn to venerate the Santo Entierro after the Good Friday Procession. Duaw, as it is commonly known in Banate, is one of the customs of Banatenhons during the Semana Santa Celebration. =San Juan Fiesta= Every year, since 1855, the town of Banate celebrates the feast of its Patron St. John the Baptist, on the 24th of June.Cf. Report of R.P. Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A., dated 1 January 1897, on the statistical data and historical information of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in Banate, Iloilo (Philippines). The document can be found in the Archives of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain. The \\"Diana,\\" a marching band, wakes the townsfolk early in the morning so as to signal opening of the fiesta. Masses are held, in both Roman Catholic and Aglipayan Churches after which, devotees' carry in procession a decorated carroza containing the statue of the Patron saint through the main streets of the town. The townspeople cook typical delicious dishes for the guests to eat and, later in the afternoon, children as well as teenagers go to the plaza to enjoy the fun at the \\"peryahan\\". People would throw water to everyone roaming in the streets, as part of the celebration. In the evening, a \\"search\\" for Miss Banate is held in the municipal covered gymnasium, where the crowd would pack in the gym, in order to cheer for their respective candidates.Search for Miss Banate, Banate Town Fiesta 2015. YouTube. Published on 30 June 2015. Retrieved 5 January 2017. =Semana Santa Celebration= Banate has, for centuries, also observed the Holy Week celebration in the traditional Catholic custom. The town boasts of antique ivory religious images, which are only seen displayed during the Easter Triduum celebrations and processions. Both the Roman Catholic and the Aglipayan Communities in this town have preserved the Western and Catholic way of making the memory of the passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ alive through the heritage received from the Spaniards, who evangelized the town for centuries. The meditation on the seven last words of Jesus and the re-enactment of his last moments on calvary attract devotees from neighboring towns on Good Fridays.Banate Holy Week Procession. =Kasag Festival= For over 17 years in the making, Kasag festival came as an offshoot of the Annual Street Dancing Competition as highlight of the Annual Town Fiesta, and the promotion of the town's famed product, the Blue Crabs (scientific name: Portunus Pelagicus which translates to ‚Äúsavory beautiful swimmer‚Äù), through as the Municipality's One Town One Product (OTOP) project. The idea of Kasag Festival as vessel of promotion and marketing of the town product sprung from the OTOP Coordinator during the OTOP presentation at Passi City, Previous Street Dancing Competitions were held every 24th day of June, as one of the highlights of the final day of the Annual Town Fiesta honoring and thanking God through the intercession of St. John the Baptist for the fruitful year spent. However, the activities meant at integrating Kasag Festival with the Feast of St. John the Baptist proved to be such a tedious endeavor for Banatenhons, requiring much of their time and effort. Most often, this results to distractions, if not deviations, from the original essence and spirit of the religious fiesta which is about the devotion to St. John the Baptist and thanksgiving to the Almighty God. With the implementation of the DTI's One Town One Product (OTOP), Banate identified Kasag (Blue Crab) as the prevalent and flourishing fishery based industry thus making it Banate's OTOP. Promoting the new product and incorporating the product with the festival was conceptualized by the people in charge of OTOP. With positive response from the Local Chief Executive, all systems go for the First Kasag Festival Celebration; with \\"young blood\\" from the newly elected public officials and the desire to promote Banate's One Town One Product as well as Banate's Tourism Development the First Kasag Festival came into celebration in December 2007. Food Courts of various mouth-watering and native delicacies were there to give justice to the ever-craving and discriminating taste of Ilonggos. A nightly Singing contest to entertain and showcase the singing prowess of Banatenhons was staged. Daily entertaining activities like Laro ng Lahi (old Filipino games), Basketball Tournament and search for Mutya sang Kasag were organized topped by the eagerly anticipated all new Street Dancing Competition based on the idea of Kasag's preservation for future generation and Kasag's nature and thanksgiving to the bountiful season of fishing. Participation in Other Festivals Selected Kasag performers regularly compete in other festivals. Banate is represented by Tribu Kasag in the Kasadyahan portion of the Dinagyang Festival every January in Iloilo City. The Kasag festival also competes in the Aliwan Fiesta held every April in Metro Manila. Both Tribu Kasag and the Kasag Festival have won several awards, including the Kasadyahan championship trophy in 2009 and 2010, and the second runner-up trophy at the Aliwan Fiesta in 2010. Nota Bene: History of \\"Tribu Kasag\\" and its antecedent Tribes. Since 1987, Banate has participated the well-known Kasadyahan Festival which takes place before the Iloilo City's Dinagyang Festival. Tribu Kasway has represented the town from the year 1987 to 1993. After then, from 1995 to 1999, the town changed the group's name to Tribu Hugyaw. They won 2nd Place in 1999. Tribu Panagat, the newly adapted name, was Kasadyan Festival's winning groups in the year 2000. It continued to represent the town of Banate until 2003. From 2004 to 2005, the name \\"Tribu Hugyaw\\" was re-adapted by the group. Later and until the present, \\"Tribu Kasag\\" represents Banate at the Dinagyang Festival as well as at other festivals in the Province of Iloilo and national competitions of the same kind. This current \\"cultural ambassadors of Banate\\" are known for their merry and lively dance which depicts the townpeople's livelihood as fishermen, and the town's famed product: \\"Kasag\\" or crab(s).Kasag Festival 2015.

Annual AD3 Karera de Paraw & Pinta Layag Competition A mixture of art, entertainment and skills enhancement: that is Banate's Karera de Paraw. Held every Easter Sunday of the year, the Karera de Paraw is a sailboat racing competition participated by Banatenhon fisher folks. It is a four-day activity, which includes the Pinta Layag (sail painting competition involving the out of school youths), Mutya sang Paraw (a beauty pageant competition), Rakustik (an acoustical jam competition), and capped by the Karera de Paraw on the fourth and final day. It aims to help boost Banate tourism together with Kasag Festival, to encourage the artistic ability of Banatenhon youth through the sail painting competition, and to give a good and fun-filled break for the fisherfolks while aiming to bag home prizes. Originally conceived and financed by Alfonso \\"Nonong\\" Delicana III, the Annual AD3 Karera de Paraw & Pinta Layag competition is now on its 4th year. However, the expanding scope and number of activities of the event encourage at this point the involvement and participation also of supporters in and outside Banate. Organizers would now welcome donations for the activities of the coming year.Karera de Paraw & Pinta Layag Competition, Banate.

History During the decade of the Spanish regime, many Filipinos who fled from the Spanish atrocities retreated to remote places to hide. Particular places worthy of note were the hillsides of Quinangyana (along its creek), Maldespina and Kinalyan. In order for the people to survive, they made farms using the kaingin system and hunted animals for food. Two settlements were established: one in Maldespina (now Bingawan Cemetery) and the other on the hilltop at Kinalyan near Quinangyana. When the revolution broke out in 1896, some Filipinos from Calinog, Dumalag, and Tapaz fled to the aforementioned places. In 1900, a big group of evacuees from Calinog arrived and joined those who were hiding. They escaped from the fury of the American soldiers who avenged the death of their fellow soldiers massacred by Filipinos. A year after, some returned to Calinog but others opted to stay and made farms. The two settlements wanted to unite and establish a community. So, the settlers led by Gregorio Plaga, known as ‚ÄúPakuribot‚Äù an instrumental leader, surveyed the hilltops. A plateau in the southern part was chosen because of the presence of the number of springs. In 1901, the community known as ‚ÄúBINGAWAN‚Äù was established. The name Bingawan was derived from the creek which resembled a missing tooth (the term ‚ÄúBINGAW‚Äù used in the local dialect). This said creek is located west of the present site of Bingawan Central School. The early residents constructed a long building made of light materials. It accommodated forty families. They called it ‚ÄúPagnahi-an‚Äù because the partition was made from materials sewed together. The building was located at the roadside east of where the Bingawan Baptist Church stands. This new community was in need of capable leaders. So, twelve were chosen from the forty families (the twelve leaders represented the twelve apostles of the Lord). Those leaders were called by the early residents as ‚ÄúFounders of Bingawan‚Äù. The twelve leaders were Martin Celeste, Eusebio Plaga, Condrado Castroverde, Paulino Celestial, Andres Paren, Gregorio (Goyo) Plaga, Eugeni Celestial, Pablo Celebria, Eulogio Pormilda, Enrique Caspillo, Feliciano Gigare and Atanacio Gener. The council of elders had two consultants, they were Gregorio (Pakuribot) Plaga and Gregorio Lampe√±o (a rebel leader form Janiuay). According to the early residents, these two elders were the most illustrious among them all and were ascribed with high respect. Lampe√±o was believed to have possessed supernatural powers, had a talisman and can beat his enemies very easily. They were accompanied by a brave man known as ‚ÄúManding Beni‚Äù. With the founding of Barrio Bingawan in 1901, was also the establishment of the Bingawan Baptist Church. The early residents were disgusted with the Spaniards because of their tyranny and religious hypocrisy. The people responded to the preaching of the Gospel by the Protestant preachers and they gladly embraced the evangelical faith. Amando Zamora, an ex-soldier from Luzon who trained under the American missionaries, was brought to Bingawan by Gregorio Lampe√±o and became the first Pastor of the church. Later, Charles Briggs, an American missionary and Don Braulio Manikan, the first Filipino preacher who was converted in Spain by Dr. Eric Lund, came to Bingawan and baptized the early converts. The church building was not only used for religious services but also as a school house. Amando Zamora was both a pastor and an educator of the early residents. In 1904, a group of notable families from Santa Teresa, Dumalag, Capiz came and settled in Bingawan. The heads of these respectable families were Isidro Faldas, Clemente Ferasol and Alejandro Pamocol. These men were fine leaders. They contributed a lot to the development of the Barrio. There was a need for the maintenance of peace and order in this newly established community. Hence, in 1905, two elders namely Condrado Castroverde and Eulogio Pormilda were appointed as the first policemen of the place. They were later replaced by Bernabe Pagara and Felipe Porado as members of the council of elders. In the Summer of 1906, a great fire swept over the progressive community which resulted to the great loss of properties and stored gains. Several months after the said fire, a great famine occurred. However, Mateo Casalmer, then barrio lieutenant, challenged the people to reconstruct their house and the church building. ‚Äú In a short period of time, houses sprang up like mushrooms and the church building stood up like magic‚Äù, an old resident once said after the call for cooperation was declared. All of those things were made possible due to the unparalleled cooperation and unity of the people. In August 1912, an energetic and intelligent leader came in the person of Rev. Antonio D. Plagata. He was educated in one the public schools in the City of Iloilo and later at the Jaro Industrial School now known as the Central Philippine University. He led the church and the school. He started the English instructions at school and it had made the school progress tremendously as years went by. The school was named Bingawan Institute in 1924. The classes in the High School Department were taught by Severo Catedral, Tranquilino Bergante and Delfin Dianala. Rev. Antonio Plagata was not only a pastor and a teacher but also a statesman. He was one of the Municipal Councilors of Passi, where Calinog, the mother municipality of Bingawan, was still a barrio. He and three other men from Calinog endeavored to make Calinog an independent municipality from Passi: Vicente Castronuevo, Francisco Casa and Eugenio Carbon. As a result, in 1926, Calinog became an independent municipality. Plagata served as Municipal Councilor of Calinog until World War II. Other residents from Bingawan who served in the Municipality of Calinog were Javier Celo and Macario Celestial. In 1929, the first public school in Bingawan was opened. This was made possible through the efforts of the following: Vidal Derecho, Florentino Faldas, Tranquilino Sorioso, Nicanor Cerbas, Fulgencio Catoera, Antonio Plagata, Rufino Pormilos, Esperidion Landero, Daniel Geretape, Jorge Lorca, Vicente Gallaza, Primo Catoera, Francisco Vargas, Leon Landero, Felix Sagotoy, Paulino Celestial, Casimiro Pagara, Antonio catolico, Valeriano Derecho and Condrado Castroverde. The school site was donated by Spouses Eusebio Palma and Maxima Celo Palma. After World War II, a complete elementary school was opened. The enrolment rapidly increased which resulted to the opening of the Bingawan High School in July 1966. Through the untiring efforts of Mrs. Sofia Paren and Mrs. Marcelina S. Castronuevo, both public school teachers of Bingawan Elementary School, the school was able to obtain 84 enrollees which comprised the first year high school class with two sections, thus meeting the requirements for the opening of a Barangay High School. The first two high school instructors assigned were Mrs. Myrna S. Jamili and Miss Nicolasa Quilarto. Through their sacrifices and the cooperation of the people of the Municipality, the school expanded and in July 1984, it was converted into a National High School which was then named as the Bingawan National High School. The papers and documents needed for such an upgrade were prepared and facilitated by Mr. Bonifacio Castronuevo, Sr. who was a high school teacher from Calinog. The processing of the papers was also undertaken by Dr. Victor S. Castronuevo and was approved by the Board through the help of Board Member Esperidion Jagunap, who was known as the ‚ÄúFather of the Barangay High School‚Äù. The Improvement of the community started in 1952, through the efforts of Victor C. Plagata, an elected councilor of Calinog. He paved the streets, improved the plaza and encouraged community beautification. Gradually, the residents built bigger houses. A public market was later constructed to cater to the needs of the people. This made marketing easier of the public. More improvements were made when Victor Plagata was elected Vice Mayor of Calinog in 1955. After a lapse of ten years, another Bingawan resident was elected Municipal Councilor in the person of Dr. Victor S. Castronuevo. His victory in 1967 elections added a name for Bingawan. The restless spirits of Victor S. Plagata and Consolador Faldas made possible the realization of the great dream of Bingawan to become an independent municipality. A bill was later passed that was authored by Congressman Ricardo Y. Ladrido, which later became R.A. 5511, to create Bingawan as a Municipality of the Province of Iloilo. The bill was approved by the Congress in May 1969. Bingawan became a new Municipality, independent from Calinog, its mother Municipality. On April 10, 1970, the first set of municipal officials were appointed led by Victor C. Plagata as Municipal Mayor and Concolador Faldas as Vice Mayor. The Municipal Councilors were Sulpicio Castronuevo, Ildelfonso Caras, Santos Laygan, Bernardo Girao, Aurelio Gargoles and Alepio Castillanes. Judge Lodrigio Lebaquin administered their Oath of Office. Under the leadership of Mayor Plagata, roads and streets were constructed connecting Bingawan to adjacent Municipalities. Barangay roads were also constructed to connect the barangays to Poblacion. School buildings and other development structures were constructed changing Bingawan into a nicer and better place to live in. On February 22, 1986, the EDSA revolution took place. Vice Mayor Consolador Faldas replaced incumbent Mayor Plagata on June 23, 1986. He then served as the OIC Mayor until November 30, 1987. On December 1, 1987, Victor C.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The town got its name from the Kinaray-a word \\"kalinong\\" which means calm or placid. But some might say it is from \\"linog\\" or an earthquake given the fact that the town lies near the West Panay Fault. History Calinog, which according to legend Datu Marikudo chose to settle, is strategically located in the central part of the Island of Panay. Calinog was already a developing community when the Spaniards came between the 16th and the 17th Century. In the early 18th Century, Calinog was established as a permanent settlement following the system of town planning as prescribed by the Law of the Indies: a town plaza surrounded by the church, Municipal Tribunal, school and public market. This remains as the main town- planning feature of the poblacion until the present. The Spanish Colonial Government then declared Calinog as ‚ÄúPueblo‚Äù or town in 1763. A new colonial power, the Americans introduced important changes in the civil affairs of the municipality in the early 1900s. The most significant was annexing Calinog as part of the Municipality of Passi (now a component city of Iloilo) from 1904 to 1920. Through intense lobbying by prominent leaders, Calinog was restored to its original status as a separate Municipality in January 1921. It was in the late 1960s when Calinog stepped on the springboard of development as a progressive Municipality bustling with business and economic opportunities. In 1969, with the sugar industry boom, the political leadership decided to split a portion of the town into a separate municipality, the Municipality of Bingawan. Among the founders of the old communities in the uplands were the descendants of the families who fought the abusive Spanish colonizers in the settlements of Bugasong and Lawaan, Province of Antique, in the 16th Century (their colorful folklore and the oral tradition of their historical journeys became a part of the timeless epic, ‚ÄúHinilawod‚Äù). Mt. Dila Dila in Barangay Alibunan is best remembered as a strong hold of Filipino guerillas and soldiers during World War II under the command of a Calinognon Major Julian C. Chaves where the fiercest battles in the annals of war in the Island of Panay were fought against the Japanese Imperial Army.

People make effort to perform colorful cultural dances and other festive commemorative rites in His honor. The festival has given life in their faith and has become a growing devotion in their hearts. The dances performed are usually thought to be simple dances composed of repetitive, easy-to-learn steps. However the presentation becomes highly complex with the incorporation of a Sugidanon--- traditional stories on a town's history and culture narrated through chanting. It is used to highlight the dances in order to heighten the dramatic or comic effect of the presentation. As a whole, the festival functions to create or promote a sense of community as it continues to make the community feel part of a provincial or regional group to help them establish ties with their heritage.

The airport can be reached either from the Cabatuan access roads (Barangay Tabucan and Barangay Tiring, Cabatuan) or from the Pavia-Santa Barbara-Cabatuan (Barangay Duyan-Duyan, Cabatuan) access road. History Towns people believed that Cabatuan could have gotten its name from three words in the local dialect describing certain facets of prehistoric Cabatuan. The name might have evolved from (1) CaBatuan which means a large area of rocks (2) Batuan which means to fight, defy, or oppose, and (3) Batu-an an sour-fruit-bearing evergreen tree that grew abundantly in the region. Another theory, however, suggests that the name was derived from \\"naga-batu\\" (fighting or opposing) which is used to describe a creek in the town that flowed from east to west opposite to that of the usual flows of the rivers in the region.The Official Webpage of the Municipality of Cabatuan - http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=12&Itemid;=41 The town of Cabatuan was first noted for the \\"Sinulugans\\" or hillside tribesmen who annually practice the art of ‚ÄúSinulog‚Äù or Dance of Death characterized by sword fighting rituals. \\"Tulisanes\\" and Rustlers also inhabit the place before the Spaniards came in 1732.Cabatuan Roman Catholic Church (History of Cabatuan) - http://www.freewebs.com/cabatuanchurch/cabatuanchurch.htm The town was founded on April 9, 1732 after a molave cross (with only its base currently existing) was planted on the peak of Pamul-ogan Hill. It was originally planned by Tono whose statue now stands in front of the Municipal Building. He was then a town leader together with two other leaders Gomoc and Amihan. This early settlement was then flourishing on a level zone of land near the northern bank of the Tigum River where the poblacion or the commercial center of the town is now located. In 1733, Cabatuan was officially organized upon the installation of Rev. Fr. Antonio Lopez as its first priest and Tono as its first ‚Äúgobernadorcillo‚Äù. Furthermore, the town was placed by the priest under the spiritual protection of Saint Nicholas de Tolentino whom Cabatuananons venerate as their Patron Saint whose feast is celebrated from September 1‚Äì10 every year through a 10-day celebration that is grandiosely culminated on September 10 by the highly anticipated Tinuom Festival patterned from Iloilo's Kasadyahan Festival. In 1903, after the census had been taken, the neighbouring town of Maasin, with a population of 8401, was temporarily annexed to Cabatuan that had a population of 16,497. During the Second World War, Cabatuan officially became the last defense of Western Visayas against the Japanese forces which led to the destruction of most of its edifices.

The gigantic Church is the only existing church in Iloilo which has three fa√ßades. Its twin belfries capped with cream-colored domes are considered to be one of the best in the Philippines. The church was given the title \\"Model of Temples\\" since it was the best representation of European architecture on the Philippine islands during the Spanish era. In 1948, the church was partially damaged by an earthquake which ruined four of its belfries, two of its fa√ßade pediments and the central dome. In the early 1990s the church was restored back to its present grandeur. Today, 'La Iglesia de San Nicolas de Tolentino' is one of the most picturesque churches in Asia. =Cabatuan Cemetery= This century old Spanish-Filipino Cemetery is the only cemetery in the Philippines which is a perfect square. Three Byzantine arch entrances dominate the front-gate, while a baroque central chapel is located at the center. The chapel is a fusion of Roman, Gothic, Byzantine, and Baroque architectures. The complex carvings on the chapel's facade is considered to be the most distinct cemetery relief which can only be found in Cabatuan. Furthermore, this cemetery's neatness and organization is famous throughout the region. =The Town Hall= One of the earliest town halls built in Northern Iloilo is the Cabatuan Municipal Hall. It was built in 1734 along with the Church. Calamities and war, however, damaged the second level of this public house and many renovations had been done.

History Settlers first arrived circa 1846 and cleared an area at Punta Bulakawe, north of the current poblacion. Following an influx of settlers from Aklan and Antique, the settlement fell under Pueblo de Pilar, Capiz. About 10 years later, the settlement was transferred to the lowland and renamed to Badiang. In 1860, the first attempt was made to convert the barrio into a municipality but the provincial government of Capiz refused. Because of this refusal, the town leaders petitioned the governor of Iloilo, Governor Jose Maria Carles, who approved the petition. On July 1, 1862, the new pueblo was inaugurated and renamed to Carles, in honor to the governor. First Gobernadorcillo was Alenjandro Buaya. On January 1, 1904, the Municipio de Carles was demoted from a status of a Barrio to the status of a Barrio Balasan. This incident disheartened some Carlese√±os who migrated to other towns and provinces. But among those who stayed on were the strong willed ones who struggled hard to make Carles an independent municipality. Headed by Casimiro Andrada, the Carles Separation Movement succeeded in getting the approval of the Carlese√±os petition for separation from Balasan on January 1, 1920. Federico A. Ramos was appointed as the first Municipal President of Carles. It was during the incumbency of Municipal President Enrico Ilanga that the title of the municipal head was changed to Municipal Mayor and continued to be such until today.http://www.oocities.org/dost6/iloilo/carles.html =Typhoon Haiyan= Carles was heavily damaged by Typhoon Haiyan.

Four years later (1603) she was joined to Dumangas and two years later in 1605 she enjoyed her independence. In 1608, she was transferred to Laglag, now Barangay Pader, Due√±as, and remained in this place for 59 years or until 1667. It had only five barrios, namely: Sibucao and Sumandig in the lowlands; and Misi, Camantugan and Malonor in the upland. In 1668, Laglag was joined to Passi, only to be separated a year after (1669). From 1669 to 1844 or for a period of 175 years, Laglag still remained in the said site. (This was for reason that most of the family name of the residents of Due√±as begin with letter ‚ÄúL‚Äù ). But later in 1845, Laglag was moved around four kilometers eastward and given a name Due√±as in memory of the birthplace (Due√±as, Palencia, Spain) of Fr. Florencio Martin, who authored the transfer. Saint Jerome, Doctor of the Church, is the Patron Saint of Due√±as.

The last day of the month is the feast in honor of the Patron, St. Jerome. The week-long celebration is a way of thanksgiving after having a good harvest and surpassing the trials and cries during lean months. The Anihan Festival stands for Due√±as being an agricultural area that mainly depends on agriculture as its major source of livelihood; out of the municipality's 9,052 hectares, 86% or approximately 7,800 hectares are devoted to agriculture. Due√±as belongs to the top ten municipalities in terms of agricultural crop production particularly rice in rainfed areas in the Province of Iloilo.

Urban legend Due√±as has been known to be the site of the infamous \\"Teniente Gimo\\" urban legend story. Teniente is a Spanish word for Lieutenant since according to the story, a guy named Gimo was the Teniente del Barrio, or what is now known as the Barangay Chairman of the place. The story revolves about Gimo's family of aswangs wherein one of her daughters invited two of her female classmates from Iloilo City to their barrio fiesta without any knowledge of them being aswangs. Story says that Gimo and company mistakenly slaughtered his daughter while asleep instead of the targeted guest after that one guest herself overheard them of their plan to manslaughter her and feast for her body. As a result, the girl tricked the aswangs into killing their own kind and escaped, while the fate of the other classmate was unknown. The story has still been considered unproven and remains arguably the most famous aswang story of all time. Sources state that the whole story and characters were all fictional and is a product of old native literature by the elderly Ilonggo people. The story is often told by adults, both young and old, to scare off disobedient children. It has even been referenced to in popular culture specifically in a few Philippine horror films and is also widespread outside Iloilo and the rest of Panay, with various versions of the tale.

According to the , it has a population of people. Estancia is located in the northern part of the province and is from the provincial capital, Iloilo City, and from Roxas City. Estancia was originally a ranch for a wealthy Spaniard named Rodrigo who married a local woman. Estancia is not known for its agricultural products nor livestock but rather for its location as it is adjacent to Carles' impressive marine resources. Estancia has a fishport and a pier - these being one of the most developed in northern visayas, a banking industry, cable television, a hospital (adjacent only, that belongs to the Municipality of Balasan) and resorts. Estancia is known around the country as a center for commercial fishing, so much so that it shares to carries the name Alaska of the Philippines . The name ‚ÄúAlaska of the Philippines‚Äù reflects back early 1900 up to pre World War II when major commercial fishing activities was within Carles fishing ground ( facing Estancia Town ) and small portion of Estancia water territory, with bountiful catches, running out place to process and preserve their catch ended up rotting by the beaches. Commercial fishing boats from Bantayan Cebu, Province of Capiz, Samar, Leyte, Masbate and Negros came to Carles to fish (The true Alaska of the Philippines). As a testament to its location adjacent to Carles' bountiful marine resources. The reason for this is that Carles lies in the Visayan Sea triangle, an imaginary triangle extending from the provinces of Iloilo, Negros, Cebu, Samar, and Masbate. This triangle is a part of the \\"Sulu-Sulawesi Triangle\\" of the Sulu Sea and neighboring Indonesia where a large concentration of marine organisms coupled with climate conditions support a massive marine ecosystem. Various commercial species are harvested along Carles' waters, namely mackerel, barracuda, sardines, shad, pompano, grouper, squid, cuttlefish, shrimp, prawns, shells, seaweed and others, these all are catches from Carles' water territory and brought to fishports of Estancia and Bancal. The method predominantly used are purse seining, trawling and gill netting as these are suited for the relatively shallow waters (up to 60 fathoms) of the Visayan Sea. However, as of recent years, pollution, heavy overfishing, and irresponsible fishing practices have slowly diminished the once abundant fish stocks of Estancia, and now problems like diminishing catches and unpredictable weather are beginning to surface. These factors have raised awareness in the government as well as the private sector and currently an artificial reef is off the shore of Brgy Paon in an attempt to provide juvenile fish with shelter in hopes of restocking these once populous waters. For now, Estancia is experiencing influx of investments as Gaisano Grand put up their first mall in the 5th District of Iloilo, also Prince Hypermart and some mall like CityMall shows interests to come in. Estancia as \\" Investor's Haven in Northern Iloilo \\" aspires to become a City in the near future. To make it happen, Estancia will looking forward to reclaim approximately 24 hectares on Estancia Bay, expecting to give Estancia more lands for massive investments to come in, also An expected Canning company to be put in.

After the procession of Holy Thursday and good Friday, people do the bari-bari taking the route of the procession to take a closer look of the kapiyas. Holy week is also a time of reunions, homecoming and other social gatherings for the Guimbalanons. Historical sites and landmarks Old Guimbal Municipal Hall Parish of St Nicolas of Tolentino, or Guimbal church *Guimbal Church: The newly restored 400-year-old church made of yellow adobe and coral stones, one of the oldest in the country. Some sources on the internet mention that the church seems to date back to about 1769-1774, when it was finished after about 3 decades of construction, but that would completely contradict its fortified structure which was used against pirate invasions. Thus this information seems to be erroneous. *Moro Watchtowers: Originally, there were four structures located in different sites along the shoreline area in the poblacion. Only three are still intact and renovated to its original condition through the Department of Tourism. These are the 17th Century structures used as look-out for raiding Moro pirates. Like the church, it was also constructed through force labor. *Guimbal Steel Bridge: Constructed during the American period. The construction was ordered by US President Roosevelt. It is approximately 0.350 kilometers long and made of Pittsburgh Steel, which were imported from Virginia, USA. It is the longest steel bridge in Western Visayas. *Public Plaza: Known for its beautiful ornamental plants and landscapes, the plaza is described by many as the little Luneta of southern Iloilo. It is well- maintained and well-lighted at night. It can be likened to a European labyrinth. *New Municipal Building: Guimbal‚Äôs symbol of public service, the new municipal building houses local and national government offices in the municipality. It is branded by many as the ‚ÄúParthenon of Western Visayas.‚Äù In front of the Athenian conceived open coliseum and an amphitheatre where cultural shows, programs, sports, activities, and public gatherings are held. One can experience being in the golden age of history just walking around. *Taytay Tigre: A short bridge constructed during the Spanish colonial period. It is commonly known as ‚ÄúTaytay Tigre‚Äù because of the tiger stone structure made part of its approaches on both sides guarding the bridge before one enters the poblacion. It was reconstructed through donation from a veteran Guimbalanon. *Ayaw-ayaw Monument: Situated on a hill, near Nahapay Elementary School. It is a life-size replica of Andres Bonifacio, father of Philippine Revolution standing proud with his bolo on his right hand. Ayaw-ayaw is a word that signifies opposition from anything or anyone. The monument was erected on the site where early American soldiers met resistance from revolutionaries. It is a symbol of bravery, a manifestation of deep love for true freedom and independence shown by revolutionaries who resisted foreign dominion.

The Beartooths are the location of Granite Peak, which at is the highest point in the state of Montana. The mountains are just northeast of Yellowstone National Park and are part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The mountains are traversed by road via the Beartooth Highway (U.S. 212) with the highest elevation at Beartooth Pass ). The name of the mountain range is attributed to a rugged peak found in the range, Beartooth Peak, that has the appearance of a bear's tooth. The Beartooth Mountains sit upon the larger Beartooth Plateau. History The remoteness of the region contributed to its obscurity until the 1870s. The Crow tribe of Native Americans used the valleys of the mountains for hunting game animals and for winter shelter from the harsh winds of the plains. Though trappers entered the region in the 1830s, formal exploration by the U.S. Government did not occur until 1878. While there has been gold discovered earlier in the mountain range the major expansion of mining began in 1882. Expansion continued adding more infrastructure for the mines. As growth continued there were six companies that had stakes in the New World Mining District. Between 1900-1955 the district has produced over 65,000 oz of gold, 500,000 oz of silver, and amounts of copper, zinc, and lead ore. One of the main limiting factors was the remoteness. Over time many of the mines ceased operations due to lack of funds or collapses that were not financially viable to correct. In 1989 Crown Butte Mines proposed massive additions to operations in the area. Once they began preparations for starting new mining operations, they came under public scrutiny based on the proximity to Yellowstone National Park and public fears that waste would find its way into the park. In 1996 the federal government paid Crown Butte Mines $65 million to defray costs they had already paid; they had to pay $22.5 million to help repair the damage done to the surrounding environment. Ecology Beartooth Peak in the Beartooth Mountains The ecosystem of the Beartooth Mountains is one of the most unique in the Contiguous United States partly due to being part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. This space allows a great diversity with 34,375 square miles of nearly intact wilderness. With the protection to the terrestrial habitats all of the bodies of water are classified as Outstanding National Resource Waters, giving them the highest protections under the Clean Water Act. The cleanliness of the bodies of water led them to be used as a benchmark to compare others in the northern Rocky Mountains. Most of the current species are currently protected. = Fauna = The mountains are home to many of North America's largest animals, including one of the few grizzly bear populations in the contiguous United States. There are rare sightings of lynx and wolverines and a population of cougars and recently reintroduced wolves. There are some of the largest herds of bison and elk in North America. = Flora = The Beartooth Mountains also have a very diverse range of trees, mostly conifers with stands of aspen and cottonwoods. The conifers mainly consist of Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, whitebark pine, and lodgepole pine below 9,000 ft. Above 9,000 ft. there are few trees, the flora including grasses, wildflowers, and sagebrush. Geology The Beartooth mountains are composed of Precambrian granite and crystalline metamorphic rocks dated at approximately 2.7 to 4 billion years old, making these rocks among the oldest on Earth. The Stillwater igneous complex within the mountains is the location of the largest known deposits of platinum and chromium and the second largest deposits of nickel found in the United States. Older ages (4-3.2 billion years) are found in zircon crystals in meta-sedimentary rocks. The most abundant rocks in the Beartooths (gneiss, amphibolites and granites, as well as the Stillwater Complex) are 2.9-2.7 billion years old. Elevation and peaks Huge expansive plateaus are found at altitudes in excess of with over 25 peaks exceeding . The mountains have over 300 pristine lakes and some waterfalls in excess of 300 feet (91 m). Winters are severe with heavy snow and incessant winds. Approximately 25 small glaciers exist in the Beartooths with Grasshopper Glacier being one of the more distinctive. The highest peaks of the Beartooth Mountains are clustered in three groups, topped by Granite Peak, Mount Wood , and Castle Mountain . The cluster containing Mount Wood is named the Granite Range. The largest of these three contiguous areas above , which extends into Wyoming, is the one dominated by Castle Mountain.

According to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, in 2005 it was estimated that around 6.2% of marriages in Japan are arranged via omiai.Ito, Masami, \\"Marriage ever-changing institution\\", Japan Times, November 3, 2009.ÂÅ•Â∫∑„Å®Âá∫Áî£„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÂÖ®ÂõΩË™øÊüª, National Institute of Population and Social Security Research History Wedding of Pujie and Hiro Saga in an arranged marriage with a strategic purpose, Tokyo, 1937 The practice of miai emerged in 16th century Japan among the samurai class to form and protect strong military alliances among warlords to ensure mutual support. Later, during the Tokugawa period (1603‚Äì1868) the practice of miai spread to other urban classes trying to emulate samurai customs. It became the practice for those seeking a union between families and parents on both sides made all the decision regarding marriage. Miai was a solemn practice and involved considerations that are not given as much weight by most modern Japanese people, such as family bloodlines and class. This type of miai is usually seen portrayed in films and television dramas. After the Pacific War, the trend was to abandon the restrictive arranged-meetings system. In Japan the 1930s and 40s Omiai practices accounted for 69% of marriages, by 2010 the figure had dropped to 5.2%. Modern forms of Omiai are still practiced in Japan today by various marriage agencies, with 'konkatsu' or 'spouse hunting' on the rise as many single people struggle to find a marriage partner. There have also been accounts of how parents pressure their unmarried children into arranged meetings that eventually lead to marriages particularly those who would assume family responsibilities such as those inheriting family business. In 2014 Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe set aside three billion Japanese Yen to help with Omiai matchmaking efforts within Japan, this was part of the Japanese governments effort to increase the declining birth rate in Japan. Historically miai signified that the parties were brought together expressly for the purpose of marriage on the initiative of the parents, a friend of the family or a go-between. It also meant that the initial criteria of selection were objective ones.Dore, Ronald Philip. City Life in Japan: A Study of a Tokyo Ward. Richmond, Surrey: Japan Library, 1999. The potential mate and their family meet with the nak≈çdo and examined all eligible persons. The nak≈çdo often had photographs of candidates and a ‚Äúrirekisho‚Äù, a small personal history. The rirekisho frequently included the name, age, health, education, occupation and marital status of all members of the candidate's family. The families then sat down with the nak≈çdo and screened the portfolios to eliminate any obviously inappropriate candidates.Blood, Robert O. Love Match and Arranged Marriage; a Tokyo-Detroit Comparison. New York, Free Press, 1967. The photographs and rirekisho were then brought to the home of the potential mate's family for the son or daughter to scrutinize.Edwards, Walter Drew. Modern Japan Through its Weddings: Gender, Person, and Society in Ritual Portrayal. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1989. The participant and their family examined the photos and short personal histories based on an investigation of social consideration. The education level and occupations of the potential candidate's family were historically the first aspects taken into consideration at that meeting. The potential mate and their mother then created a list of primary choices and asked the nak≈çdo to investigate the first choice.Applbaum, Kalman D. ‚ÄúMarriage with the Proper Stranger: Arranged Marriage in Metropolitan Japan.‚Äù Ethnology 34.1 (1995): 37-51. In more selective miai, the candidates and their families were judged on a large set of criteria aimed at determining the suitability and the balance of the marriage. This criteria is formally known in Japan as . It included level of education, income, occupation, physical attractiveness, religion, social standing, and hobbies. The participant's also played a large role. Many feared that a candidate's blood was contaminated with diseases such as epilepsy, neurosis, or mental illness. The fear was so prevalent that the Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 was passed to legalize sterilization and abortion for people with a history of mental defects and other hereditary diseases. Social status also played a large role in selecting a candidate. Ideally, paired candidates and their families would be of equal social status, so some candidates had a hard time finding a mate if their family was not of a matching social status as the other family. Family lineage also affected the quality of candidates historically, for example, a candidate with samurai blood was more likely to be picked than one with ancestry from a different class, especially during the Tokugawa-era. Historically Omiai marriage was criticized for promoting patriarchal relationships with traditional power structures and distinct divisions of labor between males and females, that has now changed significantly with modern times. =Investigation= The nak≈çdo provided, and still does, a substantial amount of information regarding each candidate. The family researched the iegara of each candidate provided by the nak≈çdo once the preliminary list is constructed. Vast differences in iegara between the two families would cause embarrassment to the sides when they met. One method of investigation in urban Japan was through a kooshinjo, or detective agency. In rural areas a common investigative method was to personally ask about the family of interest by questioning shopkeepers and neighbors: kuchikiki (‚Äúinquiry of mouth‚Äù). More recently, the nak≈çdo would gather information about the family in question by asking around and comparing responses: kikiawaseru/toriawaseru (‚Äúinquire variously and compare‚Äù). If all criteria were acceptable, the matchmaker arranged an interview for a miai. =Introduction= Before the omiai occurred, the parties scrutinized each other's pictures to prevent future rejectionHendry, Joy. Understanding Japanese society. London; New York: Routledge Curzon 3rd ed., 2003., something which still occurs through online Omiai based services in Japan now. Although candidates rely on their photographs and resumes (rirekisho) in the modern omiai process, an older custom known as \\"kagemi‚Äù (hidden look) was once employed. Kagemi occurred when a potential male candidate attempted to catch a glimpse of the female in secret. The objective of the kagemi was to prevent embarrassing denials based on appearances. The miai was, and still is, a casual meeting between the potential couple, though historically the nak≈çdo and the parents of both parties would be present also. Historically the nak≈çdo determined the place and format of the meeting. Historically the omiai was an opportunity for the parents to survey the bride/groom as well as the couple themselves. The meeting began with an informal introduction between the two families by the nak≈çdo. The introduction was often followed by small talk between the parents. Occasionally, the conversation shifted to one of the potential candidates. Toward the end of the meeting, the potential couple were advised to go off spend some time alone to get better acquainted. =Kotowari (excuse, apology, refusal)= If the initial miai introduction was successful, the potential couple went through a series of dates until a decision was reached. The decision was usually expressed at the couple's third meeting. If the potential couple chose to marry they went through a formal marriage process known as ,‚ÄúOmiai and Miai-gekkon, Arranged Marriages in Japan.‚Äù Hanami Web. 2007. 6 Nov. 2007 <> in which a was arranged by the groom's family. Contrastingly, there were also standard provisions to turn down an offer or proposal with relatively little loss of face for the party being refused. =Discrimination Historically= Historically there was some amount of racial, class, and genetic discrimination in the omiai process. Many Japan- born Koreans were discriminated against for being ‚Äúhalf-bloods‚Äù -- i.e. not of full Japanese ancestry. Also, the year of the Horse in the fifth cycle of the Japanese lunar calendar, hinoeuma -- every sixtieth year -- were thought to be bad luck‚ÄúJapanese Calendar.‚Äù japan-guide.com. 2007. 18 Oct. 2007 . Women born during those years would often claim to have been born in the previous or following year. The belief was so widespread that in 1966, according to the Japan Statistical Yearbook, the birthrate in Japan took a 26% dip. The most widespread class discriminate is against members of the burakumin. This former outcast group was composed of descendants of workers traditionally associated with trades involving blood, death, or other undesirables. Some examples being leather-workers, shoe-menders, and butchers since shoes were too dirty to be taken into the house, and meat was in the past forbidden by the Buddhist faith. During the Tokugawa Shogunate, demotion to burakumin status was sometimes a way of punishing criminals‚ÄúTaboos in Japan.‚Äù Hanami Web. 2007. 6 Nov. 2007 <>. Today, burakumin members may be identified by the region of the city where they live or by their street address, though it is getting increasingly rare and Japanese people's views on shoes and beef among other things have changed significantly. Historically, a nak≈çdo would require a candidate to bring a family history to prove that they are not a member of the burakumin. Members of the Ainu, an indigenous people from the Hokkaid≈ç region were commonly avoided as well. Descendants of people who were exposed to the radiation from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were also avoided due to perceptions regarding possible child deformities and susceptibilities to rare diseases.  Current Times  =Participants= The participants in the modern Omiai process are those who are to potentially to be married, rarely these days are the families of these candidates involved. =Nak≈çdo= A still serves in the role of go-between for potential marriage partners in the omiai process. Though a nak≈çdo is not necessary for all omiai, especially with modern omiai parties. The nak≈çdo can be a family member, friend, or as is most common now a marriage agency (ÁµêÂ©öÁõ∏Ë´áÊâÄ, kekkonsoudanjyo). The general purpose of the nak≈çdo, especially the traditional way of omiai, is to provide introductions for people entering a new arrangement and to assist candidatesHendry, Joy. Marriage in Changing Japan. London: Croom Helm, 1981.. The nak≈çdo is expected to play a variety of roles throughout the omiai process. The first is the bridging role, , in which the nak≈çdo introduces potential candidates, and potentially their families to each other depending on requirements. The second role, which is increasingly less common in modern Japan, is as a liaison for the families to avoid direct confrontation and differences in opinions between them by serving as an intermediary for working out the details of the marriage. The nak≈çdo is even consulted by the married couple after their wedding if they encounter problems in their married life. Even though omiai marriages are less common than they once were, they do still hold a place in popular media. One example is Wedding Bells, a panel type game show which ran from 1993 to 1997 in Japan on TBS, that substituted for the role of the nak≈çdo in which contestants were introduced and screened for marriage possibility. =Selection process= Historically the initiative for the omiai introductions often came from the parents who felt that their son or daughter was of a marriageable age (tekireiki), usually in the range of 22 to 30, but had shown little or no sign of seeking a partner on their own. Most commonly now the decision to contact a marriage agency comes directly from the person due to their lack of opportunity to meet a suitable spouse due to limited opportunities. Unlike in western cultures Japanese people very rarely talk to or trust strangers, thus the Nakodo or marriage agency forms the bridge as a trusted third party. At other times, the individual may ask friends or acquaintances to introduce potential mates in a similar way. Parents often subtly interject the phrase ‚Äúonegai shimasu‚Äù (‚Äúplease‚Äù) into casual conversation, which implies that both parents have consented for their daughter to meet eligible menLebra, Takie Sugiyama. Japanese Women: Constraint and Fulfillment. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1984.. The daughter may be unaware that her parents have suggested her availability though the use of \\"onegai shimasu.\\" In exceptional circumstances, though growing increasingly rare now, some parents send a candidacy picture to a future husband or go- between without their daughter's knowledge or consent. In general now, marriage agencies performing Omiai duties only discuss introductions and registration with their clients directly, thus removing involvement of parents entirely in many cases. In Japan now many women are stereotyped as looking for three attributes: height (specifically someone tall), high salary, and high education. This is commonly known as the \\"Three Hs.‚Äù Attitudes Modern attitudes toward omiai have changed significantly. According to an estimate in 1998, between ten and thirty percent of all marriages that took place in Japan at that time were arranged (omiai) marriages.‚ÄúTying the Knot.‚Äù Trends in Japan. 1998. 6 Nov. 2007 The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research in 2005 estimated that 6.2% of marriages in Japan were arranged. The younger generation is more apt to adopting the Western philosophy of love where marriage is often preceded by romantic courtship. Romantic love (ren‚Äôai) implies that there are no constraints against selecting individuals whom one can marry. However, it is not always possible to classify a particular marriage as ‚Äúlove‚Äù or ‚Äúarranged‚Äù because of parental influence on the candidates. Women are more inclined to seek a romantic relationship than men. Gender inculturation is at times seen as the cause for the discrepancy. Women were historically raised with the expectation that they may only find satisfaction within the home and are therefore perhaps more susceptible to modern brands of idealism, such as that true love will be followed by marital and domestic bliss. However many Japanese ladies do now seek careers of their own and fulfillment in other ways. Much of which has brought about even greater need by many for marriage agencies and omiai processes within Japan. There are several methods for meeting potential mates that differ from the structure of the omiai. For example, konpa or compa (companion) is a method young people have adopted into modern society‚ÄúThings Japanese: Omiai and Compa.‚Äù Yamasa Student Network. 2007. 7 Nov. 2007 . Konpa occurs when groups of four or five boys go out together with the same number of girls to see how they all get along. This method has become more popular among university students and younger company workers since it is highly informal and does not involve parents. Gender and miai Although current rates of omiai marriages are fairly low, the persistence of omiai in modern Japanese society comes as a result of challenges in meeting new people. The idea of the cutoff age is taken quite seriously, the tendency for women who remain unmarried past tekireiki to be treated as inferior and compared to Japanese Christmas cake: fresh up until the twenty-fifth but becoming less appetizing with every day past this date. A newer expression replaces Christmas cake with toshikoshisoba, a dish of noodles to see out the year on the thirty-first. Thus creating motivation for Japanese ladies after the age of 25 to seek help in the form of omiai introductions from a marriage agency. Males possess a little more latitude. While previously a man who was not married by his 30s was considered untrustworthy by colleagues and employers, who believed that such men have not been conditioned to learn the fundamental principles of co- operation and responsibility. For males, marriage also makes an implicit statement about staying in the family business. While previously men who engaged in omiai often occupied dominant roles within the marriage, many of the men now registered with marriage agencies for help in finding a wife through omiai are seeking a balanced loving relationship with mutual love between partners. In other countries The same practice is also common in Chinese-speaking countries, known as xiangqin (). In China, 82% of first-tier- city dwellers had experienced Xiangqin, primarily due to parental pressure and a lack of opportunity to meet people of opposite-sex. In literature Miai is one of the main topics of Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki's The Makioka Sisters, which was published in the 1940s.

AllMovie wrote, \\"Slaughter High gets a passing grade for the die-hard genre fans, but is worthless for most any other audience.\\" =Home media= Slaughter High was released as April Fool's Day on VHS in Japan by Vestron International and on DVD in the United Kingdom by Arrow Video.

On June 20, 1864, a league of influential citizens and inhabitants of this Barrio, officially pleaded to His Excellency the Quartermaster General of the Visayas to elevate this barrio into a new town independent of its matrix of Pototan to be named ‚ÄúPueblo de Molto‚Äù. The reasons why there was a petition to elevate said barrio into a pueblo, were due to: (1) great distance between the town and the barrio; (2) during those times, the residents of the said barrio had difficulty travelling to Pototan when they want to hear mass on required days; (3) when some barrio folks fell ill due to some pestilence and eventually died without receiving the Sacrament of Extreme Unction for the good of their souls. For a predominantly-Catholic inhabitants of this barrio, receiving and getting blessed with the sacraments as taught by the church, were important. (4) Another case in point was those women who suffered complications and died during childbirth had no chance of receiving the final sacrament, and (5) their infants often died without being baptized. It was for these reasons, that the leaders sought the approval of His Excellency praying that their request would be granted. July 30, 1864 - The Parish Priest and the Principales of Pototan endorsed to the Political-Military Government of Iloilo the required sketch and lists of more than a thousand tax payers and sixteen Cabezas de Barangay, informing the need of elevating Barrio Mantugaui into a town. Likewise to also elevate this petition to the superior knowledge of His Excellency the Governor General of the Philippines for his royal resolution/decision. There were so many disputes that had happened in the creation of this town. Arguments as to the other barrios to be included as part of Molto, as well as the boundaries and the ‚Äútributos‚Äù taxpayers, have become the major contention. Barrio Paranginan el Maya was merged to Talarocan now Tolarucan, to become part of Molto. A dispute between the Municipalities of Pototan and Janiuay over the jurisdiction of Talarocan resulted to the delay of elevating this barrio into a town. On January 20, 1868, a decree ordered by then the Gobernador Politico Militar de Visayas, contained an assignment which was delegated to the Captain of the Police Force in this District, Don Evaristo Fernandez, who conducted the survey of the boundaries concerned. Upon completion of the survey, the recommendation regarding the boundary between Mantugaui and Janiuay was objected by Fr. Miguel Claro of Janiuay Parish, hence the delay occurred for its approval. On March 30, 1869, the Bishop of Jaro appointed Don Juan Manzano y Vazques, the lawyer of this Province and was designated to form a committee to establish the official boundaries for the creation of a new town to be named ‚ÄúPueblo de Molto‚Äù. Together with him in the said committee were the Reverend Parish Priests of Pototan and Janiuay and with the chiefs of the Barrio Mantugaui, they also handled the case filed regarding the objection of the Parish Priest of Janiuay. Another important task of this committee was to establish the site where the new town of Molto and the barrios which should be part of it should be situated and indicated as well as the land for the public buildings. On April 5, 1870, the final report of the boundaries for ‚ÄúPueblo de Molto‚Äù was submitted to the Political Military Governor of the District by the said committee. On July 1, 1870, a Superior Decree issued by the Superior Government of General Carlos Ma. De la Torre to establish the demarcation and markings of the new town and named it into ‚ÄúPueblo de Mina‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúPueblo de Molto‚Äù. No parish priest yet was assigned at that time because some of the requirements imposed for the creation of a new parish like the construction of the Church, Parish House for the priest, Convent School, Court, Municipio, were not fully complied yet. On July 30, 1873, when all these terms and conditions were accomplished, a decree was issued making the new town of Mina as a full- fledged parish as approved by the Government of the Republic. The parish, which was created through the Bishop of Jaro appointed an Augustinian Priest, Father Tiburcio Casbresana, a Spaniard, to become the first parish priest in the new town of Mina. The Parish of Mina was given an official title of ‚ÄúNuestra Sra. Del Pilar‚Äù or ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Pillar‚Äù. =American colonization (1898‚Äì1946) Law of United States-Philippine Commission ‚Äì Act No. 719 April 4, 1903= After the defeat in the Philippines by Spain against the Americans, the Americans changed the structure of government in this country. On 4 April 1903, the 50 towns in the Province of Iloilo were reduced to 17 with the passage of Act No. 719, the title of which read ‚ÄúAN ACT REDUCING THE FIFTY-ONE MUNICIPALITIES OF THE PROVINCE OF ILOILO TO SEVENTEEN.‚Äù The town of Dingle and Mina, together with other neighboring barrios, were placed under the jurisdiction of the Town of Pototan. Mina became an ‚Äúarrabal‚Äù of Pototan, then considered as the biggest ‚Äúarrabal‚Äù because it has a parish of its own. But the townsfolk of Mina continued to celebrate the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar. =World War II= During the World War II, the presence of the Japanese occupation was also felt within Mina, hence, for three years, the Chapel in Barangay Abat, Mina, became the location of the parish of Mina, where the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar on October 12, was celebrated with a mass each year. Immediately after the liberation, the Parish went back to its original location in the town plaza. In 1947, the Parish Priest, having observed that the economic life of the people in the parish was pitifully difficult, transferred the celebration of the religious fiesta on December 30 from October 12. The purpose of the change was to afford the parishioners the chance to have a decent and festive celebration. For two years, the religious activities and festivities were celebrated on December 30 after which the feast day was moved back to its original date, simultaneously with the celebration of Spain where the feast of the Lady of the Pillar was originated. Thus, since then, the town of Mina celebrates the religious festival every 12 October annually. A group of local leaders residing in Mina made a petition to separate Mina, as an independent town from Pototan. On October 1, 1964, then President Diosdado Macapagal signed Executive Order No. 106 creating the Municipality of Mina. Mina‚Äôs status as a municipality became controversial. A complaint filed by then Senator Emmanuel Pelaez reached the Supreme Court. It had to do with the official acts of President Diosdado Macapagal issuing Executive Order for the creation of the Municipality of Mina, which Senator Pelaez found to be unconstitutional. The creation of a Municipality should be through a Bill passed in Congress. The legality of President Macapagal‚Äôs issuance of Executive Order No. 106 was questioned. In the end, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the complainant, Senator Pelaez, and ordered Mina to revert to its status as a suburb of Pototan. Its existence as an again independent Municipality was short-lived, only 14 months, from 1 January 1965 to 18 February 1966. It was then Congressman Ricardo Y. Ladrido of the Fourth District of the Province of Iloilo, who authored and sponsored House Bill No. 16661 creating the Municipality of Mina in 1968. On 9 September 1968, R.A. No. 5442 was passed, declaring Mina as a municipality of the Province of Iloilo. On November 11, 1969, a special election for the newly created or declared an independent town was held simultaneously with the general (presidential) election. This is the first local government election for the town of Mina. ATTY. ARTHUR D. DEFENSOR SR., at the age of 25, was the first elected Municipal Mayor.Compiled and written by Lydia E.

History Municipality of New Lucena was formerly known as Jimanban, a very small barrio organized sometime in 1800, which was a part of the Municipality of Cabatuan. In 1886 the boundary line separating the jurisdiction of Santa Barbara and Cabatuan was defined and Jimanban was made part of Santa Barbara. Intermarriage among the people increased the area's population Led by Bartolome Valenzuela, a prominent resident of the barrio (Jimanban) the resident organized themselves and petioned the governor general that they be granted independence by putting up a church, convent and a casa real (municipal building). With the help of the provincial officials and captain municipal of the municipalities of Santa Barbara, Cabatuan and Pototan, Lucena was separated from Santa Barbara on October 9, 1877 in accordance with the Dirrecion General De Administration Civil. The first Municipal Officials were elected and the first captain municipal was Bartolome Valenzuela known as Tan Abe, the grandfather of then Senator Tomas Confessor and Representative Patricio Confessor. It is not recorded when Jimanban was changed to New Lucena but Lucena reportedly comes from dialect Lu (Ulo) which means \\"head\\"and \\"cena\\" which is the short version for the flower azucena, which means pure and peaceful. Thus, Lucena means pure and peaceful leader. Another belief was that, Jimanban was changed to Lucena after the name of the Provincial Alcalde Mayor Pedro Gonzales Lucena, the 36th Executive of the Province of Iloilo in 1716-1717. When the Americans came, Pueblo de Lucena was again in incorporated to the Municipal of Santa Barbara in 1902 for economic security and facilitation of government. In 1921, the prominent cicitizens of Lucena petioned for its separation from Santa Barbara. On January 1, 1947, Lucena became a new town in the Province of Iloilo, thus it is now called New Lucena.

The municipality is the Regional Agro- Industrial Center for Western Visayas and is located north of Iloilo City. The Catholic church, is currently undergoing restoration, is similar to one in Pavia, Italy.paviachurchrestore : Pavia Church Restoration Etymology How the town got its name is unclear, and has long been disputed. One theory has it that the name came from a certain Colonel Pavia of the Spanish garrison in Iloilo who was supposedly responsible for initially establishing a Spanish presence in the area . Others believe that the name is a Spanish corruption of the Hiligaynon word biya-biya, as the area was originally considered a neglected patch of land that served mostly as a camping ground for city sophisticates and absentee landlords. Others claim that the town was named after a Spanish governor-general, Manuel Pavia y Lay, Marquis of Novaliches, who eventually became a priest after his short tenure in the Philippines from 1853-1854. However, the more credible theory seems to be the overlooked fact that the town's religious well-being was placed under the jurisdiction and supervision of the friars of the Augustinian Order, and they simply named the place in honor of the town of Pavia, Italy, where the founder of their order, Saint Augustine, was buried.http://pavia5001.tripod.com/id5.html The last theory seems to be supported by circumstantial historical evidence: it was also in 1862 that an independent parish dedicated to Saint Monica was established by an Augustinian friar, Policarpio Minayo. But it was only in 1889 when construction of the famous brick church‚Äîas it now stands‚Äîbegan. It was envisioned and built in the Byzantine style, with Romanesque design elements. Two Greek crosses dominate the facade, and the transept is round set against the rear wall. It is unique in the whole of Panay Island, as it is the only church built entirely of red brick, inside and out. Quite significantly, the church design was apparently inspired by the ancient royal arched basilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, Italy‚Äîminus the front columns. History Pavia was settled by primitive Malays and later by Chinese approximately between the 15th and 16th centuries, corroborated by archaeological work at a Chinese burial ground in Cabugao Sur. The settlement had an estimated population of 200 to 400. Separating from town of Jaro , Iloilo , Pavia was officially established in 1848, during the Spanish Colonial Era, by thirteen landowners in what used to be a ‚Äúcamping place‚Äù, a ‚Äúsettlement place‚Äù or an ‚Äúabandoned place‚Äù. Pavia became a part of Santa Barbara in 1901 and then in 1904 part of Iloilo City. In 1907, Pavia, together with Leganes, Iloilo and Jaro seceded from Iloilo City to become the suburb Jaro. Petronilo Gumban governed Pavia from 1916 until his election as Presidente Municipal of Jaro in 1920. In 1921, Pavia led by Delfin Gumban became an independent municipality.http://vicilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-7.html Barangays Pavia is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. * Aganan * Amparo * Anilao * Balabag * Purok I (Poblacion) * Purok II (Poblacion) * Purok III (Poblacion) * Purok IV (Poblacion) * Cabugao Norte * Cabugao Sur * Jibao- an * Mali-ao * Pagsanga-an * Pandac * Tigum * Ungka I * Ungka II * Pal-agon Demographics In the , the population of Pavia, Iloilo, was people, with a density of .

Spanish converted the natives and appointed St. Vincent Ferrer as Patron Saint of the settlement. Spanish set up the municipality at Concepcion, of which Dioniso was a part of. During Spanish times, the head of the local government of Concepcion was titled \\"Kapitan\\" (captain) and the subordinate leaders in San Dionisio were titled \\"Tenientes\\" (lieutenant) and hereditary Cabeza de Barangay (head of barangay). Eventually Sara was carved out of Concepcion to establish an eponymous municipality, which also included Dionisio as one of the constituent barangay of Sara. In 1920, San Dionisio municipality was established after carving it out of Sara municipality.

Following their customs and united by the bonds of kinship they built a community. Out of the flourishing settlement later rosegreat men like Manuel Paez, Modesto Palabrica and Apolinario Palabrica, who had earlier become Capitanes of the mother town of Passi. The names of Sanriago Pama, Augusto Palencia, Gregorio Aguilar, Bartolo Garrido, Cipriano Gonzales, Vicente Quianzon, and others surnamed Palabrica and Paez, had been elected to the position of Capitanes of Tenientes. During an exploration talk held at the house of his aunt, Maura Ponte in Barangay Camiri, Jesus Prudente and his closest friends stressed the need to launch a movement aimed at separating San Enrique from Passi. This was followed by a core group meeting at the old municipal building. In the presence of Ernesto Palabrica, Jose Lacsao, Crispin Lademora and Rodrigo Ponte, he laid down the mechanics for the reconstitution of the town into a separate political entity. At the Assembly meeting called on November 25, 1956, a big crowd clustered in the market place at the corner of Palabrica and Manolo street. In his stirring speech Dr. Zosimo Palencia, the no. 1 councilor of Passi assured them of his wholehearted support. Other impassioned speakers were Exequiel Garrido, Jesus Paclibar, Juan Ayupan, Ernesto Palabrica, Genaro Aguilar and Manuel Pama. On July 12, 1957, Executive Order No. 259, creating the new Municipality of San Enrique, in the Province of Iloilo, was signed by Excellency Carlos P. Garcia, President of the Philippines.

Congressman Aldeguer was the \\"Simon Bolivar\\", in the emancipation of San Enrique. During the first years of its existence as a municipality, San Enrique was confronted by heartbreaking problems. Those times were bitter, painful and discouraging. The Municipality was beset by financial crises, but the San Enriquenhons were able to move successfully against the stream of insurmountable odds. The establishments of Passi Sugar Central in San Enrique, has considerably improved the economy of the Municipality. It has drawn workers, thereby enhancing its financial status. However, in 1967, the San Enrique Community High School operated by the virtue of the law authored by Congressman Aldeguer in 1965. Since San Enrique is basically an agricultural town, the San Enrique National Agricultural and Vocational High School operated in 1972. These two secondary high schools were eventually fused, becoming San Enique Agricultural College on June 10, 1983 under Batas Pambansa 496. Republic Act number 6944 converted the school into San Enrique Polytechnic College and begun to function on June 10, 1991. Presently the school is ISCOF.

History The Agustinian Archives, Vol. 17-18, which recorded the missionary achievements of the Agustinian missionaries, mentions that in 1617 the missionaries ministered a community then known as Catmon, a name derived from a fruit tree which was an imposing landmark, which sat on a rich and fertile plain traversed by the Salug (now Tigum) and Aganan rivers, producing rice, corn, sugar, mongo and tobacco. Then Catmon was only a ‚ÄúVisita Catmon‚Äù of Jaro vicariate. In 1760, Catmon was established as an independent parish, whose patron saint was Santa Barbara and the settlement became a ‚Äúpueblo‚Äù named after her. Its total population at the time was 15,094. In 1845, its population was 19,719 and it covered an area which are now the Municipalities of Maasin, Janiuay, Cabatuan, Alimodian, San Miguel, Zarraga, New Lucena and parts of Leganes and Pavia. When the Philippine Revolution broke out on Luzon in 1896, it did not spread immediately to Iloilo. The Spanish authorities thought that they could keep the Ilonggos loyal to Spain. Governador‚ÄìGeneral Basilio Agustin organized the Volunteer Militia in Iloilo to enlist Ilonggos to fight the Tagalog rebels. Being a ‚Äúmestizo‚Äù and having occupied the highest office in his town, Martin Teofilo Delgado was appointed commander of the ‚Äúvoluntaries‚Äù in Santa Barbara. Unknown to the Spaniards, however, Delgado had already become a ‚Äúrevolucionario‚Äù. On October 28, 1898 he publicly declared himself for the Revolution and seized the municipal building. The Revolutionary Government of the Visayas was organized and on November 17, 1898, was formally inaugurated at the town plaza of Santa Barbara. A large crowd hailing from many places across Iloilo gathered for the historic occasion. The Philippine flag was raised for the first time outside of Luzon. The officials of the Revolutionary Government were Roque Lopez, president; Vicente Franco, vice president and secretary of the interior; Venancio Concepcion, secretary of finance; Ramon Avance≈àa, secretary of state; Jovito Yusay, secretary of justice; Julio Hernandez, secretary of war; Fernando Salas, secretary general. General Martin T. Delgado was chosen General ‚Äìin-Chief of the Revolutionary Forces. Santa Barbara became the headquarters of the Revolutionary Forces and from here, Gen. Delgado launched the campaign to liberate the whole province which culminated in the surrender of Iloilo City by Governor-General de los Rios on December 24, 1898. The victory against Spain was short-lived as the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War followed. Gen. Delgado led the same army against Americans from 1899 to 1901. Delgado was forced to surrender on February 2, 1901. Upon the establishment of the civil government, Martin Delgado was appointed as the first provincial Governor of Iloilo and was elected to the same position in the first elections held in 1903. Santa Barbara became a town under American regime and was incorporated into a municipality by the Commonwealth Government. The town soon began to progress. In 1948, Barangay Tuburan-Solbud was transferred to Zarraga, Iloilo. = Cityhood = Kaliwat sang Santa Barbara Migration occurred in the 20th century to Mindanao in the 1940s under Manuel Roxas who was from Panay.

In Presbyterianism, ordination is understood to be an ordinance rather than a sacrament; ministers and elders are ordained; until recently deacons were \\"commissioned\\" but now they too are ordained to their office in the Church of Scotland. Background Women were commissioned as deacons (or \\"deaconesses\\") from 1888, and allowed to preach from 1949. Serious debate on the ordination of women as ministers began when Mary Levison petitioned the General Assembly for ordination in 1963. She was eventually ordained as a Minister of Word and Sacrament in 1978, and in 1991 became the first woman to be appointed as Queen's Chaplain. In a Presbyterian Church, elders (who together with the minister form the kirk session and fulfill some of the functions of a parish council in other denominations) are ordained for life - ad vitam aut culpam - though in some cases without the laying-on of hands. The minister (\\"minister of Word and Sacrament\\", to use the full title) is a \\"teaching elder\\", the other kirk session members are \\"ruling elders\\", and the difference is understood to lie in the authority of the appointment rather than the spiritual nature of the ordinance. Consequently, the theological arguments for and against the ordination of women as elders were identical to those concerning women ministers, and the two debates ran in parallel and were settled more or less simultaneously. The General Assembly changed its legislation to allow the ordination of women as elders in 1966 and as ministers in 1968.https://books.google.com/books?id=nbi- tMwsHXwC&pg;=PA250&dq;=Ordination+of+women+in+the+Church+of+Scotland&lr;=&as;_brr=3&ei;=IVUfSqC0CI7EMdLX5f4P&client;=firefox-a, A spiritual home: life in British and American Reformed congregations, 1830-1915, Charles D.

Golden perch are not a true perch of the genus Perca, but a member of the Percichthyidae (temperate perches) family. This relatively widespread and widely stocked species is an important angling fish in Australia. Other common names for golden perch are \\"goldens\\", ‚Äúyellowbelly‚Äù, and \\"callop\\", the last generally used only in South Australia. Description Golden perch are medium-sized fish, commonly 30‚Äì40 cm and 1‚Äì2 kg in rivers. Fish from rivers are smaller and somewhat streamlined ‚Äî fish in man-made impoundments are much deeper-bodied and show much greater average and maximum sizes. In rivers, has been recorded to 9 kg, in impoundments to 15 kg. A 24-kg fish caught from Kow Swamp, Victoria in the early 1900s, and labelled and sold as a \\"Murray perch\\", is often referred to as the largest recorded golden perch, but this record is doubtful ‚Äî this record grossly exceeds all other size records for golden perch, and the specimen in question is far more likely to have been a Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), which grow to far larger sizes than golden perch. Golden perch have an elongated, deep but laterally compressed body, with a sizable mouth, small to moderate-sized eyes, a distinct curve to the forehead, and a distinct \\"hump\\" above the head. The opercula or gill covers possess a small, flat spine sharp enough to cut unwary fishermen's fingers. The caudal fin, soft dorsal fin, and anal fin are rounded. The spiny dorsal fin is short to moderate in length and strong. Golden perch vary from in colour from pale silvery-gold (turbid waters) to deep yellow/gold or bronze-black (very clear waters). A wild golden perch from an upland river: Note the much leaner, slimmer shape of wild specimens and the intense golden colouration. Taxonomy The genus name Macquaria derives from the Macquarie River, where the first species in the genus Macquaria (Macquarie perch, M. australasica) was collected. However, the genus name Macquaria was applied to golden perch much later. The naturalist Richardson actually named golden perch Datnia ambigua and applied the specific name ambigua (Latin for \\"doubtful\\") to the species because, as he states in his species description, he could not decide in which of two genera to place it, Dules (now Kuhlia species) or Datnia (now various Terapontidae species): :‚ÄúI have had much doubt as to whether this fish should be placed in the genus Dules, or Datnia. It agrees with the group of Dules that has two opercular points, in the number of dorsal rays, and in the presence of palatine teeth, but in general habit it is more like Datnia, strongly resembling it in the strength of its dorsal and anal spines, and in the number of rays in the anal. The only two specimens [8.5 and 14 inches standard length] I had the opportunity of examining are dried, and are both mutilated in the caudal fin, so that I am unable to describe the form of that member, and can give no anatomical details.‚Äù This choice of specific name was unwittingly appropriate. Golden perch are neither a khulid nor a terapontid, and Richardson also erroneously stated the golden perch's habitat was \\"Western Australia\\", when in fact the species is not found in that state. (This error was corrected, presumably by Richardson himself, in at least one reprint of the publication in question.) Range Golden perch are native primarily to lowland reaches of the Murray‚ÄìDarling River system, but also extend far into slope habitats and occasionally even lower upland reaches. In the Murray‚ÄìDarling system golden perch are often found in sympatry with Murray cod. The Macquaria perches, of which golden perch are one, continue the trend present in Murray‚ÄìDarling native fish genera of diversification into more generalist lowland species and more specialist upland species. Golden perch, M. ambigua, represent the lowland species, while the closely related Macquarie perch, M. australasica, is the more specialised upland species which used to inhabit the upland reaches of the southern Murray‚ÄìDarling basin, although this endangered species has now been almost wholly displaced by introduced trout species, dams, and associated effects such as cold-water pollution, and habitat degradation/modification. Like many Murray‚ÄìDarling native fish, golden perch have crossed river catchments through natural river capture/connection events. Golden perch are found naturally in the Fitzroy‚ÄìDawson River in central Queensland and the internal Lake Eyre‚ÄìCooper Creek drainage system of Central Australia. The fish has also been successfully introduced to other river systems in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales, confusing studies of the natural range. Introductions into Western Australia have been unsuccessful. Both of these separate populations are at least subspecies, possibly separate species, due to isolation from Murray‚ÄìDarling populations, genetic drift, and natural selection. The taxonomy of golden perch has not been updated to reflect this, although the term Macquaria ambigua oriens, denoting subspecies status, has recently appeared in literature discussing the Fitzroy‚ÄìDawson population. Some researchFaulks LK, Gilligan DM and Beheregaray LB (2010). Clarifying an ambiguous evolutionary history: range-wide phylogeography of an Australian freshwater fish, the golden perch (Macquaria ambigua). Journal of Biogeography. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02304.x indicates the Fitzroy River population is the ancestral golden perch population. Reproduction and biology In the Murray River, wild male golden perch generally reach sexual maturity at 3 years of age and 32.5 cm in length, and wild female golden perch at 4 years of age and 40 cm in length.Mallen-Cooper, M. and I. G. Stuart (2003). Age, growth and non-flood recruitment of two potamodromous fishes in a large semi- arid/temperate river system. River Research and Applications 19: 697‚Äì719. The latter fact is a concern given that minimum size limits for the species are currently less than 40 cm, at 30 cm. Originally, temperatures close to 24 ¬∞C were considered necessary for golden perch to spawn,(Lake, 1967) but as with all Murray-Darling fish species, multiple field studies have shown that their \\"required\\" spawning temperature is flexible and that they can and do spawn at lower temperatures.Koehn & Harrington, 2005 In the Barmah Forests region of the Murray River, for instance, fertilised drifting golden perch eggs have been netted in water temperatures as low as 16.9 degrees Celsius (full range 16.9 to 24.7 degrees).King et al., 2008 Golden perch have a flexible breeding strategy but generally (but not always) require a spring or summer flood or \\"fresh\\" (temporary, within-channel increase in flow) to stimulate spawning. Like some other primarily lowland native fish species of the Murray‚ÄìDarling river system, these floods or freshes appear to be necessary for good survival and recruitment of spawned fish. Very small freshes appear to be sufficient for some spawning and recruitment, however. Golden perch are highly fecund; females between 2.2 and 2.4 kg produce about half a million eggs per spawning event, with fish above 2.5 kg producing well in excess of this number. The eggs are generally planktonic, and hatch fairly quickly (24 to 36 hours).Lake, 1967; Rowland, 1996 Like other Macquaria species, sexual dimorphism is present, with females reaching much larger maximum sizes than males. Females also reach sexual maturity at older ages and larger sizes than males. Very long migrations are part of the golden perch's ecology, particularly preceding spawning. Adult fish have been recorded migrating well over 1,000 km when flood conditions allow passage over weirs and other man-made obstructions.Reynolds LM (1983). Migration patterns of five fish species in the Murray-Darling River system. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 34: 857‚Äì871. Smaller migrations are important in the ecology and dispersal of juvenile fish.Mallen-Cooper & Stuart, 2003 The evidence suggests that before European settlement, huge shoals of golden perch roamed the entire lowland and slope reaches of the vast Murray-Darling River system, unimpeded. Thus, the gradual loss of fish passage through the numerous dams, weirs, locks, and other barriers (estimated at 4,000 in the Murray-Darling systemLintermans M (2007). Fishes of the Murray-Darling Basin: An introductory guide. Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Canberra.) now present has had severe impacts on the species. Some major weirs have been remediated to provide fish passage, however. Golden perch have unusually broad temperature limits, from 4 to 37 ¬∞C, and unusually high salinity limits for a freshwater fish, up to 33 parts per thousand.Merrick JR & Schmida GE (1984). Australian Freshwater Fishes: Biology and Management. J. Merrick, North Ryde, New South Wales.McDowall RM (ed.) (1996). Freshwater Fishes of South-eastern Australia. Second Edition. Reed Books, Sydney. Golden perch continue the trend, among many native fish of southeast Australia, of being very long-lived. Longevity is a survival strategy in the often challenging Australian environment which ensures that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event. These events are often linked to unusually wet La Ni√±a years and may only occur every one or two decades. Maximum recorded age is 26 years. Diet Adult golden perch are carnivores, feeding on smaller fish and macrocrustaceans, including yabbies, shrimp, frogs, small fish, and aquatic invertebrates. Angling Generally a very good angling species (though renowned for being \\"moody\\"), golden perch are fished for throughout their range. Baits include small yabbies and shrimp, as well as various types of deeper-running lures. Recreational harvest of the species is suspected to be significant. Conservation Wild populations have declined significantly, and a number of populations lost in upper reaches of rivers, due to dams and weirs blocking migration, mitigating floods and freshes, regulating flows, and releasing unnaturally cold water (\\"thermal pollution\\"), all of which interfere with migration, spawning, and recruitment. They are listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" for management purposes. Golden perch are extremely migratory and migration appears to have been important in maintaining populations over the length of rivers, particularly the upper reaches. Weirs are proving to be a more significant threat to golden perch than first thought, with a 2006 study showing that about 90% of golden perch larvae passing through undershot weirs are killed.Baumgartner, L.J., Reynoldson, N. and Gilligan, D.M. (2006). Mortality of larval Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) associated with passage through two types of low-head weirs.

Background By 1953, elements of the UN forces were engaged in fierce fighting to prevent the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) forces from gaining ground, prior to a possible ceasefire. This was to deny them additional bargaining power, during negotiations. One such action took place at a feature called \\"the Hook\\", a crescent shaped ridge near the Samichon River, a tributary of the Imjin River near Kaesong. There had been two previous engagements at the Hook earlier in the Korean War during 1952 when first the United States Marine Corps in October, and later the Scottish Black Watch regiment in November, had successfully held the Hook against PVA assaults. This ridge was a place of tactical importance in the 1st Commonwealth Division sector: it was a potential attack route which the PVA needed to take before assaulting Yong Dong, and opening up an invasion route to Seoul, the South Korean capital. On 13 May 1953, the 1st Battalion the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (the \\"Dukes\\") were moved from its position on Yong Dong, to relieve the Black Watch, who had been defending The Hook.DWR War diary, sheet 1, 13 May 1953, National Archives During this period, the Black Watch had suffered 12 soldiers killed, 73 wounded and 20 missing. Over the next two weeks The Dukes were under constant sniper, mortar and artillery fire. This was then followed up in a major action over the 28‚Äì29 May following heavy initial artillery and mortar fire, after which the PVA infantry attacked in force. Between 19 May and 29 May 'The Dukes' suffered 15 killed in action, 95 wounded and 32 missing. They were relieved by the Royal Fusiliers later in the day of 29 May.DWR War diary, report by LtCol F.R St P Bunbury, 29 May 1953, National Archives Battle The PVA forces charged the forward British positions once the bombardment ceased. The Dukes were outnumbered by 5 to 1. The fighting that ensued was bloody and akin to the battles that the 'Dukes' had fought during World War I. Artillery shells rained down on the Hook, from both the PVA and UN forces. The PVA launched a second attack but were cut down by heavy artillery fire from UN forces. Further attacks occurred during the day, but all were defeated in heavy fighting. Successive Chinese assaults on the Hook position defended by the 1st Battalion, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment on the night of 28 May 1953. The fourth Chinese assault on the right flank of 1 battalion, the Duke of Wellington's was repulsed by the 1st Battalion, The King's Regiment, with the aid of artillery support. Just 30 minutes into 29 May, the PVA forces launched another attack, but they were again beaten back. The Dukes began advancing up the line of the original trenches to dislodge the remaining PVA in the forward trenches. The 'Dukes' secured the Hook at 03:30. For their action they were awarded the Battle Honour \\"The Hook\\" =Chinese shelling= Between 19 May and 29 May, PVA artillery fired over 20,000 shells onto the Hook position, and 11,000 of these shells were fired on the night of 28 May, with over 200 heavy calibre shells hitting the Hook positions in the one hour between 17:45 and 18:45. =United Nations shelling= 37,818 shells of all calibres were fired by British artillery and the US Army I Corps artillery, including 155 mm, 8-inch, and 240 mm shells and 325 rockets from a US Rocket Battery.

They consist of seven courses, five of which are offered at both the Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL): Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Design Technology, and, as of August 2012, Computer Science (previously a group 5 elective course) is offered as part of the Group 4 subjects. There are also two SL only courses: a transdisciplinary course, Environmental Systems and Societies, that satisfies Diploma requirements for Groups 3 and 4, and Sports, Exercise and Health Science (previously, for last examinations in 2013, a pilot subjectSports, Exercise, & Health subject guide 2007, p. 4.). Astronomy also exists as a school-based syllabus. Students taking two or more Group 4 subjects may combine any of the aforementioned. The Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Design Technology courses will be updated for first teaching in September 2014, with syllabus updates (including a decrease in the number of options), a new internal assessment component similar to that of the Group 5 (mathematics) explorations, and \\"a new concept-based approach\\" dubbed \\"the nature of science\\". A new, standard level-only course will also be introduced to cater to candidates who do not wish to further their studies in the sciences, focusing on important concepts in Chemistry, Biology and Physics. Structure and assessment All group 4 subjects (except computer science and environmental systems and societies; see below) follow roughly the same format. Each subject has its Subject Specific Core (SSC), i.e., material taught at both the standard and higher levels. Students sitting the Higher Level examination study the Additional Higher Level (AHL) material. Lastly, there is a list of options for each subject from which two are chosen. Higher Level students are sometimes unable to choose certain options that are available to Standard Level students because the AHL already covers it. Ideally, students choose the options based on their own abilities and preferences, but in practice the options are usually chosen by the school (based on the school's scientific facilities as well as the discretion of the instructor). Students spend one-quarter of the 150 hours of SL instruction (240 hours for HL; however, both numbers are merely recommendations and are not enforced) doing practical work in the laboratory. Group 4 subjects at the Standard Level are tailored for students who do not see themselves in further science instruction after leaving the programme. Assessment of a Group 4 subject comprises the following: *Internal assessment of the practical work (24%) *Paper 1 ‚Äì multiple choice questions on the SSC (20%) *Paper 2 ‚Äì free response questions on the SSC (32% at SL, 36% at HL) *Paper 3 ‚Äì free response questions on the options (24% at SL, 20% at HL) At the Standard Level, the examinations are respectively 45 minutes, 1 hour and 15 minutes, and 1 hour long. At the Higher Level, they are 1 hour, 2 hours and 15 minutes, and 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Calculators are not permitted for Paper 1, but they (as well as a provided formula booklet and periodic table) are permitted for papers 2 and 3. Subjects =Physics (2009‚Äì2015)= Standard level 80 hours of instruction on 8 topics * Physics and physical measurement * Mechanics * Thermal physics * Oscillations and waves * Electric currents * Fields and forces * Atomic and nuclear physics * Energy, power and climate change with 30 hours of instruction on two optional subjects: * Sight and wave phenomena * Quantum physics and nuclear physics * Digital technology * Relativity and particle physics * Astrophysics * Communications * Electromagnetic Waves and 40 hours of practical work.

Aside from instruction relevant to this, students are given the chance to learn complex laboratory techniques (e.g., DNA extraction) as well as develop mindful opinions about controversial topics in biology (e.g., stem-cell research and genetic modification). The syllabus lists thirteen topics, to be covered in an order varying from school to school: Standard level 80 hours of instruction on 6 topics *Statistical Analysis *Cells *Chemistry of Life *Genetics *Ecology and evolution *Health and human physiology with 30 hours of instruction on two options from: *Human nutrition and health * Physiology of exercise *Cells and energy *Evolution *Neurobiology and behavior *Microbes and Biotechnology *Ecology and conservation Higher level 80 hours of instruction on 6 topics in the standard course and 55 hours on a further 5 topics: *Nucleic acids and proteins *Cellular respiration and photosynthesis *Plant Science *Genetics *Human health and physiology with 45 hours of instruction on addition topics in the SL course plus: *Further human physiology =Biology (2016‚Äì2022)= Topics =SL/HL core= * Topic 1: Cell biology (15 hours) * Topic 2: Molecular biology (21 hours) * Topic 3: Genetics (15 hours) * Topic 4: Ecology (12 hours) * Topic 5: Evolution and biodiversity (12 hours) * Topic 6: Human physiology (20 hours) =HL extension= * Topic 7: Nucleic acids (9 hours) * Topic 8: Metabolism, cell respiration and photosynthesis (14 hours) * Topic 9: Plant biology (13 hours) * Topic 10: Genetics and evolution (8 hours) * Topic 11: Animal physiology (16 hours) =Options= * Option A: Neurology and behaviour (15/25 hours) * Option B: Biotechnology and bioinformatics (15/25 hours) * Option C: Ecology and conservation (15/25 hours) * Option D: Human physiology (15/25 hours) =Design technology (2009‚Äì2015)= Topics addressed in this course include: *Design process *Product innovation *Green design *Materials *Product development *Product design *Evaluation with additional topics in the higher level: *Energy *Structures *Mechanical design *Advanced manufacturing techniques *Sustainable development. =Design technology (2016‚Äì2022)= Topics =SL/HL core= * Topic 1: Human factors and ergonomics (12 hours) * Topic 2: Resource management and sustainable production (22 hours) * Topic 3: Modelling (12 hours) * Topic 4: Raw material to final product (23 hours) * Topic 5: Innovation and design (13 hours) * Topic 6: Classic design (8 hours) =HL extension= * Topic 7: User-centred design (UCD) (12 hours) * Topic 8: Sustainability (14 hours) * Topic 9: Innovation and markets (13 hours) * Topic 10: Commercial production (15 hours) =Sport, exercise and health science (2014‚Äì2020)=  Topics  = Core = All candidates study the 6 core topics (80 hours): * Topic 1: Anatomy (7 hours) * Topic 2: Exercise physiology (17 hours) * Topic 3: Energy systems (13 hours) * Topic 4: Movement analysis (15 hours) * Topic 5: Skill in sport (15 hours) * Topic 6: Measurement and evaluation of human performance (13 hours) = Options = In addition, they also study two of the following four options (30 hours): * Option A: Optimizing physiological performance (15 hours) * Option B: Psychology of sport (15 hours) * Option C: Physical activity and health (15 hours) * Option D: Nutrition for sport, exercise and health (15 hours) =Environmental systems and societies (2010‚Äì2016)= Topics All topics are compulsory (i.e. there are no options). *Topic 1: Systems and models (5 hours) *Topic 2: The ecosystem (31 hours) *Topic 3: Human population, carrying capacity and resource use (39 hours) *Topic 4: Conservation and biodiversity (15 hours) *Topic 5: Pollution management (18 hours) *Topic 6: The issue of global warming (6 hours) *Topic 7: Environmental value systems (6 hours) The remaining 30 hours are derived from the internal assessment (practical work), making a total of 150 teaching hours. Assessment There are two external assessment components and one internal assessment component. =External assessment= Calculators are required for both papers. * Paper 1 (45 raw marks contributing 30% of the course, 1 hour) consists of short-answer and data-based questions. * Paper 2 (65 raw marks contributing 50% of the course, 2 hours) consists of: ** Section A: Candidates are required to analyse and make reasoned and balanced judgements relating to a range of data on a specific unseen case study. ** Section B: Candidates are required to answer two structured essay questions from a choice of four. =Internal assessment= Candidates will need to complete 30 hours of practical work throughout the course. Each of the three criteria - planning (Pl), data collection and processing (DCP) and discussion, evaluation and conclusion (DEC) - are assessed twice, while the fourth criterion - personal skills (PS) - is assessed summatively throughout the course. The maximum raw mark is 42, which contributes 20% of the course. =Computer science (2014‚Äì2020)= The computer science course was recently updated and moved from Group 5 (as an elective course) to Group 4, becoming a full course, from first examinations in 2014. The structure and assessment of the course has changed to greater emphasize problem solving rather than Java program construction. The curriculum model for the course still differs from other Group 4 subjects however. Topics Standard Level candidates study the SL/HL core (80 hours) and the core of one option (30 hours), while Higher Level candidates study the SL/HL core (80 hours), HL extension (45 hours), an annually-issued case study (30 hours) and the whole of one option (30 + 15 hours). The remaining 40 hours for both Standard and Higher Level comes from the internal assessment component, for a total of 150 teaching hours at SL and 240 hours at HL. =SL/HL core= * Topic 1: System fundamentals (20 hours) * Topic 2: Computer organization (6 hours) * Topic 3: Networks (9 hours) * Topic 4: Computational thinking, problem-solving and programming (45 hours) =HL extension= * Topic 5: Abstract data structures (23 hours) * Topic 6: Resource management (8 hours) * Topic 7: Control (14 hours) =Options= * Option A: Databases (30/45 hours) * Option B: Modelling and simulation (30/45 hours) * Option C: Web science (30/45 hours) * Option D: Object-oriented programming (30/45 hours) Assessment There are three external assessment components and two internal assessment components. =External assessment= Unlike other Group 4 subjects, calculators are not permitted in any computer science examination. * Paper 1 (SL: 70 raw marks contributing 45% of the course, 1 hour 30 minutes; HL: 100 raw marks contributing 40% of the course, 2 hours 10 minutes) consists of: ** Section A (about 30 minutes): Compulsory short answer questions on the SL/HL core and (for HL) the HL extension. Some questions are common to HL and SL. The maximum raw mark for this section is 25. ** Section B (60 minutes for SL, 100 minutes for HL): 3 (SL) or 5 (HL) compulsory structured questions on the SL/HL core and the HL extension. Some questions may be common to HL and SL. The maximum raw marks for this section is 45 (SL) or 75 (HL). * Paper 2 (SL: 45 raw marks contributing 25% of the course, 1 hour; HL: 65 raw marks contributing 20% of the course, 1 hour 20 minutes) consists of 2 to 5 (SL) or 3 to 7 (HL) compulsory questions based on the option studied. For HL, questions in section A (45 marks) consists of the core of the option, which may be common to the SL paper, and questions in section B (20 marks) are based on the extension of the option. * Paper 3 (HL only: 30 raw marks contributing 20% of the course, 1 hour) consists of 4 compulsory questions based on the pre-seen case study annually issued by the IBO. =Internal assessment= Both SL and HL candidates must complete the following: * A computational solution (30 hours, 34 raw marks). Candidates will need to develop a solution for a client to a problem or an unanswered question. This can be in the form of an entirely new system, or an addition of functionality to an existing system. Candidates will need to select, identify and work closely with an adviser, a third-party that can assist the candidate throughout the creation of the product. Candidates will need to complete an electronic HTML cover sheet (not assessed), the product and the documentation of the product (maximum 2000 words in total), including a 2 to 7-minute video showing the functionality of the product. The entire solution and documentation is marked against 5 criteria and is digitally compressed in a ZIP file and submitted for moderation. * The group 4 project (10 hours, 6 raw marks). Candidates will need to complete an interdisciplinary project with other science students. This is marked against the personal skills criterion. Both components carry a weightage of 30% (SL) or 20% (HL) of the computer science course. Group 4 project All students of the Diploma Programme in any of these subjects, with the exception of environmental systems and societies, will compulsorily complete an inter- disciplinary and collaborative investigation called the Group 4 project. The Group 4 project assessment is included in the internal assessment marks. Students undertaking two or more group 4 courses will obtain the same mark for all of the courses.

An early example is the Titanomachy (War of the Titans), in which the Olympian Gods fought against the preceding generation, the Titans. The war lasted ten years and resulted in the victory of the Olympians and their dominion over the world. Another case is the Gigantomachy. The gods were once again divided against one another, each supporting a different side during the Trojan War. In the Iliad, multiple theomachies occur. One is fought between Diomedes with the direct aid of Athena against Ares (part of Diomedes' aristeia in Book 5). Ares is wounded by the spear guided by Athena; this is the first theomachy to occur chronologically in the Iliad. Book 20 begins with Zeus' grant of permission to the gods to participate in the battle and is traditionally known under the title Theomachia. In Book 21 (478ff.) there is fighting between Hera and Artemis. This battle is shown by Homer to be almost playful as Hera is smiling while she boxes the ears of Artemis, which causes Artemis to fly away in tears. Also in Book 21, Poseidon challenges Apollo to fight. Apollo rejects his offer and comments on the triviality of gods fighting over the whims of mortals while their own pain from injury would be transitory and quickly healed. Theomachy is purposely added to show the unbridgeable gap between mortal men and the immortals who rule them. By showing the triviality of divine pain, human suffering is highlighted.

It lies in the most northeast corner of the province Gelderland, about half a mile from the German border. The river Berkel enters The Netherlands east of Rekken. Rekken is also known in international aviation, by the VHF omnidirectional range called 'Rekken' (RKN). In the 12th century Rekken is known in documents as part of the Parish Eibergen. Later it was allowed by the Bishopric of M√ºnster to form an independent parish. The Rekkenaren built a Catholic Church on the northern bank of the Berkel. Around 1616 the Heerlijkheid Borculo, (until then an independent state, where Rekken was a part of) became a property of the duke of Guelders, and with that to the former Dutch Republic. The church in Rekken had to reform to the Dutch Reformed Church, based on the theory of John Calvin. Many Catholics went to church in Oldenkotte, just across the German border. Freedom of religion came when Rekken became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Catholics then built a church on the southern bank of the Berkel. The river and the two churches divided the village in two parts. This is still visible nowadays.

Special lighting effects are projected onto the fa√ßade of a building or ruin and synchronized with recorded or live narration and music to dramatize the history of the place. The invention of the concept is credited to Paul Robert- Houdin, who was the curator of the Ch√¢teau de Chambord in France, which hosted the world's first son et lumi√®re in 1952. Another was established in the early 1960s at the site of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. This nighttime medium naturally lends itself to ecclesiastical buildings, stately homes and ruins, and has rapidly become very popular in France where about 50 annual productions take place, principally in the Loire Valley, at the Palace of Versailles and at Les Invalides in Paris. The format usually involves no active participation by actors but a recorded narrative of the history of the building concerned by one or a cast of voices. To this is added music or sound effects as appropriate, all of which is synchronised to lighting and/or projection effects which provide the visual dimension. Pyrotechnic effects are occasionally included for added spectacle. A relatively recent variation is that, rather than the music and narration coming through a concert-like sound system, they may use headsets, such as in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's \\"Lights of Liberty\\". This allows an audience to move through a historic district as the show proceeds.Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation  Performances around the world In France, son et lumi√®re shows are performed in and around France's historical ch√¢teaux. In neighboring Luxembourg, a son et lumi√®re event took place in 2007 at the Chateau de Septfontaines. In other countries, son et lumi√®re has been mounted at the Forum in Rome and at the Parthenon in Athens. In the United States, the first such presentation took place at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1962. Another presentation took place at George Washington's Mount Vernon in May 1976 as France's bicentennial gift to the United States. The opening performance was attended by French President Giscard d'Estaing and American President Gerald Ford. Further afield, the first African production was at the Pyramids of Giza at Cairo, Egypt, in 1961, while the first in Asia was the Red Fort in Delhi, India in 1965 by the India Tourism Development Corporation. Canterbury Cathedral in England featured a son et lumi√®re in 1965 and more recently in 2005, along with Rochester Cathedral and Castle as part of the European \\"Cathedrales en Lumi√®re\\" project. In Britain, where the majority of such productions have been staged at churches, cathedrals and abbeys, indoor presentations are frequently preferred, particularly as architectural gems might otherwise not be shown to best advantage. The first British production was at Greenwich Palace in south London in 1957. In England in particular, where son et lumi√®re is as well received as it is in France, many of the nations's principal historic houses and church buildings have enjoyed such a production. Of particular interest have been the ones at Canterbury Cathedral (produced as part of the European \\"Cathedrales en Lumi√®re\\" events), Rochester Castle, St Augustine's Abbey, St. George's Hall, Liverpool, Tewkesbury Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, Hampton Court Palace, and at Chartwell, the country home of Winston Churchill. Part of the London 2012 Olympic bid involved the use of son et lumi√®re inspired light projections of athletes upon various London buildings. In India, popular shows are at Red Fort, Amer Fort, Khajuraho, Akbari Quila, Ajmer, Jantar Mantar, Jaipur, Purana Qila, Delhi, and Golconda Fort. Most of these shows highlight historic tapestry of the place. In Peru, a son et lumi√®re show opened in Park of the Reserve, Lima in 2007, called \\"Circuito M√°gico del Agua\\" (magic water circuit) which has a Guinness World Record as the world's largest water source exposed in a public park.Circuito M√°gico del Agua In Canada, the National Capital Commission has sponsored a sound and light show on Parliament Hill in Ottawa every year since 1984, from early July to mid-September. In Australia, Blood Under the Southern Cross, shown at Sovereign Hill in Ballarat since 1992, depicts the events of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion. In Israel, a son et lumi√®re production is presented both at the Tower of David in the Citadel of the Old City of Jerusalem, and at the desert butte of Masada. Composers who have produced son et lumi√®re shows include Jacqueline Nova and Halim El-Dabh. French electronic music composer Jean Michel Jarre has incorporated son et lumi√®re productions into his live concerts, which often take place outdoors at historical sites, sometimes with more than one million spectators. On December 31, 2017, the Burj Khalifa used an LED lighting system to present Light Up Dubai‚Äîa multimedia show that served as its New Year's countdown in lieu of a fireworks show (which had been one of the most expensive fireworks displays in the world). It set a record for the largest light and sound show displayed on a single building; for 2018-19, the show was supplemented by the return of its fireworks.

He is a six-time Emmy Award-winner. Vilanch is best known to the public for his four-year stint on Hollywood Squares, as a celebrity participant; behind the scenes he was head writer for the show. In 2000, he performed off-Broadway in his self-penned one-man show, Bruce Vilanch: Almost Famous. From 2000 to 2014, Vilanch was the head writer for the Oscars, after being an Oscar program co-writer for the previous ten years. He is a featured writer for the Tonys, Grammys and Emmys. Early life and education Vilanch was born in New York City and raised in Paterson, New Jersey. When he was four years old, he was adopted by Jonas Vilanch, an optometrist, and his wife Henne, a housewife. Having her own theatrical aspirations, Vilanch's mother helped launch her son's show business career by getting him signed on with Lane Bryant's Charming Chub division as a chubby child model. Upon graduating from high school, Vilanch attended Ohio State University as a theater and journalism student. While there, he appeared in student theater productions and wrote reviews, hoping it would be the beginning of a career as a playwright. In 1999 Vilanch stated, \\"I was going to be Neil Simon, batting out one Broadway show after another.\\" Vilanch is Jewish and attended Hebrew school, was a member of United Synagogue Youth, and had a bar mitzvah ceremony.\\"A wacky night at the JCC with Oscars joke-meister Bruce Vilanch\\".

Accessed January 19, 2016. Writing career Vilanch's career in the entertainment industry began with writing features for The Chicago Tribune. As an entertainment writer, he began spending time with as many celebrities as would let him. It was how he met then-struggling nightclub singer Bette Midler. Becoming friends, Vilanch later wrote comedy material for Midler's 1974 Broadway show Clams on the Half Shell and co-wrote Divine Madness for her in 1980. Following a move to Los Angeles, Vilanch was a co-writer for The Donny & Marie Show, 1978's negatively received Star Wars Holiday Special, and the short-lived Brady Bunch Variety Hour. After cancellation of the Brady Bunch show, he went on to write jokes for Lily Tomlin, Billy Crystal, Roseanne Barr, Rosie O'Donnell, Paul Reiser, Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, and Robin Williams. The night before the final broadcast of Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show, Bette Midler serenaded Carson with \\"You Made Me Watch You\\", to the tune of \\"You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)\\", with lyrics written by Vilanch, the farewell song later winning an Emmy award. For four years, Vilanch was head writer and celebrity square on Hollywood Squares, next to friend and client Whoopi Goldberg. Since 1980, Vilanch has been a reporter and columnist for The Advocate, writing both humorous and serious pieces. Bruce!: My Adventures in the Skin Trade and Other Essays, a 2000 collection of his writings, was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award. When asking him to write material for one of her concert tours, Barbra Streisand offered what Vilanch felt was a \\"ridiculously low\\" wage. Vilanch declined her offer. She later asked him to write for one of her upcoming Las Vegas appearances. Vilanch co-wrote the book for the musical Platinum, which briefly played on Broadway in 1978. He has also contributed to concert shows starring Michael Feinstein, Bette Midler and Diana Ross. As a songwriter, Vilanch co-wrote \\"Where Is My Man\\" with musicians Fred Zarr and Jacques Morali. The song was popularized by singer/actress Eartha Kitt in 1983. Also with Zarr and Morali, Vilanch co-wrote \\"Sex Over the Phone,\\" a minor hit for the Village People that later became a cult favorite. In 2008, Vilanch co-wrote The Showgirl Must Go On with Midler. The show opened at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, receiving positive reviews. Stage and screen veteran Florence Henderson and Vilanch teamed for An Evening with Friends in 2010. The show featured Henderson sharing songs and stories from her career on stage, screen, and television. Vilanch had a longstanding friendship with Henderson, writing for her one-woman show as well as several of The Brady Bunch Variety Hour episodes in the early 1980s. =Academy Awards writer= Vilanch wrote for the Academy Awards from 1989 to 2014, providing topical joke material for the show's hosts. In the 1990s, Vilanch collaborated with hosts Whoopi Goldberg, David Letterman and Billy Crystal. He became head writer in 2000, serving until 2014. Among Vilanch's duties as Oscar writer were coming up with additional jokes for the host based on unexpected events that have occurred during the telecast. Most memorably, at the 1992 ceremony he came up with a series of one-liners that host Billy Crystal told throughout the night after 73-year-old Jack Palance (Crystal's City Slickers co-star) did one-armed push-ups during his Best Supporting Actor acceptance speech. In a 2010 Vanity Fair interview, Vilanch was asked for whom he wrote the Oscars show jokes, replying: \\"I write across the board. Every year it breaks down differently, depending on the host, but as we get closer to the date, all of the writers tend to be writing over each other. Everyone's contributing to everybody else's work. There are four of us writing the actual show, and you end up writing and rewriting so many things at the same time. So I do a little of everything. There's a lot of mileage involved in writing for the Academy Awards, you go through a lot of hoops.\\" When asked if he could see himself doing the job for another 21 years, he replied: \\"Absolutely. It's the greatest show on Earth. It's like asking somebody, 'Hey, would you like to play in the Super Bowl next year?' Did anybody get into football not to play in the Super Bowl? Does anybody get into show business not to do the biggest show in the world?\\" Acting career In 1975, Vilanch made his feature film d√©but playing a dress manufacturer in the film Mahogany, starring Diana Ross. His professional relationship with Ross continued by writing material for her stage act. In the 1980s, Vilanch had a few acting appearances, including a bit part in an episode of Bosom Buddies and a brief scene in Breathless with his longtime friend Richard Gere. In 1984, he had a role in the comedy/science- fiction film The Ice Pirates. In the 1990s, Vilanch appeared on TV again in Law & Order.

Vinyl gramophone records Vinyl records are easily scratched and vinyl readily acquires a static charge, attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely. Dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops and, in extreme cases, they can cause the needle (stylus) to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backwards, creating an unintentional locked groove that repeats the same 1.8 seconds (at 33‚Öì RPM) or 1.3 seconds (at 45 RPM) of track over and over again. Locked grooves are not uncommon and are even heard occasionally in broadcasts. The locked groove gave rise to the expression \\"broken record\\" referring to someone who continually repeats the same statement with little if any variation. Compact Discs A \\"skip\\" or \\"jump\\" is when the laser of a Compact Disc player cannot read the faulty groove or block of data. Skips are usually caused by marks blocking the path of the beam to the disc, e.g. a finger mark, hair, dirt in general, or a scratch. Since the read mechanism has very little contact with the disc's surface and the data itself is not on the outer layer of the disc, the blockage is not a physical issue as with a record, but rather reflective. =Basic players= Early CD players were very basic in nature. A Laser tracks the blocks of data from the centre of the disc outwards, while the disc itself revolves at a variable speed between a starting speed of 495 RPM, and a minimum finishing speed of 212 RPM. Generally, one cycle constituted one block of data. If there is a faulty block of data, the player may do one of the following: #Repeat the previous block of audio #Skip the faulty block #Try and retry to read it causing a stopping and starting of the music A player may utilise one or more of these techniques, depending on how faulty the data is. In the case of severe, irrecoverable damage to the data, the player may try to rescan the disc to relocate its position. In this case, the machine may make a series of audible chirping noises as the laser is moving from the faulty block to the data information area and back again. =Later players= When CD players began their induction into battery-powered portable machines and vehicles, a skip could happen even for simple movement such as walking, vehicles jerking etc. Therefore a strategy was needed to try to prevent this. When certain techniques were tested and failed, the most successful and popular method to date was to spin the disc faster in order to read a chunk of the data into memory while playing. This meant that the player itself could concentrate on reading while the software controlling the buffers and memory distribution could also act as the audio feed. In the case of a minor error, the disc's rotation would again speed up to facilitate several attempts to read the data. A technique was also developed for testing data to prevent severe skipping. These two techniques were largely successful, unless of course the data was damaged beyond repair, in which case the audio may stop, or skip as before. =CD ROM drives= In a computer, the CD-ROM drive is governed by the program controlling it. In most cases, the BIOS has rudimentary access to the drive for boot purposes, while operating systems usually come bundled with their own drivers. The drive itself has very little instruction, apart from direct instructions, such as spin up, read data etc. When playing a CD in the computer, the media player of choice is giving instructions to the CD drive, whether through the operating system's drivers or by accessing the device's low-level interface itself. Usually, Similar to modern players, the media player will be reading audio into memory for later playback, especially given the extreme speeds used by CD ROM drives in order to access raw data on other discs. Because of this, if there is a fault during playback, the player will already be performing a checksum to verify the data read is correct. If it is wrong, the audio is usually stopped depending on the player. Cassette tapes  Cassette tape players can cause skips when the tape being played is worn or in some other way damaged. Since the tape is rolled into a reel, it depends on how the tape runs across the roll as to how the skip affects playback. Indeed, some early artists such as the Beatles deliberately rearranged the tape reels in order to produce loops used in their recordings. Computer audio Electronic media on a computer can often skip. Such media may include compressed and uncompressed audio, and video containing audio. Generally this cannot happen to music instructive files such as MIDI or Mod files, however depending on the circumstance single notes may become \\"jammed\\", when the note off message is not received by the playback device. Computer skips can be caused by lack of available RAM or processing power, damaged storage mediums (CD, hard drive etc.), a crash in the playback software, or a corrupted, incomplete or damaged audio file. Depending on the player and the operating system, a skip usually consists of a 50MS, 300MS, 500MS or a one second loop, depending on the size or length of the chunk of data that is currently loaded into memory. Skipping as a musical component Compact Disc skipping is prevalent in glitch music.

Lekkerkerk in 1866. Lekkerkerk is a town and former municipality on the Lek River, now part of the municipality of Krimpenerwaard, South Holland province, the Netherlands. Since 1 January 1985 Lekkerkerk is no longer an independent municipality. Lekkerkerk is mostly an agricultural community with its housing, including attractive 17th, 18th, and 19th century farms, stretched out on the dike along the Lek River. Near the Reformed Church (Johanneskerk), the development is denser and forms the town centre. History The oldest evidence of habitation in the Krimpenerwaard is no older than the 10th century. It is assumed that systematic cultivation only began in the 11th and early 12th century, with the river levees functioning as the base. Initially the name of the village and its surroundings was \\"Leckelant\\". The name \\"Leckerkercke\\" was used for the first time in 1276 when a village centre formed around the new church and across the Lek River Nieuw Leckelant began to develop. In 1342 Lekkerkerk was a county with the subordinate fiefdoms of Krimpen (Krimpen aan de Lek and Krimpen aan den IJssel), Stormpolder, Ouderkerk aan den IJssel and Zuidbroek. The first real significant growth of the village started in 1900 when several alleys were built perpendicular to the river dike. After 1950 the growth accelerated. Especially after the inauguration of the Algera Bridge at Krimpen aan den IJssel, the Krimpenerwaard became a popular location for commuters to Rotterdam. In 1980 and 1981 Lekkerkerk gained national notoriety when it was found that the soil underneath the new neighbourhood west of the Kerkweg (Church Road) was very polluted. The cost for removal and clean-up was 188 million Dutch Guilders (85 million Euros). On 1 January 1985, the municipalities of Lekkerkerk and Krimpen aan de Lek merged to form the new municipality of Nederlek. Economy For centuries the economy of Lekkerkerk has been agriculture, fishing, shipping, and ship building. Like so many other peat areas in Holland and Utrecht, agriculture in the Krimpenerwaard was characterized by crop cultivation in the higher lands and the lower areas used for cattle grazing. The primary crop was grain, but hops and cabbage were also cultivated with some orchards and even vineyards present as well. As a result of the important fishing industries along the river, wood and ship building industries developed, as well as ropemaking. Ropemakers used to use hemp for ropes. So hemp has been cultivated on a large scale in the Krimpenerwaard since around 1600. Circa 1930, the Opperduit area still consisted almost exclusively of hemp growers but today the whole Krimpenerwaard is used for cattle grazing.

It has about 16,000 inhabitants. Geography Uhersk√Ω Brod is situated 300 kilometres southeast of Prague, in the south-east of Moravia. It lies in the Vizovice Highlands and near the White Carpathian Mountains. History The history of Uhersk√Ω Brod, a name which can be loosely translated as the 'Hungarian ford' or 'river crossing to Hungary', can be traced back to the 10th century. In 1272 it had become sufficiently important that P≈ôemysl Otakar II granted it the status of a King's town. The 16th century was the all too short golden age of the town, which flourished under the lordship of John of Kaunic (Czech: Jan z Kaunic). The town hall and lords' house were built during this time. The good times came to an end at the beginning of the 17th century when Hungarians started to attack it in a series of invasions. Later, German and Jewish communities began to grow and in the 19th century the town was transformed by industrial development, but managed to retain its character and charm. World War II brought further invasion and the development of military industries. ƒåesk√° Zbrojovka, a precision firearms manufacturer, plays a leading role in the region's industry. It also led to the loss of the town's Jewish community, the striking reminder of which is the Jewish cemetery. =Uhersk√Ω Brod shooting= On 24 February 2015, a shooting occurred at a restaurant in Uhersk√Ω Brod.

On a hill above the town is an observatory from 1961, having been funded and built entirely by the town's residents. the observatory had plans for a large planetarium to help it with its educational message. John Amos Comenius Uhersk√Ω Brod is a possible birthplace of John Amos Comenius. However, most likely it is just a place where he spent a part of his life. There is a museum and a secondary grammar school that bear his name. The link to Comenius was the reason for the twinning of Uhersk√Ω Brod and Naarden in the Netherlands, where Comenius is buried.

Instead of being emptied into a bin lorry on site, as a wheelie bin is, a skip is removed, or replaced by an empty skip, and then tipped at a landfill site or transfer station (waste management). Typically skip bins (skips) have a distinctive shape: the longitudinal cross- section of the skip bin is either a trapezoid or two stacked trapezoids. The lower trapezoid has the smaller edge at the bottom of the skip bin, and a longer edge at the top. The smaller edge on either end is lower which makes it easier to load. Where there is an upper trapezoid, it has the smaller edge at the top. At either end of the skip bin there is a sloping floor or wall. There are usually two lugs on each side of the bin onto which chains can be attached, permitting the heavy skip bin to be lifted onto and off a Skip lorry. A special skip-carrying lorry or crane is used. One end of the skip sometimes has a large door that hinges down to allow manual loading and unloading, these Skips are called 'Drop Door Skips'. Skips are usually durable and tough, made to withstand rough use by tradespeople and labourers. The size of skip bins can vary greatly depending on their use, with sizes ranging from small 2 yard mini skips to the very large 40 yard roll-on roll-off skips. Even though these large bins can store many tonnes of waste, most lorries are limited to carrying around of material in the container. A typical small skip, when empty, weighs about . Types There are several types of skip containers: * Open skips allow easier loading of waste materials and are commonly found on construction sites. * Closed skips are more secure and prevent unauthorized use. They ensure that the volume of waste does not exceed the maximum limit. * Roll-on and roll-off (RORO) skips are similar to open skips, but instead of being lifted onto a skip loader wagon by chains, they are rolled onto a wagon with a hook. They are more common as industrial containers and are not suitable for domestic use. * Mobile skip bins are usually set on a trailer with four wheels. A lifting mechanism is used to load and unload the skip from the trailer. Normal sizes used in Australia are 3m3, 4m3 and 6m3. However, sizes ranging from 8m3, 10m3, and 12m3 are also available for larger waste management jobs. Uses A skip on a lorry, with a sheet covering the top to prevent loose debris from blowing onto other vehicles Skips are commonly used to hold open-topped loads of construction and demolition waste, garden waste or other waste and litter types. The construction debris may originate from a building, renovation, or demolition site; building supplies can be delivered to a site in a skip that is later used to remove waste. Skips are also used for various cleaning-out jobs that need much material to be taken away, and at factories producing large quantities of scrap metal. The material in the skip may be taken to a landfill, recycled or recovered/disposed of in some other way. There are wide range of uses of skip bins including construction building, home renovations, handyman maintenance or repair projects, garden or green clean up. Skip hire companies typically print 'level fill' on the sides of skips to instruct users that the contents should not fill or have contents showing above the height of the sides of the skip. This is in part for safety so that contents do not fall out posing a risk to passers-by, and is also aimed at maximising revenue for the skip hire company. Many tradesmen and builders will make use of what are termed 'greedy boards', old doors and other scrap sheet based material, to artificially heighten the sides of the skip and thus get more value for money for tradesmen or builders. If they do that, the skip bin hire provider will charge them an extra fee as the skip will be overloaded. =Domestic skip sizes and uses= 2 yard ‚Äì Mini Skip * Approximately 25-35 black bin bags * Perfect for small kitchen refurbishment * Economical choice for garden/household waste * Fits on most drives and gardens 4 yard ‚Äì Midi Skip * Approximately 45-55 black bin bags * Perfect for small kitchen refurbishment * Economical choice for garden/household waste * Fits on most drives and gardens 6 Yard ‚Äì Builders Skip * Approximately 60-70 black bin bags * Perfect for refurbishment projects * Ideal for house/Attic clearances * Fits approximately of Soil & Stone or Hardcore 8 Yard ‚Äì Large Builders Skip * 80-90 black bin bags * Size of large family car * Ideal for all construction jobs or large hour or garage clear outs * Fits approximately of Soil & Stone or Hardcore =Hazardous waste not suitable for domestic skips= * Tyres * Batteries * Fridges/freezers * Gas bottles * CRTs, TVs, monitors etc * Fluorescent tubes Etymology The origins of calling a rubbish cart a skip (most often found in Australia, New Zealand and the UK) come from the word 'skep', used to refer to a basket.

While the first recorded use of a rubbish skip dates back to 1922, the practice of using skips to dispose of residential and commercial waste became mainstream over the following century, culminating in the modern skip waste disposal system that is used today.

It is between the towns of Aalten and Winterswijk. Bredevoort has presented itself as Bredevoort boekenstad (Bredevoort book town), after the examples of Hay-on- Wye in Wales and Redu in Belgium. There are now more than 20 second-hand book shops in the town. Bredevoort was a herrschaft and a separate municipality until 1818. The villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk included the fiefdom of Bredevoort when it became a part of Aalten in 1818. History The name Bredevoort appears for the first time on a list of properties belonging to the archbishop of Cologne in 1188, who owned shares of the castle Bredevoort. When the count of Steinfurt tried to sell his share of the castle to the bishop of Munster and the count of Loon tried to sell his share to the count of Gelderland, a conflict broke out between the bishop and the count of Gelderland. The fight lasted for almost two centuries. From 1326, after 4 years of battle between Reginald II, Duke of Guelders and the Prince-Bishopric of M√ºnster Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1697 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership. The former municipality of Bredevoort was composed of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk. Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange conquered Bredevoort in the year 1597 on the Spanish occupation. The Spanish reconquered the city in 1606, but Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange liberated the garrison and citizens who had retreated in the Castle of Bredevoort. In 1646, lightning hit the gunpowder tower of the castle, causing an explosion that destroyed parts of the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. In the rampjaar (\\"disaster year\\") 1672 Bernhard von Galen reconquered the city and occupied city and herrschaft for almost two years. In 1697 received William III of England the city and herrschaft from the States of Gelderland. From that day until 1795 the city and herrschaft was a personal belonging to the House of Orange- Nassau. King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands is still Lord of Bredevoort. After centuries of war, its fortifications were demolished by its inhabitants.Staring Instituut: Bredevoort een Heerlijkheid\\", (first edition 1988) In 1818, the municipality of Bredevoort was dissolved to become part of the city Bredevoort under the newly formed municipality Aalten.

History The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, passed through the area on its way north, camping for three days near today's San Gregorio, October 24‚Äì26, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, \\"This is a fine place, with good lands and an abundance of water, where a good mission could be placed\\". No mission was ever established here, however. The string of Spanish Missions established over the next 50 years followed a more inland route through San Jose. During the Mexican era, the area was part of Rancho San Gregoria. Interior of San Gregorio General Store Named after Pope Gregory I (Saint Gregory the Great). San Gregorio was a booming town in the 1850s, when wealthy San Franciscans would travel to the San Gregorio House by stagecoach to enjoy fishing, hunting, sea bathing, and boat races. The building still stands, but is no longer a functioning hotel. In the nineteenth century, a Chinese community had lived along the creek which runs through San Gregorio however, the buildings of the former community were washed away due to heavy rains. The San Gregorio General Store has been operating since 1889. The original stagecoach stop stands across Highway 84 from the store. In 1915, the community was home to seven cheese factories. San Gregorio has been the site of several film locations and television show episode scenes.

The 16th-century harbour of Puttershoek Typical 18th- century farm Wind mill De Lelie Puttershoek is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands. It is located on the banks of the Oude Maas, on the island Hoeksche Waard, in the province of South Holland. On January 1, 1984, the municipality of Puttershoek was merged with several others into Binnenmaas. With 6,293 inhabitants (1 January 2005) Puttershoek was the largest settlement in the municipality of Binnenmaas until 's-Gravendeel joined Binnenmaas in 2007. Since 1 January 2019, it is part of the new municipality Hoeksche Waard.Wet samenvoeging gemeenten Binnenmaas, Cromstrijen, Korendijk, Oud-Beijerland en Strijen, 11 July 2018, accessed at overheid.nl History Before the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421) a township named Hoecke was located on the spot of the present-day town. The name Hoecke (meaning Corner) is probably derived from the sharp angle the dike around the former Grote or Zuid-Hollandsche Waard island took here. After the St. Elizabeth's flood, the land was owned by the Lords of Putten, who loaned it to a vassal lord. The first four vassal lords of Hoecke were all named Pieter. It remains unclear if the name Puttershoek is taken from Pietershoeck, or if it is a reference to the Lords of Putten. Until the 19th century, Puttershoek was a small and remote village, where reed cutting was the main source of income. However, in 1912 a large sugar beet processing plant was built in the village, bringing not only employment and a sweet odour during fall, but also employees from the Catholic North Brabant province. A thriving Catholic community was founded in the very Protestant village, building one of only two Catholic churches on the Hoeksche Waard island. During World War II, V-1 missiles were launched from the factory by the German occupying forces. The factory was bombed, and was rebuilt after the war. At the end of 2004, the sugar mill closed its doors.Waardestelling Suikerfabriek Puttershoek rapportage Erfgoedhuis (mei 2009).pdf Most of its buildings were demolished in 2012. Puttershoek was partially flooded during the big North Sea flood of 1953. After the flood the dike along the Oude Maas was raised.

The Protestant church was built in 1839, replacing a 15th- century church in the same location. Part of the church tower and the interior date back to the previous structure. The former town hall was built in 1835 in the neoclassicist style. The port is lined with 17th-century houses with characteristic gables. The old post office Het Springende Peerd, with stepped gable and gable stone, dates from 1648. There are several large 18th- and 19th-century farms along the Arent van Lierstraat. The windmill De Lelie, on the Molendijk towards 's-Gravendeel, was built in 1836 and renovated in 1986. In the lower part of town there are several wooden houses, donated by the Norwegian government after World War II.

The method was developed from the 1970s to the 1990s by George Adomian, chair of the Center for Applied Mathematics at the University of Georgia. It is further extensible to stochastic systems by using the Ito integral. The aim of this method is towards a unified theory for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE); an aim which has been superseded by the more general theory of the homotopy analysis method. The crucial aspect of the method is employment of the \\"Adomian polynomials\\" which allow for solution convergence of the nonlinear portion of the equation, without simply linearizing the system. These polynomials mathematically generalize to a Maclaurin series about an arbitrary external parameter; which gives the solution method more flexibility than direct Taylor series expansion.  Ordinary differential equations  Adomian method is well suited to solve Cauchy problems, an important class of problems which include initial conditions problems. = Application to a first order nonlinear system = An example of initial condition problem for an ordinary differential equation is the following: : y^\\\\prime(t) + y^{2}(t) = -1, : y(0) = 0. To solve the problem, the highest degree differential operator (written here as L) is put on the left side, in the following way: : Ly = -1 - y^{2}, with L = d/dt and L^{-1}=\\\\int_{0}^{t}() . Now the solution is assumed to be an infinite series of contributions: : y = y_{0} + y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} + \\\\cdots. Replacing in the previous expression, we obtain: : (y_{0} + y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} + \\\\cdots) = y(0) + L^{-1}[-1 - (y_{0} + y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} + \\\\cdots)^{2}]. Now we identify y0 with some explicit expression on the right, and yi, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., with some expression on the right containing terms of lower order than i. For instance: : \\\\begin{align} &y;_{0} &=&\\\\ y(0)+ L^{-1}(-1) &=& -t \\\\\\\\\\\\ &y;_{1} &=& -L^{-1}(y_{0}^{2}) =-L^{-1}(t^{2}) &=& -t^{3}/3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &y;_{2} &=& -L^{-1}(2y_{0}y_{1}) &=& -2t^{5}/15 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &y;_{3} &=& -L^{-1}(y_{1}^{2}+2y_{0}y_{2}) &=& -17t^{7}/315. \\\\end{align} In this way, any contribution can be explicitly calculated at any order. If we settle for the four first terms, the approximant is the following: : \\\\begin{align} y &= y_{0} + y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} + \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = -\\\\left[ t + \\\\frac{1}{3} t^{3} + \\\\frac{2}{15} t^{5} + \\\\frac{17}{315} t^{7} + \\\\cdots \\\\right] \\\\end{align} = Application to Blasius equation = A second example, with more complex boundary conditions is the Blasius equation for a flow in a boundary layer: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{3} u}{\\\\mathrm{d} x^{3}} + \\\\frac{1}{2} u \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{2} u}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^{2}} = 0 With the following conditions at the boundaries: : \\\\begin{align} u(0) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ u^{\\\\prime}(0) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ u^{\\\\prime}(x) &\\\\to 1, \\\\qquad x \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\end{align} Linear and non- linear operators are now called L = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{3} }{\\\\mathrm{d} x^{3}} and N =\\\\frac{1}{2} u \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^{2}}, respectively. Then, the expression becomes: : L u + N u = 0 and the solution may be expressed, in this case, in the following simple way: : u = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta x + \\\\gamma x^{2}/2 - L^{-1} N u where: L^{-1} \\\\xi (x) = \\\\int dx \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\;\\\\; \\\\xi(x) If: : \\\\begin{align} u &= u^{0} + u^{1} + u^{2} + \\\\cdots + u^{N} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\alpha + \\\\beta x + \\\\gamma x^{2}/2 - \\\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1} (u^{0}+u^{1}+u^{2}+\\\\cdots+u^{N}) \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^{2}}(u^{0} + u^{1} + u^{2} + \\\\cdots + u^{N}) \\\\end{align} and: : \\\\begin{align} &u;^{0} &=& \\\\alpha + \\\\beta x + \\\\gamma x^{2}/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &u;^{1} &=& -\\\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1}(u^{0}u^{0}) &=& -L^{-1} A_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &u;^{2} &=& -\\\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1}(u^{1}u^{0}+u^{0}u^{1}) &=& -L^{-1} A_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &u;^{3} &=& -\\\\frac{1}{2} L^{-1}(u^{2}u^{0}+u^{1}u^{1}+u^{0}u^{2}) &=& -L^{-1} A_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &&\\\\cdots& \\\\end{align} Adomian‚Äôs polynomials to linearize the non-linear term can be obtained systematically by using the following rule: : A_{n} = \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{n}}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda^{n}} f(u(\\\\lambda))\\\\mid_{\\\\lambda=0}, where: \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{n}}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\lambda^{n}} u(\\\\lambda)\\\\mid_{\\\\lambda=0} = n! u_{n} Boundary conditions must be applied, in general, at the end of each approximation. In this case, the integration constants must be grouped into three final independent constants. However, in our example, the three constants appear grouped from the beginning in the form shown in the formal solution above. After applying the two first boundary conditions we obtain the so-called Blasius series: : u = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2} x^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x^5}{5!}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{11 \\\\gamma^{3}}{4}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x^{8}}{8!}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{375 \\\\gamma^{4}}{8} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^{11}}{11!}\\\\right) + \\\\cdots To obtain Œ≥ we have to apply boundary conditions at ‚àû, which may be done by writing the series as a Pad√© approximant: : f(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{L+M} c_{n} z^{n} = \\\\frac{a_{0} + a_{1}z + \\\\cdots + a_{L}z^{L}}{b_{0} + b_{1} z + \\\\cdots + b_{M}z^{M}} where L = M. The limit at \\\\infty of this expression is aL/bM. If we choose b0 = 1, M linear equations for the b coefficients are obtained: : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cccc} c_{L-M+1} & c_{L-M+2} & \\\\cdots & c_{L} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{L-M+2} & c_{L-M+3} & \\\\cdots & c_{L+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{L} & c_{L+1} & \\\\cdots & c_{L+M-1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{c} b_{M} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{M-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{1} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] = \\\\- \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{c} c_{L+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{L+2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{L+M} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] Then, we obtain the a coefficients by means of the following sequence: : \\\\begin{align} a_{0} &= c_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{1} &= c_{1} + b_{1} c_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{2} &= c_{2} + b_{1}c_{1}+b_{2}c_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{L} &= c_{L} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\min(L,m)} b_{i} c_{L-i}. \\\\end{align} In our example: : u'(x) = \\\\gamma x - \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^{2}}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^{4}}{4!}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{11 \\\\gamma^{3}}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^7}{7!}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{375 \\\\gamma^{4}}{8} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^{10}}{10!}\\\\right) Which when Œ≥ = 0.0408 becomes: : u'(x) = \\\\frac{ 0.0204 + 0.0379\\\\, z \\\\- 0.0059\\\\, z^{2} \\\\- 0.00004575\\\\, z^{3} \\\\+ 6.357 \\\\cdot 10^{-6} z^{4} -1.291\\\\cdot 10^{-6} z^{5} }{ 1 - 0.1429\\\\, z \\\\- 0.0000232\\\\, z^{2} +0.0008375\\\\, z^{3} \\\\- 0.0001558\\\\, z^{4} \\\\- 1.2849\\\\cdot 10^{-6} z^{5} }, with the limit: : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} u'(x) = 1.004. Which is approximately equal to 1 (from boundary condition (3)) with an accuracy of 4/1000.  Partial differential equations  = Application to a rectangular system with nonlinearity = One of the most frequent problems in physical sciences is to obtain the solution of a (linear or nonlinear) partial differential equation which satisfies a set of functional values on a rectangular boundary. An example is the following problem: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} u}{\\\\partial x^{2}} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} u}{\\\\partial y^{2}} - b \\\\frac{\\\\partial u^2}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\rho(x, y) \\\\qquad (1) with the following boundary conditions defined on a rectangle: : u(x=0) = f_{1}(y) \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad u(x=x_{l}) = f_{2}(y) \\\\qquad \\\\text{(1-a)} : u(y=-y_{l}) = g_{1}(x) \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad u(y=y_{l}) = g_{2}(x) \\\\qquad \\\\text{(1-b)} This kind of partial differential equation appears frequently coupled with others in science and engineering. For instance, in the incompressible fluid flow problem, the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations must be solved in parallel with a Poisson equation for the pressure.  Decomposition of the system  Let us use the following notation for the problem (1): : L_{x} u + L_{y} u + N u = \\\\rho(x, y) \\\\qquad (2) where Lx, Ly are double derivate operators and N is a non-linear operator. The formal solution of (2) is: : u = a(y) + b(y) x + L_{x}^{-1} \\\\rho(x, y) - L_{x}^{-1} L_{y} u - L_{x}^{-1} N u \\\\qquad (3) Expanding now u as a set of contributions to the solution we have: : u = u_{0} + u_{1} + u_{2} + u_{3} + \\\\cdots By substitution in (3) and making a one-to-one correspondence between the contributions on the left side and the terms on the right side we obtain the following iterative scheme: : \\\\begin{align} u_{0} &= a_{0}(y) + b_{0}(y) x + L_{x}^{-1} \\\\rho(x, y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{1} &= a_{1}(y) + b_{1}(y) x - L_{x}^{-1} L_{y} u_{0} + b \\\\int dx A_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_{n} &= a_{n}(y) + b_{n}(y) x - L_{x}^{-1} L_{y} u_{n-1} + b \\\\int dx A_{n-1} \\\\quad 0 < n < \\\\infty \\\\end{align} where the couple {an(y), bn(y)} is the solution of the following system of equations: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\varphi^{n}(x=0) &= f_{1}(y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi^{n}(x=x_{l}) &= f_{2}(y), \\\\end{align} here \\\\varphi^{n} \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n} u_{i} is the nth-order approximant to the solution and N u has been consistently expanded in Adomian polynomials: : \\\\begin{align} N u &= -b \\\\partial_{x} u^{2} = -b \\\\partial_{x} (u_{0} + u_{1} + u_{2} + u_{3} + \\\\cdots)(u_{0} + u_{1} + u_{2} + u_{3} + \\\\cdots) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -b \\\\partial_{x} (u_{0} u_{0} + 2 u_{0} u_{1} + u_{1} u_{1} + 2 u_{0} u_{2} + \\\\cdots) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -b \\\\partial_{x} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} A(n-1), \\\\end{align} where A_{n} = \\\\sum_{ u=1}^{n} C( u, n) f^{( u)}(u_{0}) and f(u) = u2 in the example (1). Here C(ŒΩ, n) are products (or sum of products) of ŒΩ components of u whose subscripts sum up to n, divided by the factorial of the number of repeated subscripts. It is only a thumb-rule to order systematically the decomposition to be sure that all the combinations appearing are utilized sooner or later. The \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} A_{n} is equal to the sum of a generalized Taylor series about u0. For the example (1) the Adomian polynomials are: : \\\\begin{align} A_{0} &= u_{0}^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{1} &= 2 u_{0} u_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{2} &= u_{1}^{2} + 2 u_{0} u_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{3} &= 2 u_{1} u_{2} + 2 u_{0} u_{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} Other possible choices are also possible for the expression of An.  Series solutions  Cherruault established that the series terms obtained by Adomian's method approach zero as 1/(mn)! if m is the order of the highest linear differential operator and that \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\varphi^{n} = u. With this method the solution can be found by systematically integrating along any of the two directions: in the x-direction we would use expression (3); in the alternative y-direction we would use the following expression: : u = c(x) + d(x) y + L_{y}^{-1} \\\\rho(x, y) - L_{y}^{-1} L_{x} u - L_{y}^{-1} N u where: c(x), d(x) is obtained from the boundary conditions at y = - yl and y = yl: : \\\\begin{align} u(y=-y_{l}) &= g_{1}(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ u(y=y_{l}) &= g_{2}(x) \\\\end{align} If we call the two respective solutions x-partial solution and y-partial solution, one of the most interesting consequences of the method is that the x-partial solution uses only the two boundary conditions (1-a) and the y-partial solution uses only the conditions (1-b). Thus, one of the two sets of boundary functions {f1, f2} or {g1, g2} is redundant, and this implies that a partial differential equation with boundary conditions on a rectangle cannot have arbitrary boundary conditions on the borders, since the conditions at x = x1, x = x2 must be consistent with those imposed at y = y1 and y = y2. An example to clarify this point is the solution of the Poisson problem with the following boundary conditions: : \\\\begin{align} u(x=0) &= f_{1}(y) = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ u(x=x_{l}) &= f_{2}(y) = 0 \\\\end{align} By using Adomian's method and a symbolic processor (such as Mathematica or Maple) it is easy to obtain the third order approximant to the solution. This approximant has an error lower than 5√ó10‚àí16 in any point, as it can be proved by substitution in the initial problem and by displaying the absolute value of the residual obtained as a function of (x, y). The solution at y = -0.25 and y = 0.25 is given by specific functions that in this case are: : g_{1}(x) = 0.0520833\\\\, x -0.347222\\\\, x^{3} + 9.25186 \\\\times 10^{-17} x^{4} + 0.833333\\\\, x^{5} -0.555556\\\\, x^{6} and g2(x) = g1(x) respectively. If a (double) integration is now performed in the y-direction using these two boundary functions the same solution will be obtained, which satisfy u(x=0, y) = 0 and u(x=0.5, y) = 0 and cannot satisfy any other condition on these borders. Some people are surprised by these results; it seems strange that not all initial- boundary conditions must be explicitly used to solve a differential system. However, it is a well established fact that any elliptic equation has one and only one solution for any functional conditions in the four sides of a rectangle provided there is no discontinuity on the edges. The cause of the misconception is that scientists and engineers normally think in a boundary condition in terms of weak convergence in a Hilbert space (the distance to the boundary function is small enough to practical purposes). In contrast, Cauchy problems impose a point-to-point convergence to a given boundary function and to all its derivatives (and this is a quite strong condition!). For the first ones, a function satisfies a boundary condition when the area (or another functional distance) between it and the true function imposed in the boundary is so small as desired; for the second ones, however, the function must tend to the true function imposed in any and every point of the interval. The commented Poisson problem does not have a solution for any functional boundary conditions f1, f2, g1, g2; however, given f1, f2 it is always possible to find boundary functions g1*, g2* so close to g1, g2 as desired (in the weak convergence meaning) for which the problem has solution. This property makes it possible to solve Poisson's and many other problems with arbitrary boundary conditions but never for analytic functions exactly specified on the boundaries. The reader can convince himself (herself) of the high sensitivity of PDE solutions to small changes in the boundary conditions by solving this problem integrating along the x-direction, with boundary functions slightly different even though visually not distinguishable. For instance, the solution with the boundary conditions: : f_{1,2}(y) = 0.00413682 - 0.0813801\\\\, y^{2} + 0.260416\\\\, y^{4} - 0.277778\\\\, y^{6} at x = 0 and x = 0.5, and the solution with the boundary conditions: : \\\\begin{align} f_{1,2}(y) = 0.00413683 &\\\\- 0.00040048\\\\, y - 0.0813802\\\\, y^{2} + 0.0101279\\\\, y^{3} + 0.260417\\\\, y^{4} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\- 0.0694455\\\\, y^{5} - 0.277778\\\\, y^{6} + 0.15873\\\\, y^{7} + \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} at x = 0 and x = 0.5, produce lateral functions with different sign convexity even though both functions are visually not distinguishable. Solutions of elliptic problems and other partial differential equations are highly sensitive to small changes in the boundary function imposed when only two sides are used. And this sensitivity is not easily compatible with models that are supposed to represent real systems, which are described by means of measurements containing experimental errors and are normally expressed as initial-boundary value problems in a Hilbert space.  Improvements to the decomposition method  At least three methods have been reported [DOI: 10.1108/03684920310463939] to obtain the boundary functions g1*, g2* that are compatible with any lateral set of conditions {f1, f2} imposed. This makes it possible to find the analytical solution of any PDE boundary problem on a closed rectangle with the required accuracy, so allowing to solve a wide range of problems that the standard Adomian's method was not able to address. The first one perturbs the two boundary functions imposed at x = 0 and x = x1 (condition 1-a) with a Nth-order polynomial in y: p1, p2 in such a way that: f1' = f1 \\\\+ p1, f2' = f2 \\\\+ p2, where the norm of the two perturbation functions are smaller than the accuracy needed at the boundaries. These p1, p2 depend on a set of polynomial coefficients ci, i = 1, ..., N. Then, the Adomian method is applied and functions are obtained at the four boundaries which depend on the set of ci, i = 1, ..., N. Finally, a boundary function F(c1, c2, ..., cN) is defined as the sum of these four functions, and the distance between F(c1, c2, ..., cN) and the real boundary functions ((1-a) and (1-b)) is minimized. The problem has been reduced, in this way, to the global minimization of the function F(c1, c2, ..., cN) which has a global minimum for some combination of the parameters ci, i = 1, ..., N. This minimum may be found by means of a genetic algorithm or by using some other optimization method, as the one proposed by Cherruault (1999). A second method to obtain analytic approximants of initial-boundary problems is to combine Adomian decomposition with spectral methods. Finally, the third method proposed by Garc√≠a-Olivares is based on imposing analytic solutions at the four boundaries, but modifying the original differential operator in such a way that it is different from the original one only in a narrow region close to the boundaries, and it forces the solution to satisfy exactly analytic conditions at the four boundaries.

Playing career A middle-order batsman and occasional medium-pace bowler, Nicholas captained Hampshire to four major trophies ‚Äì the Benson & Hedges Cup in 1988 and 1992, Sunday League (now Pro40) in 1986, and NatWest Trophy (now Friends Provident Trophy) in 1991. Although he captained England A on tour to Zimbabwe in 1989/1990, he was unable to make an appearance for the England senior team. Known for his suave appearance and urbane manner, Nicholas is one of a long line of colourfully dressed characters to captain Hampshire County Cricket Club, including Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie and . Broadcasting career Since his retirement as a player, Nicholas has worked in broadcasting, first as a commentator for Sky Sports, and from 1999 to 2005 as the anchorman for Channel 4's cricket coverage. He worked freelance in 1995 for Sky and others, before signing for Sky Sports in 1996 as anchorman, where his first major role was presenting domestic and international cricket. He led Sky's coverage of England's winter tours to Zimbabwe and New Zealand in 1996/97, and continued this in the West Indies in 1998. His last role with Sky Sports was presenting the network's live and exclusive coverage of the 1998/99 Ashes series in Australia. He commentated for Australia's Nine Network during the Australian summer cricket season until they lost the rights before the 2018/19 season. He anchored the coverage, replacing Richie Benaud as the face of cricket on Nine, despite having once been dropped from the commentary team for reasons that were never fully explained before his reinstatement. Until 2008 he wrote a weekly column for The Daily Telegraph. He was named Sports Presenter of the Year in 2001 by the Royal Television Society, as well as being one of only two presenters to stand in for Richard and Judy. Nicholas presented the second series of the English version of the reality show Survivor. He continued his commitments to Australia's Nine Network in March 2006, anchoring the afternoon coverage of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. He rated fourth in a Melbourne newspaper poll that set out to find the public's choice on the new host of the Australian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. While as Channel 4 anchor for the cricket, Nicholas presented Today at the Test which covered the highlights of the day's play at the England Test matches or the trophy finals. Nicholas was approached by Channel Five to cover England cricket highlights from 2006, the programme being named Cricket on 5. He commentates on the programme with former cricketer Geoffrey Boycott and analyst Simon Hughes, both of whom worked with Nicholas at Channel 4 plus ex-England captain Michael Vaughan. Nicholas served as anchorman and commentator for the Nine Network coverage of the 2013‚Äì14 Ashes series and continues to serve this role for other Australian home Test series until they lost the rights in April 2018. He was part of the world feed commentary team for both the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, and the 2011 World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and 2019 Cricket World Cup in England.

He graduated in medicine at Basel in 1868 and became a physician in Florence, Italy. Like many early naturalists he spent his free time studying fossil mammals. His first publication was on fossil primates in 1872. The Italian government supported him in 1877 and he collected fossils from Calabria, Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. In 1886, he stopped practising as a physician and began to study fossils in the Greek Archipelago with his collections going to the College Galliard at Lausanne and to the British Museum (Natural History). In the British Museum collections he took a keen interest in material from Madagascar. He studied the lemur fauna, both extant and extinct, discovered the new family Megaladapidae (Major 1893), genus and species of the extinct giant lemur Megaladapis madagascariensis (Major 1893), and five new species in the genera Lepilemur and Cheirogaleus. This led to a keen interest in Madagascar and initiated an expedition to it. His field trip was funded by The Royal Society along with funds from Lionel Walter Rothschild, F. DuCane Godman, Sir Henry Peek and himself. The expedition started from Britain on 15 July 1894 and returned on 30 August 1896.

Walter Bellingrath was one of the first Coca-Cola bottlers in the Southeast, and with his wealth built the estate garden and home. He and his wife, Bessie, lived in the home which has since been converted into a museum. The gardens opened to the public in 1932. The site was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on September 14, 1977, and on the National Register of Historic Places on October 19, 1982. Gardens Azaleas in bloom from across Mirror Lake Bellingrath Gardens and Home encompasses approximately along the Fowl River. The gardens feature cabbage palmettos, live oaks, camellias, azaleas, roses, and chrysanthemums year round. Plants featured in winter are tulips, snapdragons, pansies, ornamental cabbage and kale, daffodils, poppies, primroses, and many varieties of narcissus. Plants featured in spring include more than 250,000 azaleas, hydrangeas, Easter lilies, impatiens, salvia, fuchsia, and Pelargonium geraniums. Plants featured in summer are the more than 2,000 roses, allamandas, hibiscus, copper plants, begonias, ornamental peppers, bougainvillea, caladiums, coleus, vinca, and marigolds. Plants featured in fall are over 8,000 bedded, potted and cascading chrysanthemums, hibiscus, and copper plants. History Water feature in the formal gardens The property on which the gardens would eventually be constructed were purchased in 1917 as a fishing camp by Walter Bellingrath, president of the local Coca-Cola bottling plant. Bellingrath bought the property to balance his work-life schedule. The transformation from the \\"Belle Camp\\" fishing post into what is now Bellingrath Gardens and Home is largely thanks to Bessie Mae Morse Bellingrath, who had married Walter in 1906. Mrs. Bellingrath began developing the gardens with architect George Bigelow Rogers in 1927. The home was completed in 1935, encompasses and features hand-made brick salvaged in Mobile from the 1852 birthplace of Alva Smith Vanderbilt Belmont. Ironwork was obtained from the demolished circa 1837 Southern Hotel, also in Mobile. The house design borrowed elements from many traditions and eras. Some of the most obvious are a formal Georgian staircase reminiscent of an English country house, French doors, and a Mediterranean courtyard. Walter and Bessie Morse Bellingrath opened their gardens to the public for the first time on April 7, 1932. The home opened to the general public as a museum in 1956, after the 1955 death of Mr. Bellingrath at the age of 86, and features all of its original furnishings from Mrs. Bellingrath. The Bellingraths had no children, and after Bessie's death in 1943 Walter dedicated the rest of his life to work on the gardens she had worked so hard to create. In 1950, Walter D. Bellingrath founded the Bellingrath-Morse Foundation at the age of 80. The foundation benefits Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Huntingdon College in Montgomery, Alabama, as well as Bellingrath's church, Central Presbyterian, and his wife's family's St. Francis Street Methodist; these institutions receive approximately 80% of the foundation's earnings. Although the gardens receive income from the Bellingrath-Morse Foundation, two-thirds of current operations are financed by admissions, gift shop and restaurant sales, membership, and donations.

Ltd Lim Quee and Sons}} Stadium Merdeka (; English: Independence Stadium) is a stadium in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It has significance as the site of the formal declaration of independence of the Federation of Malaya on 31 August 1957 and the first modern building of the new nation. The stadium is also the site of the proclamation of Malaysia in 16 September 1963. Currently owned by Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), the stadium has a lower and an upper terrace, with a total capacity of 40,000, as well as 14 tunnels entrance, a covered stand, 50 turnstiles and 4 floodlight tower. The stadium was designed by American architect Stanley Jewkes, under the instruction of the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Upon its completion, the stadium holds the world record for the tallest prestressed floodlight towers and the biggest cantilever shell roofs. The stadium was also the largest stadium in the Southeast Asia at the time of completion. The stadium was the principal venue in Kuala Lumpur for celebrations and sporting events until 1998 when the Bukit Jalil National Stadium was built for the 16th Commonwealth Games. Prior to that, the stadium was the home ground for the Malaysian national football team. The stadium witnessed the historic qualifying match of the 1980 Olympic Games, when the national football team qualified the Olympic Games for the first and only time. However, due to the boycott lead by America, the country did not participate in the final tournament. The stadium was also the venue for the Merdeka Tournement until 1995. Besides that, the stadium had hosted three out of the five Southeast Asian Games held in Kuala Lumpur. The stadium also hosted the fight between the legendary boxer Muhammad Ali and British boxer Joe Bugner in 1975, prior to the Thrilla in Manila. In 1975, the stadium also hosted the Hockey World Cup final between Pakistan and India. The stadium is currently a national heritage building. In 2008, the Stadium Merdeka received the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award for Excellence for Heritage Conservation owing to its cultural significance and embodiment of a unique independence declaration event. History = Background = Prior to the opening of Stadium Merdeka, there wasn't a professional stadium in Malaya, with the only stadium in Jalan Ampang ruined by the Japanese army in the World War II. After the war, the Football Association of Selangor (FAS) and the Football Association of Malaya (FAM) had proposed for a stadium to be built. As Tunku was elected as president of the two associations in 1951, both associations fought hard to have a first-class stadium built in Malaya. In 1952, an ad-hoc committee was formed by the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Commissioners to study the proposal, and a report was released three months later. Several proposals were also brought up to the Federal Legislative Council on this matter, including Tunku himself, but was blocked by the Council. After the winning of the Alliance Party in the first general election in Malaya, Tunku, who was now the Chief Minister, started an advisory committee led by E.M. McDonald to study the possibility of building a stadium. On 4 June 1956, a total of 160 proposal plan was submitted to the government. On 2 May 1956, Tunku and McDonald started looking for suitable sites for the stadium, one of the first places they visited was the Chin Woo stadium. While standing on the tower of the stadium, Tunku saw a few athletes practicing near the Coronation Park, and asked \\"Don't you think it would make an ideal spot for Stadium Merdeka?\\" Although McDonald was concerned about the traffic congestion that might arise in the future, Tunku insisted that it was the perfect spot for the country's first stadium. The site was a Chinese cemetery before it became the oldest golf course in Kuala Lumpur, which had been abandoned since 1921. The site was then later called \\"Coronation Park\\" when George VI was crowned as the King of United Kingdom. Before it was decided to build a stadium on that site, several quarters were planned to be built on the site by the Royal Malaysia Police. The uneven ground of the site means that excavation work had to be carried out before it could be constructed. The construction of the stadium would also mean that a small part of the school ground of Victoria Institution would be acquired. Despite McDonald's efforts to persuade Tunku to choose another site for the stadium, Tunku insisted on building the stadium there. On 11 July, Tunku bought this up to the Legislative Council and gained permission from it. Four days later, the project was transferred to the Malayan Public Works Department. = Construction = The stadium was constructed from 25 September 1956 to 21 August 1957, and was designed by the then Director of Public Works Department, Stanley Edward Jewkes. Several engineers such as Lee Kwok Thye, Chan Sai Soo and Peter Low were also involved in the project. The cornerstone of the stadium was laid by Tunku himself on 15 February 1957. Due to budget constraints, most of the construction materials were made locally, which meant that imported materials such as structural steels had to be avoided. To ensure that the stadium would be finished in time, the designing was done by \\"fast- track\\", which means that after each element of the design was finished, it was immediately constructed. The stadium was constructed as an earthed amphitheatre, which means that a part of the stadium is below ground level. The excavated soil was then transferred to the site of Masjid Negara which was originally a valley and was subjected to flooding issues. When the earthworks and excavation were completed, designs of the terrace seating had already been done, and the construction of it began immediately. At the same time, the designing of the covered stands, the upper terraces and the stairs were carried on by the architects. Two contractors were involved in the construction, Lim Quee for the construction of the main covered stands, while Boon & Cheah were responsible for the terrace and the tunnel entrances. Besides designing the stadium, Stanley Jewkes was also responsible for the traffic planning around the stadium. Other than Stanley, architect Edgar Green was also involved in the designing of the interior facilities such as the toilets and the canteen facilities of the restaurant. The stadium held two world records upon its completion: the tallest prestressed floodlight towers at 120 feet and the biggest cantilever shell roofs. The floodlight towers, constructed from Hume culvert pipes, was also the first prestressed tower in the world which was made from precast culvert pipe units. Another interesting feat accomplished at the time is that all four towers were erected without using a crane. The shell roof for the grandstand, made out of concrete, was chosen as it was both economically affordable and aesthetically beautiful. Although the strength of the cantilever roofs were tested before the ceremony, Stanley was concerned that the roof might be unable to withstand the vibrations caused by the firing of the cannons during the ceremony, luckily the event went on well. Engineer Lee Kwok Thye credited the Kongsi Woman, also known as Lai Sui Mui for their role in the construction. The women were responsible for carrying concrete buckets from the ground up to the structures being constructed, where it was then poured into the framework. = Opening and the declaration of independence = The stadium was completed on 21 August 1957, while the opening ceremony was held on 30 August 1957, a day before the country declared independence. The opening ceremony was opened by Tunku Abdul Rahman, which was witnessed by over 15,000 spectators, including foreign athletes. It was also Tunku himself who placed the foundation stone on 15 February 1957. The ceremony includes performances by 1000 students, each wearing a white T-shirt and shorts only, and none of them wore a proper pair of shoe. On 31 August 1957, power was transferred from the British Empire to the newly independent Malayan government. Tens of thousands of people crowded into the stadium, which was built specifically for this occasion. The ceremony was attended by Duke of Gloucester, representing the Queen of United Kingdom, the Malay rulers of the nine states , the last High Commisioner of Malaya Sir Donald Mac Gillivray, foreign dignitaries, members of the federal cabinet and Tunku Abdul Rahman himself. Following the handover of the instrument of the independence from Prince Henry to Tunku, the prime minister read out the Declaration of Independence, followed by the iconic seven shouts of \\"Merdeka\\" by Tunku. Following that, the national anthem was sung for the first time by a multiracial choir lead by Tony Fonseka, while the national flag was raised by Oliver Cuthbert Samuel. The ceremony was continued with an azan call and a thanksgiving prayer, as well as a gun salute. A mass drill were also performed by the students on the event = Plans for demolition = The role of the stadium as the principal venue for celebrations and sporting events in Kuala Lumpur was replaced by the Bukit Jalil National Stadium built in the mid-1990s. The stadium and its land were given to United Engineers Malaysia (UEM) which had intended to redevelop the land into a RM1 billion entertainment and office complex.Lim Kit Siang. Merdeka Stadium and National Stadium - the fifth injustice and disservice in a week to the memory and legacy of Tunku on birthday centenary commemoration - Cabinet and not PNB should designate them national heritage and monuments. DAP Malaysia. 12 February 2003. Retrieved 17 August 2007. In exchange, the company was required to build seven other stadiums in other locations. However, the company did not proceed with the redevelopment due to public outcry and the company's financial difficulties due to the late 1990s Asian economic crisis. The stadium was now owned by Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB). Several options were suggested following the acquirement of the site by PNB, such as redeveloping the stadium for smaller sporting activities, building a sport museum at the site, or relocate it to another site. Nonetheless, the stadium remained as a site for sporting events and concert until this day. = Restoration = In 2007, the stadium underwent massive renovations to restore its 1957 look. With that, the 45,000-capacity stadium was reduced to 20,000, which meant that several of the upper terrace blocks built over the years were demolished. The decision to reduce the capacity of the historic stadium was justified to ensure the integrity of the stadium as it was in 1957, with the Stadium Negara and the Chin Woo Stadium having the capacity to hold larger events. Besides that, the entire stadium was to be decorated as the state it was when Tunku proclaimed independence, which included the word \\"Merdeka\\" written in the stadium and the original seating arrangements of the Malay Rulers, the Queen's representatives and officers. The paintworks, main pavilion, two VIP rooms and the changing rooms were to be restored to its original state as well. The project, which costs RM2 million, was lead by PNB. = Merdeka PNB 118 = In December 2009, it was announced that PNB would be building a hundred-floored skyscraper on the site between Stadium Merdeka and Stadium Negara. The project was officially launched by the then Prime Minister Najib Razak in September 2016. Formerly named as the Warisan Merdeka, the project was estimated to be finished by 2021. The tower, when completed, would be the second tallest skyscraper in Asia and the fifth in the world. The tower would include 83 levels of office space, 16 levels of luxury hotel, and the rest of the floors would be occupied observation deck, restaurants, sky lobby, podium and amenities. Besides that, the project would also include a shopping mall and residental areas. The tower was built on the Tunku Abdul Rahman Park (also known as Merdeka Park), which was built alongside the Stadium Merdeka. Such a move was criticized as the park was supposed to act as a heritage buffer zone. Plus, the park was also a recreation park for the residents in Kuala Lumpur for generations. The project might as well worsen the traffic congestion of that area. There was also concern that the schools nearby might be affected by the project and was forced to be relocated. Sporting events and concerts The Stadium Merdeka, operated by Perbadanan Stadium Merdeka (1963‚Äì1998), was a venue for many major sporting events. These included the football matches for Selangor FA from 1957 until 1994, the fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Bugner on 1 July 1975, and the 1977 Southeast Asian Games and the annual Merdeka Football Tournament (Pesta Bola Merdeka). The Malaysia Cup final between Sarawak and Brunei was held there in 1999 which resulted in a Brunei win 2‚Äì1. The Merdeka Stadium also hosted major concerts. Michael Jackson's HIStory World Tour filled the stadium to capacity (Jackson performed two sold out concerts on 27 and 29 October 1996, respectively, in front of 55,000 people each night.) = Events after 2009 = With the restoration of the Stadium Merdeka, the 45,000-capacity stadium was reduced to 20,000, which meant that several of the upper terrace blocks built over the years were demolished. The decision to reduced the capacity of the historic stadium was justified to ensure the integrity of the stadium as it was in 1957, with the Stadium Negara and the Chin Woo Stadium having the capacity to hold larger events. In February 2015, Kuala Lumpur FA returned to Stadium Merdeka for the first time in 17 years for the team's opening Premier League match of the season against Sabah. The last international match played at the stadium saw the Malaysian team drawing 1-1 with Cambodia in October 2001. Heritage conservation In February 2003, Stadium Merdeka was named a national heritage building. In 2007, Merdeka Stadium underwent restoration to its original 1957 condition as part of Malaysia's 50th-anniversary plans to relive the moment when Tunku Abdul Rahman proclaimed independence there. The restoration was completed by December 2009. The restoration received the UNESCO Asia-Pacific 2008 Award of Excellence for Cultural Heritage Conservation.

It is in the subgenus Pelargonium along with Pelargonium crispum and Pelargonium tomentosum. Description Pelargonium radens is an evergreen perennial plant, growing to up to high. It has deeply cut triangular scented gray-green leaves and in the summer bears clusters of small pink-purple flowers, followed by small curly-tailed brownish seeds. It is originally from the southern and eastern Cape, South Africa, where it grows in ravines or gorges near streams or among shrubs on mountainsides. Etymology Pelargonium comes from the Greek; Pelargos which means stork. Another name for pelargoniums is storksbills due to the shape of their fruit. Radens refers to the coarse, rasp leaves. Cultivars and hybrids There are a few cultivars and hybrids of Pelargonium radens. These include: * Pelargonium 'Candy Dancer' - A rose scented variety. The flowers are less marked than the species. * Pelargonium 'Crowfoot' - A minty rose scented variety. * Pelargonium 'Dr Livingstone' (Synonym - 'Skeleton Rose') - A rose scented variety with less dissected leaves that the species. * Pelargonium 'Radula' - A rose scented variety. Often thought of as a synonym of the species or a named clone. * Pelargonium 'Red Flowered Rose' - A reddish-pink flowered variety that could be a hybrid between one of the other rose scented species. * Pelargonium √ó asperum - A rose scented hybrid between Pelargonium capitatum and P. radens. This hybrid is the most commonly used pelargonium in the perfume industry. Not to be confused with the sweet scented species Pelargonium asperum. Uses Traditionally the edible leaves were used as a flavoring in jellies and in herbal teas. An essential oil extracted from the leaves and flowers is used commercially as a food flavoring and additive (geranium oil, rose geranium oil). This essential oil is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe by the US FDA when small quantities are added to foods. Pelargonium radens is used as a house plant. It is also cultivated as an ornamental in, e.g., North America, in USDA hardiness zones 10‚Äì11. Propagation is by seeds and stem cuttings.

It stands on a 13 acre (50,000 m¬≤) site, located on a commanding position on the slope of a hill of Bukit Petaling overlooking the Klang River, along Jalan Syed Putra. It was replaced by the new national palace as the official residence of the king in 2011. In 2013, it was converted into The Royal Museum and referred as Old Istana Negara. History The palace was originally a double-storey mansion called The Big House built in 1928 by a local Chinese millionaire, Chan Wing. During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, it was used as the residence of the Japanese Governor. After the surrender of the Japanese on 15 August 1945, the British Military Administration (BMA) commandeered it for a senior military officers mess from the rank of brigadier. With the formation of the Federation of Malaya in 1950, the Selangor State Government rented the residence from the owners for Straits Dollars 5,000 a month until Merdeka or Independence in 1957. It was renovated to become the palace of His Majesty the Sultan of Selangor. In 1957, the owners sold the property of 13 acres to the Federal Government at an agreed valuation of Straits Dollars 1.4 Million.The Federal Government then converted the residence into the Istana Negara for the newly created sovereign post of Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaya which was about to achieve independence that August as scheduled. Since then it has undergone several renovations and extensions. But the most extensive upgrading was carried out in 1980, as it was the first time that the installation ceremony of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong was held at the Istana Negara. Prior to this the Installation Ceremonies were held at the Tunku Abdul Rahman Hall in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur with the first one held in 1957. After the Istana Negara was moved to the new palace on Jalan Duta in December 2011, it was later used for a royal exhibition called Raja Kita, in conjunction with the installation of Tuanku Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah as the 14th Yang di-Pertuan Agong in 2012. The exhibition started on 15 April 2012 and was later extended to 8 December 2012. Over 314,757 visitors, both local and foreign visited the exhibition between 15 April and 7 December. It was decided that starting in 2013, two guards in Malay traditional attire would be stationed at the main gateway of the old Istana Negara to revive the nostalgia and tradition of the Malay Sultanate. Information, Communications and Culture Minister Rais Yatim said the practice will help retain the old palace as a must-visit tourist destination. Several rooms and halls at the old Istana Negara will be open to visitors to learn of their use to the previous thirteen Kings who lived in this old royal palace. An inventory will be drawn up of the collections in the palace in the effort to conserve them. Rais Yatim requested the Royal Malaysia Police and the Department of Museums to collaborate in managing the collections. Palace areas and use Istana Negara at Jalan Duta. =Compound= The building is nestled within an 11.34-hectare compound with a variety of plants and flowers, swimming pool and indoor badminton hall. As the palace grounds are not opened to members of the public or tourists, the Main Palace Entrance is a favourite picture spot for tourists. The whole area is fenced up and the Royal Insignia of His Majesty is placed on each steel bar between two pillars of the fence. At the front of the Istana Negara, there is the main entrance which resembles an arch. On each side of the arch, are two guard posts to shelter two members of the cavalry in their full dress uniform similar to the ones at Buckingham Palace, London. From 2013 onwards, the full dress uniform will be in Malay traditional attire as it was during the Malay Sultanate era. In the grounds of the palace is a guard house for the members of the Royal Malay Regiment, one of the two Household Division units in the Malaysian Armed Forces (the other one is the Malaysian Royal Armoured Corps Mounted Ceremonial Squadron). There is also a six hole golf course, tennis courts and a lake in the far end of the grounds. The driveway, lined with cypresses and casuarinas, leads to two entrances ‚Äì an entrance to the West Wing and the other to the East Wing. =East Wing= The Balai Rong Seri or throne room is located in the East Wing and was used only for official and customary functions. These include ceremonial occasions of taking the royal pledge, the installation rite, and the appointment of a new prime minister and the federal government which included investiture ceremonies and the taking of oaths by the government ministers and state governors. This is also where the presentation and acceptance of foreign diplomatic appointments are held. It sometimes serves as a banquet hall. The second hall on the first floor is the Dewan Mengadap where the King receives honoured guests such as Head of States and foreign dignitaries. This hall doubles as a resting place of Sultans and Governors during the Conference of Rulers. The other rooms are Bilik Duta, Bilik Permaisuri and Bilik Menteri. Bilik Duta is where the King grants audience to the Prime Minister and also where honoured guests are received. The Queen receives her guests at the Bilik Permaisuri while the Bilik Menteri is the rest room for guests. =West Wing= Meetings of the Conference of Rulers were held at the Bilik Mesyuarat Raja-Raja situated in the West Wing.

Opened in September 1970, it is named after Audrey Bruce Currier, a member of the Radcliffe College Class of 1956 who, along with her husband, was killed in a plane crash in 1967. The area was formerly used as housing for Radcliffe College, and as such the four towers of Currier House are named for distinguished alumnae of Radcliffe, including the author Barbara Tuchman. Along with Cabot House and Pforzheimer House, Currier is part of the former Radcliffe Quadrangle, known colloquially as simply \\"the Quad.\\" Faculty Deans and Resident Dean The current Faculty Deans are Latanya Sweeney and Sylvia Barrett. The Allston Burr Resident Dean is Laura Johnson. Previous deans have included scholar of Islam and former Dean of Harvard Divinity School William A. Graham, chemist and Nobel laureate Dudley R. Herschbach, and classicist Gregory Nagy. Social atmosphere Currier House entrance Currier dining hall with its stone fountainBecause of its distance from most of the other residential houses, its physical layout (which places most of the house's social space near the entrance), and its small size (it has the smallest population of any house), many Currier residents consider the house to have one of the strongest and most cohesive house communities of Harvard's residential houses. Students routinely rank Currier's dining hall highest among Harvard dining halls in food quality. In 2005, Currier renovated a common space known as the \\"Fishbowl\\" to create an entertainment center complete with a big screen projector and surround sound system. In early 2006, Currier painted many of its interior walls to produce a more colorful atmosphere. Most of Currier's bedrooms are single bedrooms connected by a sinkroom or full private bathroom, a rarity at Harvard (where most dormitories date to the 1920s and are now relatively crowded.) The house is also known for the \\"Ten-Man,\\" a suite of ten single bedrooms surrounding the largest in-suite common room at Harvard College. Additionally, Currier House has a \\"Solarium,\\" a penthouse balcony suite that houses ten students in ten single bedrooms, atop Gilbert, Bingham and Tuchman towers. Athletic success In 2004‚Äì2005, Currier House won the Straus Cup for the first time in over twenty years. The cup is given to the house that scores the most points in intramural athletic competition during the school year. Housing arrangements Currier House consists of four towers containing mostly single rooms adjoined by a sink room or bathroom. In addition to these rooms, Currier also has some of the most coveted senior living arrangements, including the \\"Ten-Man,\\" which is a suite of ten singles and three full bathrooms arranged around Harvard's largest common room, and 3 penthouse suites nicknamed \\"Solarium rooms.\\" Student government Student government in Currier House consists of the Currier House Committee, of which all house residents are members. The committee operates separate from the Harvard Undergraduate Council, to organize student events and manage funding. The Currier HoCo, as the other student government organizations in the Houses, are funded by the UC and maintained by an executive council run my students in leadership positions. Elections for the two Chair positions, as well as all other social organization positions, are held every January during the Super Bowl Halftime show, broadcast in the Fishbowl common space.

In the fourteenth century Bokhoven Castle had been built in the village. It became the center of the Lordship (later county) of Bokhoven, which was a loan of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge.

In 1795 the Lordship Bokhoven was annexed by the First French Republic. In 1800 it was sold to the Batavian Republic, a precursor state of the present Kingdom of the Netherlands in which Bokhoven became a municipality.

The legislature makes the laws; the executive put the laws into operation; and the judiciary interprets the laws. The doctrine of the separation of powers is often assumed to be one of the cornerstones of fair government. A strict separation of powers is not always evident in Australia;. instead the Australian version of separation of powers combines the basic democratic concepts embedded in the Westminster system, the doctrine of \\"responsible government\\" and the United States version of the separation of powers. The issue of separation of powers in Australia has been a contentious one and continues to raise questions about where power lies in the Australian political system. Although it is assumed that all the branches under the separation of powers do not overlap - as in the US, for example - there is sometimes a 'common ground' between all three levels. In Australia there is little separation between the executive and the legislature, with the executive required to be drawn from, and maintain the confidence of, the legislature. In Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd & Meakes v Dignan the High Court of Australia held that a strict division between these two levels was not practical and re-affirmed the Constitution to outline this (German, 2012). The first three chapters of the Australian Constitution are headed respectively \\"The Parliament\\", \\"The Executive Government\\", and \\"The Judicature\\". Each of these chapters begins with a section by which the relevant \\"power of the Commonwealth\\" is \\"vested\\" in the appropriate persons or bodies. The historical context in which the Constitution was drafted suggests that these arrangements were intended to be connected with federal ideas along American lines. On the other hand, the Constitution incorporates responsible government, in which the legislature and the executive are effectively united. This incorporation is reflected in sections 44, 62 and 64 of the Constitution. Legislative and executive powers Currently, there is no constitutional system where there is a complete separation of powers. The strict doctrine exists only in a theory ‚Äì in reality, some overlap is inevitable, though a system of checks and balances has developed. In the Westminster system, ministers (executive) are required to sit in Parliament (legislative). This is to adhere with the concept of Responsible Government. This is also present in the Australian system, being a requirement of section 64 of the Constitution. Ministers of State. The specific requirement for ministers to sit in Parliament established the connection between executive and legislative, effectively preventing an American-style separation of the two. Strictly speaking, any person may be appointed a Minister, but their appointment lapses if they do not gain a seat in either house of the Parliament within three months. This provision was necessary in 1901, as the first government was sworn in on 1 January but the first parliament was not elected until late March (see 1901 Australian federal election). No non-parliamentarian was appointed a Minister since then, until the appointment of Bob Carr as Foreign Minister in 2012. However, the provision is still relevant. It applies when a minister in the House of Representatives loses their seat at a general election; despite no longer being a member of parliament, the Minister will typically retain their portfolio for some days after the election, until the new government is sworn in. It also applied when John Gorton became Prime Minister in 1968; he was sworn in while a member of the Senate, then he resigned to contest a by- election for a lower house seat, which he won, but between his resignation from the Senate and being elected to the House of Representatives, he remained Prime Minister without holding any seat in Parliament. In Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan, the High Court of Australia held that it was impossible, consistent with the British tradition, to insist upon a strict separation between legislative and executive powers., see also It was found that legislative power may be delegated to the executive, and as a result upheld the validity of delegated legislation. By contrast, in its insistence on a strict separation of \\"judicial power\\", the High Court has been less willing to compromise.. Furthermore, the role of the courts was discussed in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), whereby a NSW statute was invalidated since it purported to confer not-judicial functions to court.. The principle that a State Court cannot be assigned powers that are incompatible with its constitutionally protected independence was extended to Territory Courts in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000).. The executive is not only physically part of the legislature, but the legislature can also allocate it some of its powers, such as of the making of regulations under an Act passed by Parliament. Similarly, the legislature could restrict or over-rule some powers held by the executive by passing new laws to that effect, though these could be subject to judicial review. The exceptionally strong party discipline in Australia, especially in the lower house, has had the effect of weakening scrutiny of the executive by the legislature since within the lower house, every member of the numerically larger party will almost always support the executive and its propositions on all issues. On the other hand, the Senate has had the effect of restraining the power of the executive through its ability to query, amend and block government legislation. The result of the adoption of a proportional system of voting in 1949 has been that the Senate in recent decades has rarely been controlled by governments. Minor parties have gained greater representation and Senate majorities on votes come from a coalition of groups on a particular issue, usually after debate by the Opposition and Independents. The Constitution does, moreover, provide for one form of physical separation of executive and legislature. Section 44, concerning the disqualifications applying to membership of Parliament, excludes from Parliament government employees (who hold \\"an office of profit under the crown\\" (iv)) along with people in certain contractual arrangements with the Commonwealth. This was demonstrated in 1992 after Independent MP, Phil Cleary, had won the Victorian seat of Wills. Cleary, on leave without pay from the Victorian Education Department at the time of his election, was held in Sykes v Cleary to be holding an office of profit under the Crown and disqualified. The Court noted that that Section 44's intention was to separate executive influence from the legislature.. Separation of federal judicial power As early as New South Wales v Commonwealth (The Wheat Case), the High Court decided that the strict insulation of judicial power was a fundamental principle of the Constitution... This also applies to tribunals and commissions set up by Federal Parliament which, unlike some of their equivalents in the states, can only recommend consequences. The Federal Parliament itself has the rarely used privilege of being able to act as a court in some circumstances, primarily where it may regard a non-member as acting \\"in contempt\\" of parliament. The reasoning in the Wheat Case was taken further in Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd where a decisive distinction between judicial and arbitral functions was drawn. The High Court made reference to the separation of powers again in R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia (Boilermakers' Case), highlighting that only a Chapter III Court can exercise judicial powers and, that a Chapter III Court is only permitted to exercise judicial power. A consequence of the Australian version of the separation of powers is its role in encouraging judicial deference to the \\"political\\" arms of government. The normal propensity of the High Court is to recognise that separation of powers requires not only that the \\"political branches\\" should not interfere with judicial activity, but also that the judiciary should leave politicians and administrators alone. The importance of deference has been acknowledged in extrajudicial writings, and in decisions such as Drake v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (No 2).. As a manifestation of the separation of powers, a 'Chapter III Court' cannot make administrative decisions. In administrative law this means that the courts cannot substitute an original decision of the executive, but can only decide on its correctness.. The doctrine of persona designata permits non-judicial functions to be conferred on judges in their personal capacity, as opposed to their judicial capacity.. . However, in Hindmarsh Island Bridge case, it was held that this is subject to the compatibility of the conferred non-judicial function with judicial office.. Separation of powers in the States While there are strong textual and structural bases for the independence of the judiciary in the Commonwealth Constitution, the same is not true of the State constitutions. State courts, unlike their federal counterparts, are therefore capable of exercising non-judicial functions. For example, the District Court of South Australia, through its Administrative and Disciplinary Division, conducts merits review of administrative decisions, a function which at Commonwealth level can only be exercised by Executive tribunals. Nevertheless, a degree of judicial independence is maintained at State level by convention. The federal separation of powers also has implications for State courts, due to the fact that State courts may be invested with federal judicial power under section 71 of the Commonwealth Constitution. On this basis it was held in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) that a State court could not be given a function inconsistent with its status as a potential repository of federal judicial power. The doctrine was rarely applied in the early years following Kable, leading Justice Kirby to describe it as \\"a constitutional guard-dog that would bark but once.\\". However, there has been a revival in the High Court's application of the doctrine since 2009. (2015) 40 Monash University Law Review 673. One recent case was South Australia v Totani,. which involved a challenge to the validity of the Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008 (SA).. Section 14(1) of the Act required members of the Magistrates' Court of South Australia to make control orders on application by the Commissioner of Police, provided only that the Magistrate was satisfied that the person subject to the control order was a member of a declared organisation. Even though the functions of the Magistrates' Court under the Act are purely a matter of South Australian law, the fact that the Court is also capable of exercising federal jurisdiction was held to require that it maintain certain standards of independence and impartiality so that it retain the character of a court. Parliamentary scrutiny of the executive and, in particular, by the New South Wales Legislative Council, was tested in the 1990s when Treasurer Michael Egan, on behalf of Cabinet, refused to table documents in the Legislative Council of which he was a member. The Council, determined to exercise its scrutiny of the executive, pressed the issues and eventually adjudged the Treasurer in contempt, suspending him from the house twice. The matters were disputed in three cases in the High Court and the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The results upheld that principle that the Legislative Council does have the power to order the production of documents by a member of the House, including a minister, and can counter obstruction.... However, the extent of the Legislative Council's power in relation to Cabinet documents remains unclear. In 2018 the High Court held that all matters falling within section 75, Original jurisdiction of High Court. and section 76, Additional original jurisdiction. of the Constitution formed part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, including a dispute between the residents of different States. It followed that the federal separation of powers meant that a State tribunal was unable to determine a dispute between residents of different States. Separation of powers in the Territories One of the bases for the separation of powers in the Constitution is that the powers of the Parliament are found in Chapter I, executive powers are in Chapter II and judicial powers are in Chapter III. In 1915 it had been held that the separation of powers precluded the exercise of judicial power by the Inter-State Commission, provided for at section 101, Inter‚ÄëState Commission. in Chapter IV Finance and Trade. The power to make laws for the government of the territories is found in section 122, Government of territories. located in Chapter VI New States. How section 122 relates to Chapter III is \\"a problem of interpretation ... which has vexed judges and commentators since the earliest days of Federation\\". Three of the six judges in the Stolen Generations case, per Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ. held that the separation of powers doctrine did not apply to the power to make laws for a territory under section 122 of the Constitution. The High Court went on to hold in 2004 that federal jurisdiction can be invested by the Australian Parliament in a Territory court as well as in a State court.. In 2015 the question was again considered by the High Court where Gageler J,. and Keane J, held that the power under section 122 was not constrained by the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in Chapter III of the Constitution. Keane J similarly held . The other members of the Court, French CJ, Kiefel and Bell JJ, and Nettle and Gordon JJ, found it was unnecessary to answer the question.

Nicknamed \\"Henry\\" after the Australian poet, Lawson was a fast bowler for New South Wales (NSW) and Australia.Cricinfo.com: Geoff Lawson player profile. He first played for NSW in 1977-78, made his international debut in 1980-81\\\\. Lawson made three tours of England, including the 1989 Ashes-winning tour. For a few seasons in the early 1980s, Lawson was Australia's leading fast bowler, but his career suffered from poor luck with injury. Lawson received the Order of Australia in 1990 for services to cricket and in 2002 he was given the Australian Sports Medal. He is a qualified optometrist who graduated with a Bachelor of Optometry (BOptom) from the University of New South Wales. Since his playing retirement, Lawson has been a coach, commentator and writer on the game. He has broadcast for ABC Radio, Channel Nine and Foxsports, and contributed to the Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers and magazines in various countries. He has coached the Kochi Tuskers Kerala.  International career  Lawson first came to notice in international cricket by bowling a series of bouncers during a brief spell against Geoff Boycott in a tour match between NSW and England in the 1978-79 season. He was called up as a replacement player for the 1979 tour of India, but did not play a Test match. Similarly, he toured Pakistan in 1980 and did not make the Test team. He took three wickets during his debut in the first Test against New Zealand at Brisbane in 1980-81, and played the first three ODIs of his career in the World Series Cup. In only his third Test, Lawson returned 7/81 in the first innings against England at Lord's in 1981, which earned him the man of the match award.Wisden, 1982 edition: 2nd Test England v Australia, match report.

Chosen for nine preliminary ODIs in the World Series Cup, his total of nine wickets was not enough to earn him selection for the finals against the West Indies. Establishing himself as a leading bowler on Australia's tour of Pakistan in 1982, Lawson claimed nine wickets at 33.55 in three Tests on slow wickets not conducive to fast bowling.Wisden, 1984 edition: The Australians in Pakistan 1982-83\\\\.

This included 5/108 in the second innings at Perth during the first Test (where he scored 50 in the first innings), match figures of 11/134 at Brisbane, and 4/46 and 5/66 at Adelaide. Australia won the series 2-1 and regained the Ashes. Lawson enjoyed a successful World Series Cup tournament, capturing 16 wickets at 15.80 in ten ODIs as Australia defeated New Zealand in the final. Geoff Lawson's Test career batting performance. Opting to miss the short tour of Sri Lanka that followed, Lawson returned to the team for the 1983 World Cup. The Australians failed to make the semi-final in a disappointing performance and Lawson's contribution was five wickets in four games. Against Pakistan in 1983-84, he was again Australia's most successful Test bowler in a 2-0 win, taking 24 wickets at 24.16, including 5/59 and 4/48 in the fifth Test at Sydney. Lawson's mediocre figures on the 1984 tour of the West Indies (12 wickets in five Tests) was a primary reason for Australia's heavy defeat in the series, although he performed better on the short one day tour of India later that year. Playing against the West Indies in the Australian season of 1984-85, Lawson returned to form with 23 wickets at 25.60. In the third Test at Adelaide, he claimed 8/112 in a marathon spell on a batting-friendly pitch, then made 49 in the first innings but Australia lost the match, and eventually the series 1-3\\\\. During the season, he played 15 ODIs and took 17 wickets, but surprisingly was never chosen for an ODI in Australia again. Leading an inexperienced bowling attack weakened by player defections to the rebel tours of South Africa, Lawson captured 24 wickets in six Tests against England in 1985 despite suffering bronchial problems throughout the tour. His best was 5/103 in the first innings at Nottingham and a score of 53 in the fifth Test at Edgbaston. However, his wickets were obtained at the expensive average of 37.72, as England compiled a series of high scores and won the series 3-1.Wisde, 1986 edition: The Australians in England 1985. Retrieved 22 September 2007. The weakened Australian team fared little better in the 1985-86 season, playing New Zealand and India. Injury restricted Lawson to only two Tests against the Kiwis, for five wickets. As Australia began rebuilding its team, Lawson was absent for most of the next three years, due to injuries and falling out of favour with the selectors and the captain Allan Border. He played a single Test in both the 1986-87 Ashes seriesWisden, 1988 edition: England in Australia 1986-87\\\\. Retrieved 22 September 2007. and the 1988-89 series against the West Indies.

Lawson recovered to make the 1989 tour of England, when his experience and guile contributed to a resurgence in Australia's performances. Forming a potent pace bowling attack with Terry Alderman and Merv Hughes, Lawson finished with 29 wickets at 27.27 as Australia won back the Ashes with a crushing 4-0 victory.Wisden, 1990 edition: The Australians in England 1990.

He played his last ODIs during the Nehru Cup tournament in India that followed the England tour. In the 1989-90 Australian season, he played one Test against New Zealand (for two wickets) and then took a solitary wicket in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Brisbane. Dropped for the next Test, he failed to regain his place although he continued playing for NSW until the end of the 1991-92 season.  Domestic cricket career  In the Sheffield Shield competition, he captained New South Wales between 1988 and 1992, leading the team to the title in the 1991-92 final, his final first-class game.

Australian bass (Macquaria novemaculeata) are closely related and very similar in appearance to estuary perch (Macquaria colonorum). Estuary perch however tend to remain in the estuarine reaches or (occasionally) the extreme lower freshwater reaches. Hybridisation between the two species is rare overall but relatively common in the far southern extremities of the Australian bass's range.Jerry DR, Raadik TA, Cairns SC and Baverstock PR (1999).

In the 1970s Australian bass and estuary perch were moved into the genus Macquaria ‚Äì one of a number of Australian genera in the family Percichthyidae ‚Äì along with two species of native perch from the Murray-Darling Basin, golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica).McDonald CM (1978). Morphological and biochemical systematics of Australian freshwater and estuarine percichthyid fishes. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 29: 667‚Äì698. Prior to that, Australian bass and estuary perch were in a separate genus, Percalates. (The generic name Percalates is a compound of the generic names Perca and Lates, and arose from an early, erroneous taxonomic belief that Australian bass were an old world perch related to barramundi (Lates calcarifer)). Results from recent research using genetic MtDNA analysis indicate Australian bass and estuary perch do belong in a separate genus to golden perch and Macquarie perch, and has resulted some in researchers resurrecting the genus Percalates and referring to Australian bass and estuary perch as Percalates novemaculeata and Percalates colonorum respectively. A rather surprising and unexpected finding of this research is that the putative genus Percalates (i.e. Australian bass and estuary perch) appears to be genetically closer to the genus Maccullochella (Murray cod and other cod species) than to the remnant genus Macquaria (golden perch and Macquarie perch).Jerry DR, Elphinstone MS and Baverstock PR (2001).

Steindachner does not explicitly state the reasons behind the surprisingly ambiguous specific name novemaculeata that he created for Australian bass. There are several possibilities. It may be a Latin rendering of \\"new\\" (novem) and \\"spotted\\" (maculeata) and refer to the distinct black blotches juvenile bass are temporarily marked with when very small (i.e. <6‚Äì7 cm). It may be a Latin rendering of \\"in an unusual manner\\" (nove) and \\"spotted\\" (maculeata) and refer to the specimens he examined being \\"spotted\\": :\\"The upper half of the body is steel gray with a greenish shimmer, the lower half golden yellow. In the middle of each scale on the upper half of the body is a brownish spot. ‚Ä¶ some little brownish spots sometimes appear at the base of the first dorsal fin ‚Ä¶ The rather big dark spot on the gill cover is blurry ‚Ä¶\\" The most likely explanation however is a Latin rendering of \\"nine\\" (novem) and \\"spines/needles\\" (aculeata) and refer to the spiny dorsal fin, which is relatively high and sharp and which Steindachner indicates is usually (but not always) composed of nine dorsal spines: :\\"Dorsal with 9 spikes.\\" An Australian bass (summer, freshwater reaches) before release. Description and size Australian bass have a moderately deep, elongated body that is laterally compressed. They have a forked caudal (\\"tail\\") fin and angular anal and soft dorsal fins. Their spiny dorsal fin is relatively high, strong and sharp. They have a medium-sized mouth and relatively large eyes than can appear dark in low light or red in bright light. The opercula or gill covers on Australian bass carry extremely sharp flat spines that can cut fishermens' fingers deeply. Australian bass vary in colour from metallic gold in clear sandy streams to the more usual bronze or bronze-green colouration in streams with darker substrates and/or some tannin staining to the water. Australian bass are, overall, a smallish-sized species. Wild river fish average around 0.4‚Äì0.5 kg and 20‚Äì30 cm. A river fish of 1 kg or larger is a good specimen. Maximum size in rivers appears to be around 2.5 kg and 55 cm in southern waters, and around 3.0 kg and 60‚Äì65 cm in northern waters. Australian bass stocked in man- made impoundments (where they cannot breed) grow to greater average and maximum weights than this. Range Australian bass are found in coastal rivers and streams from Wilsons Promontory in Victoria east and north along the eastern seaboard to the rivers and creeks of the Bundaberg region in central Queensland. Australian bass are not found in the Murray-Darling system. Although the system is extensive, it terminates in a sequence of lakes and lagoons and has only one shallow and changeable entrance to the Southern Ocean‚Äîfeatures that appear to be incompatible with the estuarine breeding habits of Australian bass and other aspects of their life cycle. Migratory patterns Australian bass are primarily a freshwater riverine species, but must breed in estuarine waters. Consequently, Australian bass reside in the freshwater reaches of coastal rivers for the warmer half of the year or slightly more and in the estuarine reaches in winter, and are highly migratory in general. A general description of the typical migratory pattern for adult Australian bass in the central (NSW) portion of their range would be: *September: re-enter lower freshwater reaches after spawning *October‚ÄìNovember: movement through middle freshwater reaches *December‚ÄìFebruary: maximum penetration into negotiable upper freshwater reaches *March‚ÄìApril: slow movement back down through freshwater reaches in anticipation of spawning run *May: strong spawning run to estuarine reaches *June‚ÄìJuly‚ÄìAugust: aggregation and spawning in estuarine reaches Obviously the timing of these migratory movements varies from the north to the south of their range, with bass in the far south of their range appearing to move and recruit in spring rather than winter, probably because of colder water temperatures. The timing of these migratory movements are also dependent on river flows, particularly freshes and floods that drown out and make larger rapids and cascades passable. A large wild female Australian bass (early autumn, freshwater reaches) before release. This specimen was making her way down to the estuary for winter spawning. Australian bass are found at their highest altitude in the freshwater reaches of rivers during the months of December, January and February. Research indicates there is sexual segregation in this non-spawning season for resource partitioning purposes.Harris JH (1988). Demography of Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata (Perciformes: Percichthyidae), in the Sydney Basin. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 39: 355‚Äì69. Males inhabit the lower freshwater reaches of rivers while females travel far into the middle and even upper freshwater (upland) reaches. The distance Australia bass travel upstream appears to be limited only by flows and impassable barriers (historically, waterfalls; today, often, dams). Thus, historically, the effective altitudinal limit for Australian bass has been as high as 400‚Äì600 metres in some river systems. For instance, Australian bass originally migrated up to the Dalgety region in the Snowy River, well above Oallen Crossing on the Shoalhaven River and far up the Warragamba River and Coxs River before these rivers were dammed: :\\"Messrs R. F. Seymour and L. Whitfeld were also out for perch, and the first-named did some exploring along the valley of the Cox River and the head of the Burragorang Valley. Mr Seymour found the perch plentiful in the Cox, but his travelling proved very rough.\\" :Angling. Sydney Morning Herald, 8 October 1910. Habitat In the freshwater reaches of coastal rivers in the warmer months, Australian bass require reasonable quality, unsilted habitats with adequate native riparian vegetation and in-stream cover/habitat. Australian bass generally sit in cover during the day. However, they are fairly flexible about the type of cover used. Sunken timber (‚Äúsnags‚Äù), undercut banks, boulders, shade under trees and bushes overhanging the water and thick weedbeds are all used as cover. Such cover does not need to be in deep water to be used; Australian bass are happy to use cover in water as shallow as 1 metre in depth. Australian bass are strong swimmers at all sizes and can easily traverse rapids and fast-flowing water. However, they generally avoid sitting directly in currents to conserve energy. Australian bass easily traverse rapids like these in their coastal river habitats. However, they require floods or freshes to drown out more significant rapids and cascades and make them passable. At night Australian bass display pelagic (\\"near- surface\\") behaviour and actively hunt prey in shallow water and at the water's surface. When aggregated for spawning in the broad reaches of estuaries in winter, Australian bass are less cover oriented, and generally sit in deeper water. Diet Common items in the diet of Australian bass are: * terrestrial insects, particularly cicadas * aquatic macroinvertebrates, particularly Trichoptera (caddisfly) larvae * crustaceans in the forms of freshwater shrimps and estuarine prawns * small fish, particularly flathead gudgeon (Philhypnodon grandiceps), which are common in their freshwater habitats. However, Australian bass are fierce predators and any small creature that swims across a bass pool such as (introduced) mice and native lizards or frogs are at risk of being taken by a large Australian bass, and are regularly taken. Growth and age For reasons that are not clear, Australian bass are extremely slow growing.Harris JH (1987). Growth of Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata (Perciformes: Percichthyidae) in the Sydney Basin. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 38: 351‚Äì361. Australian bass continue the trend present in the larger native fish species of SE Australia of being very long-lived. Longevity is a survival strategy to ensure that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet 'La Ni√±a' years and may only occur every one or two decades. For many years, the maximum age recorded in wild Australian bass was 22 years.Harris JH (1985b). Age of Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata (Perciformes: Percichthyidae) in the Sydney Basin. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 36: 235‚Äì246. However, a wild bass from the Genoa River system has now been aged at 47 years of age. The same study recorded numerous wild bass aged 19 years of age and 29 years of age (corresponding to two separate years of strong recruitment). Reproduction As with other Macquaria species, there is sexual dimorphism in Australian bass. Males tend to have an absolute maximum size of 1.0 kg or less, while females regularly exceed 1.0 kg and sometimes reach the maximum size of 2.5‚Äì3.0 kg. Males reach sexual maturity at 3+ years of age, females at 5‚Äì6 years of age. Australian bass spawn in estuaries in winter, generally in the months of July or August.Harris JH (1986). Reproduction of the Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata (Perciformes: Percichthyidae) in the Sydney Basin. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 37: 209‚Äì235. There is uncertainty about the salinity levels that Australian bass spawn in. Estuaries are dynamic habitats with daily fluxes in salinity due to tides, and are also affected by droughts, floods and freshes (minor, temporary rises in flow), making measurements of preferred spawning salinities for wild Australian bass difficult. However, based on capture of recently spawned larval and juvenile Australian bass in estuaries, the species appears to spawn in a salinity range of 8‚Äì12 parts per thousand (salt water is approximately 36 ppt). Australian bass sperm have no viability at or below 6 ppt, but are most viable at 12 ppt, the latter probably being the most relevant fact. However, it has been reported that Australian bass spawned in salinities of 12‚Äì18 ppt, with this statement based on fishermens' reports of observing wild Australian bass spawnings and some unpublished data gathered by the NSW Fisheries Department.McDowall RM (ed.) (1996). Freshwater Fishes of South-Eastern Australia. Reed Books, Sydney. Artificial breeding of Australian bass is carried out at much higher salinities than natural. Australian bass are highly fecund, with a reported mean fecundity (\\"fertility\\") of 440,000 eggs from the mature wild female specimens examined, and one very large specimen yielding 1,400,000 eggs. The eggs are reported as being demersal (\\"sinking\\") in natural spawning salinities, in which case estuarine vegetation such as sea grass almost certainly play an important role in \\"trapping\\" and protecting eggs. Larvae hatch in 2‚Äì3 days. Juvenile Australian bass migrate into the freshwater reaches after spending several months in estuarine waters. Despite spawning in estuaries, Australian bass rely on floods coming down river systems into the estuaries throughout the winter period, both to stimulate migration and spawning in adult Australian bass and to create productivity increases that lead to strong survival and recruitment of Australian bass larvae. Australian bass adults and larvae may also enter the sea (the latter perhaps involuntarily) during winter spawning in times of flood.

This kind of movement leads to some genetic interchange between river systems and is important in maintaining a high degree of genetic homogeneity (\\"sameness\\") in Australian bass stocksChenoweth SF and Hughes JM (1997). Genetic population structure of the catadromous perciform Macquaria novemaculeata (Percichthyidae). Journal of Fish Biology 50: 721‚Äì733. and preventing speciation. However, this movement has not prevented distinct genetic profiles and subtle morphological (\\"body shape\\") differences developing in different river systems.Jerry DR (1998). Population genetic structure of the catadromous Australian bass from throughout its range. Journal of Fish Biology 51: 909‚Äì920.Jerry DR and Baverstock PR (1998).

Journal of Fish Biology 52: 829‚Äì843. These findings, along with research showing significant differences in seasonal timing of spawning and migration in far south populations stress the importance of using appropriate regional Australian bass stocks for artificial breeding and stocking projects. Conservation Wild Australian bass stocks have declined seriously since European settlement. Dams and weirs blocking migration of Australian bass both to estuaries and to the upper freshwater reaches of coastal rivers is the most potent cause of decline. Most coastal rivers now have dams and weirs on them. If Australian bass are prevented from migrating to estuaries for breeding by an impassable dam or weir, then they will die out above that dam or weir. Some dams or weirs exclude Australian bass from the vast majority of their habitat. It is estimated for example that Tallowa Dam on the Shoalhaven River, once an Australian bass stronghold, currently excludes wild Australian bass from more than 80% of their former habitat (in early 2010 however a \\"fish lift\\" was fitted to the dam). Dams and weirs also diminish or completely remove flood events required for effective breeding of adult bass and effective recruitment of juvenile Australian bass. A related issue is the myriad of other structures on coastal rivers such as poorly designed road crossings that (often needlessly) block migration of Australian bass. Another potent cause of decline is habitat degradation. Unfortunately poor land management practices have been the norm historically in Australia. Complete clearing of riparian (river bank) vegetation, stock trampling river banks, and massive siltation from these poor practices as well as poor practices in the catchment, can severely degrade and silt coastal rivers to the point of being uninhabitable for Australian bass. The Bega River in southern New South Wales is a particularly salutory example of a coastal river so stripped of riparian vegetation and so silted with coarse granitic sands from poor land management practices, that the majority of it is now completely uninhabitable by Australian bass and other native fish. As a slow-growing fish, Australian bass are vulnerable to overfishing, and overfishing has been a driver of decline in Australian bass stocks in past decades. However, the situation has improved markedly now the majority of fishermen are practicing catch and release with Australian bass. Hatchery breeding and stocking of Australian bass is used to create fisheries above dams and weirs but these are causing concern over genetic diversity issues, use of bass broodfish from different genetic strains, and introduction/translocation of unwanted pest fish species in stockings. Stockings can also mask and divert attention away from serious habitat degradation and decline of wild stocks in catchments. Fishing Fishing for Australian bass is a summertime affair, undertaken during the warmer months in the freshwater reaches of the rivers they inhabit. Australian bass are keenly fished for as they are an outstanding sportsfish, extraordinarily fast and powerful for their size. Their extraordinary speed and power is probably due to their significant, strenuous annual migrations for spawning and a life-style that is migratory in general. Australian bass in their natural river habitats are not to be underestimated; they head straight for the nearest snags (sunken timber) when hooked and light but powerful tackle and stiff drag settings are needed to stop them. As mentioned above, during the day Australian bass generally remain close to or in cover (e.g. snags, overhanging trees), and small plug lures and flies cast close to such cover are used. Australian bass will strike at a very large variety of lures from diving minnow-style hard-bodied lures to slowly jigged soft plastic baits, as well as various surface lures such as poppers and surface walkers. In recent years fly fishing for Australian bass using surface flies imitating cicadas has proven to be extremely effective. At night Australian bass are a roaming pelagic feeder and surface lures (which waddle or fizz across the surface of the water) are used. This sizeable wild Australian bass was caught on a fizzing surface lure equipped with barbless hooks (summer, freshwater reaches), and was carefully released. Some of the best Australian bass fishing is coastal rivers and tributaries where access is difficult. Fishing these more remote locations can be extremely rewarding both for the fishing and the scenery. Fishing the more remote bass water is therefore usually the domain of the hardened backpacking fisherman or the dedicated kayak fisherman willing to drag his kayak over numerous logs and other obstacles. It pays for fishermen to remember that wild Australian bass are still a highly migratory when in the freshwater reaches of rivers, and can also be an extremely wary fish in these habitats, much more so than exotic trout species. Australian bass fishermen almost exclusively practice catch and release, which is necessary for the preservation of wild Australian bass stocks. The use of barbless hooks (which can be created by crushing the barbs flat with a pair of needle-nosed pliers) is essential as Australian bass hit lures with great ferocity and are consequently almost impossible to unhook on barbed hooks without serious injury to the fish. Conversely, Australian bass are swiftly and easily released if barbless hooks are used. Responsible fishermen now avoid fishing for wild Australian bass in estuaries in winter, so that this increasingly pressured native fish can spawn in peace. In 2014 the NSW Fisheries Department announced an extended closed season for Australian bass and estuary perch, from 1 May to 31 August. Citations Additional References * Mallen- Cooper M (1992).

Only the Chicago Bears (owned by the Halas-McCaskey family since 1921) and New York Giants (owned by the Mara family since their founding in 1925) have been in the hands of the family longer than the Cardinals. Michael began to enjoy American football when he visited the Cardinals' training camp for the first time in 1969. In 1974, Bidwill's father, Bill, made him one of the team's ball boys including his brothers William Jr., Patrick and Tim. Said Bidwill in 2007: \\"I understood at a young age that when you don't win, there will be criticism.\\" Michael Bidwill attended Georgetown Prep and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from Saint Louis University in 1987 where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta. Later, he graduated from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University in 1990. Michael followed the Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988. From 1990 to 1996, Michael was a federal prosecutor in Phoenix. Professional sports =Arizona Cardinals= While the Cardinals struggled to fill Sun Devil Stadium, Bidwill publicly stated that fans would respond in greater numbers if given a better environment. He additionally emphasized that the team could not compete without the revenue streams a new stadium would bring. The Cardinals have sold out all 100 games played since the stadium opened in 2006. They sold out 12 total games in 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium. In nine seasons at State Farm Stadium, the Cardinals have won their conference once, their division three times, earned three playoff berths and finished .500 or better in 6 of 9. They had two seasons of .500 or better in their 18 seasons (1988-2006) since their arrival in Arizona from St. Louis before moving into State Farm Stadium. In 2007, Bill named Michael as team president and ceded most day-to-day control over the Cardinals to Michael, making his son operating head of the franchise. In October 2014, Cardinals general manager Steve Keim called Bidwill \\"the glue that holds the organization together.\\" Quarterback Carson Palmer said \\"It's easy to say it's the head coach or the GM. It's the owner,\\" Palmer said. \\"And you would never know it. He doesn't want to be here when the media's here. He's not doing interviews left and right, but he's picked the right people to hire and he wants to win. ‚Ä¶ He doesn't have a hand in every decision, cutting this guy, bringing in this guy. He's hired the right people, and he knows it.\\" In July 2018, Bidwill announced his support for longtime friend and fellow Georgetown Prep classmate Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice nominee. The move generated controversy, as Bidwill used the Arizona Cardinals website and social media outlets to voice his support. This came just two months after NFL owners voted to restrict NFL players' ability to protest during the national anthem. After his father's death in October 2019, Michael succeeded his father as chairman. He is only the sixth principal owner in franchise history; it was founded in 1898 in Chicago as an independent team and was a charter member of the NFL in 1920.  Other positions  In addition to his role with the Cardinals, Bidwill has been active in the greater Phoenix business community where he has been an advocate for economic growth and development. From 2008 to 2010, Bidwill served back-to-back terms as Chairman of Greater Phoenix Economic Council (GPEC). He is also a board member of Greater Phoenix Leadership (GPL), an organization composed of the region's top business and civic leaders. In July 2011, Bidwill and 16 business leaders in the state were appointed to the Arizona Commerce Authority Board of Directors. Michael is also a member of the board for the Pat Tillman Foundation, which carries on the legacy of the former Cardinals safety killed in Afghanistan in 2004. In 2010, Bidwill was selected by the Phoenix Business Journal as one of its 25 \\"Most Admired CEO's.\\" In 2009, he received the Leader for Tomorrow award from the Boy Scouts of America. In 2014, it was announced that Bidwill was named the chair of the league's new conduct committee. Composed of representatives of NFL ownership, the committee will review the league's Personal Conduct Policy at least annually and recommend appropriate changes with advice from outside experts. He also chairs the NFL's Security and Fan Conduct Committee, a group of eight club executives that oversees and develops best security practices for NFL facilities. He also serves on the board of the National Football League Foundation, which in 2013 awarded more than $23 million in grants to support youth and high school football programs, health and safety efforts, as well as community health initiatives. Bidwill has also been a member of the league's Business Ventures Committee since 2007 when Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed him to it. Bidwill serves on Arizona's Super Bowl Host Committee. The group oversaw the successful staging of Super Bowl XLII at University of Phoenix Stadium in 2008. It also brought Super Bowl XLIX, which was played on February 1, 2015 and its half billion dollar economic impact to the state. Super Bowl XLIX was played at University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1, 2015. After the 2015 game, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, \\"Arizona earned it ‚Ä¶ this community has wrapped their arms around every opportunity and made the Super Bowl even bigger and better for our fans and for the NFL over all,\\" Goodell said at his annual Super Bowl news conference. \\"We're thrilled about being here, and we look forward to coming back.\\" A January 2014 poll in the Phoenix Business Journal asked \\"what business leader had the best 2013?\\" Michael Bidwill finished first with 34% of the vote. Personal life Bidwill has an airplane pilot's license, which he's had since he was 19. He resides in Paradise Valley, Arizona.

William Berners owned Berners Street in London, which became known later for the Berners Street Hoax. He erected Woolverstone Hall in 1776. A high obelisk was erected in 1793 to William's memory by his son, Charles Berners (1767‚Äì1831), High Sheriff of Suffolk, which was damaged and demolished during World War II. In 1823, alterations and additions were done by Thomas Hoppe, including side wings. The estate passed to Charles's brother and, in the 1880s, Henry Denny Berners, LL.B., Archdeacon of Suffolk, resided at Woolverstone Hall. His son John became the next owner, followed in 1886 by John's brother, Hugh Berners (died 1891), a Royal Navy captain. The estate became the seat of Charles Hugh Berners, High Steward for Harwich, Essex, great-grandson of William Berners. The manor was sold to Oxford University in 1937. It was requisitioned as a naval training establishment during World War II and, in 1950, the London County Council took it over as a boys' boarding school--Woolverstone Hall School.

It is open during daylight hours without admission charge. The arboretum was established in 1972 mainly through the efforts of Ernest Bauer, Professor L. R. Quinlan (landscape architect at Kansas State University), and Bill Flynn (nurseryman from Abilene). Quinlan said that they had discussed the idea of a local landscape arboretum for 40 years before it became possible to gain support from the federal government. The United States Army Corps of Engineers project to create Milford Reservoir, the largest man-made lake in Kansas, created an opportunity for the arboretum, and in 1969 an organization was incorporated under the name Kansas Landscape Arboretum, sponsored by the Kansas State Horticultural Society. In 1972, the organization signed a lease with the Corps for 193 acres of land, and began planting native Kansas plants and creating recreational trails. The arboretum was formally dedicated on May 29, 1976. When initially leased, the arboretum contained only 24 varieties of trees, shrubs, and flowers. It now includes about 1,000 species of native and exotic woody plants including green ash, crabapple, honey locust, juniper, maple, oak, osage-orange, pine, American sycamore, and black walnut. More than 260 of these species are identified with plaques along the Memorial Tree Walk. Much of the area is left in native vegetation. To maintain the overall \\"naturalness\\" of the views, trees with unusual or colorful foliage or particularly distinctive shapes (like \\"weeping\\" trees) are planted in a special display section. There are three short walking trails available, including a Bird Sanctuary Walk with stumps to sit on for bird-watching. The arboretum includes a view of Milford Lake.

The plot follows a deranged man recently released from a psychiatric institution who opens an ice cream factory where he begins using human flesh in his recipes. The film had an estimated $2 million budget and was released direct-to-video, and in recent years has developed a cult following among viewers who see it as an unintentional comedy, and enjoy it for its campy production values. Joe Bob Briggs hosted the film on TNT, when it was shown on MonsterVision. Howard himself made an appearance, discussing the film with Briggs. It was released on DVD in 2004. Plot In a 1950s American suburb, young Gregory Tudor witnesses his local ice cream man, known as the \\"Ice Cream King,\\" murdered in a drive-by shooting. In the present, Gregory has taken over the \\"King's\\" business, calling himself the Ice Cream Prince, and using the man's truck and ice cream parlor. Unbeknownst to the public, Gregory is putting gruesome ingredients in his ice cream such as insects, blood, and body parts, and is using the dilapidated ice cream parlor as a sort of laboratory in which he produces his concoctions. One night, Gregory kills a dog belonging to Nurse Wharton‚Äîhis landlord and one of the orderlies who treated him for his childhood trauma. The same night, Roger, a boy from the neighborhood, goes missing. The other children, having witnessed Gregory's creepy personality, suspect him of kidnapping Roger, but the police and Nurse Wharton do not. The kids, Johnny, Heather, and Tuna, agree to gang up and search for Roger themselves. Soon after, another boy known as Small Paul disappears. The kids are initially unable to prove that Gregory is dangerous, and the police persist in not believing them. Gregory has recurring flashbacks to his abusive treatment at the Wishing Well Sanatorium, and obsessively idolizes the Ice Cream King, visiting the man's grave at odd hours of the night. As the kids dig deeper, it is revealed that Gregory really did kidnap Roger and Small Paul, and is keeping them in a cage at the ice cream parlor. However, Small Paul shows a macabre interest in Gregory's experiments, and so Gregory takes him under his wing. Two detectives investigate the Wishing Well, which turns out to be an unregulated free-for-all; the unstable patients roam freely and cause chaos, while the doctors and administrators are insane themselves. The police now believe the children regarding Gregory's craziness, and prepare to search for Roger and Small Paul at the ice cream parlor. When Gregory kidnaps Tuna, Heather enlists the help of her older brother Jacob to investigate the parlor, but Jacob is killed by Gregory, who also kills Jacob's girlfriend and frightens Heather and Johnny into running around the property. Gregory outsmarts the two cops and knocks them unconscious. By holding a photo of the Ice Cream King over his face, Small Paul causes Gregory to walk into a trap that pulls him into the main ice cream mixer, where Gregory is dismembered by the razor-sharp mixing blade. Roger and Tuna are reunited with their friends, who mention that Small Paul has been sent to therapy. A closing shot shows Small Paul sitting alone in a darkened room, silently churning a bucket of ice cream, his face twisted into an evil leer just like Gregory's.

It was directed by Carpenter, Hooper and Larry Sulkis. It first aired on August 8, 1993. It is notable for its numerous celebrity cameo appearances. The first story, \\"The Gas Station\\", features Robert Carradine as a serial killer, with cameos by David Naughton, Sam Raimi, and Wes Craven. \\"Hair\\" follows Stacy Keach as he receives a botched hair transplant that infests him with an alien parasite. \\"Eye\\" features Mark Hamill as a baseball player who loses an eye in a car accident and receives a transplant, only to be taken over by the personality of the eye's previous owner, a murderous killer. Plot ;Prologue A creepy- looking coroner introduces three different horror tales involving his current work on cadavers in \\"body bags\\". =\\"The Gas Station\\"= Anne is a young college student who arrives for her first job working the night shift at an all-night filling station near Haddonfield, Illinois (a reference to the setting of Carpenter's two Halloween films). The leaving worker, Bill, reminds her that a serial killer has broken out of a mental hospital, and cautions her not to leave the booth at the station without the keys because the door locks automatically. After Bill leaves, Anne is alone and the tension mounts as she deals with various late-night customers seeking to buy gas for a quick fill- up, purchase cigarettes or just use the restroom key, unsure whether any of them might be the escaped maniac. A homeless transient asks to use the restroom, and when a partying couple arrives, she asks the man to check on the bum. He says he is sleeping. After the couple leaves, Annie goes inside the men's restroom, only to find an elaborately grotesque drawing on an evil looking entity carrying beheaded people in the restroom and then the dead body of the homeless man sitting in a pickup truck on the lift in one of the garage bays. She makes a phone call for help which results in her realization that \\"Bill\\", the attending worker she met earlier, is in fact the escaped killer, who has killed the real Bill and is killing numerous passers-by. She finds the real Bill's dead body in one of the lockers. Serial killer \\"Bill\\" then reappears and attempts to kill Anne with a machete, breaking into the locked booth by smashing out the glass with a sledgehammer and then chasing her around the deserted garage. Just as he is about to kill her, a customer named Pete returns, having forgotten his credit card, and he wrestles the killer, giving Anne time to crush the maniac under the vehicle lift. =\\"Hair\\"= Richard Coberts is a middle-aged businessman who is very self-conscious about his thinning hair. This obsession has caused a rift between him and his long- suffering girlfriend Megan. Richard answers a television ad about a \\"miracle\\" hair transplant procedure, pays a visit to the office, and meets the shady Dr. Lock, who agrees to give Richard a solution to make his hair grow back. The next day, Richard wakes up and removes the bandage around his head, and is overjoyed to find that he has a full head of hair. But soon he becomes increasingly sick and fatigued, and finds his hair continuing to grow and, additionally, growing out of parts of his body, where hair does not normally grow. Trying to cut a hair off his mouth, he finds that it \\"screams\\", and, examining it under a magnifying glass, sees that it's alive and resembles a tiny serpent. He goes back to Dr. Lock for an explanation, but finds himself a prisoner as Dr. Lock explains that he and his entire staff are aliens from another planet, seeking out narcissistic human beings and planting seeds of \\"hair\\" to take over their bodies for consumption as part of their plan to spread their essence to Earth. Soon after this reveal, according to the coroner, he jumps off of the building on top of a moving car and then dragged by a moving train. =\\"Eye\\"= Brent Matthews is a baseball player whose life and career take a turn for the worse when he gets into a serious car accident in which his right eye is damaged. Unwilling to admit that his career is over, he jumps at the chance to undergo an experimental surgical procedure to replace his eye with one from a recently deceased person. But soon after the surgery he begins to see things out of his new eye that others cannot see, and begins having nightmares of killing women and having sex with them. Brent seeks out the doctor who operated on him, and the doctor tells him that the donor of his new eye was John Randle, a recently executed serial killer and necrophile who killed several young women, and then had sex with their dead bodies. Brent becomes convinced that the spirit of the dead killer is taking over his body so that he can resume killing women. He flees back to his house and tells his skeptical wife, Cathy, about what is happening. Just then the spirit of the killer emerges and attempts to kill Cathy as well. Cathy fights back, subduing him long enough for Brent to re-emerge. Realizing that it is only a matter of time before the killer emerges again, Brent stabs his donated eye with garden scissors, severing his link with the killer, but then bleeds to death. ;Epilogue The coroner is finishing telling his last tale when he hears a noise from outside the morgue. He crawls back inside a body bag, revealing that he himself is a living cadaver. The noise is shown to be the walking of two other morgue workers; soon they begin to go to work on his \\"John Doe\\" corpse.

It was released direct to video on 24 March 1993.  Plot  Philip (David Naughton) and Alexandria (India Allen) are a married couple that have decided to spend their vacation at a friend's house in the Arizona desert. Their marriage has hit a rough patch due to Philip's work, which has monopolized his time and left Alexandra feeling lonely. Additionally, Alex is encouraged to cheat on her husband by a close friend, which she considers. She's further dismayed when she finds that Philip is still too busy to pay attention to her and pushes him to go to a night bar. Once there the two quickly run into some trouble with a biker, but are saved from harm by Randall (Gary Hudson) and Maggie (Michelle Moffett). They give the two a ride to a trailer park, unaware that Randall is there to get revenge against his ex-girlfriend Celeste (Kathy Shower), who sent him to jail, and that Maggie is a prostitute that Randall has brought along by force. Randall manages to break into the trailer, which terrifies Celeste. Despite his assurances that he is not there to harm her, Randall forces Maggie to kill Celeste. The following morning the two arrive at Alexandria and Philip's vacation home, as Randall had promised to help Philip look for plants for his job. The two men leave to look for plants, only for Randall to push Philip off a cliff. Believing the man to be dead, Randall drives off, unaware that Philip survived and has begun walking back in order to rescue his wife. Meanwhile, back at the house, Alexandria has grown increasingly suspicious that Maggie is a wanted criminal, and at one point tries to call the police, but is interrupted by Maggie. When Randall returns without Philip, Alexandria, driven by a desire to survive and a desire to have an extramarital affair with a dangerous, sexy man, tries to turn the couple against one another by having sex with them both. After having sex with Randall, and realizing she really enjoyed it, Alexandra attempts to run away with him, but to no avail. On his way back to the house, Philip finds his way to Celeste's trailer park and discovers her dead body. Soon after, he is found by the town's Sheriff Brenner (Paul Gleason), who takes Philip back to the vacation house after hearing his story. They arrive at the house and sneak into it in an attempt to save Alexandria. Maggie, who has decided that she is no longer going to follow Randall, is accidentally shot by the sheriff, who is then killed by Randall. Randall then tries to chase after Alexandria, only for her to later turn the tables on him and shoot him. Finally safe, Philip and Alexandria embrace.

Biography Gustav Davidson was born on December 25, 1895 in Warsaw, Poland. In the wake of anti-Jewish pogroms in Poland, his family fled to the United States, settling in New York City in 1907. Davidson received bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University in 1919 and 1920 respectively. He worked for the Library of Congress between 1938 and 1939 and became executive secretary of the Poetry Society of America from 1949 to 1965 (after which he was elected executive secretary emeritus).http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2003/ms003040.pdf A Dictionary of Angels He is today best remembered as the author of A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels (1967), a popular work detailing the types of angel classes and their roles. This was a popularised compendium of angelology from Talmud, kabbalah, medieval occult writers, gothic grimoires and other sources. He also wrote articles, such as on encounters with angels, in the parapsychological Tomorrow magazine of medium Eileen J. Garrett.Tomorrow: Volume 10 1962 \\"THE GUISE OF ANGELS by Gustav Davidson ... Admittedly, encounters \\"in the flesh\\" with angels or demons have become increasingly rare and suspect, but such encounters should not be dismissed as wholly fanciful.\\" Poetry In addition to the Dictionary, Davidson published several collections of his poems, including Songs of Adoration (1919), Twenty Sonnets (1926), Lilith (1928), Mortal Hunger (1943), Thirst of the Antelope (1945), Moment of Visitation (1950), Ambushed by Angels & Other Poems (1965), and All Things Are Holy (1970). He wrote a dramatic adaptation of Melmoth the Wanderer in collaboration with playwright Joseph Koven. As the titles of some of his works indicate, much of Davidson's verse is religious and spiritual in outlook and subject matter. Davidson edited A Half Century of Sonnets (1924), and the 1950 collection In Fealty to Apollo for the Poetry Society of America, an organization for which he served as Secretary. (The Society established a Gustav Davidson Memorial Award in his honor.) He also edited periodicals devoted to poetry: The Poetry Chapbook and Poet Lore: A Quarterly of World Literature. He headed Fine Editions Press and established and ran the Davidson Printing Corporation, both of which specialized in the publication of contemporary poetry. Beyond the confines of poetry, Davidson wrote First Editions in American Juvenilia and Problems in Their Identification (1939) and other works on bibliography and book collecting. He was also active as a translator and a book designer.

It is the first handbook to cover every known living species of bird. The series is edited by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott, Jordi Sargatal and David A. Christie. All 16 volumes have been published. For the first time an animal class will have all the species illustrated and treated in detail in a single work. This has not been done before for any other group in the animal kingdom. Material in each volume is grouped first by family, with an introductory article on each family; this is followed by individual species accounts (taxonomy, subspecies and distribution, descriptive notes, habitat, food and feeding, breeding, movements, status and conservation, bibliography). In addition, all volumes except the first and second contain an essay on a particular ornithological theme. More than 200 renowned specialists and 35 illustrators (including Toni Llobet, Hilary Burn, Chris Rose and H. Douglas Pratt) from more than 40 countries have contributed to the project up to now, as well as 834 photographers from all over the world. Since the first volume appeared in 1992, the series has received various international awards. The first volume was selected as Bird Book of the Year by the magazines Birdwatch and British Birds, and the fifth volume was recognised as Outstanding Academic Title by Choice Magazine, the American Library Association magazine. The seventh volume, as well as being named Bird Book of the Year by Birdwatch and British Birds, also received the distinction of Best Bird Reference Book in the 2002 WorldTwitch Book Awards This same distinction was also awarded to Volume 8 a year later in 2003. Individual volumes are large, measuring , and weighing between ; it has been commented in a review that \\"fork-lift truck book\\" would be a more appropriate title. As a complement to the Handbook of the Birds of the World and with the ultimate goal of disseminating knowledge about the world's avifauna, in 2002 Lynx Edicions started the Internet Bird Collection (IBC). It is a free-access, but not free-licensed, on-line audiovisual library of the world's birds with the aim of posting videos, photos and sound recordings showing a variety of biological aspects (e.g. subspecies, plumages, feeding, breeding, etc.) for every species. It is a non- profit endeavour fuelled by material from more than one hundred contributors from around the world. In early 2013, Lynx Edicions launched the online database HBW Alive, which includes the volume and family introductions and updated species accounts from all 17 published HBW volumes. Since its launch, the taxonomy has been thoroughly revised and updated twice (once for non- passerines and once for passerines), following the publication of the two volumes of the HBW and BirdLife International Illustrated Checklist of the Birds of the World.

AdZU began in 1912 as Escuela Catolica, a parochial school run by Spanish Jesuits. It is the second oldest Jesuit school in the Philippines and the second Jesuit school to be named Ateneo. It initially offered primary and secondary education for boys. It became a college in 1952 and a university in August 2001. It operates in two campuses. The main campus located in La Purisima Street is where the tertiary and senior high school departments are located and the annex campus in Barangay Tumaga, outside Zamboanga City proper, is where the junior high school and grade school units are located. History =Pre-war Ateneo= The Ateneo de Zamboanga University began in 1912 as Escuela Catolica, a parochial school run by Spanish Jesuits at the old site of the Immaculate Conception Church across from the Sunken Garden. Fr. Manuel M. Sauras, S.J., was the first director and served in that capacity up to 1926. Escuela Catolica served as the parochial school of the Immaculada Concepcion Parish headed by Fr. Miguel Saderra Mata, S.J. Classes were held on the ground floor of the rectory of the parish, which was adjacent to Plaza Pershing. While the curriculum was similar to that of the public elementary school, the Spanish Jesuits emphasized religious teaching alongside quality education. Catholic education later became a factor in the decision of the Jesuits to open a school that was empowered to issue the titulo oficial upon completion of studies. In 1916, the Escuela Catolica expanded and became the Ateneo Elementary School. Its grade school opened that year with seven grades. The school name was changed to Ateneo de Zamboanga when its high school opened in 1928. High school classes were held on the top floor of the three-story Ateneo building along I. Magno corners P. Reyes and Urdaneta streets. The building was the Mindanao Theater, now the site of the City Theater. Five lay teachers and the Jesuit director made up the faculty. The elementary school occupied the lower floors. The first high school students graduated from Ateneo in 1932. The ten young male graduates belonged to Zamboanga City's cr√®me de la cr√®me, one of whom was Roseller T. Lim who would become the first Zamboangue√±o senator of the Philippines. The American Jesuits took over from the Spanish Jesuits in 1930, with Fr. Thomas J. Murray, S.J., as the first American director. In 1932 the government gave official recognition to the high school. In 1938, AdZU opened night classes in commerce and pre-law, thus pioneering its expansion to college, later interrupted by World War II. Pre-war Ateneo expanded with an enrollment of 230 in the grade school and 376 in the high school under Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J. A Zamboangue√±o and a product of Escuela Catolica, Fr. Salvador was the first Filipino director of AdZU. In 1938 a library was built on the first floor of the Knights of Columbus building. A fa√ßade, an auditorium, and an annex were also built. Fr. John Shinn, S.J., was appointed headmaster of the grade school and Fr. Francis X. Clark, S.J., became the principal and dean of discipline of the high school. The school was closed during World War II when the Japanese used it as a public school until it was shelled and bombed by American forces on March 8 and 9 in 1945, before the liberation of the city. =Post-war Ateneo= The high school and intermediate classes (grades 5 and 6) reopened in 1946, in a nipa-sawali building on a new site outside of the poblacion called the Jardin de Chino near Camino Nuevo. It was providential that shortly before the outbreak of the war, Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J., had bought 18 adjoining lots in Jardin de Chino on Bailen Street (now La Purisima Street). In 1947 he bought an additional 1.5 hectares along Camino Nuevo St. adjoining the Bailen St. property to bring to a total of 4.3 hectares the La Purisima campus. Together with Frs. Kyran B. Egan and Cesar E. Maravilla, he reopened high school classes. In 1949, Ateneo became independent of the Jesuit mission in Zamboanga, separating itself from the Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was officially recognized as a Jesuit school separate from the parish. The postliberation years were a period of rapid physical, curricular, and enrollment expansion of the school. By 1949, AdZU underwent a major make-over. A solid structure of fine wood replaced the nipa-and-sawali classrooms. The gymnasium-auditorium (now Brebeuf Gymnasium) was constructed in 1950, making it the oldest structure on campus today. A college was established in 1952 and a graduate school in 1976. In the years between 1946 and 1952, a total of 2,766 students graduated from high school. The college opened in 1952 with a two-year collegiate program, which offered pre-law courses and a degree in Associate in Arts. The college gradually expanded to include four-year bachelor's programs in the arts, commerce, education, and nursing. In 1956, the college and high school became separate departments. =Expansion= AdZ experienced a ‚Äúbuilding boom‚Äù beginning with the completion of the Jesuit Residence in 1959, Sacred Heart Chapel in 1961, Gonzaga Hall in 1964, and Canisius Hall in 1967. In 1972, the two one-storey grade school buildings, Berchmans and Kostka halls, were built. By the mid-70s, basic education was well established with an enrolment reaching 381 students in the grade school. In 1976, higher education expanded to include the graduate school which opened an MBA course, the first graduate program in business administration in Region IX. Soon after, other master's degrees followed: public administration, nursing, guidance and counselling, and education. These programs were offered under the guidance of Fr. Ernesto A. Carretero, S.J., the first president elected by the Board of Trustees of AdZ. In the years that followed, more changes and developments took place. Campion Hall and Bellarmine Hall were built in 1979 and 1980. The Fr. Jose Ma. Rosauro, S.J. Center was finished in 1986. The Learning Resource Center was inaugurated in 1987 to accommodate the library, book center, audio-visual unit, and various offices. Fr. Carretero, S.J., obtained the PAASCU accreditation of the high school in 1975, the liberal arts and commerce in 1981, and education, nursing, and the grade school in 1982. AdZ attained Level III in the accreditation of these colleges, the highest rank given to tertiary schools in the Philippines at that time. In 1984, girls were accepted for the first time in the grade school. Twenty-two girls were part of the grade six graduating class in 1992. They became the first batch of girls to study at the Ateneo High School in 1992. =Presidency of Fr. Kreutz (1989-2006)= The facade of the Bellarmine-Campion building facing La Purisima St. Fr. Carretero, S.J., and after 1989 Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., Ateneo presidents, sought university status for the school. By this time and into the mid-90s the school had added undergraduate programs including accountancy, arts and sciences, business management, and computer science. In 1994, a group of Zamboanga-based doctors entered into a consortium with the Ateneo de Zamboanga under Fr. Kreutz's presidency to establish a medical school named Zamboanga Medical School Foundation (ZMSF). It was located on the La Purisima campus. In 2004, ZMSF was turned over to Ateneo. The medical school became the Ateneo de Zamboanga University School of Medicine. Partnering with the universities of Calgary, Laos, Nepal, and Cambodia, the School of Medicine uses problem-based learning and community- based approach to medical practice with emphasis on serving communities in Western Mindanao. University status On August 20, 2001, AdZ was officially declared a university by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). In the same year it was granted autonomous status by CHED, making Ateneo de Zamboanga University (AdZU) one of only thirty higher education institutions in the Philippines, and the only one in Western Mindanao, to be granted full deregulation and autonomy. The new College building and the Multi-Purpose Covered Courts were inaugurated in 2001. New campus in Tumaga On July 31, 2005, groundbreaking was held for the new high school building in Savanah, Tumaga, Zamboanga City. Fr. Kreutz's 18-year presidency came to a close together with the completion of the new campus in Tumaga, which was later named Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., campus. The high school was transferred to this new site in 2006 for school year 2006‚Äì2007. =Presidency of Fr. Moreno (2006-2013)= On October 11, 2006, Fr. Antonio F. Moreno, S.J., was elected as the second president of the University, replacing Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J. He assumed office on May 21, 2007, and was officially installed on September 22, 2007. Meanwhile, AdZU and Xavier University ‚Äì Ateneo de Cagayan launched the Xavier University College of Law ‚Äì Zamboanga on 25 June 2011. The College of Law is in a new four-storey building named in honor of Fr. Manuel Ma. Sauras, S.J. Sauras Hall is also home to the new university cafeteria. The school's Sacred Heart chapel, built in 1961, was replaced after 50 years by a new Spanish-colonial University Church of the Sacred Heart in time for the university's centennial in 2012. =Presidency of Fr. San Juan (2013-present)= When in 2013 Fr. Moreno became Provincial Superior of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus, the University Board of Trustees elected Fr. Karel S. San Juan, S.J., as its third president, on February 23, 2013. As Fr. San Juan was in his final year of Jesuit spiritual formation, he did not assume the presidency until October 8, 2013. Groundbreaking for a new grade school building at the Tumaga campus was held on July 30, 2013; the new building was opened on June 13, 2015. Plans for this campus include construction of an auditorium, an amphitheater, sports facilities, and a chapel which will replace the chapel in the high school building. Senior High School On June 13, 2016, the Senior High School unit was officially inaugurated at the Fr Salvador Eusebio Campus, La Purisima St, Zamboanga City. The unit originally occupied the Kostka and Xavier Halls. On April 3, 2017, the Ateneo de Zamboanga University held the groundbreaking and contract- signing ceremonials for the construction of the new Senior High School (SHS) building. This five-story building, later named the Francisco Wee Saavedra (FWS) building, houses classrooms, offices, laboratories, a chapel, prayer room, cafeteria and commercial spaces. The FWS building was inaugurated on December 8, 2018, coinciding with the last day of the Ateneo Fiesta that year.  Brebeuf Gym Fire and RISE Capital Campaign  On July 7, 2017, the historic 67-year-old Brebeuf Gymnasium was razed to the ground; the Sauras, Kostka, and Gonzaga Halls were also affected. The Zamboanga City government estimated the damages to amount to 5 million. In response, the University, led by the University Office for Advancement, initiated the RISE Capital Campaign and adjusted its campus expansion plans. The campaign aims to rase PHP 1 billion, allocating PHP 700 million to infrastructure, PHP 200 million to scholarships, and PHP 100 million to research. The Gonzaga Hall was rebuilt, while the Sauras Hall was retrofitted with carbon fiber materials. In the former site of the Brebeuf Gymnasium, a second Multi-Purpose Covered Court was built.  Lantaka Campus  The former Lantaka Hotel was donated by the Walstrom family to AdZU. The inauguration of the campus was held on March 19, 2019.  Academics  = Programs = AdZU offers academic programs at the kindergarten, elementary, junior high, senior high, undergraduate, and graduate levels. As is the norm in the Philippine education system, instruction is primarily delivered in the English language with the exception of Philippine and foreign language subjects. Consistent with the liberal arts tradition upon which all Ateneo schools draw from, AdZU's academic programs always have core subjects that educate students from all levels and specializations not only on the nationally mandated areas of history, social studies, and literature, but also on matters that are of importance to Atenean education such as Ignatian spirituality, Catholic theology, and Jesuit philosophy. In spite of this, AdZU welcomes students from differing faiths and traditions. = Graduate and professional schools = The AdZU Graduate School offers Masters-level and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs across the disciplines covered by the five undergraduate schools. In addition, AdZU has career-specific professional schools, including the School of Medicine and the College of Law. = Undergraduate schools = The AdZU undergraduate schools comprise the following: * College of Nursing (CON) - offers a single degree program, Bachelor of Science in Nursing. * College of Science and Information Technology (CSIT) - confers four-year Bachelor of Science degrees in natural sciences, mathematics, information technology, and engineering, including the Philippines's first fully fledged (non-minor) Biomedical Engineering program, as well as a two-year associate degree program. CSIT is considered by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Development for Information Technology * School of Education (SEd) - offers degrees in education as well as a Certificate in Professional Education (CPE) program for graduates of other undergraduate programs. SEd is considered by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education. * School of Liberal Arts (SLA) - offers programs in the humanities and social sciences. * School of Management and Accountancy (SMA) - facilitates programs in the realms of business and management. = Basic Education = The graduation ceremony of the inaugural cohort of the AdZU Senior High School AdZU offers education in the Grade School (GS), Junior High School (JHS), and Senior High School (SHS) units. The Grade School unit offers primary education in the 1st to 6th grade as well as two years of kindergarten (preparatory) education. The Junior High School unit covers the 7th to 10th grade of secondary education, and offers accelerated mathematics curricula to qualified students. Both units achieved the top level of PAASCU accreditation for their education levels. The Senior High School offers 11th and 12th grade education. The unit was launched following the K-12 curriculum overhaul project of the Department of Education. It offers the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM); Accountancy and Business Management (ABM); Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and Information and Communications Technology - 2D Animation (ICT-2DA) strands. = Admissions = AdZU operates with a selective admissions policy. All of the units of the University require, among other things, passing an entrance examination (which in the case of the Grade School is instead termed an 'assessment test'); past education records are also required for examination. The School of Medicine requires results in the National Medical Admission Test while the College of Law requires results in the PhilSAT; all other units administer their own entrance examinations. = Accreditation = After receiving a five-year Level III Accreditation for the Arts and Sciences, Education, Business and Accountancy, and Nursing programs in May 2014, AdZU requested Institutional Accreditation, an evaluation process that looks at the overall quality of the school. In September 2014, the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) granted Institutional Accreditation to Ateneo de Zamboanga. The University has also been declared by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence (CoE) in Teacher Education and a Center of Development (CoD) in Information Technology. In May 2017, the Junior High School was conferred a Level III accreditation status from PAASCU accreditors. Campuses AdZU operates three campuses. As part of the RISE ADZU capital campaign, the University is currently undergoing a campus revitalization and expansion program. = Fr. Eusebio Salvador, S.J. (Main) Campus = The Bellarmine-Campion building, with the FWS building behind it The main campus (4.3 hectares) on La Purisima Street, named for Fr. Eusebio Salvador, S.J., houses the undergraduate and graduate schools and the Senior High School unit. Buildings used as learning spaces include the Bellarmine-Campion building (home to the Bellarmine and Campion halls), the Canisius and Gonzaga halls (collectively colloquially referred to as the C building), the Xavier Hall, the Kostka Hall, and the Francisco Wee Saavedra (FWS) Building. The FWS Building permanently hosts the Senior High School unit, while other buildings are shared by the undergraduate, graduate, and senior high schools. The Learning Resource Center on-campus houses the Fr. Jose Bacatan, S.J. library, the University's main library, as well as several important offices and the administration of the Graduate School. The campus also contains two Multi- Purpose Covered Courts, the Backfield, the Bellarmine-Campion Quadrangle, the Jesuit Residences, the Rosauro (JMR) Hall, and the Sauras Hall.

William H. Kreutz, S.J. Campus = The second campus (8.3 hectares) in Barangay Tumaga, which is outside Zamboanga City proper, named for Fr. William Kreutz, S.J., is home to the Junior High School and Grade School units. The campus initially opened as the new home of the Ateneo de Zamboanga University High School, which transferred from the main campus in La Purisima St. as it needed more space for expansion due to its growing student population. Such expansion was no longer possible in the crowded Main Campus. Eventually, the Grade School was also moved to this campus in 2015, and the campus was given purpose as the basic education center of the University. Aside from the junior high school and grade school buildings, the campus also includes a soccer field, a multi- purpose covered court, and a playground. File:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Grade School.jpgA courtyard in the Grade School complex File:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Junior High School.jpgA walkway at the Junior High School building = Lantaka Campus = The Ateneo de Zamboanga University Lantaka Campus is situated along the developed historic coastline of Zamboanga City. The campus was previously a resort hotel. The University will repurpose the site for educational, spiritual, religious, and social development purposes.  Research  The University Research Office (URO), formerly known as the Ateneo Research Center (ARC), is the office of AdZU concerned with supervising the research activities of the University. The URO is supervised by the University Research and Publication Council (URPC), a policy-making body that is concerned with setting research agenda and providing mentoring to AdZU academics. The Ateneo de Zamboanga University Press is the publisher of the Asia Mindanaw: Dialogue on Peace and Development journal, which covers research papers and projects that examine Western Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, as well as the dynamics between MIndanao itself and Asia as a whole. Social Development The AdZU Social Development Council includes an institute and three centers that provide social and religious outreach to the peoples served by Ateneo de Zamboanga University in Western Mindanao, Philippines. The Council's programs include the following: *Ateneo Peace Institute (API). Cultural conflict in Mindanao goes back to the intrusion of the Spanish 450 years ago into this formerly Moslem preserve, and persists in migration and turmoil amongst various ethnic groups, with sporadic conflict and military action. API responds with research, education, and consulting work in conjunction with others, including dialogue among various religious and cultural groups, as well as youth activities. *Center for Community Extension Services (CCES) since 1993 has been collaborating with other development organizations and with marginalized communities to try to improve literacy, health, and livelihood, with special attention to isolated communities in the area and on neighboring islands. *Social Awareness and Community Service Involvement (SACSI). The acronym ‚ÄúSACSI‚Äù is Filipino for ‚Äúwitness‚Äù, which is the task of this organization internal to the university. Its purpose is to increase awareness within the university of the realities of life outside, It trains and handles placement of student and faculty volunteers in service opportunities. *Ateneo Center for Leadership and Governance (ACLG). This training center for leaders from both government and civil society extends its efforts to dialogue, advocacy, networking, and interdisciplinary research. Its projects include efforts to secure peaceful and fair elections. A center of the University, the Ateneo Center for Culture and the Arts (ACCA), is also home to the SUGPAT Adolescent Development and Participation Program, a youth development and alternative education advocacy supported by UNICEF Philippines and the ING Group. University image =Seal= 200x200px The Ateneo de Zamboanga University seal reflects the institution's mission. Surrounding the upper half of the seal is the school motto, \\"Pro Deo et Patria.\\" This Latin phrase literally translates to \\"For God and Country,\\" but is officially rephrased by the University to mean \\"In the Service of God and Country\\" to reflect the university's self-defined mission to produce men and women who are both nationalistic and grounded in faith. The name of the school is written on the bottom half. In the circular field is the shield. The red and yellow stripes are derived from the coat of arms of the family of O√±az, the maternal line of St. Ignatius. In the center are two wolves and a food pot. These are of the medallion of the family of Loyola, the paternal line of St. Ignatius of Loyola. This medallion stands for the generosity for which the house of Loyola was well known. The cross on the upper right portion of the shield symbolizes the Christian character of the Ateneo, while the vinta is meant to be representative of the various cultural communities of the South Western Philippines where the school is located. On the bottom left are the book and torch, traditional symbols of education. Above the shield is the sunburst, in which the monogram of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) ‚Äî JHS is positioned with the cross above and three nails below. The \\"JHS\\" wordmark is derived from the Greek Œô·º®Œ£, the first letters of Jesus' name. Emanating from the name of Jesus are blue and white rays signifying grace for all. =Ateneo Name= The name Ateneo is the Spanish form of the Latin name Athen√¶um, which the Dictionary of Classical Antiquities defines as the name of \\"the first educational institution in Rome\\" where \\"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, was where \\"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\\" Athen√¶um is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning. The Ateneo de Zamboanga is not the only Jesuit school that the Jesuits named Ateneo. The Society of Jesus has established 16 schools in the Philippines since 1590. Nine of them were given the name Ateneo. Ateneo de Zamboanga was the second school named Ateneo. Over the years, the name \\"Ateneo\\" has been recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the Philippines and synonymous with academic excellence. Student life The units of AdZU together have dozens of student organizations that cater to a wide variety of preferences, ranging from advocacy and humanitarian groups such as institutional chapters of Rotary International's Interact to niche interests such as debate and worship music. In addition, the different Schools (including undergraduate, professional, and basic education schools) have Academic Organizations (AOs) that manage the specific needs of students in a given School. These AOs are instrumental in rallying students from these schools together for matters of interest and importance, as well as organizing teams for sports festivals and other intra-University activities. = Athletics = The college varsity teams compete in the Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA), and the grade school and high school varsity teams participate in the Private Schools of Zamboanga City Athletic Association (PSZCAA). AdZU holds a school-wide annual sportsfest called \\"Ateneo Fiesta,\\" a week-long event beginning in the last week of November. Most of the high school and college competitors in the Fiesta are varsity athletes preparing for competition in sports events on the PRISAA agenda. The Fiesta itself is now considered the most important event of the academic year for student life. = Student councils = The Sanggunian ng mga Mag-aaral ng Ateneo de Zamboanga University (SMADZU) was the College unit's student government before 2009. Currently in its place is El Consejo Atenista, which was created with the objective of being a more representative student government. The basic education units also have their own student councils; the junior high school student government is called the Council of Leaders, while the senior high school government is called the Ateneo Student Executive Council (ASEC). The grade school's council is simply named Student Government. = Student publications = Official student publications are The Beacon Magazine for the College unit, The Oculus Publications and Vista de Aguila for the Senior High School, Blue Eagle Publications and La Liga Atenista for the Junior High School, and The Quill for the Grade School. The student publications of the University regularly compete in local, regional, and national journalism competitions.

Their main business lines are services to energy, utilities and mining companies. They also provide services to ports, insurance and large retail corporations. They specialize in aggregating content from a large range of private and government funded organisations (e.g. Bureau of Meteorology, Environmental Protection Authority, World Meteorological Organisation, Australian Broadcasting Corporation etc.). Weatherzone is the major commercial weather company that provides meteorological services in Australia. History Weatherzone was founded in 1998 by former Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) meteorologist, Mark Hardy, providing graphics, scripts and weather briefings for television weather presentations. In 2008 in response to an increasing demand from industry for more accurate and more frequently updating weather forecasts, Weatherzone developed the Opticast forecast system. This system takes information from over a dozen computer models including variants of the in-house operated Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The Opticast algorithms are run every hour ensuring the forecasts are continually staying abreast of rapid and previously unforeseen meteorological changes. The accuracy of Opticast allowed weatherzone to make a successful foray into the lucrative energy and mining weather forecasting markets. Over subsequent years, many of Australia's major electricity companies commenced using weatherzone's Opticast forecasting products including AGL, Snowy Hydro, Origin and AEMO. On 25 June 2008 Fairfax Media acquired a 75% share in Weatherzone (then known as The Weather Company) with 25% still owned by the founder, Mark Hardy who retained the Managing Director role. On 9 August 2010 The organisation changed its name from The Weather Company to Weatherzone. It still trades as The Weather Company Pty Ltd. Weatherzone was part of Fairfax's Digital Ventures group of companies and in September 2013 Charles Solomon was appointed Managing Director. In 2015 Weatherzone expanded into Africa with an investment in South Africa based AfricaWeather. Weatherzone also operates the largest total lightning detection network in Australia. On 1 October 2019 Fairfax's 75% stake in Weatherzone was acquired by US-based DTN for an undisclosed sum. Services Weatherzone runs their own WRF computer model which is used to produce content for the subscription product, Weatherzone Pro (formerly Weatherzone Silver), and feeds into their Opticast forecasting model. It employs a team of meteorologists to offer a meteorological alternative to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Weatherzone also provides solutions for displaying weather on websites. Some large sites that use this include Elders, an Australian agricultural site, News Corp Australia (formerly News Limited) and Fairfax Media. Advanced forecasts and alerting products are also produced for the energy, mining and insurance industries. Weatherzone publishes its own weather site and smartphone apps which combines their own content with Bureau of Meteorology information and that from several global providers into a user friendly and customizable interface. Weatherzone sources surf data from Swellnet, Australia's most popular source of online surf reports, surf forecasts and live surfcam vision. It provides these weather services, for among others, The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and world weather reports for Bloomberg Television. Weatherzones Apple iOS app includes iPhone, iPad and WatchOS apps, enabling users to view 10-day forecasts, rain radar and BOM warnings at a glance. The iOS apps also include WeatherPulse, a daily video magazine. The app offers both a free ad funded version and a paid for subscription.

It is privately owned, and open to the public regularly, as well as upon special request. The Arboretum was established in 1910 by Dr. Walter Bartlett, a general practitioner from Belle Plaine, who purchased pastureland to create his own arboretum. In the 1930s the arboretum became an approved test site for the United States Department of Agriculture which provided plants and trees from around the world for hardiness tests. The Arboretum now contains massive cypress, oaks and champion Japanese maples. Its steward is Robin Lynn Macy, otherwise known as a founding member of the Dixie Chicks bluegrass and country music group. It was developed over many years, from relatively barren land with water only in a slough. Early in the process, Bartlett formed a dam and also built 4 islands in the slough. (62 pages, with maps, historic photos, and 27 photos from 2007 and 2009) According to the National Park Service: > The Bartlett Arboretum is a private fifteen acre park in rural Belle Plaine, > Kansas, that evolved in early 20th century from a recreational park and > conservation area to an arboretum with formal gardens and experimental plots > and nurseries. The arboretum largely reflects the influences of professional > landscape architect and horticulturist Glenn Bartlett, his wife and floral > expert Margaret Bartlett, and Glenn‚Äôs father who first purchased the > property in 1910 to be used as a public athletic field for the small > community and as a natural reserve complete with water fowl and non- > indigenous trees.

It was originally known as XPFE, an abbreviation of cross-platform front end. It was also known as XPToolkit. To avoid confusion, it is now referred to as the Mozilla application framework. While similar to generic cross-platform application frameworks like GTK+, Qt and wxWidgets, the intent is to provide a subset of cross-platform functionality suitable for building network applications like web browsers, leveraging the cross-platform functionality already built into the Gecko layout engine. The following are the various components of the framework: ; Gecko : Gecko is a standard-based layout engine designed for performance and portability. ; Necko : Necko provides an extensible API for several layers of networking from transport to presentation layers. ; XUL : XUL is the basis of user interface. It is an application of XML that defines various user interfaces elements, mostly widgets, control elements, template, etc. It is similar in many ways to HTML. ; XBL : XBL allows one to define their own widget for use in XUL. ; XPCOM : XPCOM is an object interface that allows interfacing between any programming language for which a binding has been developed ; XPConnect : XPConnect is the binding between XPCOM and JavaScript. ; XPInstall : XPInstall is a technology for installing small packages like extensions and themes into Mozilla applications in form of installation archives known as XPI. ; Web services : Mozilla includes built-in support for popular web services standards XML-RPC, SOAP (dropped since Gran Paradiso Alpha 7), and WSDL as well as a simple XMLHttpRequest object similar to the one in Internet Explorer. ; Others : The framework supports a number of open or common standards, including DTD, RDF, XSLT/XPath, MathML, SVG, JavaScript, SQL, LDAP, etc. Applications that use the framework *Netscape Navigator 9 web browser *Mozilla Firefox web browser *Flock web browser *Wine compatibility layer (Gecko is used in the built-in web browser component) *SeaMonkey Internet suite *Mozilla Thunderbird email client *ChatZilla IRC client *KompoZer WYSIWYG web authoring *Mozilla Sunbird calendar *Komodo IDE and Komodo Edit since version 5 of both *Songbird media player *Former Joost IPTV client *Celtx screenplay writing application *Miro internet TV application *Boxee media center software *Instantbird instant messaging client See also *XULRunner *Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) References * Syd Logan: Cross-Platform Development in C++: Building Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows Applications, Addison-Wesley, 2007.

He has written a number of books on the field in general, as well as on specific deviant topics. He is a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Biography Goode received a B.A. from Oberlin College (1960) and a Ph.D. in sociology from Columbia University (1966). He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, Florida Atlantic University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. He is currently employed as a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He also teaches at the University of Maryland. Goode takes a constructionist approach to deviance. In his view, a behavior is deviant if and only if society at large considers it so. The broader social factors that go into the classification of a behavior as deviant are thus considered a valid subject of study. His research focuses on the deviant individuals (and behaviors) themselves, as well as the particular individuals and groups that play a part in classifying the behavior as deviant. As a sociologist, Goode makes no judgment about whether a particular is \\"bad\\" or \\"evil\\", and considers deviance as a topic to be entirely dependent on whether the society at large considers the behavior deviant. In this view, a particular behavior can be deviant in one society, but normal in another. This is in contrast to the perspective of essentialism, which would say that a behavior either \\"really is\\" deviant or \\"really isn't\\", and that it is the task of the sociologist to discover and report on the truth of the matter, and what society at large believes is mostly irrelevant. According to the constructionist framework as espoused by Goode, an instance of \\"deviance\\" can exist as a social construct exclusively, completely separate from any actual behavior. In other words, \\"imaginary deviance\\" can exist that causes a frenzy of interesting sociological behavior in response to a non-existence phenomenon. Satanic ritual abuse is an example of this in modern times, and the case of witch hunts is an example from antiquity. These are often called moral panics, and Goode considers them a valid subject (perhaps the ideal subject) for deviance studies. Erich Goode is known for his exploration and exposure of the \\"moral panic\\" concept. He takes a \\"harm reductionist\\" approach to studying social deviance. This commitment aims to reduce social harm without engaging in value judgments or essentialist claims about those being studied. Goode's Four Types of Drug Use 1\\\\. Legal instrumental use - Taking prescribed drugs and over the counter drugs to relieve or treat symptoms. 2\\\\. Legal recreational use - Using legal (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine) drugs to achieve a certain mental state. 3\\\\. Illegal instrumental use - Taking non prescription drugs to accomplish a task or goal. 4.Illegal recreational use - Taking illegal drugs for fun or pleasure to experience euphoria.Hanson, Glen R., Peter J. Venturelli, and Annette E. Fleckenstein. Drugs and Society. 9th ed. Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett, 2006. 19. Books Marijuana (1969) seeks to bring to the reader the whole configuration of this mushrooming problem, which, like the Sexual Revolution and the New Politics, lies at the heart of the alienation felt by many young people and the fears of social breakdown voiced by many of their elders. Atherton Press, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 68-56981 In The Marijuana Smokers (1971), Goode looked at marijuana through a sociological lens. In Drugs in American Society, Goode argued that the effect of a drug is dependent on the societal context in which it is taken. Thus, in one society (or social context) a particular drug may be a depressant, and in another it may be a stimulant. Deviant Behavior is a textbook intended for undergrad students. In it, Goode takes the position of a weak constructionist. Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance, written with Nachman Ben-Yehuda, is a book about moral panics, from a sociological perspective. In Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction (1999), Goode studies paranormal beliefs such as UFOs, ESP, and creationism using the methods of the sociology of deviance. Consistent in tone with the rest of his works, he takes the position that whether the phenomenon in question is real is not important to a sociologist. Rather, sociologists should be concerned with how the paranormalist is labeled as deviant, and what effect the label has on them and society. Controversy As a sociologist, Goode relies heavily on informants for his research. For example, Goode consulted with and interviewed actual drug users for his books on drugs. In 1999, Goode admitted through the sociology journal circuit that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with a few of his informants and discussed how this influenced his perspective on the subject he was studying. This caused a firestorm of articles defending or denouncing his work. Additionally, in an article in Qualitative Sociology Goode notes that the parents of an informant who became pregnant urged him to move to California and he explained that it was impossible for both personal and professional reasons to do so.

Youth and background El-Ouali was born in 1948 in a Sahrawi nomad encampment somewhere on the hammada desert plains in eastern Spanish Sahara or northern Mauritania; some sources give his place of birth as Bir Lehlou, a location that is symbolic for the Polisario Front, for being the place of the proclamation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). His parents were poor and his father disabled, and with the sum of the severe drought on the Sahara that year, and the consequences of the Ifni War, the family had to abandon the traditional bedouin lifestyle of the Sahrawis, settling near Tan-Tan (nowadays southern Morocco) at the late 1950s. Some sources stated that Ouali's family was deported among others to Morocco by Spanish authorities in 1960. He went to Primary School in Tan-Tan in 1962, and then to the Islamic Institute in Taroudannt in 1966 with impressive results, being awarded scholarships to attend university in Rabat in 1970. There he studied Laws & Political sciences, and met other young members of the Sahrawi diaspora, who like him were affected by the radicalism sweeping Moroccan universities in the early 1970s (heavily influenced by May 1968 in France). He was the first alumnus in the history of Moroccan universities on achieving a punctuation of 19 out of 20 in Constitutional law. He travelled to Europe for the only time in his life about this time, visiting Amsterdam in the Netherlands & Paris in France. Polisario Front El-Ouali grew increasingly disturbed by the oppressive Spanish colonial rule over what was then known as Spanish Sahara, and although never involved with the Harakat Tahrir, news of the Zemla Intifada made a deep impression on him. In 1972, he returned to Tan-Tan (former Spanish Sahara), where he began organizing a group called the Embryonic Movement for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and R√≠o de Oro. After a Sahrawi demonstration in Tan-Tan in June 1972, a group of 20 participants including Ouali were detained and tortured by the Moroccan police; then he met with other groups of Sahrawis from inside Western Sahara, Algeria & Mauritania, and in 1973 founded with them the Polisario Front.Alejandro Garc√≠a, Historias del S√°hara ‚Äì El mejor y el peor de los mundos, Catarata, 2001, Pages 111‚Äì113 Days after the POLISARIO's foundation, El-Ouali and Brahim Gali led a group of six poorly armed guerrillas in the 20 May 1973 El-Khanga raid, the first armed action of the Polisario Front (El- Khanga was a Spanish military post in the desert). El-Ouali and another fighter were briefly captured, but they managed to escape when the remaining patrol headed by Gali overran the ill-prepared Spanish troops. The Khanga strike was to be followed by similar attacks on isolated targets, in which the POLISARIO gathered weapons and equipment, until they were finally able to enter into full-scale guerrilla warfare. In April 1974, El-Uali headed the POLISARIO delegation that took part in the Pan African Youth Movement meeting in Benghazi, Libya.Dispute for control of Western Sahara ‚Äì 1975/1991 (to present day) Bippi.org In August 1974, El-Uali was elected secretary-general of the Polisario, replacing Brahim Gali on the post.Pablo San Martin (2010). Western Sahara: The Refugee Nation University of Wales Press. Retrieved 3 August 2016. In 1974‚Äì75 the Polisario Front slowly seized control over the desert countryside, and quickly became the most important nationalist organization in the country. By 1975 Spain had been forced to retreat into the major coastal cities, and reluctantly accepted negotiations on the surrender of power. At this point, the Polisario remained a relatively small organization of perhaps 800 fighters and activists, although supported by a vastly larger network of sympathizers. According to claims by Mehdi Bennouna in his book Heroes Sans Gloire, El-Ouali was the son of a member of the Moroccan Army of Liberation. Allegedly, he was a member of Union National des √âtudiants Marocains (UNEM), the students union in Morocco and was recruited by Mohamed Bennouna to join the \\"Tanzim\\" (The Organisation or the Structure), an Arabic nationalist and socialist organization which was created to overthrow the monarchy under Hassan II and obtained support from Syria, Libya, and Algeria. El-Ouali was supposedly trained in Libya and his mentor was a man named \\"Nemri\\". Bennouna claims the death of Mahmoud and Nemri, as well as the fluctuating relationship between Tanzim and Algeria led to the creation of the Polisario Front. Bennouna personally views this as part of the armed revolution in Morocco and of the political dissidence against the Moroccan regime.Quand la gauche voulait abattre Hassan II ‚Äì \\"Le Journal\\" Exile and war After the joint Moroccan‚ÄìMauritanian invasion of Western Sahara in late 1975, and the Moroccan air raids on Sahrawi refugees columns in the desert, El-Ouali escorted them into exile in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria. From there, as the secretary-general of Polisario he presided over the establishing of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The Sahrawi republic effectively became the government of some 50,000‚Äì60,000 people in 1976, housed in the Tindouf refugee camps. At that point, the Polisario Front, backed by Algeria and Libya, reinforced a guerrilla war against Morocco and Mauritania, who had substantially larger forces and armament, mostly from French and Spanish origin. The usual tactic of the Polisario guerrillas consisted in raids (sometimes of hundreds of km) on military objectives like Moroccan military posts on Tarfaya, Amgala or Guelta Zemmur, or economic objectives, as the Bou Craa phosphate conveyor belt, the Zouerat iron mines and the Mauritania Railway. By all accounts, El-Ouali was intensely charismatic, and often made public speeches in the refugee camps. He frequently met with foreign journalists visiting the camps, acknowledging the importance of publicizing the Sahrawi struggle. He was widely respected by his compatriots for his habit of fighting at the front line with his troops, although this would ultimately prove a fatal choice. Death in combat On 9 June 1976 El- Ouali was killed by a shrapnel piece through the head returning from a major Polisario raid on the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, in which they bombarded the Presidential palace. In the retreat, pursued by Mauritanian troops, armored vehicles and aviation, a group with Ouali separated from the principal column, going to Benichab (about 100 km. north of Nouakchott) with the intention of destroying the water pipeline that supplied the capital. Other sources claim that the subsequent combat took place north of Akjoujt. They were surrounded and cornered by Mauritanian troops with Panhard AMLs and then annihilated. Ouali's body was sent to Nouackchott and buried secretly in a military terrain (in 1996, 20 years after his death, the exact place of his rests was revealed),Alejandro Garc√≠a, Historias del S√°hara ‚Äì El mejor y el peor de los mundos, Catarata, 2001, Pages 178‚Äì179 where it still lies. His position as Secretary-General was briefly assumed in an interim capacity by Mahfoud Ali Beiba, who was then replaced by Mohammed Abdelaziz at the Polisario's III General Popular Congress in August 1976.

Christian metal, which is also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is heavy metal music with a Christian message. Christian metal is regarded more of a concept rather than a genre since it has no specific musical characteristics. It emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelization to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by American bands Resurrection Band and Barnabas, Swedish band Jerusalem and Canadian band Daniel Band. Los Angeles' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s. In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as Vengeance Rising, Deliverance, Believer and Tourniquet. In the early 1990, the Australian death metal band Mortification rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene. At the turn of the 21st century, P.O.D., with two platinum-selling albums, achieved a mainstream commercial success rivaling that of Stryper. The metalcore groups Underoath, Demon Hunter, As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean (dubbed by the magazine Revolver as \\"The Holy Alliance\\") also brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 2000s, achieving ranks in the Billboard 200..

Cheng ran Ford Models Supermodel of the World competitions under license from Ford in China in 2007 and in Malaysia in 2011. The World Economic Forum named Cheng a Young Global Leader in 2009. On 23 November 2011, several model agencies, including Looque Models, were fined for price fixing. Cheng profited from the higher agency commissions, claiming in defense that the goal was to raise wages for models. The CCS ruled that AMIP engaged in anticompetitive price-fixing, resulting in customers paying more and having a considerable and adverse impact on the market. The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) noted in its decision that as president of the Association of Modelling Industry Professionals Singapore (AMIP), Cheng played a central role by instructing AMIP members how to mask the collusion to evade detection and complaints. Cheng appealed, claiming that statements in the decision were damaging to his character; the appeal was dismissed because he had not been personally fined. In August 2015, Cheng merged one of his franchise businesses, Lumina Looque Knowledge Hubs Pte Ltd, with a Chinese firm called Retech that focused on educational technology. In June 2017 ReTech made an initial public offering of stock on the Australian Stock Exchange.  Government roles  In July 2009, Cheng was appointed to a year term as a Nominated Member of Parliament in Singapore's 11th Parliament. NMPs were supposed to reflect nonpartisan views; the newspaper Today questioned his appointment in light of his membership in Young PAP. Cheng resigned from Young PAP shortly thereafter. His term as an NMP ended after 21 months when Parliament was dissolved due to elections being called. In 2012 Cheng was appointed to the newly formed Media Literacy Council (MLC) of Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information, which was created to \\"promote civility and responsibility on the Internet\\"Media Development Authority of Singapore, a statutory board under the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. 30 July 2012 Press Release: New Council to oversee cyber wellness, media literacy initiatives He served two two-year terms on the MLC. Political views  Cheng often posts his views on socio- political issues in Singapore on Facebook, and is known for attracting controversy at times for his outspoken views and for his personal attacks against people with whom he disagrees. In November 2015, while he was on the Media Literacy Council, Cheng wrote provocative comments about killing the children of terrorists on the Facebook page of entrepreneur and commentator Devadas Krishnadas. His comments led to a verbal chiding from Tan Cheng Han, the Chairman of the MLC. In addition, two reports calling for investigation were filed with police, including one by Augustin Lee Tze Shih, organising secretary of the People's Power Party. Cheng apologized to the MLC. Amos Yee, a teenager who had been previously jailed for comments offensive to the Singaporean government, was convicted and jailed in 2016 for \\"hurting religious feelings\\" in his online responses to Cheng's Facebook posts. In March 2017, a United States judge granted Yee political asylum, citing the different ways that Cheng and Yee had been treated, where Cheng was not charged, and Yee was charged and convicted. Controversial opinions have included advocating in 2017 that Singapore's arts should not be funded by the government, and supporting the Population White Paper in 2015.

Biography =Youth= Boudewijn de Groot was born in wartime occupied Dutch East Indies in 1944 in a Japanese concentration camp close to Batavia (today known as Jakarta) where his mother died in June 1945. In 1946, he and his family returned to the Netherlands. De Groot's father, however, was obliged to return to Indonesia, so De Groot went to stay with his aunt in Haarlem. In 1951, his father came back and in 1952, the family moved, with his new stepmother, to Heemstede. De Groot lived in Heemstede in the same street as one of his future lyricists, Lennaert Nijgh, who was a friend of De Groot's stepbrother. =Early years in music= In 1960, De Groot met Nijgh at the Coornhert Lyceum in Haarlem. At that time, De Groot was already singing in the style of Jaap Fischer and Jacques Brel. Lennaert Nijgh wrote his lyrics. After their high school-period they both decided to go to a film academy. In their last year, Nijgh made the short movie \\"Feestje Bouwen\\", for which De Groot wrote two songs. During one of the presentations of the movie, television journalist Ed Lautenslager became impressed with De Groot's talent, and subsequently helped him to get a contract with record label Philips. De Groot's first single, \\"Strand\\", appeared in 1964 and led to some media attention. He followed it up with \\"Elegie prenatale\\" and \\"De morgen\\", and his recurring appearances in the television show \\"Kaberet Kroniek\\" made De Groot a minor national celebrity. The single \\"Noordzee\\" in February 1964 was a much bigger hit, but the huge breakthrough came in 1966 with Lennaert Nijgh's adaptation of a song from Charles Aznavour's \\"Une enfant de seize ans\\", retitled \\"Meisje van 16\\". This was De Groot's first song to appear in a music chart. He soon quit his job to become a full-time singer. After a while, his first album Boudewijn de Groot, recorded with the Frans de Kok orchestra, was released by record label Decca. =Years of fame= Much of Nijgh's lyrics included social criticism, so after the release of his first album in 1966 De Groot was labeled as a protest singer, an image confirmed for the mainstream audience by the success of his song Welterusten Meneer de President (\\"Goodnight, Mister President\\") on the Vietnam War. De Groot's second album Voor de overlevenden was released later in 1966. The arranger and conductor for this album, Bert Paige, continued to work with De Groot until the 1970s. However, during carnival 1967, \\"Het Land van Maas en Waal\\" was released and became De Groot's third hit. Under the name \\"Baldwin\\", an English version of these songs appeared in the U.K. (The land at rainbow's end). The next single, \\"Onder ons\\", just made it into the charts. By this time, De Groot had already recorded songs like \\"Verdronken vlinder\\", \\"Testament\\" and \\"Beneden alle peil\\", which would later become successful but would never enter hit charts. De Groot and Nijgh became influenced by the Flower Power movement during that time and created the album Picknick. The songs sounded a lot like a mix of George Harrison's work on The Beatles albums and their own work. The album was well received, and the single \\"Picknick\\" was a hit. The duet \\"Meester Prikkebeen\\" with Elly Nieman entered the charts two months later. Two other songs, \\"Waterdrager\\" and \\"Als de rook om je hoofd is verdwenen\\" were minor hits in 1968. =Other work= In 1968, De Groot decided he didn't want to perform live anymore and stopped his collaboration with Nijgh and his band, The Names and Faces. In 1969, De Groot worked with Eelco Gelling, the guitarist of Cuby and the Blizzards and, under the name Tower, they recorded the single \\"In Your Life\\", which became a hit. After this, he started working with Lucien Duzee, and they created his fourth album Nacht en ontij. The record didn't sound like De Groot's old work, and the single didn't make it in the charts. The new singles from Tower also failed, and De Groot gave up singing. He moved to a farm in Dwingeloo. After a year, De Groot returned as the producer of Rob de Nijs and Oscar Benton. =Newfound fame= In 1971, his record label released a compilation album called Vijf jaar hits. It sold over 100,000 copies and, subsequently, De Groot frequently reappeared on the radio. Much of his old work was re-appreciated, and \\"Als de rook om je hoofd is verdwenen\\" became a hit again. Another compilation album called Dubbel twee was also released. De Groot began working with Nijgh again, and they released the album Hoe sterk is de eenzame fietser in 1973. The song \\"Jimmy\\" became his biggest hit in five years, constituting a definite comeback. De Groot received an Edison and a Gouden Harp (Dutch music awards). Meanwhile, De Groot en Nijgh had orchestrated the comeback of Rob de Nijs, writing a string of hits for him, including \\"Jan Klaassen de trompetter\\" and \\"Malle Babbe\\". In 1975, De Groot wrote the album Waar ik woon en wie ik ben with his old classmate Ren√© Daalder. The single \\"Ik ben Ik\\" became a hit. De Groot moved to California a few months later for inspiration, and did not return until 1977. He made no new records in this period, but toured in Belgium and the Netherlands. One of the songs he wrote in California, \\"Annabel\\", became a hit for Hans de Booy. In April 1980, his new album Van een afstand was released. It contained (the single of) the title song for the movie Tip van de sluier. Neither the single nor the movie were a success, but the album won an Edison. De Groot quit in 1984 after the release of his eight album, Maalstroom. =Retirement from music= After his retirement from music, De Groot wanted to translate, compose film music and perform when asked. He composed the music for the TV series De familie Wijntak (1986) and for the movies Lost in Amsterdam (1989), Let the Music Dance (1990) and a 1987 Dutch adaptation of the hit musical Nunsense. He acted in the musical Tjechov, where he played the lead role of Anton Chekhov and in Het dagboek van Anne Frank where he played the role of Otto Frank. Under the pseudonym \\"Frank de Groot\\", he has translated seven Stephen King novels and in 2011 Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent into Dutch. =Another comeback= In 1996, De Groot released Een Nieuwe Herfst. His new record label Mercury also released an album with old work and newly released work. De Groot started going on tour again and he reappeared in some TV-shows. He started writing non-commercial albums alongside with Nijgh and released Een eiland in de verte in 2003. Nijgh died in 2002. On 19 January 2007 De Groot issued Lage Landen; he wrote most of the lyrics, but also used texts of Lennaert Nijgh and Freek de Jonge. The album was recorded in Nashville. On 3 February 2007 Lage Landen reached the top rankings on hit lists in the Netherlands. On 20 April 2015 De Groot issued ' (Behind glass). During the tour he played songs from his post-comeback-era as well as rare older tracks. =Supergroup= In 2016 De Groot formed the supergroup Vreemde Kostgangers (Strange Boarders) with Henny Vrienten (bass- player of Doe Maar) and George Kooymans (guitarist of Golden Earring); they successfully released two albums in 2017 and did sold out tours consisting of collective songs and solo-material. In 2018, De Groot released Even weg; he recorded this album with tribute-band The Dutch Eagles. =Retirement from performing= On February 6, 2020, De Groot appeared on talkshow De Wereld Draait Door to announce that he'll retire from performing after one last tour with Vreemde Kostgangers. Personal life Boudewijn de Groot is married to Anja Bak. He has three children with his first wife; Marcel, Caya and Jim, all of whom have music- and acting careers.

The Canadiens eventually moved from the arena because of its uneven natural ice surface.

It is likely the third arena designed expressly for ice hockey, after the St. Nicholas Rink in New York City, and the Dey's Skating Rink in Ottawa, which both opened in 1896. The ice rink ends were not squared off but rounded off. The ends were somewhat semi- circular, possibly the first design of its kind. A puck could be shot along the outside rim, slide along the corners, pass behind the goal and come out the other side. That type of shot is common in hockey today and is called \\"rimmed around.\\" The rounded-corners design spread to other arenas. In 1902, after Ottawa's Dey Rink was demolished due to a storm, it was rebuilt with rounded ends to match the Montreal Arena.Kitchen(2008), p. 112 The fence along the ice surface was increased in height to , an increase from the Victoria Skating Rink's one foot high boards. The first artificial ice-making plant in Montreal was installed in the Arena in 1915. The owners of the Montreal Arena, the Canadian Arena Company, later built the Arena Gardens in Toronto, and operated the Toronto NHL franchise in 1917-18. Principals of the Arena Company, such as William Northey, would later be involved in the building of the Montreal Forum and the founding of the Montreal Maroons. The Montreal Canadiens won their first (pre-NHL) Stanley Cup in this building on March 30, 1916 against the Portland Rosebuds. =Fire= Ruins of Montreal Arena A fire started in the ice-making plant causing the arena to burn down on January 2, 1918. It began mid-day, when the only people in the building were the superintendent James McKeene and his family, who were eating in their apartment on the north side of the structure; all escaped safely but they lost most of their belongings, as well as a car stored in the annex. Damage was estimated at $150,000, including the uniforms and sticks of the Wanderers and Canadiens, with only a third covered by insurance. The blaze led the Montreal Wanderers, already on shaky grounds, to disband within days and the Canadiens to move back to Jubilee Arena, which itself would be destroyed by fire, the next year. In 1924, the new Montreal Forum was built one block to the east. =Today= A condominium building currently sits on the site. Previously a warehouse had been on the site after the fire that destroyed the arena. Usage At first, it hosted the Montreal senior men's amateur hockey teams of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, including the Montreal, Shamrock and Victoria hockey clubs. The Wanderers would start play there in 1904. Later, it served as the home rink for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League from 1911 until 1918. In 1907, it was the site of one of hockey's first player brawls. On January 12, 1907, the game between the heated rivals Ottawa Hockey Club and the Montreal Wanderers degenerated into a free for all. Ottawa players Charles Spittal, Alf Smith and Harry Smith each knocked out a Montreal player cold and received game misconducts. Cecil Blachford, Ernest Johnson and Hod Stuart all required hospital treatment. Despite the injuries, the Wanderers won the game 4‚Äì2. The ECAHA convened a week later to consider discipline for the Ottawa players and when no agreement was found, league president McRobie resigned. When Ottawa returned for a January 26 against the Montreal Victorias, Spittal and the Smiths were arrested for assault, each eventually paying $20 fines. The newly formed NHL played its first game in the Arena on December 19, 1917, with the Wanderers earning a 10-9 win over the newly established Toronto Arenas. A French language newspaper ad re-discovered in 2017 established that the Montreal game started at 8:15 pm, ahead of another game that same night in Ottawa scheduled to begin at 8:30 pm. Wanderers defenceman Dave Ritchie scored the league's first goal early in the game. The building was also used for exhibition space. Horse shows, car shows, motor-boat displays, concerts, and bazaars were held. New York's Metropolitan Opera performed at the arena, as well as singers such as Melba, Caruso, Calve and Albani.

Amarapura is bounded by the Irrawaddy river in the west, Chanmyathazi Township in the north, and the ancient capital site of Ava (Inwa) in the south. It was the capital of Myanmar twice during the Konbaung period (1783‚Äì1821 and 1842‚Äì1859) before finally being supplanted by Mandalay 11 km north in 1859. It is historically referred to as Taungmyo (Southern City) in relation to Mandalay. Amarapura today is part of Mandalay, as a result of urban sprawl. The township is known today for its traditional silk and cotton weaving, and bronze casting. It is a popular tourist day-trip destination from Mandalay. Etymology Amarapura comes from (), which means \\"city of immortality.\\"amara = immortality; p≈´ra = city. History Royal palace of king Bodawpaya at Amarapura, during the visit of the British Embassy of Michael Symes, in 1795 Amarapura was founded by King Bodawpaya of the Konbaung Dynasty. He founded Amarapura as his new capital in May 1783.Maung Maung Tin Vol. 1 1905: 395 The new capital became a center of Buddhist reforms and learning. In 1800, Buddhist clergy from Sri Lanka obtained higher ordination in this city and founded the Amarapura Nikaya (Amarapura sect).Bischoff 1995: 113 In 1810 the town was estimated to contain 170,000 inhabitants, but in that year it was destroyed by fire. Bodawpaya's grandson, King Bagyidaw moved the Court back to Ava in November 1821Maung Maung Tin Vol. 2 1905: 223 and in 1827 the population of Amarapura was estimated at only 30,000. Bagyidaw's successor King Tharrawaddy again moved the royal capital back to Amarapura in February 1842.Maung Maung Tin Vol. 3 1905: 33 In February 1857, King Mindon began building Mandalay as his new capital city, 11 km north of Amarapura. With the royal treasury depleted by the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, Mindon decided to reuse as much material from Amarapura as possible in the construction of Mandalay. The palace buildings were dismantled and moved by elephant to the new location, and the city walls were pulled down for use as building material for roads and railways.Cooler, Konbaung Amarapura Part of the moat is still recognizable near the Bagaya Monastery. The city officially ceased being the capital on 23 May 1859 when Mandalay took over that role.Maung Maung Tin Vol. 3 1905: 193 The ruins of the city wall show it to have been a square with a side of about three-quarters of a mile in length. At each corner stood a solid brick pagoda about 100 ft. high. The most remarkable edifice was a celebrated temple, adorned with 250 lofty pillars of gilt wood, and containing a colossal bronze statue of the Buddha. The indigenous Burmese tradition of acheik textile weaving originates in Amarapura, and became popular during the Konbaung dynasty, during which sumptuary laws regulated who could wear acheik clothing. Amarapura, alongside Wundwin, remains a major domestic center of traditional acheik weaving, although in recent years, cheaper factory-produced imitations from China and India have significantly disrupted Myanmar's traditional cottage industry.

It was located at the area bounded by rue Alphonse-D. Roy Street (then known as rue Malborough) and rue Ste. Catherine Est.Mouton (1987), p. 111. It was used for games of the Montreal Canadiens hockey club of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and National Hockey League (NHL) from 1909 to 1910 and again in 1919, and it was home of the Montreal Wanderers NHA club from 1910. It was originally built in 1908 and held seating for 3,200 spectators. In 1918, when the Montreal Arena burned down, the Canadiens moved into Jubilee Arena on a full-time basis. On the afternoon of April 23, 1919, Jubilee Arena also burned down, forcing the Habs to build and move into the Mount Royal Arena which opened in 1920. The site of the old arena is now occupied by industrial tenants bearing no reminder of the former hockey venue. Ownership of the Jubilee Rink played a significant role in the 1909 formation of the NHA (later becoming the present NHL). In November 1909, the owner of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) Wanderers club announced he would move the team to the Jubilee, which he also owned. As it was smaller than the Montreal Arena, and the other three members of the ECHA would earn less revenues when playing there, these owners dissolved the ECHA, formed the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and invited applications from other teams. At a meeting on November 25, the CHA rejected the application of the Wanderers, represented at the meeting by player Jimmy Gardner, as well as the application of Ambrose O'Brien's Renfrew Creamery Kings.Coleman, p.178 Before leaving the building, Gardner and O'Brien decided to form the NHA, which was finalized on December 2.

At that time the king Sigismund III Vasa determined the metes and bounds of Kyiv's burgesses land possession in his charter.

In the 1780s, at the time when this land was included into the Kyiv Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire, the Magdeburg rights of Kyiv were revoked so Sviatoshyn area went to the state ownership. Until the end of the 19th century, that land had been mentioned like Sviatoshyn wood, grove or forest, and it was a part of the volost of the Kyiv Governorate. There were no allusions about any permanent human settlements in there at that time.Plan of Kyiv outskirts, 1850 = Dacha village = In 1897 the Sviatoshyn land, which had been occupied by a pine grove, was divided into 450 lots and leased for 99 years. Thus –∞ dacha village (summer colony) was set up there. A grid plan was implemented in the village. That area master plan is typical of dacha summer settlements. The core road of Sviatoshyn was Brest-Litovsky highway, now , that went from east to west dividing the village into two unequal parts. * A prosika (, ) means a narrow straight glade in a forest, in which trees have been cut down for further road laying or other business purposes. I. Diakonov Kyiv mayor (1906-1916, 1918) The villa projects were created by the Kyiv architects and . A lot of powerful, influential and rich people had villas there. In particular, villa owners were Kyiv University professors, three Kyiv mayors, businessmen including members of the \\"sugar magnate\\" Tereshchenko family. The popularity of the villa area was growing up because of a pine grove, a pond and a good transport infrastructure. Simultaneously with developing the land area, in 1898 a narrow-gauge railway was laid from Kyiv and it was used as a horsecar tram line then steam tram-cars operated there. In 1901 the village was connected to an electricity network so on the 1st of May that year electric trams were launched. In 1902 Kyiv - Kovel railway, which goes along the east edge of Sviatoshyn village, was finished up building and was opened.

In 1921 Bolsheviks conducted the administrative subdivision reform, so Kyiv was divided into 5 raions (districts) and Sviatoshyn was included into the City Council area permanently. The Bolshevik government was conducting the nationalisation policy so that many dacha villas were expropriated. The best villas were transferred to state and trade unions sanatoriums, boarding schools and Young Pioneer camps. Some other villas and cottages were converted to communal apartments. In practice it means that a house owner family was left just one bedroom, a rest of bedrooms were given to other families, which usually originated from the working class. A kitchen room and a bathroom were used by all families together, that lived in a house. In the 1930s Sviatoshyn's St. Nicholas Eastern Orthodox church was demolished by Bolsheviks.

Notice the route through the Goyt Valley. Also the north-facing junction at Ambergate The various routes followed by the Midland into Manchester The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway ran from a junction with the Midland Railway at Ambergate to Rowsley north of Matlock and thence to Buxton. In time it would become part of the Midland Railway's main line between London and Manchester, but it was initially planned as a route from Manchester to the East of England, via the proposed Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway which would meet it a little further north along the North Midland line at Ambergate. The Act for a line from just south of Stockport to Ambergate was passed in 1846. Currently, the section north of Millers Dale is open as the Great Rocks freight line, Derby to Matlock still holds passenger services as the Derwent Valley line, Matlock to Rowsley is the Peak Rail heritage line, and Rowsley to Buxton has become the Monsal Trail for cycling, horse riding and walking. Ambergate to Rowsley The initial plan was for \\"An Act for making a Railway from the Manchester and Birmingham Railway at Cheadle in the County of Chester to or near to the Ambergate Station of the Midlands Railway in the County of Derby, to be called \\"The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock, and Midlands Junction Railway\\"Local and Personal Act, 9 & 10 Victoria I, c. cxcii HL/PO/PB/1/1846/9&10V1n231 1846 The Bill received Parliamentary Assent in 1846. The line opened as far as Rowsley in 1849, but went no further, having run out of moneyKingscott, G., (2007) Lost Railways of Derbyshire, Newbury: Countryside Books giving its promoters something of a problem. Matlock Bath had long been a tourist town. Since the station at Ambergate had been opened, tourists had been brought in by coach and canal. Around thirty coaches had passed that way each day, with sixty or seventy thousand visitors going on to Chatsworth House.Williams, F.S., (1874) The Midland Railway: Its Rise and Progress Derby: Bemrose and Son The aim then was to develop the trade further. The Midland Railway had held shares in the line since it had been first proposed in 1845, its interest being an extension onto its route to London. The Manchester and Birmingham had for some time been looking for a route of its own, and had considered a line through the Churnet Valley (later built by the North Staffordshire Railway), but had instead supported the alternative Matlock route with a substantial shareholding. However, in 1846 it had merged with other lines to become the LNWR, which clearly could not contemplate a competing London line. In 1852 the two companies agreed to lease the line jointly for 19 years, In addition, the Midland would work the line and pay a rent on it, and also take over the Cromford Canal. Rowsley to Buxton In 1853, a junction was made to the southern end of the Cromford and High Peak Railway now LNWR-owned, at High Peak Junction, and with the latter's support, the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway connected Manchester to the northern end. In 1857, with the LNWR's barely concealed support, the SD&WBR; then gained permission to extend to Buxton. It did so by a roundabout route along a massive escarpment to the east of the Goyt Valley, such that it could never become a through express route. Despite an LNWR petition against the Bill and opposition from the SD&WBR;, the Midland Railway (Rowsley & Buxton) Act of 25 May 1860 authorised a Railway Magazine October 1963 pp. 675‚Äì684 Peter E Baughan: Buxton Centenary line from Rowsley to meet the SD&WBR; at Buxton. Work started in September 1860, under Frederic Campion, the Midland Railway's Southern Division engineer,Graces Guide then under Alfred Andrew Langley (from 1883 Midland's Chief Engineer).Birmingham West Suburban Railway history It was the first time the Midland had built in such difficult terrain, with steep hills and deep valleys, Buxton itself being some above sea level. The line followed the River Wye as far as Bakewell, with the complication of the cut and cover Haddon Tunnel, and reached Hassop in 1862 There then followed two viaducts ‚Äì at Millers Dale and Monsal Dale ‚Äì and eight tunnels, reaching Buxton in 1863 at almost the same time as the LNWR reached it from Whaley Bridge. In 1884 John Ruskin complained of the effect on the dales, saying, \\"your railway drags its close clinging damnation\\".John Ruskin letter to the Editor of the Manchester City News All this time passengers were having to change at Ambergate, but in the same year, the Midland added a south-facing junction and moved the station to allow through travel from Derby and the south.Pixton, B., (2000) North Midland: Portrait of a Famous Route, Cheltenham: Runpast Publishing However, there was still the problem of the joint control of the line. For many years, the town of Wirksworth had been campaigning for a branch line from Duffield. The CH&PR; was interested, but had insufficient funds. The Midland was initially unenthusiastic, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley, avoiding the section to Ambergate, being unsure about what might occur when joint lease expired in 1871.Sprenger, Howard (2004) The Wirksworth Branch, London: Oakwood Press However, the LNWR gave up its share of the line when the lease expired. It was, after all, remote and isolated from the company's main system. The Midland was therefore relieved of the necessity of extending from Wirksworth over a very difficult piece of terrain. The branch opened to Wirksworth in 1867 but was not carried further. To Manchester In the shifting alliances and rivalries between the various companies, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway also wished to keep the Midland away from the coalmines which it served and, in 1859, was planning a line from Hyde just outside Manchester to New Mills and Hayfield. The company was also being courted by the GNR that planned to run London trains through Retford. Meanwhile, the MS&LR;'s manager Edward Watkin had his own plans to reach London through Sheffield. A cement train running west towards Chinley in 1964 It seemed the Midland's only chance was a circuitous route with the help of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, except that it transpired that latter had an agreement with the LNWR not to handle other companies' trains. In 1861, the Midland sent their manager James Allport and some of the directors on a scouting trip around the area, and came by chance upon a party of MS&LR; directors riding in a dog cart. The upshot was that Allport who had previously worked for the latter company should arrange a deal. Since it was clear that the Midland was determined to go ahead, it would be better not to have two lines running side by side. On 7 November 1861 it was formally agreed therefore that the Midland would join the MS&LR; partner's Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction line at New Mills, an agreement which was put into statutes, later including the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee in the \\"Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Act\\" of 6 August 1872.The National Archives  The Catalogue  Full Details  RAIL 471 To do this, it built a junction at Millers Dale, which effectively left Buxton on a branch. Thus railway politics deprived what was (particularly at that time) the largest town in the Peak District of a through main-line station. The Midland's line proceeded to the east of, but parallel to, the LNWR's line until it reached a summit at Peak Forest. It then plunged under the LNWR through Dove Holes Tunnel with stations at Chapel-en-le-Frith, and joining the MS&LR; at New Mills to run into Manchester London Road, opening in 1867. This section of route is still open for stone freight trains serving the Buxton lime industry as the Great Rocks Line. Later history The Midland at last had its route into Manchester from London. Over the years it made some improvements. The route from Romiley through Hyde entailed a long detour, so in 1875 a new more direct line was opened through Reddish. In 1865 the Midland had become a partner of the Cheshire Lines Committee which opened Manchester Central railway station in 1880. Therefore, the Midland transferred most of its trains there, at first reaching it through Stockport Tiviot Dale. However the route became increasingly congested and was hardly suitable as an express route, so in 1897, the Midland opened a new line from New Mills through Disley Tunnel and Heaton Mersey.Truman, P., Hunt, D., (1989) Midland Railway Portrait Sheffield: Platform 5 Publishing summer 1961 leaflet ‚Äì on the reverse the Cheap Day Return fare between the terminals was shown as 5/2 (26p). Closure The line from Matlock to Buxton was closed in June 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, not, as is often thought, by the Beeching reforms. Continuing support is being given by a heritage group Peak Rail who have restored the section from Matlock to Rowsley. The line from Matlock to Ambergate, plus the section of the Midland Main Line to Derby, are now referred to as the Derwent Valley Line. Meanwhile, the Wirksworth branch still exists and is now painstakingly restored as the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway.

An extrasolar planet (designated HD 149026 b, later named Smertrios) is believed to orbit the star. Nomenclature HD 149026 in the star's identifier in the Henry Draper Catalog. Following its discovery in 2005 the planet was designated HD 149026 b. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Ogma for this star and Smertrios for its planet.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The winning names based on those submitted by the Club d'Astronomie de Toussaint of France; namely 'Ogmios' and 'Smertrios'. Ogmios was a Gallo-Roman deity and Smertrios was a Gallic deity of war. The IAU substituted the name of Ogma, a deity of eloquence, writing, and great physical strength in the Celtic mythologies of Ireland and Scotland, and who may be related to Ogmios, because 'Ogmios' is the name of an asteroid (189011 Ogmios).NameExoWorlds The Approved Names In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. Properties The star is thought to be much more massive, larger, and brighter than the Sun. The higher mass means that despite its considerably younger age (2.0 Ga) it is already much more evolved than the Sun. The internal fusion of hydrogen in the core of the star is coming to an end, and it is beginning to evolve towards red gianthood. At a distance of 250 light-years, the star is not visible to the unaided eye. However, it should be easily seen in binoculars or a small telescope. The star is over twice as enriched with chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as the Sun. Because of this and the fact that the star is relatively bright, a group of astronomers in N2K Consortium began to study the star. The star's anomalous composition as measured may be surface pollution only, from the intake of heavy-element planetesimals. Planetary system In 2005 an unusual extrasolar planet was discovered to be orbiting the star. Designated HD 149026 b, it was detected transiting the star allowing its diameter to be measured. It was found to be smaller than other known transiting planets, meaning it is unusually dense for a closely orbiting giant planet. The temperature of the giant planet is calculated to be , generating so much infrared heat that it glows. Scientists believe the planet absorbs nearly all the sunlight and radiates it into space as heat.Imaginova, Sizzling Hot Planet Makes Some Stars Look Cool (5/9/07).

In 1106, the second Icelandic diocese, H√≥lar, was created in the north of Iceland, and J√≥n was appointed its first bishop. He served as bishop there until his death. Influence A religious purist, J√≥n made it his mission to uproot all remnants of paganism. This included changing the names of the days of the week. Thus √ì√∞insdagr, \\"day of Odin\\", became mi√∞vikudagr, \\"mid-week day\\" and the days of T√Ωr and Thor became the prosaic \\"third day\\" and \\"fifth day\\". J√≥n's names for the days are still in use in Iceland today but despite the success of this cosmetic reform it appears that J√≥n did not manage to uproot the memory of the heathen gods. More than a century after his death the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda were written, preserving large amounts of pagan myth and poetry. J√≥n‚Äôs relic was translated to the cathedral of H√≥lar on 3 March 1200, a process called \\"translation\\" which made him a local saint. His feast day, 23 April (the date of his death) was decreed a Holy Day of Obligation for all Iceland at the Althing in the summer of 1200. These two events are distinguished in the Icelandic annals: J√≥n was not 'made a saint' by the Althing. J√≥n never received as much veneration as the first Icelandic saint, Thorlak Thorhallsson. He was venerated primarily in the diocese of H√≥lar, and also at his birthplace, Brei√∞ab√≥lsta√∞ur in Flj√≥tshl√≠√∞; relics were preserved at both these places. J√≥ns saga  A Latin life (vita) about St. J√≥n was probably written by the monk Gunnlaugr Leifsson of the monastery at √ûingeyrar in the early thirteenth century. Composed nearly a century after J√≥n‚Äôs lifetime, its historical value is dubious. It is a classic example of hagiography for a confessor saint, aiming to praise the saintly virtues of its subject rather than record accurate historical information. The Latin original has not survived, but was it translated into Icelandic shortly after its composition and revised on subsequent occasions.

Compare Wiktionary.) with permanent population of about 720 people is a quiet Lithuanian seaside resort village located on the Curonian Spit. A part of Neringa municipality, Juodkrantƒó is the second largest settlement on Lithuania's part of the spit. Situated in Old Prussian territory it was for centuries a fishing village named Schwarzort, which underwent a tourist boom in the late 19th - early 20th century. After World War I this northern part of East Prussia was severed from Germany and the village became known as Juodkrantƒó.Schwarzort in first print referred to as Juodkrante in 1928 History Juodkrantƒó sign graphic design Juodkrantƒó was first mentioned (as Schwarzort) by the Teutonic Knights in 1429 in a letter describing storm damages. It was initially situated along the Baltic Sea shore, about 2.5 km from the present location. In the early 17th century, due to the Black Death, and moving sand dunes threatening to bury the village, it lost almost all of its inhabitants. In the 1680s, the village relocated to its present location along the Curonian Lagoon shore. After 1724, the sources do not mention the village along the Baltic Sea shore any more. The village did quite well in the new location: a tavern was opened in 1673, a school in 1743, and a wooden church in 1795. Until 1740 the village belonged to (Klaipƒóda County), then from 1740‚Äì1795 to Church District (Karvaiƒçiai). It grew in importance after Carwaiten/Karvaiƒçiai/Karwaiten village was swallowed by traveling sand and the seat of the Church District relocated here. The wooden church burned down in 1878 but was soon replaced by a red brick Lutheran church in 1885. Stantien & Becker operations Major developments took place in 1860s. In the late 1850s the lagoon waterway was deepened and now ferries could arrive. It was the easiest way to travel. In the course of the work, samples of amber were found. In 1860 the Stantien & Becker company was founded to dig amber just north of the village. During 30 years of operations, it dug out about 2,250 tonnes of amber. At its peak, the company employed about 1,000 workers. The company had a positive effect on KAKALAS out was used to reinforce the shore and swampy areas. After the company relocated to Palmnicken (now Yantarny) in 1890, the population of Schwarzort dropped from 851 in 1885 to 423 in 1895. The tourist business was started in 1860s by Edward Stellmacher, who turned an old tavern house into a hotel named Kurischer Hof (Lithuanian: Kur≈°i≈≥ kiemas, now Gintaras). Because of the amber business, a new Juodkrantƒó was developed north of the old fishermen village. Many villas and hotels were built there. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 5 hotels, 20 villas, and a convalescent home Luisenbad (Lithuanian: Luizƒós maudykla). The new town was considered a luxury resort and attracted about 3,000 visitors a year. World War II destroyed the tourist business. Neringa was a strictly regulated border region. Only in the early 1960s tourists started to come back. However, Nida became a more popular destination for tourists. This allowed Juodkrantƒó to retain its old business - fishing. Sometimes it is referred to as the \\"capital of fishermen\\" and holds annual fishermen festival in July. =Amber treasure= Stantien & Becker would dig up many pieces of amber shaped as amulets or knick-knacks. At first, they would give them out as souvenirs, but then started collecting these items from the Mid Neolithic and the Bronze Ages. Richard Klebs, professor at K√∂nigsberg University, described 435 items (pendants, buttons, tubular beads, discs, and figurines of humans and animals) in his book Stone Age Amber Adornments in 1882. These ancient Schwarzorter Funde are considered to contain the earliest known amber carving finds from the Baltic Sea area (with amber carvings thousands of years older in other locations). About 150 items have detailed images. The collection was exhibited in Berlin, St. Petersburg, London, Chicago. After Klebs' death, K√∂nigsberg University purchased his collection. However, during the turbulent times of World War II and the expulsions from East Prussia most of the large collection in K√∂nigsberg was destroyed or stolen and only a few items were saved at G√∂ttingen University, previously the sister university of K√∂nigsberg. But scientists were able to make replicas from detailed illustrations in Klebs' book. =Genealogy= Most of the genealogical information was recorded in Church books \\"Kirchenb√ºcher\\" when the wooden church was built in 1795. Records are stored in Evangelisches Zentralarchiv Berlin and Bundesarchiv. Some families moved to Juodkrantƒó from Karwaiten (Karvaiƒçiai) when sand buried this site completely in 1797. Tourist attractions =Hill of Witches= A large collection of wooden sculptures by various artists is displayed on the Hill of Witches (). The sculpture park was started in 1979 and now has more than 70 wooden objects. Most of the figures are based on Lithuanian legends or folk tales. Before the surrounding area was planted with trees, visitors could admire a view of the sea and the lagoon. =Sculpture park \\"Land and Water\\"= Weathervane gallery Another sculpture park was finished in 2002. It houses 31 stone and metal sculptures created during an international symposium \\"Land and Water.\\" The sculptures are located on the recently built quay, 2.4 km in length, along the lagoon shore. A Weathervane gallery (Vƒótrungi≈≥ galerija) is maintained by Daiva and Remigijus ≈Ωadeikiai. The gallery has information on the Nerija cultural heritage. There is also a gallery maintained by the Lithuanian National Art Museum. =The heron and cormorant colonies= Cormorant nests on dead pine trees in the colony near Juodkrantƒó Of interest to nature watchers are the large great cormorant (2000 pairs) and grey heron (500 pairs) colonies west of Juodkrantƒó. It is believed that the herons have nested near Juodkrantƒó since 17th century, but the cormorants arrived only at the beginning of 19th century. The cormorants were exterminated at the end of the 19th century due to Prussian administration regulations and started to reappear only in the 1970s. The large cormorant colony has damaged the old and fragile forest because the birds' excrement burns tree roots. During last 15 years about 10 ha (25 acres) of forest has died. Fishermen blame the birds for diminishing fish catches, but unlike in Prussia, the regulations now do not allow killing them as both grey heron and great cormorant are protected species in Lithuania. Famous people * Gustav Fenkohl, a sea- and landscape painter, was born in 1872 in nearby Memel and lived for many years in the village.

O'Charley's is located in 17 Southern and Midwestern states, including four franchised O'Charley's in Ohio, and three joint venture O'Charley's restaurants in Louisiana. O'Charley's was part of the parent company O'Charley's, Inc. Enterprise, a multi-concept restaurant company that operated or franchised a total of 363 restaurants under three brands: O'Charley's, Ninety Nine Restaurant, and Stoney River Legendary Steaks. In 2012, O'Charley's, Inc. Enterprise was acquired by Fidelity National Financial and became part of American Blue Ribbon Holdings. History An O'Charley's restaurant in Acworth, Georgia Charles (Sonny) Watkins founded O'Charley's restaurant in 1971 on 21st Avenue South in Nashville, across the street from Vanderbilt University. Watkins ran O'Charley's from 1971 to 1984 when he sold the restaurant to David K. Wachtel. David K. Wachtel spent 23 years working for Shoney's where he eventually became president and chief executive officer of the restaurant company. Wachtel resigned from Shoney's in 1982. Wachtel intended to develop the O'Charley's restaurant into a restaurant chain. In mid-1987, the 12th O'Charley's opened in Lexington, Kentucky, occupying a site formerly used by the Bennigan's chain of restaurants. While the Lexington grand opening was under way, Wachtel was working on plans to convert two more Bennigan's units in Huntsville, Alabama and Nashville, Tennessee into O'Charley's. In December 1993, Burns and McWhorter announced the formulation of a growth strategy designed to carry the 45-unit chain into the ranks of the country's largest regional dinner-house chains. In 1994, the company planned to open at least eight new O'Charley's restaurants, situating the new units primarily in southeastern markets such as Cookeville, Tennessee; Louisville and Paducah, Kentucky; and Palm Harbor, Florida. There was an expectation of restaurants opening for the year, but as time continued past 1994 other issues hindered this expansion. In February 1994, Wachtel resigned as chairman of O'Charley's, citing his \\"pressing commitments\\" with other business interests, the most notable of which was the 300-unit Western Sizzlin' budget steakhouse chain he had acquired in 1993. Burns was named chief executive and co-chairman and McWhorter was tapped as president and co-chairman. One month after Wachtel's resignation, the company was advised that four former O'Charley's employees had filed a federal lawsuit charging the restaurant chain with racial discrimination practices against African Americans in the company's hiring, assignment, and promotion procedures. Burns denied the charges In 2007, O'Charley's closed its Nashville commissary and distribution center, and began using Performance Food Group to distribute product to all of its locations. In 2013, O'Charley's launched \\"Free Pie Wednesday.\\" Any dine-in customer ordering an entree on Wednesdays will receive a free slice of pie. In 2014 O'Charley's selected BOHAN Advertising as a marketing partner. In April 2019, O'Charley's closed a single location in Florida. Three months later, O'Charley's abruptly closed eight locations in Indiana and Georgia in June 2019. The company had 201 locations in 2018, down from 213 in 2016.

Imotski, like the surrounding inland Dalmatia, has a generally mild Mediterranean climate which makes it a popular tourist destination. Geography The town is located close to the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, 10 km away from Posu≈°je and 18 km from Grude. It is located 29 km away from the coast (Ba≈°ka Voda). The nearest coastal town is Makarska, on the other side of the Biokovo massif. The town is located on the crossroad of D60 and D76 state roads and 20 km from the Sveti Ilija Tunnel. The A1 motorway is accessed at the Zagvozd Interchange, next to the D76 expressway. Imotski is known for its medieval fortress on the rocks of Blue Lake. Another phenomenon is the Red Lake which looks like an eye in the scenery. Both lakes are said to be connected with underground channels to the Adriatic Sea. History The region around Imotski has been populated in the Neolithic age. At the time of Illyrians and Romans it was known as \\"Emotha\\" and later \\"Imota\\". It was first mentioned by today's name by Byzantine Emperor Constantin Porphyrogennetos in the 10th century. In medieval historical sources it was mentioned as important fortress. The fortress above the town, Topana, was first mentioned in the 9th century, in the times of Croatian sovereigns. Imotski was held by the Turks from the fall of Bosnia in 1492 until 1717 when it was captured by the Venetians.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 308, Zagreb (1999), In April 1717, a small church, dedicated to the Lady of Angels, was built in honour of the victory against the Ottomans. The Lady of Angels has since then been honored as patroness of Imotski and Imotski region. The Hasanaginica folk ballad was created in the Imotski region in mid 17th century. In 1912, a secondary school was built in Imotski when the town was part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From 1941 to 1945 Imotski was part of the Independent State of Croatia. In April 1944, German forces shot down three American B-24s. The local population saved many of the American personnel despite being bombed by them. One airman/paratrooper, Marion Dropulich (Marijan Dropuljiƒá) who crashed near Imotski, but survived and was taken by Italian Soldiers happened to have been a Croatian American with immediate Imotski ancestry.  Climate  The climate is modified Mediterranean, with the highest air temperature averaging during July and the lowest averaging , in January. Summers are usually very hot during the day, temperature goes up to 40 ¬∞C. Temperatures above last for more than 250 days a year. Two kinds of wind are common in the area - the northern to north-eastern bora, which usually brings cold and clear weather in winter, and the southern to south- eastern sirocco, which often brings rain.  Population  According to the 2011 census, the town proper has a population of 4,757, while the whole municipality has a population of 10,764. The absolute majority are Croats with 96.78% of the population. The Town of Imotski administratively consists of following settlements: * Donji Vinjani - 2,169 * Glavina Donja - 1,748 * Glavina Gornja - 283 * Gornji Vinjani - 1,422 * Imotski - 4,757 * Medvidoviƒáa Draga - 385  Notable people  ≈Ωarko Domljan, the first Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, was born in Imotski. The famous poet Tin Ujeviƒá spent part of his childhood in Imotski. Politician, poet and Croatian dissident Vlado Gotovac was born and spent his early years in Imotski. The town itself is home to Croatian league football club NK Imotski. There are other individuals born in Imotski to have made their names known outside of the local region. In the world of entertainment, there is the singer Neda Ukraden and film director Antun Vrdoljak. Sports stars include female tennis player Silvija Talaja and footballers Zvonimir Boban, Ante Rebiƒá, Tomislav Bu≈°iƒá and Ivan Gudelj. The father of former Canada national men's ice hockey team captain Joe Sakic, Marijan ≈†akiƒá, is from Imotski.

Mobile phones are often referred to as feature phones, and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native code try to differentiate their own products by implementing additional functions to make them more attractive to consumers. This has led to great innovation in mobile phone development over the past 20 years. The common components found on all phones are: * A number of metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips. * A battery (typically a lithium-ion battery), providing the power source for the phone functions. * An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone. The most common input mechanism is a keypad, but touch screens are also found in smartphones. * Basic mobile phone services to allow users to make calls and send text messages. * All GSM phones use a SIM card to allow an account to be swapped among devices. Some CDMA devices also have a similar card called a R-UIM. * Individual GSM, WCDMA, IDEN and some satellite phone devices are uniquely identified by an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. All mobile phones are designed to work on cellular networks and contain a standard set of services that allow phones of different types and in different countries to communicate with each other. However, they can also support other features added by various manufacturers over the years: * roaming which permits the same phone to be used in multiple countries, providing that the operators of both countries have a roaming agreement. * send and receive data and faxes (if a computer is attached), access WAP services, and provide full Internet access using technologies such as GPRS. * applications like a clock, alarm, calendar, contacts, and calculator and a few games. * Sending and receiving pictures and videos (by without internet) through MMS, and for short distances with e.g. Bluetooth. *In Multimedia phones Bluetooth is commonly but important Feature. * GPS receivers integrated or connected (i.e. using Bluetooth) to cell phones, primarily to aid in dispatching emergency responders and road tow truck services. This feature is generally referred to as E911. * Push to talk, available on some mobile phones, is a feature that allows the user to be heard only while the talk button is held, similar to a walkie-talkie. * A hardware notification LED on some phones  MOS integrated circuit chips  A typical smartphone contains a number of metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, which in turn contain billions of tiny MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). A typical smartphone contains the following MOS IC chips. *Application processor (CMOS system-on-a-chip) *Flash memory (floating-gate MOS memory) *Cellular modem (baseband RF CMOS) *RF transceiver (RF CMOS) *Phone camera image sensor (CMOS image sensor) *Power management integrated circuit (power MOSFETs) *Display driver (LCD or LED driver) *Wireless communication chips (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS receiver) *Sound chip (audio codec and power amplifier) *Gyroscope *Capacitive touchscreen controller (ASIC and DSP) *RF power amplifier (LDMOS)  Software, applications and services  Software-side view of a typical smartphone In early stages, every mobile phone company had its own user interface, which can be considered as \\"closed\\" operating system, since there was a minimal configurability. A limited variety of basic applications (usually games, accessories like calculator or conversion tool and so on) was usually included with the phone and those were not available otherwise. Early mobile phones included basic web browser, for reading basic WAP pages. Handhelds (Personal digital assistants like Palm, running Palm OS) were more sophisticated and also included more advanced browser and a touch screen (for use with stylus), but these were not broadly used, comparing to standard phones. Other capabilities like Pulling and Pushing Emails or working with calendar were also made more accessible but it usually required physical (and not wireless) Syncing. BlackBerry 850, an email pager, released January 19, 1999, was the first device to integrate Email. A major step towards a more \\"open\\" mobile OS was the symbian S60 OS, that could be expanded by downloading software (written in C++, java or python), and its appearance was more configurable. In July 2008, Apple introduced its App store, which made downloading mobile applications more accessible. In October 2008, the HTC Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux-based Android OS, which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time (Mainly Symbian operating system, BlackBerry OS, and iOS)-The operating system offered a customizable graphical user interface and a notification system showing a list of recent messages pushed from apps. The most commonly used data application on mobile phones is SMS text messaging. The first SMS text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993. The first mobile news service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000. Mobile news services are expanding with many organizations providing \\"on-demand\\" news services by SMS. Some also provide \\"instant\\" news pushed out by SMS. Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payments systems, on the mobile operators Globe and Smart. Today, mobile payments ranging from mobile banking to mobile credit cards to mobile commerce are very widely used in Asia and Africa, and in selected European markets. Usually, the SMS services utilize short code. Some network operators have utilized USSD for information, entertainment or finance services (e.g. M-Pesa). Other non-SMS data services used on mobile phones include mobile music, downloadable logos and pictures, gaming, gambling, adult entertainment and advertising. The first downloadable mobile content was sold to a mobile phone in Finland in 1998, when Radiolinja (now Elisa) introduced the downloadable ringtone service. In 1999, Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo introduced its mobile Internet service, i-Mode, which today is the world's largest mobile Internet service. Even after the appearance of smartphones, network operators have continued to offer information services, although in some places, those services have become less common. Power supply Mobile phone charging service in Uganda The world's five largest handset makers introduced a new rating system in November 2008 to help consumers more easily identify the most energy-efficient chargers. Mobile phones generally obtain power from rechargeable batteries. There are a variety of ways used to charge cell phones, including USB, portable batteries, mains power (using an AC adapter), cigarette lighters (using an adapter), or a dynamo. In 2009, the first wireless charger was released for consumer use.goingcellular.com ‚Äî Powermat wireless charger now available Some manufacturers have been experimenting with alternative power sources, including solar cells.Charge Use Mini Solar Panel  Android Phones. Various initiatives, such as the EU Common External Power Supply have been announced to standardize the interface to the charger, and to promote energy efficiency of mains-operated chargers. A star rating system is promoted by some manufacturers, where the most efficient chargers consume less than 0.03 watts and obtain a five-star rating. =Battery= Most modern mobile phones use a lithium-ion battery. A popular early mobile phone battery was the nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) type, due to its relatively small size and low weight. Lithium-ion batteries later became commonly used, as they are lighter and do not have the voltage depression due to long-term over-charging that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers use lithium‚Äìpolymer batteries as opposed to the older lithium-ion, the main advantages being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid.  SIM card  Typical mobile phone SIM card GSM mobile phones require a small microchip called a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM card, to function. The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the service-subscriber key (IMSI) used to identify a subscriber on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device. A SIM card contains its unique serial number, internationally unique number of the mobile user (IMSI), security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to and two passwords (PIN for usual use and PUK for unlocking). SIM cards are available in three standard sizes. The first is the size of a credit card (85.60 mm √ó 53.98 mm x 0.76 mm, defined by ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1). The newer, most popular miniature version has the same thickness but a length of 25 mm and a width of 15 mm (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-000), and has one of its corners truncated (chamfered) to prevent misinsertion. The newest incarnation known as the 3FF or micro-SIM has dimensions of 15 mm √ó 12 mm. Most cards of the two smaller sizes are supplied as a full-sized card with the smaller card held in place by a few plastic links; it can easily be broken off to be used in a device that uses the smaller SIM. The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient for the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja. Giesecke & Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Elisa (ex. Radiolinja). Those cell phones that do not use a SIM card have the data programmed into their memory. This data is accessed by using a special digit sequence to access the \\"NAM\\" as in \\"Name\\" or number programming menu. From there, information can be added, including a new number for the phone, new Service Provider numbers, new emergency numbers, new Authentication Key or A-Key code, and a Preferred Roaming List or PRL. However, to prevent the phone being accidentally disabled or removed from the network, the Service Provider typically locks this data with a Master Subsidiary Lock (MSL). The MSL also locks the device to a particular carrier when it is sold as a loss leader. The MSL applies only to the SIM, so once the contract has expired, the MSL still applies to the SIM. The phone, however, is also initially locked by the manufacturer into the Service Provider's MSL. This lock may be disabled so that the phone can use other Service Providers' SIM cards. Most phones purchased outside the U.S. are unlocked phones because there are numerous Service Providers that are close to one another or have overlapping coverage. The cost to unlock a phone varies but is usually very cheap and is sometimes provided by independent phone vendors. A similar module called a Removable User Identity Module or RUIM card is present in some CDMA networks, notably in China and Indonesia. =Multi-card hybrid phones= A hybrid mobile phone can take more than one SIM card, even of different types. The SIM and RUIM cards can be mixed together, and some phones also support three or four SIMs.Example of a Triple SIM hybrid phone.The Latest F160 Quad Sim Quad Standby TV Java Phone with Qwerty Keyboard  Tri Sim Phones. From 2010 onwards they became popular in India and Indonesia and other emerging markets,https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110429/wr_nm/us_handsets attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on-net calling rate. In Q3 2011, Nokia shipped 18 million of its low cost dual SIM phone range in an attempt to make up lost ground in the higher end smartphone market.  Display  Mobile phones have a display device, some of which are also touch screens. The screen size varies greatly by model and is usually specified either as width and height in pixels or the diagonal measured in inches. Some mobiles have more than one display, for example that mobileKyocera Echo, an Android smartphone with a dual 3.5 inch screen. The screens can also be combined into a single 4.7 inch tablet style computer.Kyocera Echo Phone Review  PCWorld.  Central processing unit  Mobile phones have central processing units (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments. In smartphones, the CPU is typically integrated in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) application processor. Mobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of hertz) but also the memory hierarchy also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.  Miscellaneous features  Other features that may be found on mobile phones include GPS navigation, music (MP3) and video (MP4) playback, RDS radio receiver, built-in projector, vibration and other \\"silent\\" ring options, alarms, memo recording, personal digital assistant functions, ability to watch streaming video, video download, video calling, built-in cameras (1.0+ Mpx) and camcorders (video recording), with autofocus and flash, ringtones, games, PTT, memory card reader (SD), USB (2.0), dual line support, infrared, Bluetooth (2.0) and WiFi connectivity, NFC, instant messaging, Internet e-mail and browsing and serving as a wireless modem. The first smartphone was the Nokia 9000 Communicator in 1996 which added PDA functionality to the basic mobile phone at the time. As miniaturization and increased processing power of microchips has enabled ever more features to be added to phones, the concept of the smartphone has evolved, and what was a high-end smartphone five years ago, is a standard phone today. Several phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM BlackBerry focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the SonyEricsson Walkman series of musicphones and Cybershot series of cameraphones; the Nokia Nseries of multimedia phones, the Palm Pre the HTC Dream and the Apple iPhone. Nokia and the University of Cambridge demonstrated a bendable cell phone called the Morph.Reardon, Marguerite. \\"Nokia demos bendable cell phone\\". CNET News, February 25, 2008. Retrieved 20 July 2009. Some phones have an electromechanical transducer on the back which changes the electrical voice signal into mechanical vibrations. The vibrations flow through the cheek bones or forehead allowing the user to hear the conversation. This is useful in the noisy situations or if the user is hard of hearing.Mito 228: Unique Handphone, Can Hear with the cheek , IeuMart.com As of 2018, there are smartphones that offer reverse wireless charging.  Multi-mode and multi-band mobile phones  Most mobile phone networks are digital and use the GSM, CDMA or iDEN standard which operate at various radio frequencies. These phones can only be used with a service plan from the same company. For example, a Verizon phone cannot be used with a T-Mobile service, and vica versa. A multi-mode phone operates across different standards whereas a multi-band phone (also known more specifically as dual, tri or quad band) mobile phone is a phone which is designed to work on more than one radio frequency. Some multi-mode phones can operate on analog networks as well (for example, dual band, tri-mode: AMPS 800 / CDMA 800 / CDMA 1900). For a GSM phone, dual-band usually means 850 / 1900 MHz in the United States and Canada, 900 / 1800 MHz in Europe and most other countries. Tri-band means 850 / 1800 / 1900 MHz or 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz. Quad-band means 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz, also called a world phone, since it can work on any GSM network. Multi-band phones have been valuable to enable roaming whereas multi- mode phones helped to introduce WCDMA features without customers having to give up the wide coverage of GSM. Almost every single true 3G phone sold is actually a WCDMA/GSM dual-mode mobile. This is also true of 2.75G phones such as those based on CDMA-2000 or EDGE. = Challenges in producing multi-mode phones = The special challenge involved in producing a multi-mode mobile is in finding ways to share the components between the different standards. Obviously, the phone keypad and display should be shared, otherwise it would be hard to treat as one phone. Beyond that, though, there are challenges at each level of integration. How difficult these challenges are depends on the differences between systems. When talking about IS-95/GSM multi-mode phones, for example, or AMPS/IS-95 phones, the base band processing is very different from system to system. This leads to real difficulties in component integration and so to larger phones. An interesting special case of multi-mode phones is the WCDMA/GSM phone. The radio interfaces are very different from each other, but mobile to core network messaging has strong similarities, meaning that software sharing is quite easy. Probably more importantly, the WCDMA air interface has been designed with GSM compatibility in mind. It has a special mode of operation, known as punctured mode, in which, instead of transmitting continuously, the mobile is able to stop sending for a short period and try searching for GSM carriers in the area. This mode allows for safe inter-frequency handovers with channel measurements which can only be approximated using \\"pilot signals\\" in other CDMA based systems. A final interesting case is that of mobiles covering the DS-WCDMA and MC-CDMA 3G variants of the CDMA-2000 protocol. Initially, the chip rate of these phones was incompatible. As part of the negotiations related to patents, it was agreed to use compatible chip rates. This should mean that, despite the fact that the air and system interfaces are quite different, even on a philosophical level, much of the hardware for each system inside a phone should be common with differences being mostly confined to software. Data communications Mobile phones are now heavily used for data communications. such as SMS messages, browsing mobile web sites, and even streaming audio and video files. The main limiting factors are the size of the screen, lack of a keyboard, processing power and connection speed. Most cellphones, which supports data communications, can be used as wireless modems (via cable or bluetooth), to connect computer to internet. Such access method is slow and expensive, but it can be available in very remote areas. With newer smartphones, screen resolution and processing power has become bigger and better. Some new phone CPUs run at over 1 GHz. Many complex programs are now available for the various smartphones, such as Symbian and Windows Mobile. Connection speed is based on network support. Originally data transfers over GSM networks were possible only over CSD (circuit switched data), it has bandwidth of 9600 bit/s and usually is billed by connection time (from network point of view, it does not differ much from voice call). Later, there were introduced improved version of CSD - HSCSD (high speed CSD), it could use multiple time slots for downlink, improving speed. Maximum speed for HSCSD is ~42 kbit/s, it also is billed by time. Later was introduced GPRS (general packet radio service), which operates on completely different principle. It also can use multiple time slots for transfer, but it does not tie up radio resources, when not transferring data (as opposed to CSD and like). GPRS usually is prioritized under voice and CSD, so latencies are large and variable. Later, GPRS was upgraded to EDGE, which differs mainly by radio modulation, squeezing more data capacity in same radio bandwidth. GPRS and EDGE usually are billed by data traffic volume. Some phones also feature full Qwerty keyboards, such as the LG enV. As of April 2006, several models, such as the Nokia 6680, support 3G communications. Such phones have access to the Web via a free download of the Opera web browser. Verizon Wireless models come with Internet Explorer pre-loaded onto the phone. Vulnerability to viruses As more complex features are added to phones, they become more vulnerable to viruses which exploit weaknesses in these features. Even text messages can be used in attacks by worms and viruses. Advanced phones capable of e-mail can be susceptible to viruses that can multiply by sending messages through a phone's address book. In some phone models, the USSD was exploited for inducing a factory reset, resulting in clearing the data and resetting the user settings. A virus may allow unauthorized users to access a phone to find passwords or corporate data stored on the device. Moreover, they can be used to commandeer the phone to make calls or send messages at the owner's expense. Mobile phones used to have proprietary operating system unique only to the manufacturer which had the beneficial effect of making it harder to design a mass attack. However, the rise of software platforms and operating systems shared by many manufacturers such as Java, Microsoft operating systems, Linux, or Symbian OS, may increase the spread of viruses in the future. Bluetooth is a feature now found in many higher-end phones, and the virus Caribe hijacked this function, making Bluetooth phones infect other Bluetooth phones running the Symbian OS. In early November 2004, several web sites began offering a specific piece of software promising ringtones and screensavers for certain phones. Those who downloaded the software found that it turned each icon on the phone's screen into a skull-and-crossbones and disabled their phones, so they could no longer send or receive text messages or access contact lists or calendars. The virus has since been dubbed \\"Skulls\\" by security experts. The Commwarrior-A virus was identified in March 2005, and it attempts to replicate itself through MMS to others on the phone's contact list. Like Cabir, Commwarrior-A also tries to communicate via Bluetooth wireless connections with other devices, which can eventually lead to draining the battery. The virus requires user intervention for propagation however. Bluetooth phones are also subject to bluejacking, which although not a virus, does allow for the transmission of unwanted messages from anonymous Bluetooth users.  Cameras  Most current phones also have a built-in digital camera (see camera phone), that can have resolutions as high as 108M pixels. This gives rise to some concern about privacy, in view of possible voyeurism, for example in swimming pools. South Korea has ordered manufacturers to ensure that all new handsets emit a beep whenever a picture is taken. Sound recording and video recording is often also possible. Most people do not walk around with a video camera, but do carry a phone. The arrival of video camera phones is transforming the availability of video to consumers, and helps fuel citizen journalism.

It is mild with a creamy and salty flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a low melting point. It can be yellow or white in color; yellow American cheese is seasoned and colored with annatto. It originated in the 1910s and is a common staple in many American dishes.  History  British colonists made cheddar cheese soon after their arrival in North America. By 1790, American- made cheddars were being exported back to England. According to Robert Carlton Brown, author of The Complete Book of Cheese, \\"The English called our imitation Yankee, or American, Cheddar, while here at home it was popularly known as yellow or store cheese\\".Robert Carlton Brown, The Complete Book of Cheese (New York: Programmer Publishing Company, 1955). Republished in 2006: \\"Bob\\" Brown, The Complete Book of Cheese (Echo Library, 2006). The Oxford English Dictionary lists the first known usage of \\"American cheese\\" as occurring in the Frankfort, Kentucky, newspaper The Guardian of Freedom in 1804. The next usage given is in 1860 by Charles Dickens in his series The Uncommercial Traveller. The cheeseburger is a popular food in North America (shown topped with American cheese). After patenting a new method for manufacturing processed cheese in 1916, James L. Kraft began marketing it in the late 1910s, and the term \\"American cheese\\" rapidly began to refer to the processed variety instead of the traditional but more expensive cheddars also made and sold in the U.S. Legal definition According to the Standards of Identity for Dairy Products, part of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), to be labeled \\"American cheese\\" a processed cheese is required to be manufactured from cheddar cheese, colby cheese, washed curd cheese, or granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these.US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Subchapter B, Part 133, Section 169-173 (Pasteurized processed cheese), the allowed usage of the term \\"American cheese\\" for certain types of \\"Pasteurized processed cheese\\" is detailed. The CFR also includes regulations for the manufacturing of processed American cheese. Because its manufacturing process differs from traditional cheeses, federal laws mandate that it be labeled as \\"process American cheese\\" if made from combining more than one cheese, or \\"process American cheese food\\" if dairy ingredients such as cream, milk, skim milk, buttermilk, cheese whey, or albumin from cheese whey are added. Manufacturing process Traditional cheese is ground, combined with emulsifying agents and other ingredients, mixed and heated until it forms a \\"melted homogeneous\\" mixture. To pasteurize it, the cheese mixture must be heated to a temperature of at least for a minimum of 30 seconds. Composition requirements of processed American cheese control the percentage of milkfat, moisture, salt and pH value in the final product, along with specifications for flavor, body and texture, color, and meltability. Processed American cheese is packaged in individually wrapped slices, as unwrapped slices sold in stacks, or in unsliced blocks. Individually wrapped slices are formed from processed cheese which solidifies only between the wrapping medium; these slices, sold as \\"singles\\", are typically the least like traditional cheese. Blocks of American cheese are more similar to traditional cheese, and are sliced to order at deli counters. Market size Americans purchased about $2.77 billion worth of American cheese in 2018, but the popularity was falling, and, according to Bloomberg News, sales were projected to drop 1.6% in 2018. The average price for a pound of American was below $4 () for the first time since 2011.

The village is contiguous with Winterbourne to the south-west and Coalpit Heath to the east. The parish borders Iron Acton to the north and Westerleigh to the south-east, the large town of Yate is away. The village is north-east of the city of Bristol. The village has evolved from a once rural Gloucestershire village, to a partial dormitory village for Bristol. The population according to the UK crime statistics was around 9,385 and is increasing. The population was remeasured at the 2011 census and came to 6,520 for the parish alone.  History  = Pre Anglo- Saxon history = Dullage- The row of shops at the Frampton End Road/Church Road junction, believed to be the site of a Roman settlement in the village Very little archaeological work has taken place in the Frampton Cotterell area so knowledge of the area prior to the Anglo-Saxon arrival is limited. Local historians tend to use field names and street names to work out the distant history of the village. It is believed from place names that there were two settlements in the area in the Roman times. One centred on the group of shops at the Church Road/Frampton End Road junction, where the name Dullage survived until the 1940s. The second was in rural farmland west of Cogmill in between Frampton Cotterell and Iron Acton, here several fields held the name Chessolds from the old English 'ceastel' meaning 'a heap of stones'.Frampton Cotterell and Coalpit Heath by the Frampton Cotterell Local History Society Tempus, 2007. = Anglo-Saxon and Medieval history = The name Frampton means 'the settlement (farmstead or village) on the Frome'. Frampton Cotterell was recorded as Frantone in the Domesday Book (1086). All the other local villages (Westerleigh, Stoke Gifford and Winterbourne) also have Old English names, suggesting they were either conquered or resettled between 577 and 1066. Early in the 11th century, Frampton may have been under the manor of Winterbourne, a later medieval record refers to 'the Lordship of Frampton and Winterbourne'. This would have included Stoke Gifford. However, at no point after 1066 were these three manors owned by the same person. The name of a lane in the village, 'Harris Barton' also may be of pre-Norman origin, Barton comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'bere' and 'tun' meaning 'place where grain was stored' this suggests there was a farm here prior to Norman conquest. In 1086 Frampton was held by Walter the Crossbowman (Balistarius) and then contained 10 villagers and 11 smallholders. Indicating a total population of about 100, to this total should be added slaves and their families. In 1086 there was a church which was not there before 1066 (so under 20 years old) this church was probably on the site of St. Peter's church today. There were also two water mills, probably behind the church (near Mill Lane today) and at Cogmill. By 1301 Frampton had a third watermill, probably at 'Frampton Lido' upstream from the church (where remains of a mill could be seen as late as the 1970s), a windmill, on the site of the current one at Brockeridge. and a coal pit, presumably at Coalpit Heath (although this name did not appear until around 1680) By the 13th century the village was known as Frampton Cotell. Oxford Dictionary of British Place NamesPlea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/677; Year: 1430; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no677/aCP40no677fronts/IMG_0637.htm; 4th entry; home of the defendant, Thomas Weston The name Cotell or Cotterell is derived from the Cotele Family, lords of Frampton Manor in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Their manor house was not at modern day Frampton Court, it was probably located behind the church on the east of Mill Lane, here the field names 'Hall Marsh' and 'Hall Marsh Mead' survived into the 19th Century. The medieval village was long and rectangular, located on the ridge between (Lower) Stone Close and the River Frome, and between Church Road and Rectory Road. The village was provided for using the open field system. Surrounding the village would have been three big fields; these fields were cultivated by peasants who held scattered strips in the many furlongs which made up the fields, every year one of the fields would be left unploughed and would be fertilised by the manure from the local animals. This system would have provided for the village. Besides these fields there were also common wastes, Frampton Common, Adam's Land, Brockridge, Goose Green, Woodend Green, and Tovey's Green to name a few. This system lasted until about 1550 by which time the big fields had made way for compact farms, cultivated by independent farmers as they saw fit. This boosted the village's economy, providing dairy products, cider, pigs, and turnips. = Industrial era = Frampton Cotterell developed on a sloping bank of the River Frome, as seen here from Frampton Common on the other side of the river. St. Peter's Church is off to the left of the picture. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the hamlets of Brockridge, Adam's Land and others joined together with Frampton Cotterell to form the modern village. Since then the modern village has joined with Winterbourne, Watley's End and Coalpit Heath. One notable Industrial Revolution landmark in the village is the hat factory on Park Lane. Frampton Cotterell Church of England Primary School was established on School Road in the village in the 19th century. It was moved to its present location on Rectory Road in the 1960s. = 20th and 21st centuries = Ordnance Survey maps from the middle of the 20th century show open land between the three villages of Frampton Cotterell, Coalpit Heath and Winterbourne. Hamlets at Watley's End, Frampton End and Harris Barton,Ordnance Survey one-inch map of Great Britain, Sheet 156 Bristol and Stroud, Seventh series 1949, 1963 revision all of which are now part of Frampton Cotterell and Winterbourne, were still separate at this time. The most dramatic changes have occurred in the south-east of the village at the boundary with Coalpit Heath, in 1928 Beesmoor Road was constructed through farmland, connecting Badminton Road, the main Yate ‚Äì Bristol thoroughfare, with the Woodend area of Frampton Cotterell. Since then estates of closes, drives and cul-de-sacs have been built up in the green land between Park Lane and Woodend Road. In the 1960s Church Road, the main thoroughfare, was rerouted A field in between Rectory Road and Church Road called 'Benson's Field' was sold for housing becoming the 'Benson's Estate'. This estate comprises Beaufort Road, Foxe Road, Winchcombe Road and Brookside Close. Another field north of School Road was built on becoming Robel Avenue and Western Avenue. Houses on Heather Avenue and Beesmoor Road were built. In 1996, an area of farmland to the south of the village was sold in a joint contract with housing estate developers Barratt and Taywood. In the years 1996‚Äì2000 they built a large housing estate known as Park Farm, adding an extra 200 3,4 and 5 bedroomed homes to the settlement. There was fierce opposition from local residents, particularly those living on Beesmoor Road. This followed another 20th-century housing development between Woodend Road and Beesmoor Road. In 2011 Barratt Homes began building another large estate on Denny's Field, alongside Park Farm and Heather Avenue, again despite fierce opposition from residents.  Geography  The centre of Frampton Cotterell, looking down Church Road from Ryecroft Road, towards the River Frome, St. Peter's Church is visible. The former post office is on the right. Frampton Cotterell is seven miles north east of Bristol City centre, and two miles outside the city's ring road, and lies in the commuter belt. It is joined to the villages of Winterbourne and Coalpit Heath, forming a sizeable settlement with a collective population of around 17,500. It is linked by the A432 to Yate and Chipping Sodbury to the north and Downend to the south. There are three takeaways in the village. A Chinese takeaway also sells fish and chips, a fish and chip shop and there is an Indian takeaway all on Lower Stone Close. The Golden Lion Pub on Beesmoor Road was an Indian takeaway with restaurant facilities but has now been demolished for housing despite being one of the oldest buildings in the village. The village has its own Post Office located in the Nisa shop. The village also has a handful of small grocery shops including a Sainsburys which was opened in 2016. The A432 is used by residents to travel into nearby Yate and Downend for services. Frampton Cotterell is twinned with Kelbra, Germany. In Popular Culture Frampton is mentioned in the Monty Python sketch \\"Adolph Hitler lives In a guesthouse in Minehead\\". Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from Frampton Cotterell in the south to Iron Acton in the north. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 7,327. = Cogmill = Cogmill is the name of a historical, and now almost non-existent hamlet in the north of Frampton Cotterell parish in South Gloucestershire. It is located on the B4058 between Frampton Cotterell and Iron Acton, and was possibly the site of a Roman settlement. The name derives from the site of a watermill that was the originally recorded in the 1086 Doomsday census as \\"Cock Mill\\" and served as a gristmill for \\"Cock Mill Farm\\". The last known recording of this spelling was in the Appointment Roll of 1841 Tithe Map, from then on it has been known as Cogmill. The watermill remained functioning until the early 19th century and was final demolished in 1958 by a compulsory purchase order by South Gloucestershire Council to eliminate a sharp corner on the B4058 road. Cogmill Farm still remains but the only evidence of the watermill is the remains of the tail-race tunnel and spill tunnel each side of the current river bridge. An article describing the mill was published by the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society in 1981 (BIAS Journal, volume 13, page 2) In 2006 near the site of Cogmill, South Gloucestershire Council selected an area of land for a residential site for Gypsies and Travellers called Frampton Park.

He played at Bolton Wanderers in the mid to late 1990s. Career =Early years= A supporter of Celtic in childhood, McGinlay's first senior game was as a 16-year-old for his hometown club Fort William, in a Highland Football League game in August 1980 against Elgin City. Following a year playing in New Zealand either side of two seasons with Nairn County, and a three-year spell with English Football Conference club Yeovil Town, McGinlay returned to the Highland League with Elgin City in 1988. He then progressed through English League football, initially playing with Shrewsbury Town then with Bury. After a successful loan spell with Millwall, in which he scored during their unsuccessful participation in the 1991 Football League play-offs, McGinlay moved to The Den permanently for the 1991‚Äì92 season. He scored 27 goals in 52 league matches for the London club. =Bolton Wanderers= McGinlay is perhaps best known for his five-year spell with Bolton Wanderers between 1992 and 1997, where his scoring exploits led to him being nicknamed 'Super John'. After his goals eliminated FA Cup holders Liverpool from the competition, he successfully partnered fellow Scot Andy Walker as the Trotters gained promotion from the third tier in 1993, with McGinlay scoring the match winning penalty in the last fixture against local rivals Preston North End. Further cup 'giant killings' over teams such as Everton and Arsenal followed the next year, with McGinlay featuring prominently ‚Äì he scored 33 goals across all competitions during the campaign, and the team became known in local media as 'white hot' due to the performances. In the 1995 he was in the side which gained promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs, playing all 120 minutes of the dramatic 4‚Äì3 victory over Reading (they were relegated in the subsequent campaign), and also started in the League Cup Final (lost 2‚Äì1 to Liverpool) in the same season. In April 1997, he scored the last goals at Burnden Park, finishing as the club and the division's top scorer with 24 goals from 43 games as Bolton returned to the top level, this time as champions. He scored a hat-trick in a 6‚Äì1 cup win over Tottenham Hotspur. He made seven further league appearances for the club at the outset of the next season before joining second-tier Bradford City in November 1997 for ¬£625,000 in what would be an injury-hit move. He later had the Bolton club crest tattooed on his arm. =Later years= McGinlay had short spells with Oldham Athletic and American team Cincinnati Riverhawks before moving into management with non-league sides Ilkeston Town and Gresley Rovers. In 2013, he was also employed as a chief scout by Wigan Athletic, appointed by former Bolton teammate Owen Coyle during his spell as manager, after spending time working in similar roles in the US with Cincinnati Kings (where he had also finished his playing career after serving as a manager), and with the Scottish Football Association. In 2014, McGinlay took over the 240-year old Horwich pub the Original Bay Horse. He rejoined Bolton Wanderers in an official ambassadorial role in 2020, in an attempt by the club to strengthen their ties with the sports courses held at the University of Bolton, and to bring former players back into contact with the club. =International= During his time with Bolton, McGinlay earned 13 international caps for Scotland, scoring four goals; his last and most important strike was the only goal of a 1‚Äì0 victory over Sweden (which featured a memorable goalkeeping display by Jim Leighton) and helped the national side qualify for 1998 FIFA World Cup, although he did not make the squad for that tournament, nor for the Euro 96 competition. McGinlay lined up for Scotland alongside his childhood friend from Fort William, Duncan Shearer, who also spent much of his career in England ‚Äì the two never played in the same team at club level. He also featured in the infamous '3-second match' in Estonia and its replay in Monaco, and missed the birth of his daughter in order to travel to Belarus for another qualification game the following year.

The population as at the 2011 census was 507. It is at the point where the River Wye flows into the River Derwent and prospered from mills on both. The border of the Peak District National Park runs through the village west of the River Wye and immediately to the north of Chatsworth Road. The Peak District Boundary Walk goes through the village. Overview The original Rowsley railway station Notable features are the bridge over the River Derwent, St Katherine's Church, Rowsley and the Grade-II*-listed Peacock hotel, originally built in 1652 as a manor house by John Stevenson, agent to Lady Manners, whose family crest bearing a peacock gives it its name. Both Longfellow and Landseer are said to have stayed there. Nearby is Chatsworth House, home of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. It was the site of an extensive motive power depot and marshalling yard, the first being built by the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway with a railway station designed by Joseph Paxton in 1849. This was replaced by a new station when the line was extended northwards in 1862. It was frequently used by King Edward VII when he visited Chatsworth House. The original station became a goods depot until 1968, when it was used as a contractor's yard. It then became the centrepiece of a shopping development known as Peak Village. Railway stations =Rowsley South= Rowsley South is the current northern terminus of the preserved heritage railway Peak Rail, and is located about a quarter-mile south of the village itself. Running for a length of four miles between Rowsley and Matlock, it is projected that the heritage railway will run into Rowsley proper in the near future. In the long term, the A6 presents the greatest challenge to the organisation, as a new bridge is required to be built over it in order to reach the viaduct which crosses the River Derwent and thence the trackbed that runs through the Duke of Rutland's estate to Bakewell. =Rowsley North= Notable residents *Phillip Whitehead, MP, MEP, author and Emmy Award-winning television producer, was brought up here.Philip Whitehead's obituary in The Times References Further reading * The Peacock at Rowsley.

According to the , it has a population of people. History In the 18th century till early 19th Century Spanish Colonial era, the Municipality of Atimonan, Tayabas (now Quezon Province) was suffering from frequent attacks by Pirates and outlaws. A man from this place named Mariano Aguilar thought of moving to a safer place to live and dwell with his family. He asked a good friend and distant relative, Juan Salvador to help him find a nearby peaceful place to settle for good. Along with their immediate families, they walked through the forest south-west bound until they found a clean river. While traversing the riverside, they found a scenic body of water which was best described as ladder-like as the waters run over ladder-like steps. They initially named the place Hagdan-hagdan (ladder-like structure). This majestic scenery nowadays is a local tourist attraction that can be found in Barangay Dayap. As they moved further west, they found a huge, serene and attractive flat land area where they later established the town proper. In this land, they built houses for their families and divided the land area between their family members, relatives and friends. The population in this newly discovered area had increased dramatically and before the end of the 19th century, this place was officially called Agdangan (from the word hagdan-hagdan), a barrio of the nearby town Unisan, Tayabas. As time went by, the two families realized that there was a pressing need to build church, school buildings, marketplace, the government building and other facilities basic to the community. The Salvador family donated the site for the school buildings and the public cemetery while Aguilar family donated the sites for the Roman Catholic Church, the marketplace and the municipal building. The population had increased further as a result of influx of people from nearby municipalities and provinces adjacent to Tayabas (Now Quezon province). The Philippine National Railways established a permanent train station which also contributed to the migration of people to this place. The Aguilar and Salvador families, along with other migrant families such as Garin, Banal, Mapaye, Trinidad and Urgino with the help of local civic organization led by Mr. Pedro Olase, again took proactive efforts to gain independence from Unisan. Their actions led to the foundation of the municipality of Agdangan, Province of Tayabas. The culmination of this endeavor happened on April 1, 1939, when President Manuel Quezon signed into a Law the creation of the Municipality of Agdangan, Tayabas. As of today, April 1 has been commemorated in honor of the town's foundation day and is commonly known as Agdangan Day. In that year, the Commonwealth President appointed Roque M. Aguilar, the eldest son of Mariano Aguilar as Mayor until the first election was held the following year where Catalino Aguilar, his youngest brother was elected as Mayor along with Crispin Salvador as Vice Mayor. Through the years, without any lucrative source of income and industries, the modern-day Agdangan has already improved in terms of infrastructure. The local revenue has grown fairly well. The resilience, diligence, peacefulness and simplicity of people of Agdangan have been the key factors of its success.

According to the , it has a population of people. The name Alabat came from the local Tagalog word Alabat, meaning \\"balustrade\\". The town is home to a few speakers of the critically endangered Inagta Alabat language, one of the most endangered languages in the world as listed by UNESCO. Etymology Long before the colonial Spanish, Japanese, or Americans set foot on Alabat Island, the mountains were already inhabited by the ‚ÄúBaluga‚Äù (aborigines). Nomadic by nature, they would clean patches of land, plant rice and vegetables and hunt. After harvest, they would migrate to another part of the forest and repeat the cycle. The elder of the community was their leader and adviser. During drought, they made temporary houses near the shore and used fishing as their primary means of livelihood. Local folklore says that a Spanish priest from the mainland saw the Island from across the Lamon bay. He was curious as to what lay in that island and its inhabitants. The Spanish priest crossed the bay on the boat and founded a church at what is today barangay Gordon. The church today is underwater but the cross can still be seen. The name Alabat which has been used as it is now, came from the word Al√¢b√¢t (local Tagalog word for balustrade or balcony). The early inhabitants of this place made balustrades across their doors to prevent small children from walking out of the house or falling from the stairwells. Local history says that a platoon of American soldiers came to Lupac after the Philippine independence to conduct a survey. They entered a native‚Äôs hut and asked the person what the name of the place was. The owner of the house at that time was holding the balustrade that he was making. Unable to understand the English language, he thought they were asking what he was doing so the native replied al√¢b√¢t! The leader took his diary and wrote the word A L A B A T without any accent. Another local folklore says that the name 'Alabat' was from Muslim origins where Alabat comes from Allah-bat, and if the word is mixed up actually means bat-ala or bathala which is the local word for god. But according to the RA 956, Alabat was founded on Oct. 23, 1903. Meanwhile, the legal basis of creation is May 15, 1900 The separation of Silangan (now Quezon) as an independent municipality was declared in 1914. This municipality was named in honor of President Manuel L Quezon. In 1929, the inhabitants of Sangirin (now Perez) clamored also for separation from Alabat. By the end of the same year, Sangirin was granted freedom and became an independent municipality named in honor of then Felimon Perez, who was the Governor of the Province. Today, Alabat island is composed of 3 towns, Perez in the northern tip, Alabat town proper at the center and Quezon in the south. The town of Alabat saw new development in the early 21st century: a modern port was built to replace the old one, more paved roads are being constructed, telephone service, cellphone sites, wireless internet and local government projects to improve the lives of Alabate√±os.http://www.alabatisland.com/History.html Geography Located centrally on the eponymous Alabat Island, It is between the Pacific Ocean and Lamon Bay, with good fishing grounds, fertile soil, wide plains and near to a river and safe landing shore. =Barangays= Alabat is politically subdivided into 19 barangays, 5 of which are urban and 14 rural. * Angeles * Bacong * Balungay * Buenavista * Caglate * Camagong * Gordon * Pambilan Norte * Pambilan Sur * Barangay 1 (Poblacion) * Barangay 2 (Poblacion) * Barangay 3 (Poblacion) * Barangay 4 (Poblacion) * Barangay 5 (Poblacion) * Villa Esperanza * Villa Jesus Este * Villa Jesus Weste * Villa Norte * Villa Victoria =Climate= Alabat experiences tropical monsoon climate (Am) as the rainfall throughout the year is influenced by the monsoon. There is a significant difference between the driest and the wettest month whereas the driest month is April with rainfall total 81.5 mm, while the wettest month is December with rainfall total 571.4 mm. The rainfall seems increased significantly in October. The mean temperature throughout the year is ranging from the coolest month with average of 26.2 ¬∞C of January to the hottest month with average of 29.4 ¬∞C on May. History The first inhabitants of the town were the indigenous Inagta Alabat people who are Negritos, the earliest settlers in the Philippines. The indigenous people spoke the Inagta Alabat language, one of the most endangered languages in the world. During the Spanish colonial period, Alabat was inhabited by the family of Caparros because of its safe landing shore and overflowing natural resources. Other immigrants from Gumaca came pouring in upon hearing the suitability of this place from human habitation. They named the place \\"CAMAGONG\\". Perhaps this name was taken from trees which bore edible fruits called Camagong or Mabulo which grow abundantly in Camagong Mountain, the highest mountain in Alabat Island. It was said that Rev. Father Jesus, in charge of the parish of Gumaca possessed a telescope. Almost every time he looked through his telescope to see whether Moro Vintas were coming. He reached out a focus on the sandy shore of Ilangin, the present sitio of the barrio of Gordon. It came to his mind that an Ermita should be built in that place. So he summoned the leaders of the settlers to congregate and encouraged them to settle at Ilangin in order to make a vesita and build on Ermita. The growth was so abrupt that a village sprang. Father Jesus called this village \\"GORDO\\" (meaning fat) and afterwards he named it Gordon in memory of his town in Spain. Then came Don Pedro Pica and his brother Don Nicolas, who wanted to establish a home in Gorden. Upon reaching the place they found out that anchorage was difficult on account of the shallow coral reefs and absence of navigable river. Inquiries were made among the villagers and Don Pedro learned the suitability of Lupac, the present site of Alabat. He ordered Francisco Mercado, Modesto Arcaya, Casimero Caparros, Luciano Caparros, Cayetano Caparros, Pedro Caparros, Juan Caparros, Venancio Mascari√±a, Valentin Lisardo, Camilo Febrer, Antonio Monta√±ez, Mariano Silva, Eusebio Baranta, Cayetano Olivares, Jose Canata and many others to clean a site in Lupac for a new village. When Rev. Father Jesus heard about this act of Don Pedro Pica, he was neatly infuriated. He accused these two men and by the order of Capitang Totoy of Gumaca, they were taken to prison until Don Pedro Pica secured freedom from the gobernadorcillos of Tayabas. The Gobernadorcillo also pardoned his brother Don Nicolas Pica the following year. The interest of these two brothers in Lupac did not fade away so they returned to the place and established a lumber industry. The Gobernadorcillo learned of their success in their industry and their able leadership to settlers of the place so Don Pedro, the elder, gained influence from the Gobernadorcillo and was appointed sub-Captain of Lupac under Capitan Totoy of Gumaca. Through the order of Father Jesus, Don Pedro Pica changed the name Lupac to BARCELONA in memory of the beautiful coastal town in Spain. When the American Expeditionary forces occupied Tayabas Province and appointed Carpenter as Military Governor, the name BARCELONA was changed to ALABAT. Demographics =Alabat Island Agta Language= In 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the Alabat Island Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 30 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as Critically Endangered, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 30 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Alabat Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades. The Alabat Agta people live only on the island of Alabat in Quezon province. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.

According to the , it has a population of people. It was formerly known as Piris. It is accessible by land via Lopez and Catanauan or by water transportation via Guinayangan from Lucena City. Geography The municipality of Buenavista is located in the eastern part of Quezon Province at the base of the Bondoc Peninsula. It is bounded on the northern part by Guinayangan, on the south by the town of San Narciso, on the western part by Lopez and Catanauan, and on the east by the Ragay Gulf facing Bicol Region. The municipality is about southeast of Metro Manila and about southeast of provincial capital, the city of Lucena. =Topography= Buenavista is primarily upland municipality characterized by ragged terrain, generally hilly or mountainous with high plains, valleys and swamps. It lies on different slopes from 0-15% and above. There are three (3) types of soil that covers the municipality. These are Faraon Clay, Catanauan Clay loam and Bolinao Clay loam. This is the most extensive upland soil of the province mostly found in Bondoc Peninsula. Faraon Clay loam covers about 13,133.75 hectares which is 85% of the total land area of the municipality, 10%is said to be catanauan Clay loam and 5% of the total land area in Bolinao Clay loam. The greater portion of the soil types is used for grazing. The low- lying hills are planted to coconut and seasonal crops like corn, root crops, and fruit bearing trees. Catanauan Clay loam is found in the valley is used mostly on paddy rice field, while Bolinao Clay loam is devoted to coconut, bananas and other crops and some part has a mineral deposit like in Barangay Bulo and Cadlit. =Barangays= Buenavista is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. * Bagong Silang * Batabat Norte * Batabat Sur * Buenavista * Bukal * Bulo * Cabong * Cadlit * Catulin * Cawa * De La Paz * Del Rosario * Hagonghong * Ibabang Wasay * Ilayang Wasay * Lilukin * Mabini * Mabutag * Magallanes * Maligaya (Esperanza) * Manlana * Masaya * Poblacion * Rizal * Sabang Pinamasagan * Sabang Piris * San Diego * San Isidro Ibaba * San Isidro Ilaya * San Pablo * San Pedro (Villa Rodrigo) * San Vicente * Siain * Villa Aurora * Villa Batabat * Villa Magsaysay * Villa Veronica =Climate= Its climate is classified as type 3 which means the rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. History Piris was its former name. It was a mere hamlet of the municipality of Guinanyagan, province of Quezon and remained as such for quite a number of years until it finally became a municipality. Buenavista is now its official name which means beautiful view. Its original name was Piri as engraved in the oldest church bell which was donated by one Don Jose Casal in the year 1866. It used to be located in the Sitio of Pinagbayanan situated in the western side of the Piris River which is about one a half kilometers away from the present town site. This place became the choice of the founders who were a mixture of Bicolanos and Visayans to enable them to easily escape the Moro raids that were prevalent during the olden times. When the raids finally subsided, the barrio of Piris was transferred to its present location. The word Piri was changed to Piris and later re-changed to Piris. In October 1936, some civic minded residents launched the proposition of making the place a municipality. They signed a petition for the separation of Piris from the municipality of Guinayangan. A group of seven members was formed and was commissioned to undertake a delegation to the Office of the Secretary of the Interior for the purpose. The group was composed of then Don Feliciano Roldan, Mariano San Jose, Honorio Hutamares, Teodorico Dosto, Ciriaco Parraba, Antonio Pasta and Francisco San Jose. The outbreak of the second global war marked the failure of the offices concerned to convert the place into a regular municipality. After the election of Gaudencio V. Vera to the Office of the Congressman for the second district of Quezon Province, Francisco San Jose, a native and public teacher of the place, was instructed by Congressman Vera to help prepare the necessary papers pertaining to the separation of Piris from Guinayangan. When the papers were prepared, House Bill No. 83 was passed by both houses of Congress and became Republic Act No. 495 under Proclamation No. 201 by President Elpidio Quirino, the corporate existence of Piris in the name Buenavista the 37th municipality of Quezon province, was fixed on 26 August 1950. An inauguration was celebrated by the town people under the leadership of Domingo Reyes and Yao Ching Kio, wealthy businessman of the place, with Congressman Vera as the guest of honor. When the municipality of Buenavista was inaugurated on August 26, 1950, it belonged to the seventh class. Six months thereafter, due to some increase in revenue, it rose to sixth class.

It is a classical Cepheid variable star, of which over 800 have been found in our galaxy. As such its regular pulsation and luminosity (proven in its class to correspond) and its relative proximity means the star is a useful calibrator in computing the cosmic distance ladder. Based on parallax measurements, it is approximately 1,200 light-years from the Sun. Zeta Geminorum is the primary or 'A' component of a multiple star system designated WDS J07041+2034. It bears traditional name Mekbuda, usually anglicised to . Nomenclature Œ∂ Geminorum (Latinised to Zeta Geminorum) is the star's Bayer designation. WDS J07041+2034 A is its designation in the Washington Double Star Catalog. The designations of the two components as WDS J03158-0849 Aa and Ab derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Zeta Geminorum bore the traditional name Mekbuda, from an Arabic phrase meaning \\"the lion's folded paw\\" (Zeta and Epsilon Geminorum (Mebsuta) were the paws of a lion). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Mekbuda for the component WDS J07041+2034 Aa on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

Observation history Œ∂ Geminorum in optical light, with the companions B, C, and D visible close by In 1825, German astronomer Julius Schmidt discovered that Zeta Geminorum varies in brightness with a period of about 10 days, although it had been suspected of variability as early as 1790. It was recognised as being related to the Cepheid class of variable stars, although was often treated as the prototype of its own class, the Geminids, because of its symmetrical light curve. In 1899, American astronomer W. W. Campbell announced the star to have a variable radial velocity. (This variation was independently discovered by Russian astronomer Aristarkh Belopolsky, published in 1901.) Based on his observations, Campbell later published orbital elements for the binary. However, he found that the curve departed from a keplerian orbit and even suggested that it was a triple star system to explain the irregularities. The periodic variation in radial velocity of the Cepheid variables was later explained as being due to pulsations in the atmosphere of the star. The periodicity of the star is itself variable, a trend first noted by German astronomer Paul Guthnick in 1920, who suspected that the period change was the result of an orbiting companion. In 1930, Danish astronomer Axel Nielsen suggested that the change was instead the result in a steady decrease of about 3.6 seconds per year in the period. Companions Zeta Geminorum has three visible companions known since the 19th century and listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog as B, C, and D. More recently, a possible spectroscopic companion has been listed, further faint stars close by have been catalogued, and a diffuse cluster has been identified as including Zeta Geminorum. The brightest nearby star, WDS J07041+2034 C, is the magnitude 7.6 HD 268518, 91.9\\" away when discovered in 1779 and 101.3\\" distant in 2008. It is a foreground object, only a tenth the distance of Zeta Geminorum and a high proper motion star moving rapidly compared to the more distant stars. It is a G1 main sequence star very similar to the sun. The closest visible companion is WDS J07041+2034 D, a 12th magnitude star measured to be 67.8\\" away in 2008. It was 80\\" distant when first measured in 1905. It appears on the sky between Zeta Geminorum and component C, but is a more distant object than either. WDS J07041+2034 B is an 11th magnitude star, 76.0\\" distant in 1831 and 87.4\\" in 2008. It is itself a spectroscopic binary, although little is known about the two components. The combined spectrum is of an F4 main sequence star. It is thought to be physically associated with the supergiant primary and a member of a loose cluster of stars around Zeta Geminorum. A combination of photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry has identified 26 stars approximately 355 parsecs away, which are likely to be members of the birth cluster of Zeta Geminorum. The brightest are late B and early A giant stars such as the 7th magnitude stars HD 49381 and HD 50634, while the faintest detected cluster members are 12th magnitude class F main sequence stars including WDS J07041+2034 B. Properties Zeta Geminorum has been reported to be a spectroscopic binary on the basis of lunar occultation observations, but this has not been confirmed by other methods. Zeta Geminorum's primary (WDS J07041+2034 Aa) is a Classical Cepheid variable that undergoes regular, periodic variation in brightness because of radial pulsations. In the V band, the apparent magnitude varies between a high of 3.68 and a low of 4.16 (with a mean of 3.93) over a period of 10.148 days. This period of variation is decreasing at the rate of 3.1 seconds per year, or 0.085 seconds per cycle. The spectral classification varies between F7Ib and G3Ib over the course of a pulsation cycle. Likewise the effective temperature of the outer envelope varies between 5,780 K and 5,260 K, while the radius varies from 61 to 69 times the Sun's radius. On average, it is radiating about 2,900 times the luminosity of the Sun. Membership of a cluster provides independent validation of distances determined using recent Hubble Space Telescope and Hipparcos parallaxes. This strongly constrains the star's distance: parsecs. Zeta Geminorum is thus an important calibrator for the Cepheid period-luminosity relation used for establishing the cosmic distance ladder. The Gaia Data Release 2 parallax of suggests the distance is towards the top end of this range, and has a comparable margin of error.

Each year, Points of Light mobilizes millions of people through affiliates in approximately 250 cities and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies. History Points of Light was formed in 2007 by the merger of the Points of Light Foundation and Hands On Network. Encouraged by major donors and affiliates, the two organizations merged with the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact. The Points of Light Foundation was created in 1990 as a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C. to promote the spirit of volunteerism described by U.S. President George H. W. Bush in his 1989 inaugural address, \\"I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good.\\" President Bush used the \\"thousand points of light\\" theme frequently, including in his 1991 State of the Union address in which he said: In 1991 the National Volunteer Center, which had begun in 1970 as the National Center for Voluntary Action, was merged into it. The merged organization also became known during the 2000s as the Points of Light Foundation and Volunteer Center National Network. The Foundation and its expanded network acted as community hubs to connect volunteers to opportunities, work with local nonprofits and businesses to establish and improve volunteer programs, and, overall, bolster the local infrastructure for the volunteering community. The Points of Light Foundation received an annual allocation from the Corporation for National and Community Service to manage some of that agency's programs, and administered the President's Volunteer Service Award program, which was created by President George W. Bush in 2003. The group also sponsored conferences, offered training and other assistance to its network of volunteer centers, and recognized volunteers through a Daily Point of Light award. The Points of Light Foundation was in fact not a grant-making foundation. It engaged in a variety of tasks, including managing its network of volunteer centers, engaging volunteers in disaster recovery, supporting corporate volunteer councils and more. At the same time as the Points of Light Foundation's founding, a group of young professionals in Atlanta started a group to connect volunteers with nonprofit organizations. Michelle Nunn joined this group of co-founders as the first executive director of Hands On Atlanta in 1989. The nonprofit offered a volunteer model with flexible opportunities for people to be involved in their communities through \\"hands on\\" projects like working in a soup kitchen, food bank or building a house. When the group held its first Hands On Atlanta Day in 1992, around 2,000 people volunteered. In 2003, Nunn moved from Hands On Atlanta to become CEO of the national Atlanta-based HandsOn Network to expand the volunteer model to cities around the world. In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation began talks with the HandsOn Network to join forces through a merger to make one national organization with local affiliates focused on volunteering and service. They combined forces on August 11, 2007, to become the Points of Light Institute.Points of Light HomepageFEMA Citizen Corps Points of Light Institute By late 2011, it changed its name to Points of Light. Points of Light has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million. Points of Light received the highest possible rating (4-stars) on Charity Navigator in 2012, 2011, and 2010. In 2013, Nunn took a leave of absence from CEO to pursue an unsuccessful run for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat in 2014. In 2015, Tracy Hoover was named as CEO of Points of Light, with Nunn taking a place on the board of directors. Criticism On January 10, 1995, the Los Angeles Times published a scathing account of the new foundation, saying \\"the lone remnant of the Bush initiative has the look of a wasteful, Washington-dependent operation.\\" The article noted the foundation had received $26.6 million in federal funds and had spent $22.3 million \\"on glitzy promotions, consultants, salaries, travel and conferences.\\" The article said \\"only 11 percent of the foundation's budget had been spent to provide grants to volunteer efforts. The foundation has fallen well short of private fund- raising goals and attracted scant scrutiny from Congress.\\" In the article, volunteerism expert Susan J. Ellis said, \\"There's been tons of money wasted, just wasted... and I don't think they can show a lot of people have volunteered.\\" Daily Point of Light Award President Bush created the \\"Daily Point of Light Award\\" in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all fifty states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for homeless people. The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light; up until his death, President Bush continued to sign all of the awards. President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. In The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation, President Bush wrote, On July 15, 2013, President Barack Obama welcomed President Bush to the White House to celebrate the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award. They bestowed the award on Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton of Union, Iowa, for their work founding Outreach, a nonprofit that delivers free meals to hungry children in 15 countries. Daily Point of Light honorees include: *Christian Thomas Lee, American concert classical guitarist and collector of fine art for his work in bringing the fine arts to tens of thousands of children in poor inner city and rural schools. *Israel Idonije, for his foundation's work providing support to thousands of kids through after-school programs, sports camps and medical missions in West Africa, Winnipeg and Chicago. *Joseph Hanna, founder of Bunkers in Baghdad, for his work to collect and ship new and used golf equipment to soldiers around the world and to wounded warriors in the U.S. *The Volunteer Partners of Sacred Heart Hospital for their support of their hospital colleagues to provide excellent patient care. *Project Linus for their mission to embrace fragile children with hope and healing through the gift of a handmade blanket. *Bryant Ranch Elementary School's \\"Once Upon A River\\" Project to restore the native habitat of the Santa Ana River. *Derrius Quarles who founded Million Dollar Scholar to help high school students find scholarships Programs The organization manages a number of notable programs including the HandsOn Network, which leads approximately 250 volunteer action centers; generationOn, which helps schools, children and families volunteer in their communities; Community Blueprint, which works with nonprofits to meet the needs of veterans and military families; Billion + Change, which organizes companies to pledge billions of dollars in skills- based volunteer services to nonprofits; and the Civic Accelerator, which invests in civic enterprise start-ups. The Extra Mile - Points of Light Volunteer Pathway honors famous volunteers with a series of bronze medallions that form a one-mile walking path, just blocks from the White House in Washington, D.C. There are 33 people recognized, including Booker T. Washington, Jane Addams, John Muir, Clara Barton and Martin Luther King Jr. National Volunteer Week is an annual event designed to thank volunteers for their service and encourage others across the United States to volunteer. The HandsOn Network works in partnership with local organizations and schools to create \\"hands on\\" service projects that produce tangible benefits in communities. The network enlists a corps of hundreds of thousands of volunteers who join forces to address community needs worldwide. The HandsOn Network enables them to choose from a variety of projects that connect community needs with their time and interests. They cultivate and train volunteers to in turn lead other volunteers.HandsOn Network What We Do In 2018, Points of Light worked with Starbucks on a new program. 36 Starbucks employees were selected as Starbucks Service Fellows. For six months, the Fellows worked at least 20 hours per week at Starbucks, and up to 20 hours for a local organization. The program supported employees who wanted to give back to the local community. Points of Light paid the Fellows using a grant from the Starbucks Foundation, which also provided money for the local nonprofits' programs. Events =All Together Now: A Celebration of Service= Points of Light paid tribute to President George H.W. Bush and volunteer service on March 21, 2011 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush joined President George H.W. Bush to highlight the role volunteer service plays in people's lives. It marked the first time all four former presidents had come together since President Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009. President Obama was on a trip to South America and taped a video message for the event. The Tribute to the elder Bush ‚Äî called \\"All Together Now: A Celebration of Service\\" ‚Äî featured singers Carrie Underwood, Darius Rucker, and Garth Brooks, and broadcaster Jim Nantz. =Presidential Forum on Service= On October 16, 2009, President Obama held a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H.W. Bush and Points of Light at the George Bush Presidential Library Center on the campus of Texas A&M; University. The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement. At the Presidential Forum, President Obama said, =Conference on Volunteering and Service= Since 1992, leaders from the nonprofit, for-profit, government, Hollywood and military sectors have gathered for Points of Light's annual Conference on Volunteering and Service. In 2012, approximately 5,000 people attended a plenary session featuring former First Lady Barbara Bush, Second Lady Jill Biden, Points of Light CEO Michelle Nunn and actor Kevin Bacon. =Make a Difference Day= Make A Difference Day is the nation's largest day of service, created by USA Weekend magazine and held in partnership with Points of Light on the fourth Saturday of each October. An estimated 3 million volunteers spent the 22nd Make A Difference Day in 2012 helping their communities in projects ranging from bowl-a-thon fundraisers to beach cleanups. =Martin Luther King Jr. Day= Each year, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Points of Light honors King's memory with service projects across the United States, calling it their MLK Day of service. In 2013, Vice President Joe Biden and his family joined 10,000 volunteers at Points of Light's service project at the D.C. Armory to put together 100,000 thank-you \\"care kits\\" for U.S. military personnel, disabled veterans, and civilian first responders. =International Year of Volunteers= In the USA, the Points of Light Foundation and the Association of Junior Leagues International (AJLI) partnered to convene and lead the International Year of Volunteers 2001 USA Steering Committee. Members of the committee included the National Council of Volunteer Centers, National Council on Workplace Volunteering, Association for Volunteer Administration, National Parents and Teachers Association and Make A Difference Day.

She was named for Levi Woodbury. History Woodbury was laid down on 3 October 1918 at San Francisco, California, by the Union Iron Works plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 6 February 1919; sponsored by Miss Catherine Muhlenberg Chapin, the daughter of newspaper publisher W. W. Chapin; reclassified DD-309 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 20 October 1920, Lieutenant Commander Frank L. Lowe in command. Woodbury departed San Francisco on 22 November and reached San Diego, her assigned home port, the following day. Woodbury moored at the Reserve Docks, where she remained into 1921. The destroyer, like many of her numerous sisters begun during World War I, had entered service at a time when the post-war cutbacks in funds and personnel had seriously curtailed American peacetime naval operations. Accordingly, she was placed in a \\"rotating reserve\\" established by the Navy to maintain a \\"force in readiness.\\" In operation, the system required that one-third of a given force remain pierside, maintained by only the minimum number of officers and men, while another third was to be half-manned as it remained berthed at a buoy in the harbor. The last third was fully manned and remained at buoys in the harbor but for periodic operations underway at sea. Woodbury departed her mooring at the Reserve Docks on 1 February 1921 and, over the next few days, conducted torpedo practices and made a speed run off the southern California coast. During that brief underway period, the destroyer conducted her operations during the day and returned to her mooring buoy in the evenings. She remained largely port-bound from March to May, but moved to San Pedro, California, on 14 June. There, her crew assisted in preservation and maintenance work on while she lay in drydock at the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, San Pedro. Woodbury then underwent a drydocking herself for the application of anti-corrosive and antifouling paint to her bottom. Woodbury later returned to San Diego and, but for a run, via Los Angeles harbor, to Seattle, Washington, stayed there for the remainder of 1921. Underway on the morning of 14 January 1922, Woodbury led , , and to sea. She arrived off Goat Island, near San Francisco, at 0820 the following day and lay to, embarking passengers for transportation to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, before she resumed her cruise up the Pacific coast. The destroyer reached Puget Sound on the afternoon of the 18th, discharged her passengers, and soon commenced her scheduled overhaul. Woodbury remained at Puget Sound through March 1922. She got underway for San Diego on 3 April but put into Port Angeles, Washington, when Nicholas developed a machinery casualty. Upon completion of Nicholas' repairs, Woodbury resumed her passage southward and reached San Diego on 8 April. The destroyer lay at berth 35, San Diego harbor, into the summer, again as part of the inactive arm of the \\"rotating reserve.\\" From early July to late September, Woodbury provided essential maintenance and upkeep services to her sister ships in the decommissioned Destroyer Division 17 moored alongside. There were only two breaks in the ship's routine during that time: a tender upkeep period alongside and her participation in the funeral of the late Rear Admiral Uriel Sebree, USN (Ret.), on 8 August, for which she sent a party ashore to form part of the naval escort for the casket. Woodbury got underway on 26 September 1922 and conducted gunnery exercises in company with Young and Nicholas. After another period of upkeep alongside Melville, the destroyer participated in an intensive slate of gunnery and torpedo drills. Then, late in October, she also performed torpedo recovery chores for the battleships and . After spending the remainder of 1922 in San Diego waters, Woodbury stood out of San Diego harbor on 6 February 1923, in company with Destroyer Squadrons 11 and 12 and the tender Melville, all ships bound for Mexico, and, ultimately, for Panama. Arriving at Magdalena Bay on the 8th, Woodbury refueled from before she pushed on for Panamanian waters on the 11th. That afternoon, she rendezvoused with the dreadnoughts of Battleship Divisions 3, 4, and 5 and conducted exercises with them en route to Panama. Over the ensuing weeks, Woodbury took part in the first of the Navy's large scale fleet maneuvers, Fleet Problem I. Held in the vicinity of the strategic Panama Canal Zone, Fleet Problem I was designed to ascertain the defensive condition of that waterway, to allow for the formulation of the \\"estimate of the situation,\\" and to facilitate the study of war plans. Woodbury took part in the exercises as part of the \\"attacking\\" forces built around the Battle Fleet. The opposing forces consisted of the Scouting Fleet, augmented by a division of battleships. During one phase of the operation, while the ships lay anchored at Panama Bay, ‚Äî bearing the Secretary of the Navy, Edwin C. Denby, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert E. Coontz - stood through the fleet. Later, Woodbury resumed her operations with the Battle Fleet ‚Äî conducting gunnery drills, antisubmarine screening, protective screening for the battleships ‚Äî and serving as a target for Battleship Division 4 during its long-range battle practices. Returning to San Diego on 11 April, Woodbury remained there into the summer. Departing her home port on 25 June, however, she sailed for the Pacific Northwest and reached Tacoma, Washington, via San Francisco, on 2 July. There, her landing force participated in the Independence Day parade at Tacoma. Woodbury departed Tacoma on 9 July and reached Port Angeles the same day. For nearly two weeks, the destroyer operated out of that port, conducting exercises, tactical maneuvers, and short range battle practices. After that stint of operations, she shifted to Bellingham, Wash., and, later, to Seattle. Underway at 0405 on 27 July, Woodbury departed the fleet's anchorage off Admiralty Head, near Seattle, in company with Destroyer Divisions 32 and 33 to escort Henderson in which the President of the United States, Warren G. Harding, was embarked. Woodbury consequently formed part of the presidential escort as the transport sailed through the fleet. Once her duties in connection with the Presidential review were completed, Woodbury returned to the routine of exercises, acting as a target for the gunnery drills carried out by Battleship Division 4. She later conducted tactical exercises while screening the battleships of that division, before she put in at Lake Washington, via the Lake Washington Ship Canal, on 4 August. She remained there for a little over a week before she got underway on the 13th for Port Townsend. After torpedo-firing and gunnery evolutions out of Port Townsend in company with William Jones, Woodbury got underway for Keyport, Washington, en route back to Seattle and Puget Sound. Reaching the navy yard on the 20th, she embarked the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CinCUS), Admiral Robert E. Coontz, his staff, and a party of congressmen at 0840 on the 22nd. With the CinCUS' four-starred flag at her main, Woodbury cast off from Pier 5, Puget Sound Navy Yard, and sailed for Keyport. There, Admiral Coontz disembarked with his staff and the congressmen and inspected the naval torpedo station. The admiral and his party then reembarked in the destroyer, and she returned them to the navy yard, where they left the ship at 1110. At noon, however, the CinCUS returned on board. Woodbury subsequently arrived at Seattle's Bell Street Dock at 1310 and disembarked the admiral. The next day, the destroyer carried Admiral Coontz to his flagship, the armored cruiser . Over the ensuing days, Woodbury also carried, as passengers, Rear Admiral William C. Cole, chief of staff for the CinCUS, and Rear Admiral Luther E. Gregory, CEC, the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. After completing her tour in the waters off the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States, Woodbury departed Port Angeles and headed south. She conducted tactical maneuvers and exercises with battleships en route and stood into San Francisco Bay on 31 August. Woodbury remained at San Francisco for a week. She got underway on the morning of 8 September 1923 with other destroyers of Squadron 11, bound for San Diego, and while skirting the coast over the ensuing hours, conducted tactical exercises and maneuvers. In addition, the ships were making a speed run. Led by the leader, , the squadron steamed into the worsening weather. Later that evening, Delphy - basing her movements on an inaccurate navigational bearing - made a fateful turn, believing she was heading into the Santa Barbara Channel. In fact, she was headed, as were all of the ships astern of her in follow-the- leader fashion, for jagged rock pinnacles and reefs off Point Arguello. Shortly after 2105, tragedy struck Squadron 11's ships, one by one in the Honda Point Disaster. Seven ships, led by Delphy and including Woodbury, ran hard aground. Some of the destroyers farther astern saw what was happening and managed to avoid disaster by quick-thinking seamanship. U.S.S. Woodbury on beach. Woodbury came to rest alongside a small island‚Äî later nicknamed \\"Woodbury Rock\\"‚Äîthat she used as a permanent anchor. Volunteers took across four lines and rigged them across the gap of tumbling surf between the destroyer and the rock that would later bear her name. Meanwhile, although water was pouring into the forward boiler room and engine room spaces, Commander Louis P. Davis, the ship's commanding officer, ordered full speed astern. Ensign Horatio Ridout, the engineer officer, and his men worked to try to produce the horsepower necessary to get the ship out of her predicament but their efforts were brought to nought when all power failed, due to the flooding, at 2230. As the floodwaters below engulfed and drowned out her power supply and it became impossible to move the ship, Cmdr. Davis turned to his reserve plan. While Woodbury settled astern, waves struck her with some force, causing her bow to rise and fall rhythmically. The hawsers tenuously connecting the ship with \\"Woodbury Rock\\" stretched taut and then sagged with the movement of ship and sea. Nevertheless, one by one, Woodbury's crew clambered across the chasm, monkey-fashion, in a well-organized operation to abandon ship. Later, men from the stranded sister ship also reached \\"Woodbury Rock.\\" Ultimately, all of Woodbury's crew reached safety, some taken off to by the fishing boat Bueno Amor de Roma, under the command of a Captain Noceti. The rough log entry for Woodbury, dated 9 September 1923, sums up the ship's status as of that date: \\"Woodbury on rocks off Point Arguello, California, abandoned by all hands and under supervision of a salvage party composed of men from various 11th squadron ships.\\" Fate Officially placed out of commission on 26 October 1923, the ship was struck from the Navy list on 20 November of the same year. She was simultaneously ordered sold as a hulk, but a subsequent sale, on 6 February 1924 to a Santa Monica, California-based salvage firm, the Fryn Salvage Company, was never consummated. Yet another sale, to a Robert J. Smith of Oakland, California, is recorded as having been awarded on 19 October 1925, but whether or not the hulk was scrapped is not recorded. However she, and her wrecked sister ships, were still not moved by late August 1929 for she, and most of the others, may be clearly seen in film footage taken from the German airship Graf Zeppelin as she headed towards Los Angeles on her circumnavigation of the globe; the film footage is used in the documentary film Farewell (2009).

Maasin City is the commercial and religious center of Southern Leyte and the south-western part of Leyte Island. On August 10, 2000, Maasin was converted into a city. NSCB - 2001 Factsheet - 12 New Cities Created , July‚ÄìDecember 2000. The Diocese of Maasin was founded on August 14, 1968.  History  In 1521, a Portuguese-born Spanish explorer and navigator, Ferdinand Magellan and his crew came ashore and celebrated the first Roman Catholic Mass on the island. Magellan made peace with two Filipino rulers, Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siani who subsequently were converted to Christianity. A marker notes the spot on Limasawa where their blood compact of friendship and alliance was sealed. Southern Leyte, for centuries, was actually an integral part of the island of Leyte. During the Spanish period, the region was sparsely populated. Continued Moro slave raiding discouraged the establishment and stabilization of other large towns. In the 19th century, immigration from the provinces of Cebu and Bohol increased the population of the region and opened the land towards farming. One of the oldest towns in Southern Leyte is Maasin, nowadays called Maasin City. Little is known about its pre-Spanish existence. When the Spanish missionaries became active in their missions, they discovered that the Maasin community was already organized, with its people friendly and interested in embracing the Catholic faith. The community was formally established as a parish by the missionaries of the Society of Jesus in the 1700s and was called \\"nipa\\". This was authenticated by a piece of stone from a long destroyed convent that bears the inscription: \\"Pa. De Tagnipa - a√±o 1776.\\" The renaming of the town of Maasin is related to the incident when some Spaniards, who needed drinking water, scanned the shorelines and found Canturing River. They asked the natives in Castillan Spanish while gesturing towards the river, \\"Que pueblo es este?\\" Without hesitation, the natives answered \\"Maasin\\" (meaning salty), thinking that the Spaniards were asking them how the water tasted. From that time on, the place has been called Maasin. The town grew rapidly in the 1700s after the Jesuit priests built the first church of which ruins still exists today between the two districts of Abgao and Mantahan. The Jesuit administration prevailed from 1700 through 1768. Subsequently, Augustinian fathers took over the parish from 1768 to 1843 during which the townspeople, with the guidance of the Spanish ecclesiastical authorities, built the town's second concrete church located approximately one kilometer away from the ruins of the first one. The church stands to this day; although it underwent several repairs and renovations on account of damage wrought by the forces of nature and man-made events. In 1843, Franciscan missionaries took over the parish and managed it until 1896 when they were forced to abandon it due to the revolution. A native clergy took over there after. During the Spanish regime, Maasin evolved and became an organized municipality. It became a busy seaport which maintained trading with nearby islands of Cebu, Bohol, and Mindanao. A historical proof of this account is a document that depicts a record of \\"gobernacillos\\" in this municipality in 1880 through 1894. By virtue of the Maura Code passed by the Spanish Cortez, the first chosen local executive was changed from Gobernadorcillo to \\"Capitan Municipal\\". The last gobernadorcillo was Alejo Alcantara who served from 1892 to 1894, followed by Capitanes Municipal Julio Raagas (1894-1896) and Flaviano Aguilar (1897-1898). The short-lived Philippine revolution against Spain brought about a change in the local government. During the early part of 1898, General Lukban came to Maasin to install the municipal government under the short-lived Philippine Republic. Even before the fall of the Spaniards to the Americans on August 13, 1898, there had already been established in Maasin a Court of First Instance; the office of \\"Promoter Fiscal\\" (equivalent to the Provincial Fiscal); and, the office of \\"Administrador de Hacienda\\" (equivalent to Provincial Treasurer). With the change of sovereign power, the positions were abolished but the Fiscal's which continued to serve cases from distant towns. However, due to the problems emanating from transportation availability for the Tacloban- Maasin span, and the intricate management of governmental affairs in Tacloban, several prominent leaders of the west coast of Leyte began proposing bills that entail the division of the island of Leyte into two distinct provinces. In 1919, Representative Ciriaco K. Kangleon presented the first bill but lost in the Senate by one vote. In 1922, Tomas Oppus renewed the move with presentation of House Bill No. 254 which became Act No. 3117. Unfortunately, the Act did not take effect because it was not proclaimed by the Governor- General. The arrival of the Americans at the beginning of the 20th century and the suppression of all resistance to the American rule stopped all dreams of Philippine independence. However, the epoch-making announcement of President McKinley that the Philippines was not theirs to exploit but to train in the art of self-government and independence brought about new hope for the Filipinos. True to their word, the Americans instituted in this country their democratic institutions. Maasin was one of the beneficiaries of this enlightened American policy. Schools were established; businesses began to rise and prosper; and, Maasin became the most progressive town in south- western Leyte (and still is). Maasin was enjoying the blessings of democracy up until the eruption of World War II. On June 3, 1942, the Japanese occupied Maasin and immediately instituted Martial Law. Many townspeople realized that their immediate task was to live and escape the abuses, atrocities, and murderous acts of the Japanese soldiers. They took refuge at the mountains and hills where they lived on the natural provisions of Mother Nature. Many brave ones, including Colonel Ruperto Kangleon, Alfonso Cobile and others, fought the Japanese invaders making the record of the Maasin guerillas one glorious chapter in Maasin history. Maasin resumed its path to prosperity when the Americans returned in late 1944. It became, once again, a bustling seacoast town trading with the nearby islands of Cebu, Bohol, and Mindanao. Through the initiatives of its leaders, Maasin progressively continued to move forward in its role as the center of commerce and industry in Southern Leyte. In 1953, Francisco M. Pajao won the re-presentation of the issue that entails the division of the island of Leyte but could not do anything else to complete the move. Hence, Senator Ruperto K. Kangleon, younger brother of Ciriaco K. Kangleon, presented and passed the move under Senate Bill No. 2140. The House of Representatives carpeted the Bill. Then in 1957, Congressman Nicanor Espina Yniguez, Jr. filed the House Bill that changed the move's original designation as Western Leyte of Occidental Leyte to \\"Southern Leyte\\". At 10:00 AM on Friday, May 22, 1959, President Carlos P. Garcia signed the Bill into law as Republic Act No. 2227. Witnesses to the signing, among others, were Congressman Yniguez, Mayor Alfredo K. Bantug of Maasin, Attorney Manuel Enage, Sr., Erlinda Capili, and Attorney Floro Kangleon. On July 1, 1960, Southern Leyte was officially inaugurated as a province with municipalities including Maasin (being the capital town and seat of the provincial government), Malitbog, Bontoc, Sogod, Libagon, Pintuyan, San Francisco, St. Bernard, Cabalian (now San Juan), Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan, and Silago. Three more municipalities were subsequently created, namely, San Ricardo (from Pintuyan), Tomas Oppus (from Malitbog), and Limasawa (from Padre Burgos). Maasin continued to progressively prosper for decades. On April 8, 1998, Congressman Aniceto G. Saludo, Jr. filed a move under House Bill No. 7201 to convert the municipality of Maasin into a component city of the province of Southern Leyte, thus becoming Maasin City.  Barangays  Maasin City is politically subdivided into 70 barangays. Demographics =Language= Maasinhons and Southern Leyte√±os speak Cebuano. Their cultural and linguistic affinities tend to differentiate them from those who reside in Cebu, Bohol, and the western coast of the province of Leyte. Most of the people are farmers and fishermen who are noted for their hard work and frugality. =Religion= Although approximately 50% of the people are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church and the others called themselves the believer of true GOD, traditional folk beliefs and superstition still influence some of them. Some farmers are also known to hold on to pre-and conservative beliefs in making offerings and sacrifices before planting season starts. At times, chickens or pigs are ritually offered in hopes of enticing spirits for a fruitful harvest. =Topography= The terrain of Southern Leyte is characterized by relatively flat lands along the coastal plains where population areas lay, and becomes rugged and mountainous towards the interior. It has numerous small rivers in addition to, at least, eleven major rivers which include Canturing River in Maasin City, Amparo River in Macrohon, Divisoria River in Bontoc, Subang Daku in Sogod, Lawigan and Hitongao Rivers in St. Bernard, Camugao River in Hinundayan, Magcasa River in San Juan, Das-ay and Pondol Rivers in Hinunangan, and Maag River in Silago. =Climate= Even though March‚ÄìMay is considered hot and dry with temperatures ranging from 22-32 ¬∞C, in general terms, the province actually has no dry season. This is due to rainfall more or less, distributed throughout the year. June to October is mostly rainy; whereas, November to February is cool with temperatures ranging from 22-28 ¬∞C. Year round, average humidity is about 76%. =Roads= The existing road networks criss-crossing Southern Leyte consists of major arterial highways that link to the province of Leyte, passing through two major outlets - on the western part, the Maasin-Mahaplag-Baybay route; and, on the central part, the Mahaplag-Sogod route via the Maharlika Highway. =Airport= The province has one existing airstrip located in Panan-awan, Maasin City. This airstrip, which has a runway length of 1200 meters and a width of 30 meters, is simply considered a feeder landing pad. There are regular scheduled flights between Cebu and Maasin and Tagbilaran to Maasin via Air Juan (AO). The runway is suspected to be incapable of supporting aircraft weighing over 12,000 pounds. Controversies of the construction of the airport was found by COA, that lead Damian Mercado dismissed to his position. =Seaports= Weesam Express fast ferry from Maasin National Port to Cebu takes three hours, 9:00AM daily . Cokaliong Shipping 'Roll-on' ships make four trips weekly each way, with a sailing time between five and seven hours. Cokaliong ships also carry cargo and vehicles. Cargo ships regularly make use of Maasin National Port mainly bringing in cement and taking out copra. =Bus Terminals= There are five designated bus terminals in Southern Leyte: Maasin, Liloan, Sogod, Hinunangan, and Silago. These terminals are just open spaces used by buses as parking/passenger waiting areas, and not equipped with buildings and other facilities. There are at least four bus companies taking the Manila-Maasin route: Philtranco, DLTB, Ultrabus, and CUL. Bachelor takes the Ormoc-Maasin- Davao route. From the Maasin City, by land, it takes approximately five hours to travel to Tacloban City; twenty three hours to Pasay City or Quezon City; and, nineteen hours to Davao City via Liloan ferry boat. =Power / Energy= The principal source of power / electricity in Southern Leyte is the Tonongan Geothermal Power Plant in Ormoc via National Power Corporation through the Southern Leyte Electric Cooperative (SOLECO). The major power transmission lines in the province emanate from 69 kV Tolosa, Leyte which is connected to 69 kV Bontoc, Southern Leyte then to Maasin City, and 69 kV Baybay, Leyte to Maasin City in case of power failure. A mini-hydro electric power plant in Hinabian, Catmon, St. Bernard was developed with a capacity of 810 KW to serve the Pacific towns particularly St. Bernard and San Juan. A major breakthrough in power generation is the Southern Leyte Geothermal Project in San Juan with a capacity of 50-100 megawatts commissioning in year 2003. It is anticipated to sustain an estimated economic life of 25 years. Activities involving Pre- operation Phase was already initiated. =Communication= Postal communication system is the major means of communication in all municipalities of the province. There are five telephone exchange companies operating in the province to provide domestic and international calls namely PLDT, PT&T;, RCPI/Bayan Tel, Evtelco, and the Bureau of Telecommunications (Butel); two AM radio stations - DYSL in Sogod, and DYDM in Maasin City. Other modes of communication include SSB radios for government offices, and cellular phones for government and private entities. TV5, GMA Network and ABS-CBN operate upcoming TV station in the city. =Health Facilities= In 1996, the health and medical needs of the province were provided by eight government hospitals, six private hospitals and clinics, twenty rural health units or municipal centers, ninety three health stations, and ten outpatient private clinics. The total bed capacity of government hospitals is 265 while that of the private is 110. A current tally of health facilities in the province is still being determined. Maasin City also knowned to be the no-smoking capital city in Eastern Visayas. Diocese of Maasin On August 14, 1968, the Diocese of Maasin was canonically erected through a papal decree issued March 23, 1968. In June of the same year, the Most Reverend Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. who was up to then a parish priest of Masbate, Masbate, was appointed as its first bishop. He was consecrated on August 8, 1968, and installed as the First Bishop of Maasin on August 14 at Our Lady of Assumption Parish Church in Maasin, the capital of Southern Leyte. From 1595 to 1910, the area which now comprises the Diocese of Maasin belonged to the diocese of Cebu. From 1910 to 1937 it belonged to the Diocese of Calbayog. From 1937 to 1968 it came under the jurisdiction of the Diocesan of Palo in Leyte. Today it is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cebu. The diocese comprises the entire province of Southern Leyte, and the towns of Matalom, Bato, Hilongos, Hindang, Inopacan and Baybay in the province of Leyte, with the Maasin Parish Cathedral as the seat of the diocese. Distributed within its 2,505 square kilometers of land are 38 parishes and 1 quasi-parish. To facilitate administration these parishes have been grouped under 6 vicariates. In recent years, awareness of their potent role in the local church has been perceived among the lay faithful ‚Äì a result of diocesan programs designed to awaken the \\"sleeping giant\\" in the church. There has been a marked increase in the number of lay ministers to assist priests in every parish, as there has been in the number of volunteer catechists. The Diocese of Maasin today has started to focus on the vision of the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines. Apart from the usual ministerial and sacramental functions, the clergy has succeeded to penetrate the people's conscience with concern for other issues, such as reforestation, among others. The Social Action Center has generously offered help in livelihood projects to those who do not have the necessary capital. This has been successful in the abaca business enterprise. The Center is now in the process of opening up more opportunities for more livelihood projects. The Commission on Youth is helping in the formation of the youth in all the parishes of the diocese through youth encounters and leadership training. It has organized three diocesan summer youth camps between 1993 and 1995, attended by more than a thousand delegates. In 1993 the Diocese of Maasin marked its 25th anniversary as a diocese. Places of interest The Maasin City Cathedral. Mother Mary Shrine Maasin Cathedral built in the 17th century is probably not only the biggest, but also the oldest church in Maasin City. It is a diocesan seat since 1968. The church is adorned or embellished with an ornate altar and images of saints, and became a testament to the religious devotion of the people of Southern Leyte. Don Anatalio Gaviola Plaza, which is dedicated to a then Mayor of Maasin. It still is one of the highly recommended stumping points for tourists as well as for locals. The Guinsohotan Cave is a large cave, 15 km from the city center and 276 meters above sea level. Those who do enter the cave by wading or swimming can find small ‚Äúin-cave‚Äù waterfalls, bats and impressive rock formations. Cagnituan Lagoon, the water coming out of Guinsohotan Cave flows down in cascades to form a natural lagoon frequently visited by bathers and patrons of cool therapeutic treatment. The two sights (Guinsohotan Cave and Cagnituan Lagoon), which belong more or less together, are placed in Barangay Canitoan and can be reached from Barangay Maria Clara by using a Habal-habal. The last part of the way is a walking part: you pass by small groups of houses, fields and palms. In the background there are the mountains covered by large vegetation. Camp Danao Forest Park is located 335 m. above sea level and 15 km away from the city proper and the sprawling forested area has a man-made lake. It hosted the 2010 BSP (Boy Scout of the Philippines) National Activity. It is also known as the Maasin City Forest Park and played host to the 2010 Boy Scouts of the Philippines National Activity. It is a good destination for those traveling with children because different animals can be seen in the zoo, such as tigers, crocodiles, lions, camels, snakes, monkeys, and several types of birds. Maasin Zoo and Adventure Park (soft-opening in early 2012). One of the specialties of this zoo will be that the animals will not be kept in cages but be separated from the spectator by ‚Äúnatural‚Äù barricades. Bogo Bird Paradise (private owned), just about 4 km from the city proper is a mountain retreat nestled among flora, fauna and especially rare species of bird. Busay Falls, where you can find lush vegetation just as well as wildlife cavorting with cascading mountain waterfalls and chirping birds. It can be found in Barangay Combado. Sadly, this former completely wild and dreamlike part of nature is victim of fast economic expansion, so water quality is not as good as years ago and the former wild lagoon was removed by a pool. Abiera Museo d‚ÄôArt, another sight in Maasin City, showing a rare collection of artifacts, antiques, paintings, preserved animals, coins, gems, and historical relics. Although it is privately owned by the Abiera Family, it can be visited by interested ones. It is located in Barangay Tunga-tunga in the heart of the city.Maasin City - Simply Marvelous! broshure; Editor: City Investment Promotion & Tourism Office The Lady of Assumption at the Jalleca Hills is the tallest privately owned shrine in the Philippines. The statue itself and the nearby chapel can be reached by using a stairway with more than 300 steps and is located at 104 m above sea level in Barangay Mantahan.

The town celebrates their fiesta in honor of the Holy Child Jesus. The Ulang Festival, held annually on January 15, is celebrated by colorful participants dancing in honor of the icon of the Se√±or Santo Ni√±o (Holy Child Jesus). Some devotees to the Se√±or Santo Ni√±o said that it can performed miracles that can heal sickness of those who touches the said icon. Geography The town is situated on a long stretch of rich alluvial plain, which considered as the greatest farming region in the entire Sogod Bay District, and is drained by the Salog and Divisoria Rivers. Because of its rich soil, there is much rice farming. The town is also the producer of abaca, copra and tobacco in the Bay District. =Barangays= Bontoc is politically subdivided into 40 barangays. =Climate= History The name ‚ÄúBontoc‚Äù is derived from an old creek called Bontoc creek near the present Roman Catholic Cemetery where old ‚Äúpueblo‚Äù called Daan Lungsod existed during the early Spanish regime. Before the coming of the Spaniards, Bontoc was a wilderness where few natives lived and wild animals roamed. When the Spaniards came, they found scattered warring tribes of primitive Malays who settled in prosperous villages near the mouth and along the fertile plains of the historic Salog river basin. They then successfully subjugated these warring tribes and immigrants and founded a cluster of villages which later on formed the nucleus of the Barrio of Bontoc. As far as history could recall the most popular among the ancient warring chiefs, was Mariano Barcelon who was nicknamed as ‚ÄúTahug‚Äù. He was acclaimed to be the bravest of the braves. His name was a terror to the Moro pirates that swarmed Philippine waters during the 16th century. During the Spanish time up to the early part of the American regime, Bontoc was ruled by a succession of native ‚ÄúCabezas de barangay‚Äù, a unit government organization during that time. Bontoc was at that time a tributary ‚Äúpueblo‚Äù belonging to the old town of Libagon which governed the people for many years both in civil and religious matter by a line of ‚Äúcapitanes or gobernadocillos. The cabezas de barangay who governed this little pueblo also earned for themselves the honor of being called ‚Äúcapitan‚Äù by their own people. The church wielded tremendous power at that time in the affairs of the government. Any person who offends the clergy or disobeys religious order is severely punished. Among the well-known capitanes who controlled the reins of the local administration of this barrio were: Hilario Barcelon, Manuel Leyes, Romualdo Tubia, Florentino Flores, Felipe Aguilar and the last well-known cabeza or capitan was Gerardo Faelnar popularly known among the people as Capitan Dadoy whose administration lasted up to the early days of American occupation. Shortly after the coming of the Americans, Bontoc became a unit barrio of Sogod. During the Japanese occupation, the town served as the seat of resistance movement against the Japanese with its general headquarters in sitio Mamingaw, Barangay Banahaw and under the command of Colonel Ruperto K. Kangleon. In one notable raid, an entire truckload of Japanese soldiers on patrol was completely annihilated at Sitio Trece, Barangay Santo Ni√±o. A small monument stands in front of Bontoc motor pool at Sitio Trece commemorates this event. On June 15, 1950, it became a regular municipality by the operative provisions of Republic Act No. 522.

According to the Hinundayan has a total land area of 6,108 hectares or 61.08 square kilometers, comprising 17 barangays. , it has a population of people. Barangays Hinundayan is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. Demographics Among the seventeen (17) barangays of the municipality, four (4) barangays are considered urban and the remaining thirteen (13) barangays are rural. Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO), 2007 Census of Population, the municipality's population is dispersed in the rural barangays with a total population count of 7,692 or 66% of the total population while the remaining 34% or the 3,918 population count is concentrated in the urban barangays. Climate  History  During the 17th century, there were Spanish sailors who by chance arrived at our shores in Barangay Sabang. At that time, the fisherfolks and villagers were very busy setting up \\"handayanans\\" or resting place for their outrigger canoes. These handayanans were made up of posts with horizontal rails which were a meter high from the ground where the canoes and other sea crafts were laid after use. When the Spanish sailors asked the villagers what was the name of the place, the villagers who were oblivious of the strange language thought that they were asked of what they were doing, so they simply answered in their own dialect, \\"handayanan among gibuhat para sa among baruto.\\" The Spaniards noted the first word \\"Handayanan\\" as the name of the place, so they refer the place as such, which was later on distorted to \\"Hinundayan\\". Since then, this place was called Hinundayan. = Creation of the Municipality = Before Hinunangan became a town, this and Hinundayan were part of the town of Abuyog. But when it was created a town on the 18th century, Hinundayan was part of its jurisdiction. On March 21, 1876 the Governor of Leyte Jose Fernandez issued an Executive Order proclaiming Hinundayan a separate town, the first ‚ÄúKapitan Municipal‚Äù was Don Sotero Tobio. But its townhood lasted only until the Revolutionary Period. When the American came, it became a barrio of Hinunangan again. The ‚ÄúKapitan Municipal‚Äù at that time was Don Luis Lagumbay. Due to the petition of some concerned Hinundayanons, Executive Order No. 59 was issued on July 31, 1909 signed by Governor General William Cameron Forbes and Act No. 986 proclaiming Hinundayan a separate town from Hinunangan.

Libagon celebrates its town fiesta every 8th day of December, the feast of Immaculate Concepcion. Another fiesta that is celebrated by the Libagonians is the feast of the Virgin of Mount Carmel every July 16. The people's main sources of income are copra, abaca, farming, and fishing. Barangays Libagon is politically subdivided into 14 barangays. * Biasong * Bogasong * Cawayan * Gakat * Jubas (Poblacion) * Magkasag * Mayuga * Nahaong * Nahulid * Otikon * Pangi * Punta * Talisay (Poblacion) * Tigbao Demographics Climate History It was said that Libagon got its name from a derivative or distorted word of the dialect, libaong, which means a small depression of the ground. Spanish authorities mistook the reference to the ground fault on the land being tilled as the name of the place. It has since been known by that name, Libagon. The Dagohoy revolt prompted more Boholanos to settle the southern towns of Leyte, in particular in Hilongos, Bato, Matalom, Maasin, Macrohon, Malitbog and Hinunangan. Sometime in 1771, seventeen families from the different towns of Bohol migrated in the southeastern coast of Sogod. Led by Marciano Esca√±o, Agun Espedilla, Fernando Escueta ( Estuita), Mariano Evailar (Yballar), Lazaro Idhaw (now spelled as Idjao), Jose Endriga, Soldiano Arot, Fausto and Agustin Enclona (some families changed their spelling Encluna), Rosendo Evalin (Ybalen), Mauro Escamilla (Escabillas), Laurente Edillo, Domingo Espinosa, Francisco, Felipe and Tiburcio Egina, they founded the visita[satellite barrio with chapel] of Libagon. Andres Espina, a resident of Tamolayag [now Padre Burgos town], Malitbog, was invited to instruct the children how to read and write. Despite of its growing population, Libagon was only recognized as a visita of Sogod sometime in 1850.[13 Gan, Edito. \\"Sogod of our Memories: A Special History- Genealogy Account\\", Sogod Municipal Hall, Sogod, Southern Leyte] The \\"Balwarte\\" where the Japanese soldiers camp during World War II The early known settlers of Libagon were of Bol-anon ancestry (Boholano people). The settlers' first chosen leader of Libagon was Domingo Mateo Espina. He was the son of Agustin Mateo Espina and Francisca Barbara and the grandson of Pedro Espina of Duero, Bohol. Espina's wife, Potenciana Esca√±o, was called Capitana Potenciana by townsfolk, in recognition of her role as First Lady of Libagon. The town of Libagon was founded in 1845.Espina, Francisco Sr., Ang Lungsod sa Libagon, 1985.Espina 1985, Gibalhin Ang Lungsod, p. 3. At this point in the history of the municipality, the barrios or barangays under Libagon included Sogod and Bontoc at the farthest north and Punta at the farthest south. The Poblacion comprised two barangays: Jubas (at the south) and Talisay (at the north). By March 1870, Don Gabriel Ydjao became the chief executive of Sogod and transferred the poblacion [town center] to Libagon. Since Ydjao was a native of that place, and probably because Sogod was far from his residence, he renamed Libagon as Sogod Nuevo (other historical accounts stated that Libagon was renamed Sogod Sur) and Sogod as Sogod Viejo (Sogod Norte). Ydjao also appealed to the parish curate, Padre Logronio, to transfer the parish church in Libagon, a year after Sogod was made a parish.[13] The church in Libagon would remain there until 1924, when a group of concerned Sogodnons plead to the bishop of Calbayog, the Most Reverend Sofronio Hacbang Gaborni, to return the seat of the parish in Sogod. Don Patricio Tubia, a native of Buntuk, succeeded Ydjao during the 1876 elections as gobernadorcillo until 1878. Don Nicolas Idjao won the position of gobernadorcillo in the 1885 elections with Gabino Ellacer as teniente 2, Antonio Reyes as juez de sementeros, Rufino Espina as juez de policia, Ramon Espina as juez de ganados, Vicente Pajuyo as teniente 2 and Catalino Encinas as juez. The alguacils [municipal council or councilors] of Sogod Nuevo, at that period, were Julian Endriga, Raymundo Escabillas, Magdaleno Endriga and Pedro Ermogina(Hermogino). In the visita of Maak, Domingo Javier became the teniente del barrio, Gregorio Deberal as juez and Cirilo Banal and Evaristo Pa√±a as police officers. Eleuterio Faelnar became the teniente del barrio of Sogod Viejo and Hipgasan with Mauro Catajoy and Potenciano Espina as juezes, and Jose Singson and Ariston Meole (now spelled as Miole) as police officers. Florentino Flores became the teniente del barrio of Buntuk with Francisco Cabilin and Fabian Ballena as juezes, and Dionisio Resma and Victor Jomor as police officers.[13] By 1887, Don Eleuterio Falenar, who once served as the teniente del barrio of Sogod, assumed as gobernadorcillo.[13]Borrinaga, Rolando (September 25‚Äì28, 2000). \\"Leyte: A Forgotten Symbol of Resistance Movements in the Visayas\\". http://www.oocities.org. Retrieved May 7, 2014. Don Cipriano Lebiste (now Leviste, real name Tomas Jabonillo) became the gobernadorcillo of Sogod from 1889 to 1891. The members of the municipal council under Lebiste's administration were Eugenio Destrisa (some families spelled it as Destreza or Destriza), Felix Entino, Magdaleno Dagaas, Catalina Idjao, Pedro Bellesa, Patricio Tubia, Victoriano Godes, Lucio Dagaas and Agustin Ballina.[8] When Don Luis Espina became gobernadorcillo from 1891 to 1893, the municipal council was composed of Buenaventura Gimenes (now spelled as Jimenez), Bernardo Endriga and Damaso Amongan as subalterno tenientes and Anastacio Ylan, Calexto Montanes, Protacio Elejorde and Carlos Ymluna (some families spelled it as Encluna or Enclona) as police officers. During Espina's incumbency, the visita of Maak was reduced to a sitio of barrio Consolacion with Antonio Ca√±ete as the teniente 1, Gregorio Debera (now spelled as De Vera or De Veyra) as teniente 2, Rosales Bonot and Leoncio Cocido as juezes; and Eugenio Demosmog and Pantaleon Dejarme as police officers. With Maak's status being demoted, Sogod Viejo was also placed under the jurisdiction of the visita of Hipgasan with Crispulo Cabales as teniente 1, Domingo Bellesa as teniente 2, Mauro Catajoy as juez 1, Tranquilino Dagohoy as juez 2, and Victoriano Camba and Juan Javier as police officers. In Buntuk, Felipe Aguilar and Felix Entino assumed the position of tenientes 1 and 2 while Graciano Sama√±o and Antonio Arguelles were designated as juezes and Leoncio Resma as police officer.[8]Gan, Edito. \\"Sogod of our Memories: A Special History- Genealogy Account.\\" Sogod, Southern Leyte: Sogod Local Government Unit By 1893, Sogod was again headed by Don Nicolas Idjao with Crisante Pajuyo, Dimas Yndico (now spelled as Endico), Macario Ylang and Mauricio Sembrano as tenientes, Patricio Tubia as juez de sementeras, Luis Espina became the juez de ganados, Buenaventura Gimenez as juez de policia, and Felipe Paitan, Pedro Ralo (now Rale), Enrique Tiguetigue (now Tikistikis) and Fruto Egina as police officers.[8]Gan, Edito. \\"Sogod of our Memories: A Special History-Genealogy Account.\\" Sogod, Southern Leyte: Sogod Local Government Unit At some point in time, possibly during the years following 1845 until 1885, Libagon was deemed as a barrio of Sogod, together with Bontoc and Consolacion. In 1885, Nicolas Idjao was elected as gobernadorcillo and transferred the poblacion of Sogod to Libagon, from Sogod. Then, he renamed Libagon as Sogod Nuevo or Sogod Del Norte while Sogod as Sogod Viejo or Sogod Del Sur. After twelve years of power, the poblacion was restored to Sogod for a while when Benito Faelnar was appointed as capitan municipal of Sogod. But in 1904, Ladislao or \\"Estanislao\\" Decenteceo was elected and transferred the poblacion to Barangay Consolacion, a barrio from Libagon. However, in 1912, the poblacion was again transferred to Sogod when Vicente Cari√±o took office in that year. On 16 October 1913, Libagon and Sogod were finally separated into two independent towns ‚Äì Libagon (14 barrios) and Sogod (45 barrios). The challenges of an increasing population necessitated the division. The new Libagon was under the administration of the new Presidente Municipal, Mariano L. Espina.Espina 1985, Nabahin sa Duha ang Lungsod sa Libagon, p. 13. Language The Cebuano language is either commonly spoken in Libagon or the Boholano dialect (Binol- anon) although there are some slight linguistic variation maybe in form, meaning or context. The Filipino language (or Tagalog) and English are taught in Elementary and High School. Religion Libagonons (or Libagonians) are predominantly Roman Catholic. Feasts The town celebrates its annual fiesta in honor of their patron saint, the Blessed Virgin Mary of The Immaculate Conception on December 8. She is also the principal patroness of the Philippines. Other main Catholic holy days, including the local feasts of barangays, are observed throughout the year. Caro floral decoration with the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Besides the main fiesta on 8 December, every 16 July, rain or shine, Libagonians also celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. They have a commending devotion to Mother Mary and a firm belief in Mary's general aid and prayerful assistance. The day after the feast, the traditional Pangilis is held. [Pangilis from the root word \\"ilis\\" meaning \\"change\\"]. On the 17th (July), at the break of dawn, the sounding of a bugle early in the morning to awake people, or dayana in the dialect, is carried out as a custom observed through the years to start-off the Pangilis solemnization and festivity. [\\"Dayana\\" etymology: Spanish: diana: reveille]. The former ermano-ermana hand over the holy image of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel to the home of the succeeding (h)ermano or (h)ermana mayor for the following year's fiesta in a procession joined by townsfolk of Libagon mostly from the poblacion. Before the Pangilis, devotees (Carmelitas or Carmelites) who pledge for one's support for the coming year's celebration are also enlisted. Then after the street parade, immediately begins a joyous street dancing that ends on or before midnight. This affair is usually led by that year's chosen (with solicitation) or at times designated \\"King and Queen\\" of Pangilis. In recent celebrations, a Pangilis Idol is determined in a contest of talents usually in dancing dressed in their own imaginative, artistic, colorful and, at times, bizarre costumes. Similarly, these two feasts feature the colorful karo (carriage) that carries the holy image of the Blessed Virgin Mary on a ceremonial procession after the novena and mass held on the evening before the feast day. Both the karo and the church's altar are usually adorned with creative floral arrangements. =The Parish of the Immaculate Conception= The first church and convent built by Libagonons were of wooden structure. \\"The tradition of building wooden churches date back from the Middle Ages until the turn of the 18th century. The skills, knowledge and experience to build an ample log structure were performances out of the ordinary\\". (See: Wooden Churches of Maramures). As commonly practiced in the past, the construction of the church, chapel, convent and the town hall was made possible through bayanihan, a spirit of communal unity or effort to do a particular goal. A resident of proper age can volunteer at least a day in a week to a month to help or work in the construction. Usually on a Saturday, the volunteers ascended the mountains to look for timber for the church's pillars and some wood used in other means, like wood joints, posts, floors, etc. The wood found were Narra trees (pterocarpus), Molave trees (vitex parviflora), White Lauan (shorea contorta) and other rainforest trees in the forested mountains of Libagon. The largest pillars were huge trees bigger than the circumference of a man's (or two men's) outstretched arms. The task of dragging down the trees (with very strong ropes on both ends) from the mountainous jungle on narrow access was indeed a hazardous challenge to the men. In like manner, another group of volunteers brought gongs and drums to tap a repeated rhythmic beat and synchronized the pushing and pulling down of the timber while together they howled, \\"HIIIIBOOOYYYY....\\" While on an abrupt slope, restraining the heavy log is crucial to prevent it from running over someone and avoid breakage of the tree. Each of them brought their own food and an ample amount of coconut wine (tuba) stored in a baler shell or bamboo container to quench their thirst. Despite all these, the bayanihan spirit of the Libagonons rose above the arduousness of the endeavor and wiped out any exhaustion they felt.Espina, Francisco Sr., Gitukod Ang Simbahan, Kombento Ug Balay-Lungsod, p.5. Aside from timber, the church's foundation were made of crushed rocks, stones and sand that were hauled and made into tablets of stone and framed as walls. The stone walls stood nearly at 5 to 6 feet tall and laid on top with lumber that continued up to the ceiling. The groundwork for every column was deep and durable. As cement, they used stones and sand daubed with whipped egg whites mixed with lime to reinforce the pillars.Espina, Francisco Sr., Gitukod Ang Simbahan, Kombento Ug Balay-Lungsod, p.6. The floor tiles were specifically requested from Barcelona, Spain. The belfry stood high with three large church bells. Each piece, when rang, upended and plunged causing a loud sound that can be heard as far as San Isidro, Banday, and areas across Sogod Bay. Unfortunately, during World War II this wooden church was burned down by the Japanese invaders and was rebuilt into its present structure with a more modernized architecture but twice smaller than the original. They tried to reposition the original columns to rebuild it but they were unexpectedly tough to demolish. They instead had to severe the posts from the surface.Espina, Francisco Sr., Ang Unang Pari sa Libagon, p.7. The first ever parish priest of Libagon was Padre Don Tomas Logro√±o from Inabanga, Bohol. He graduated from Colegio-Seminario de San Carlos of Cebu (presently known as San Carlos Major Seminary of Cebu). He arrived in Libagon in June 1870. He was instrumental in the materialization of Libagon's earliest parish and convent. He bought articles, stuff and other religious items needed in the church. He served as Libagon's parish priest for 12 years. In April 1882, he was destined to the town of Macrohon, Southern Leyte until his demise on October 21, 1901. Local government Century-old Spanish-designed Libagon Town Hall =List of former municipal leaders= During the early years of the Spanish regime, the town's leader was addressed as the \\"Capitan\\" similar to Alcalde Municipal, or Presidente Municipal, and presently, Municipal Mayor. On record, the succession of leaders in Libagon from Spanish to American regimes to Postwar (Philippine Independence) 1946-1965 was as follows:Espina 1985, Mga Punoan sa Libagon, p. 21. * Capitan Domingo Espina * Capitan Pedro Espina * Capitan Felix Espina * Capitan Estanislao Decenteceo * 1870-Gobernadorcillo-Don Gabriel Ydjao * 1885-Gobernadorcillo-Don Nicolas Idjao * 1889-1891-Gobernadorcillo-Don Cepriano Lebiste (Tomas Jabonillo) * 1913-1916 ...Presidente Municipal Mariano L.

Espina During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1942‚Äì1945), Petronilo \\"Liloy\\" Ebarle was appointed as the Municipal Mayor from 1942-1944. However, the guerrillas alluded him as a \\"puppet mayor\\". Though Mayor Ebarle held the Japanese- appointed position, Mayor Gregorio E. Edillo also continued to be the official leader under the authority of the Philippine Commonwealth with the United States. On the other hand, the people also recognized the command of the guerrilla forces of Leyte or the Leyte Area Command under Coronel Ruperto Kangleon, and supported as well the supervision of the Volunteer Guards in the town level. There were only two leaders of the Volunteer Guards in Libagon. The first was Lieutenant Francisco Barros, followed by Francisco \\"Dodo\\" Espina.Espina 1985, Mga Punoan sa Libagon, p. 22. And the only Libagonian officials of the Leyte Area Command (LAC) were Lieutenant Catalino \\"Nongnong\\" E. Soledad, Lieutenant Feliciano \\"Lily\\" A. Espina and Lieutenant Marcelo \\"Celing\\" E. Espina, who were also officers of USAFFE (U.S. Army Forces in the Far East). These three brave Libagonians fought in the Battle of Bataan which represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II. Unfortunately, of the three brave men, only Marcelino Espina did not make it back to his hometown, Libagon. His body was left on the battlefield of Bataan. He was the younger brother of Francisco \\"Dodo\\" Espina who became the town's Mayor for two terms. Like , many valiant guerrillas from Libagon died during the war. A Memorial Stone (Ang Bato sa Paghandum) was built in memory of these heroic men of Libagon. All their names were engraved on granite to honor their lives and monumentalize their memory and courageous deed.Espina 1985, Mga Opisyales sa Leyte Area Command, p. 39. The Memorial Stone now stood in the midst of Libagon Rizal Park. The Contemporary period includes the final years of the Third Republic (1965‚Äì72) and the entirety of the Fourth Republic (1972‚Äì86) to the succeeding years following the 1986 People Power Revolution. * 1968- 1979 ...Municipal Mayor Salvador M.

Ranque Attractions Libagon is the home of exotic and unique natural areas that are excellent for ecotourism and adventure travel. Perhaps the most defining experience in adventure travel is found in Libagon. However, ‚Äúa walk through the rainforest is not eco-tourism unless that particular walk somehow benefits that environment and the people who live there. A rafting trip is only eco-tourism if it raises awareness and funds to help protect the watershed.‚Äù (Untamed Path) =Patag Daku Rain Forest= View from Patag Daku facing the Pacific Ocean Patag Daku is located in Libagon, Southern Leyte, particularly in the upper or mountainside of the poblacion in Talisay. Patag Daku, in English, means \\"big plain\\". It is certainly big but is never quite plain. It is actually a valley so dense in vegetation that novice campers and mountaineers will never come in or out without an experienced guide leading the way. But the trek to the valley comes big in every way. In mountaineering parlance, it is a major climb. Not the leisurely stroll that one might expect, the climb is an arduous six-hour journey through a maze of trees, ferns, moss, grass and big trees. Patag Daku, the mossy forest more than 500 hectares of unexplored, uncharted wilderness, fraught with dangerous tales of huge snakes and wild animals. =Uwan-Uwanan Falls= Rock climbing at Uwan-uwanan Falls Uwan-uwanan falls is located in barangay Kawayan, Libagon. The gorge is a world-class adventure wonder. Climbing, swimming and trekking rolled into one. It will take a two-hour trek to the mountains, rappelling and climbing bamboo ladders within cascading falls before you reach the top. Uwan-uwanan, literally means \\"resembling a rainfall\\" because the two-hour track entails an enchanting encounter of an \\"uwan-uwanan \\". And at the top, photo enthusiasts are in for a marvelous treat. At exactly 12:00 noon when the sun is directly above the middle of the narrow opening at the gorge, the natural light is awe- inspiring as it dramatically illuminates the whole area resembling a magnificent altar in a cathedral or a place of worship. =Hindag-an Falls= Hindag-an Falls is a natural wonder found in St. Bernard, Southern Leyte. Just about 1 kilometer away from the roadside. The place displays natural waterfalls with man-made pools. In every waterfall is a pool of particular depth. The deepest was about 10‚Äì15 feet wherein you need to jump from above the rocks to get to the pool. There is also a pool for children about 2 ft. and also a water slide. =Pangi Black Sand Beach= The beach in barangay Pangi is of fine black sands usually great for swimming, hiking and ecotourism. Other black sand beaches can also be found in more places than anyone thinks, like the famous black sand beaches of Polynesia, Indonesia, Iceland, the Caribbean islands and the Punaluu Black Sand Beach in Hawaii, were created virtually instantaneously by the violent interaction between hot lava and sea water. The suspicion of a volcano close to Libagon may explain the black sand beach formation in barangay Pangi. But there is no exact evidence on this suspicion as verified by the concerned agency. See also: Black sand and Black Sand Beach =Biasong Springs= Biasong Spring one of Southern Leyte's best springs. Many Libagonians get their drinking water here. Biasong Springs is one of the oldest spring in Southern Leyte. It is located in the barangay of Biasong. The clear spring water is collected into a man- made basin or pool. The place is a favorite of the locals providing cool mountain spring water. A pool that has been the site of many happy occasions: birthday picnics, homecoming celebrations, etc. It has perhaps the sweetest mineral spring water in the province and most uncontaminated source. =Peter's Mound= Peter's Mound, a fascinating dive site, is a sea mound located just 200 meter offshore from barrio Otikon. A sea mound just 200 m. (650 ft.) offshore, is a cleaning station for large pelagics. Animals to see are: wrasse, grouper, sweetlips, surgeons, fusiliers, tuna, and jacks together with other species of reef fish. The deep starts at 10m and drops off to over 40m. The currents can be strong which means that coral life is profuse. = Municipal Town Hall= Libagon has a century-old and well-preserved Spanish style municipal hall. The structure gives a glimpse of the town's rich heritage. It is amongst Southern Leyte's premier historical sites and landmarks - the pride of Southern Leyte. = Bulwark (Ang Balwarte)= This is the only memorial left of the Lungsod-Daan or the original location of the town center of Libagon. It is made of boulders or tablets of rock, limestone and gravel. This structure is made strong and formidable as a defensive fortification against the Moros (Muslim) from the big island of Mindanao. See also Moro people (section: Spanish period). Strategically located, the edifice is overlooking Sogod Bay and the two deltas of the islands of Limasawa and Panaon. The Bulwark or Balwarte at the old town center is near the big river named Tubig-Daku, below and adjacent to the existing cemetery. This is also where the Japanese soldiers camped during World War II. = Old Pantalan (Seaport)= Jubas Boulevard and Sogod Bay The ruins of the old pantalan or seaport still stand along the shores of the Poblacion in Jubas. Recently, the entire seacoast along Sogod Bay is transformed into a \\"park by the bay\\" also commonly referred to as the Boulevard in Jubas ideal for walks and for viewing the sunset while fishermen on their lighted bancas or boats scatter all over the bay. This is seen most specially during peak fish season. Besides, the beautiful sunset along Sogod Bay, the whale-sharks in Southern Leyte are simply at home in Sogod Bay. Whale-sharks or Rhyncodon typus are popularly known locally as iho-tiki. Recent sightings confirm that whale-sharks actually are all over Sogod Bay. They were spotted in San Francisco, Southern Leyte, as well as in Limasawa, Malitbog, Libagon, Sogod, Pintuyan and even as far as San Ricardo. In fact, they had long been ordinary fare for small fishermen. People have gotten used to them that young boys ride on their backs as they scour for plankton along the village shores. Though, there is no 100 percent guarantee to spot a whale-shark in Sogod Bay. It takes proper timing, good weather, and a huge amount of luck to see one. Patience is the name of the game. The best time to see whale-sharks in Southern Leyte is April and May. =Libagon Rizal Park= Like most local governments from Luzon to Visayas and Mindanao, a Rizal monument is erected to commemorate the Philippines' national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, regarded as the foremost Filipino patriot. The Rizal monument stands at the Libagon Rizal Park, a significant landmark of Libagon located strategically in the midst of the poblacion. Education =The Parish Convent cum Libagon High School= Like the old church, several large pillars made the convent strong. The large convent was built beside the church. Unlike the old sanctuary, the old friary was providentially spared from being burned down during the war. The structure defied many strong typhoons, hurricanes, and vigorous quakes‚Äîa token of the superior groundwork. Earlier, the friary being the home of the parish priest and church servants was also used as the house of the first Catholic educational institution of Libagon and the first and only High school. The limited funds to set up a Secondary school moved the founders to appeal to Bishop Manuel Mascari√±as (in Palo, Leyte) for his approval to use some of the rooms of the convent. Because Libagon High School was dedicated to be a Catholic institution the Bishop acceded to the request and even allowed the High School to use the church's plaza as well. Libagon Academy Foundation, Inc. old building Initially known as the \\"Libagon High School, Inc.\\", the establishment basically taught Catechism ‚Äì training for the young Catholic faithful with questions and answers about the essentials of Catholic faith and doctrine so that they could understand easily their faith. Besides the 3 R's (Reading, Writing and Arithmetic), the Spanish language was normally taught at that time. Music, however, was especially instructed. Musicians, songwriters, singers and choirmaster were trained for the church's choir. The same musicians completed the town's band that was well known among other bands in the province. The Bureau of Private Schools suggested that the establishment be given another name that would signify it as a non-public school. Thus, the Board of Trustees signed a resolution renaming the High School as, \\"Libagon Academy.\\" Consequently, they renamed the corporation as, \\"Libagon Academy Foundation, Inc.\\" In another resolution the Board decided to make the Academy a non-profit organization. All proceeds (if there was any at all) were used to improve the schoolhouse. The modest tuition enabled all primary school graduates to continue their education in High school in their own town instead of spending more to attend school in nearby provinces, or stop and work in the farm or simply marry. However, the low tuition prevented the academy to some earnings, thus the resolution. After all, the many professionals ‚Äì the teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, auditors, seamen, nurses, and many other professionals as products of Libagon Academy‚Äîbecame undoubtedly the biggest dividend of a simple and unassuming town, such as, Libagon. The Libagon Academy was yet another product of the bayanihan spirit among Libagonians. The forerunners and shareholders, who were also parents and widowed mothers after the war, were driven with the same purpose to give reasonable education to their children. And as donation, they pulled together some of their own personal belongings (like pocket books, magazines, notebooks, etc.) to the academy. These admirable men and women were motivated by the selfless efforts of the founders of the first Libagon High School (renamed Libagon Academy) despite stiff disapproval from some factions. The founding Board of Trustees were: * Francisco E. Espina - President * Mario E. Espina - Vice-President * Nemesio A. Egina - Secretary-Treasurer * Bibiano K. Lasala - Auditor * Brigida Gozo-Escuita - Member * Vivencio Lopez - Member The pioneer members of the Faculty were: * Felix B. Endriga - Director / Principal / English Instructor * Carmen N. Endriga - Biology & Tagalog Instructor * Purificacion Ebarle - English Instructor * Perpetou D.Margallo - History Instructor * Jesus Cellan - Science Instructor * Mario E.Espina - Religion Instructor * Imelda Espinosa - Librarian On June 1949, Libagon Academy opened its doors for its first day of classes. The institution remained to be the only premier Catholic educational organization of the municipality of Libagon.Espina 1985, Natukod Ug Gibuksan Ang Libagon Academy, p. 44. Transportation Ordinarily, the habal-habal(s) or single motorcycles are used as modes of transportation in crossing Sogod and to other distant and mountainous areas. Sogod is the major terminus in the south central portion in Leyte Island. It is the vital link in connecting Visayas to Mindanao. The buses, jeepneys, and for-hire vans terminate from Sogod to Maasin City, Ormoc City, Tacloban City, Bato-Hilongos, Liloan (by way of Libagon), Hinunangan and Silago. The Libagon Highway is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway, also known as the Maharlika Highway (AH26). It is a 3517 km network of roads, bridges, and ferry services that connect the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao in the Philippines, serving as the country's principal transport backbone. The northern terminus of the highway is at Laoag City, and the southern terminus is at Zamboanga City. In addition, traveling to Manila from Libagon approximately takes 24 hours by bus along with ferry from Northern Samar to Matnog. The trip is a scenic interprovincial ride. Philtranco buses are long known to serve this route.

About 301.39 hectares (2.38%) is occupied by the Poblacion, composed of three barangays namely Santo Rosario, San Vicente (Poblacion) and Santa Cruz. Rivers and creeks cross Macrohon; the most prominent ones are the Amparo River and Villa Jacinta River. Along the seacoast are coral reef and sand beaches. The town has varying contour elevations. The western portion along the seacoast comprises a level land. The rest of the land area has varying elevations ranging from gently sloping areas, land sloping in one general direction to steeply undulating and rolling land sloping in many directions. Macrohon's northern portion is bounded by the City of Maasin, the Municipality of Padre Burgos borders the southern portion and the Municipality of Malitbog borders the eastern portion and faces Mindanao Sea on the west. The town center is away from Maasin City, which is the capital of Southern Leyte; and is away from the town of Padre Burgos. Barangays Macrohon is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. Demographics Climate History Macrohon since 1895, was named in memory of Spanish Governor-General Manuel MacCrohon, of Irish descent. It was weaned from the jurisdiction of Maasin in 1904. The town of Macrohon holds the distinction of having a son who led the resistance in Leyte and prepared the landing of the Liberation Forces which earned him high posts after the war and posthumous promotion by President Fidel V. Ramos to Brigadier General Ruperto K. Kangleon. Back to ancient times, after the United States took over the Philippines from Spain, Macrohon became a municipality. However, in 1906, it was reverted as a barrio. When Salvador Demeterio was elected a delegate to the First National Assembly, he made Macrohon a separate municipality in 1907. Demeterio was also elected as governor of Leyte and the Capitol Building of Tacloban was built during his term. A historic edifice that during the naval pre- invasion bombardment, Ruperto K. Kangleon persuaded Gen. Douglas MacArthur on board the USS Nashville to desist the inclusion of Tacloban as target to preserve the capitol building. Thus, Macrohon earned a unique distinction of having great leaders deserving hallowed place in history. The town has a land area of 120 hectares. Its coastline has many mangroves, resort beaches and springs. A tiny islet in barrio Molopolo, a vacation home of its owner, continue to attract visitors and the beaches and springs inveigle bathers. The barrios of Aguinaldo (since 1870, named in memory of the 1st Filipino Revolutionary leader, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo); Amparo (in memory of its Patron Saint and river); Asuncion; Bag-ong Silang; Buscayan, Cambaro, Canlusay, Flordeliz (was named barrio Katung, a name of a revolutionary commander); Guadalupe; Ichon (named in memory of Emilio Ichon, secretary to the Leyte revolutionary commander); Ilihan, Laray; Mabini; Mohon; Molopolo ( barrio since 1845, a name from the abundant mangrove trees along the coast); Rizal ( a barrio since 1858; it was known then as Baliw, it was changed to Rizal to honor the National Filipino Hero and to remind the people of Macrohon the Philippines' struggle for freedom); San Joaquin ( a barrio since 1896, known then as Luuk); San Roque ( a barrio since 1873, known as Panagsaan); San Vicente (Poblacion); San Vicente (Upper); Santa Cruz; Santo Ni√±o; Santo Rosario; Sindangan; Lower and Upper Villa Jacinta and Upper Ichon (also known as Lumbang). These baranggays constitutes the political units of the town of Macrohon. Distinguished luminaries from Macrohon, who earned renown, are the following: WWII Resistance Hero, Gen. Ruperto K. Kangleon, also assigned as Secretary of National Defense and was also elected as senator; Rep. Ciriaco K. Kangleon and Leyte Governor Salvador Demeterio. Archbishop Mariano G. Gaviola; former Court of Appeals Presiding Justice Ramon G. Gaviola, Jr.;and former Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports Ricardo Gloria, trace their roots from Macrohon. Their exemplary lives inspired others as to append the honor to Macrohon as the fountainhead of successful sons. =1901 to present= The Municipal Government of Macrohon was organized in 1901 headed by Mr. Felomino Demeterio as the first appointed president. The town was composed only of the following barrios: \\"Nipaon\\" now Ichon, \\"Hingatigan\\" now Amparo, \\"Maypague\\" now Aguinaldo, \\"Catong\\" now Flordeliz and \\"Panasawa\\" now San Roque. In 1903 a formal grade school was opened which was the most important activity during the period. In the year 1906, Macrohon was reduced to a barrio of Maasin excluding Barrio San Roque, which was part of Malitbog. The new governor- general in accordance with the general reorganization plan instituted this in order to economize government expenditures by fusing small towns and provinces. When Mr. Bautista Kuizon became a member of the Maasin Municipal Council representing Macrohon, he noticed that the administration neglected Macrohon because of its distance from the poblacion. Salvador Demeterio brought a petition signed by only around twenty people who know how to read and write to the governor general. They changed the name of the town to Smith with the hope of getting favorable action from Governor Smith. But it was stipulated in the executive order approving the petition to retain the old name Macrohon. The executive order was implemented in 1907. Capitan Gerardo Kuizon was appointed municipal president. The next head of the municipality was the first elected municipal president, Mr. Bautista Kuizon. His knowledge on the democratic processes during the student days in Manila made him the most competent person to lay down the foundation of a real democratic government in the municipality. He implemented the separation of power between the church and state reminiscent of the Spanish Regime. He strictly practiced equally under the law and demonstrated it by not averting a fine meted on his own mother who happened to break a provision of an ordinance. He also succeeded to provide religious toleration in the town by extending protection to the propagator of new faiths such as the Protestants and the Aglipayan. By this, he got the ire of the parish priest and the church leaders, but he was able to regain their friendship and cooperation. Mr. Kuizon stayed in the office a little more than a year. He moved out to Mindanao and left the municipality to his vice, Mr. Ponciano Tallo. During the elections in 1912, Mr. Filomeno Demeterio was elected Municipal President of Macrohon. Under his leadership the town was reconstructed after it was hit by the most devastating typhoon in the town‚Äôs history. He served two terms from 1913-1919. The period covering the First World War was a period of progress in Macrohon. The price of abaca was high and almost all vacant lots caused by the typhoon of 1912 were planted with abaca. A native son veteran Federico Gaviola, who served under the United States Army in France, represented the town at the war front. Mr. Trinidad Demeterio was elected to succeed his elder brother. He served for three consecutive terms from 1919 to 1927. The former Chief of Police, Mr. Felixberto Kuizon, was elected municipal president in 1929 and served the term from 1928 to 1930. Atty. Prisco Bitos occupied the office of the municipal president for two terms from 1931 to 1936. In his incumbency another cooperative marketing association was organized and sponsored by municipal government. It was only short-lived, but during its existence the association affected better price of abaca and copra. During the commonwealth government Mr. Tereso Kangleon became the first Municipal Mayor, starting 1936. He was serving his second term when the war broke out. When he fled in 1942, Mr. Tito Gloria Sr., his vice took over and was the one who met the Japanese occupation army to accept the Japanese sovereignty. In 1943, Mr. Tito Gloria, Sr. affiliated himself with the free Leyte government sponsored by the guerillas. The people chose Mr. Vicente Evarretta as caretaker of the town under the Japanese sponsored Independence. When the Second World War ended the elected mayor resumed his unfinished term. Mr. Tereso Kangleon was reelected for another term. He did not serve his term but rather gave the office to his vice mayor, Mr. Rafael Joven. He reconstructed the town, its public buildings, plazas and bridges. Again he was reelected in the next election from 1952 to 1955. Mr. Conrado Compendio was elected and served as municipal mayor for two terms from 1956 to 1963 where the municipal hall was constructed and completed. In 1957, three new barrios were created: * Ilihan - composed of the sitios of Ilihan Proper, Camalig, Sindangan, Gawisan, Guinabonan, Lunang, Mabanga and Danao * Villa Jacinta - composed of the sitios of Upper Villa Jacinta Proper, Peng-on, Mahayahay, Canodto, Laray, Luan, Santa Rosa and Camangahan * Lower Villa Jacinta - composed of the sitios of Lower Villa Jacinta Proper, Suba, Central, Babayon, Muldes, Boayahan and Pancil. Mayor Leonor O. Galdo, M.D. was installed into office by the election of 1963. He was reelected for a second term in 1967 until 1971. He was reelected again for two successive terms from 1988-1995. Dr. Caridad S. Evarretta was elected as mayor from 1995-1998. Mayor Fe Gaviola-Edillo was elected as mayor for three terms from 1998-2007. Her vice mayor, Manuel Boldo, was elected as mayor from 2007-2010. Fe Gaviola-Edillo won again as mayor in 2010. The current mayor is Alan Jose Kuizon Aroy which term will end in 2022.

The name comes from the word \\"mang-haon\\" meaning \\"to remove cooked food\\", from the word \\"haon\\" meaning \\"to pick up pots after cooking something\\". Moro raiders, usually arriving at dusk, surprise the coastal dwellers which force them to hide in tall bushes. The Moros would then get their food, thus the name \\"Manhaon\\". The term thus believed where the name of the town was derived. The 2006 Manhaon Festival Contest was celebrated on Sept. 29, 2006, at the spacious Municipal Plaza. Tribu ng Maasin garnered first place, Concepcion National High School (from the town of Malitbog) second and Macrohon Institute (MACI), Inc. third.

According to the , it has a population of people. Geography The municipality of Malitbog is located in the southern region of the island of Leyte, one of the major islands in the Philippines. It is officially designated as part of Region VIII, or Southern Leyte. It is situated along the coast of Sogod Bay and is bounded on the north-west by the municipalities of Macrohon and Maasin City, the capital town of the province of Southern Leyte, on the north-east by the municipality of Tomas Oppus and on the south by the municipality of Padre Burgos. It is two away from Tacloban City, the regional center of Region VIII. It can be reached by bus and other public utility vehicles and privately owned ones with a travel time of 40 minutes to one 1 hour to and from Maasin City, and 30‚Äì40 minutes to Sogod. It takes about 2‚Äì4 hours to and from Malitbog to Tacloban City. Barangays Malitbog is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. Demographics Climate  History The town of Malitbog, Southern Leyte came into existence in the early part of the 18th century as proven from the inscriptions on the stone walls of the ruins of the watchtowers \\"Baluarte\\" located equidistant from the Roman Catholic Church. One is found south of the Poblacion in Barangay Caaga and the other in Barangay Abgao north of the Poblacion. Said watchtowers were constructed in the year 1820. The two barangays abovementioned were ruled by their chieftains, called capitanes. No traces could be found as to the names of the capitanes. As absolute rulers of their respective barangays, they tried to established their own kingdoms. Both of the chieftains wanted to rule the other, hence, there was strong and keen rivalry between the two and the pueblo was to be organized by the Spaniards sometimes in the middle part of the 18th century. The inhabitants were very much confused as to where the pueblo be located. Confusion in the local dialect means \\"makalibog\\". Since that time the Spaniards organized the pueblo, they called it Malitbog, a derivative or distorted word from the dialect \\"makalibog\\". They built the Town Center midway and equidistant between the two Barrios. The Malitbog Santo Nino Church. The Malitbog Watch Tower, built in 1862 Through the intercession of the Roman Catholic Priest who often visited the two warring barangays, a proposal was made to the rival barangays to fuse the two communities and establish a bigger church. Again, trouble arose as to where the church be constructed. A settlement was later on made through the insinuation of the priest that the church be built not in any of the two barangays but in a location that shall serve as boundaries between them. In 1857, the Roman Catholic Church was built up in baroque architecture by forced labor. And in addition to the construction starting from the very portal of the church leading to the shoreline, going east to serve as the demarcation line between the two rival barangays, at the end of the dividing line a watchtower was constructed. This watchtower was constructed in the year 1862 as inscribed in the walls of the said watchtower. The town of Malitbog was created on December 14, 1849, and was later on reorganized under the provisions of the Maura Law of 1893 the territorial limits covered nineteen (19) kilometers to the south of the Poblacion including the island of Limasawa. In 1897, a one-storey building in baroque style was constructed at the left side of the demarcation line also equidistant from the Catholic Church and the watchtower. The said building was believed to be the seat of government during the Spanish Regime. No traces could be found as to the name of the first governadorcillo, though at a later time prior to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, there were capitanes known in the locality by the name of Capitan Tonio Base and Capitan Esteban Piramide. During the American Regime, the town was reorganized under the provision of Act. No. 82 passed by the Second Philippine Commission in 1900. This Act was known as the Municipal Code and the First Municipal President of Malitbog was Francisco Esca√±o. A house owned by a certain Macabuhay located at the corner of Calle Real and a street now known as Lopez Jaena served as the Municipal Hall and was later transferred to another private house owned by a certain Chinese merchant at the corner of Calle Real and a street now known as Mayor Va√±o Street. The American Regime in the early 1900 was marked with the establishment of public elementary schools. One of the school buildings was constructed near the old building built in baroque style during the Spanish era. This old building was later on made into a Municipal Hall. When the enrolment in the school increased, the newly constructed house could no longer accommodate until the local government came into agreement with the school authorities to exchange places. And so the Municipal Hall was transferred for the fourth time to the public school building until at present which remain to the seat of the Local Government Unit of Malitbog. In 1957 during the incumbency of President Carlos P. Garcia, several barrios in the southern portion of Malitbog including the island of Limasawa was created into a separate town as the municipality of Padre Burgos by virtue of an Executive Order No. 265. Fourteen (14) years later, the northern portion of Malitbog was declared into another town known as the municipality of Tomas Oppus, previously known as Santiago through the Act of Congress No. 5777 and further amended by Presidential Decree No. 134. Presently, the municipality has 37 barangays; 21 of which are coastal, 4 are inland and 12 are mountain barangays.

Henry Ross was born in Toronto, Upper Canada, and probably arrived at Melbourne on the Magnolia in November 1852, along with Charles Doudiet and three other Canadians. There is no evidence of who exactly designed the Eureka Flag, but it was Ross who took the design to three women - Anastasia Withers, Anne Duke and Anastasia Hayes - to ask them to sew it and have it ready in time for the meeting taking place at Bakery Hill at 2.00pm on Wednesday the 29 November 1854. At Bakery Hill on 30 November 1854 Captain Ross unfurled the Southern Cross and led the march from Bakery Hill to Eureka Stockade; behind him followed about 1,000 diggers, some armed with rifles, many only armed with picks and shovels. Captain Ross was given the command of a division of miners by a meeting of the 7 captains of the rebellion who met at Eureka that afternoon to organise the defence of Eureka. Later that afternoon Captain Ross raised the flag on the temporary flagpole that had been erected at Bakery Hill. Sword in hand, his division gathered at the foot of the flagstaff, the sun going down behind them. Peter Lalor jumped onto a stump and asked those around him to take an oath to the Southern Cross. He pointed his right hand towards the Southern Cross and delivered the diggers oath. :\\"We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties\\" The miners shouted 'Amen' and then marched back to the Eureka Stockade and hoisted the Southern Cross on a makeshift flagpole at the centre of their camp. When the first shots rang out at daybreak on Sunday the 3 December 1854, Captain Henry Ross took up his position at the foot of the flagpole. He was mortally wounded during the early phase of the battle and lay dying at the foot of the Southern Cross when trooper King scaled the flagpole and tore the flag down. By some accounts Ross was shot 10 or 15 minutes after he surrendered. Fellow Canadian (Charles) Alphonse Doudiet, who painted earlier Eureka events, recorded that he was among those who carried the Stockade leader to the nearby Star Hotel, and remained with him until he died \\"in great pain\\" at 2 am on 5 December 1854. Duncan Clark, from the same regiment as Ross, had been out scouting and returned in time to assist his leader to the hotel. Some 260 mourners followed the funeral procession of Ross to the Ballarat Cemetery. He was eulogised as one of the best loved men of those who fell. The young Canadian digger, Henry Ross, was buried at the bottom of a mass grave at the Ballaarat Old Cemetery, while his beloved Flag of the Southern Cross is owned by the Art Gallery of Ballarat ( which stands on the site of the soldiers encampment), and is displayed at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka, the site of the rebellion.

Barangays Saint Bernard is politically subdivided into 30 barangays but only 28 are considered truly functioning barangays. History Landslide at Barangay Guinsaugon This town was formerly the largest barrio of San Juan, then known as \\"Himatagon\\". On December 9, 1954, President Ramon Magsaysay issued Executive Order No. 84, converting the barrio as a municipality of Saint Bernard. It was through the efforts of Leyte Governor Bernardo Torres that the conversion was made possible in response to the lingering clamour of the inhabitants for an independent and separate municipality from San Juan. As a gratitude to Governor Bernardo Torres, the people unanimously renamed Himatagon as Saint Bernard, with the honorific title \\"Saint\\" being a translation of the vernacular honorific \\"San\\" which is given to persons of virtue, wisdom or generosity and the name Bernard being the English version of the name Bernardo. On February 17, 2006, a tragic series of mudslides killed over 1100 residents in Barangay Guinsaugon. Affected families were treated by the Philippine government and other non-government organizations from all over the world. New houses were built, and the people chose New Guinsaugon as the name of their village located near the town proper. Demographics Climate Economy Saint Bernard's economy are based in agriculture and marine culture. The municipality is considered among the fastest growing economy in the pacific area of Southern Leyte. Saint Bernard is a peninsula and therefore it is almost entirely surrounded by water. The majority of the people who live in the flat lands engage in fishing as their main mode of livelihood. Those who live in the mountain barangays, live through farming. The common mode of transportation is by bicycles with side cars, known locally as Potpot or pedicabs or, depending on the distance, tricycles with side cars, called trisikads or center cab. The LGU established the Saint Bernard Town Center for economic activities of some Small to Medium Entrepreneurs.

In addition, ants provide soil aeration through the creation of galleries and chambers, mix deep and upper layers of soil, and incorporate organic refuse into the soil. Seed dispersal Ants may play an important role in the dynamics of plant communities by acting either as seed dispersal agents or as seed predators, or both. During the day, these ants search the savannas for vegetation and plant seeds, and carry them along back to their nest. The two main mechanisms through which ants disperse seeds are myrmecochory, or seed dispersal mediated by the elaiosome, i.e., a lipid-rich seed appendage that mainly attracts non-granivorous ants and provides rewards for seed dispersal, and diszoochory, or seed dispersal performed by seed- harvesting ants that is not mediated by any particular seed structure. While the former has traditionally been recognized mainly as a mutualism, the latter is usually perceived as an antagonism. Foraging behavior Harvester ants foraging in hot, dry conditions lose water, but obtain water from metabolizing fats in the seeds they eat. Positive feedback on foraging activity, from returning foragers with food, allows the colony to regulate its foraging activity according to the current costs of desiccation and the benefits based on current food availability. In many harvester ant species, foraging behavior is influenced by the weather. For example, in the ant Messor andrei, recruitment to food bait is higher in more humid conditions. Both humidity and food availability are affected by day-to-day changes in weather conditions. Food is distributed by wind and flooding and rain uncover seeds in the top layer of the soil. In Pogonomyrmex barbatus, daily changes in conditions such as humidity and food availability produce strong daily trends in the foraging activity of all colonies. Colonies may vary in the relation between humidity and foraging activity. Colonies differ consistently from year to year in how often they forage at all and most colonies forage on days with high humidity and high food availability, such as those just after a rain when flooding has exposed a layer of seeds in the soil. Few colonies forage on very dry days. Colonies also differ in how likely they are to adjust the rate of outgoing foragers to the rate of forager return. While all colonies tend to adjust outgoing foraging rate closely when conditions are good, only some colonies do so in poor conditions. Sting Harvester ants for their size have a rather potent venom. They inject it to their victim via sting by biting down and following up with a rapid sting from their abdomen, this causes 4-8 hours of sharp pain with effects similar to neurotoxicity such as piloerection and localized sweating around the area of the sting.Clinical Consequences of Toxic Envenomations by Hymenoptera Species and genera *Aphaenogaster - about 200 species **Aphaenogaster cockerelli, seed-harvesters *Euprenolepis - eight species **Euprenolepis procera, nomadic mushroom-harvesters, a previously unknown lifestyle among ants *Messor, seed-harvesters *Pheidole, seed- harvesters *Pogonomyrmex, seed-harvesters **Pogonomyrmex barbatus ** Pogonomyrmex maricopa, a venomous species found in Arizona, USA ** Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, seed-harvesters *Carebara ** Carebara diversa, seed harvesters See also *Leafcutter ant *Honeypot ant References    Category:Ants Category:Insect common names ","title":"Harvester ant"},{"id":"2155943","text":"', officially the ' (Kabalian: Lungsod sa San Juan-Cabalian; ; ), is a in the province of , .

While there are several versions, the most popular one involves Magellan who happened to pass by Cabalian. This account tells of Magellan and his crew attempting to land this settlement after being battered by a heavy storm known locally as ‚Äúsubasco‚Äù. One of his ships had a broken main mast that required immediate repair. The curious natives led by their chieftain, Datu Malitik, gathered on the shore as they closely watched the approaching ships. The natives who were armed noticed the broken mast and shouted ‚Äúgikabali-an‚Äù. Roughly translated, the word means ‚Äúto experience a breakage or broken materials‚Äù. Magellan and his men interpreted the hostile- surrounding shouts as the name of the place. Not wishing to engage the natives in combat after the battering of the storm, the explorers lifted anchors and sailed away. On June 17, 1961, Republic Act 3088, which changed the name Cabali-an to San Juan, was signed into law by the President of the Republic of the Philippines. However, up to this day, the town is still known as Cabali- an. The name simply refuses to disappear on maps, telecommunication directories and in most people‚Äôs minds. On September 15, 2010, San Juan celebrated its 150th Founding Anniversary. Local government Municipal elected officials: * Municipal Mayor: Virgilio A. Mortera * Municipal Vice Mayor: Lolito A.

Festival The town celebrates its rich Catholic heritage every 24th day of June, the Solemnity of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, Precursor to the Divine Word, Our Lord Jesus Christ. The \\"novemdiales\\" or novena in honor of the patron saint commences every 15th day of June, and is referred to as jornadas. Jornadas in Spanish means \\"sojourns\\" or \\"journeys\\", which specifically refer to the translation of the patron saints of all barangays to kiosks or minuscule chapels outside the baroque parish church. In addition to the eighteen patron saints of the 18 barangays of Cabalian, more come from the hill villages of Hinunangan. They remain in those chapels until the 24th day of June, called the kahuyugan, whence they are processed around the town in andas and carrozas. The fiesta spans for three (3) days: (1) disperas (Sp. v√≠speras) which falls on the 23rd day of June, coinciding with the Vespers for the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in the Divine Office; (2) kahuyugan (lit. the day on which the fiesta falls) on the 24th of June, coinciding with the main celebrations; and (3) liwas (lit. post-fiesta) on the 25th day of June, when the remaining victuals are served to fiesta-goers who want to avoid the fiesta traffic and hullabaloo. The novena is said in the parish church. Preserving the incorruptible tradition of Visayan Catholic identity, the long Gozos in honor of St. John is sung. The tradition of the gozos goes back to the august cathedrals of Spain and Portugal. The structure of the gozos follows the usual format of the Spanish gozos: an estribillo (couplet) repeated after every estrofa (verse). Although, the Solemnity of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist was traditionally not celebrated with water dousing, sometime in 2000, the LGU launched the Sinabligay Festival, which translates as Water Dousing Festival. The LGU has passed ordinances prohibiting the use of dirty water during this Festival. Amongst the activities included in the Town and Patronal Fiesta are the following # SLSU Alumni Homecoming, organized by the Southern Leyte State University # SJNHS Grand Alumni Homecoming, organized by the San Juan National High School # Parish Pastoral Night # The Search for Ms. TEEN Cabalian, organized by the Municipal Federation of Sangguniang Kabataan, in partnership with KUYOGG Inc.

It started as a joint venture between the United Nations Development Programme and Cisco Systems. It became an independent nonprofit organization in 2001. In 2007, NetAid became a part of Mercy Corps. Launch concerts NetAid began with a concert event on October 9, 1999 with simultaneous activities meant to harness the Internet to raise money and awareness for the Jubilee 2000 campaign. Concerts took place at Wembley Stadium in London, Giants Stadium in New Jersey and the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The Wembley show was at capacity; the U.S. show suffered from very poor ticket sales. Performers at Wembley Stadium included: Eurythmics, The Corrs, Catatonia, Bush, Bryan Adams, George Michael, David Bowie, Stereophonics and Robbie Williams. Performers at Giants Stadium included: Sheryl Crow, Jimmy Page, Busta Rhymes, Counting Crows, Bono, Puff Daddy, The Black Crowes, Wyclef Jean, Jewel, Mary J. Blige, Cheb Mami, Sting, Slash, Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease, and Zucchero. Performers in Geneva included: Bryan Ferry, Texas, Des'ree and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The NetAid website, originally at www.netaid.org, received over 2.4 million hits and raised $830,000 from 80 countries. Cisco sponsored the concerts and the web site. Along with Kofi Annan, Keyur Patel, MD of KPMG Consulting spearheaded the technology architecture development of the web site and Anaal Udaybabu (Gigabaud Studios, San Francisco) designed the user experience . Wyclef Jean released a charity single featuring Bono entitled \\"New Day\\" coinciding with NetAid. The song also has an accompanying music video that premiered on MTV's Total Request Live (USA) on September 21, 1999, although the video never charted. Programs & Administration Robert Piper of UNDP served as a manager of the NetAid initiative for its launch in 1999.. Following the concerts, NetAid was spun out of Cisco as an independent entity and tried various approaches to raising awareness of extreme poverty and raising money for anti-poverty projects undertaken by other organizations, through a variety of different NetAid campaigns. In 2000, NetAid launched an online volunteering matching service on its website, in partnership with the United Nations Volunteers programme, then under the direction of Sharon Capeling-Alakija.. The volunteering portion of the web site, managed by UNV staff, allowed non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN-affiliated projects serving the developing world to recruit and involve online volunteers in various projects. UNV took ownership of the online volunteering portion of the service in 2004, moving the it to its own URL at onlinevolunteering.org. In February 2001, Time magazine and NetAid announced a pioneering initiative aimed at collecting donations through Palm VII handheld computers, allowing volunteers collect credit card data from friends and input the information into the NetAid web site via these newly-wireless devices. The experiment \\"pushes the envelope for Web-based charities, according to analysts, who said the bid to turn handhelds into virtual wallets faces some significant hurdles--for example, guaranteeing the privacy and security of contributors.\\" In response criticisms regarding its finances, NetAid published a web page in November 2001 citing its record of donations to anti-poverty initiatives to date, such as granting \\"$1.4 million to 16 poverty alleviation projects in Kosovo and Africa ‚Äî well over the $1m that had been raised from the public to that point... the remaining $10.6 million was dedicated to creating an innovative institution that will generate new support for reducing global poverty over the long term. Since January 2000, NetAid has used approximately $2 million to catalyze new support and partnerships for fighting global poverty.\\" As an incubator for civic technology, NetAid explored the use of videogames for social change, co- founding the Games for Change movement in 2004. NetAid's work with games was initially offline, beginning with the \\"NetAid World Class\\" board game, which piloted in California, Massachusetts and New York in 2003. In 2004, NetAid co- produced a game with Cisco Systems called \\"Peter Packet,\\" which addresses how the Internet can help fight poverty, focusing on issues of basic education, clean drinking water, and HIV-AIDS. By 2006, NetAid had narrowed its focus to raising awareness among high school students in the USA regarding poverty in developing countries.

He is considered the father of the Finnish public school system. His accomplishments also include the initiation of high class teacher training, emphasizing the importance of women's education and most importantly introducing the use of crafts (veisto in Finnish, sloyd/sl√∏yd in Norwegian, sl√∂jd in Swedish, and sl√∏jd in Danish), as a mandatory subject in the school curriculum. Early life Cygnaeus was born in H√§meenlinna, Finland, on 12 October 1810. His father died early in his childhood when he was 8 years old. Uno studied natural sciences and theology at the University of Turku and continued in Helsinki when the university moved over to Helsinki. In 1837 he was ordained as a priest and started serving in Viipuri till 1839. In Viipuri he served as assistant pastor and prison chaplain in addition to teaching at a private school. This experience and his study of the work of the educational philosophers Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Friedrich Fr√∂bel led to the formulation of Cygnaeus's own educational philosophy and ideas. In 1840 he was sent off to Russian America to serve for five years as the first pastor of Sitka Lutheran Church in New Archangel (now Sitka, Alaska) as a punishment for an extramarital affair. This place was a trading post, where Cygnaeus got a chance to observe the barter exchanges between the Europeans and the Native Alaskans. Upon his return, he spent twelve years as a superintendent of a Finnish parish school in St. Petersburg. Career In 1855 the Russian senate was commissioned to advance the educational system in Finland after Tsar Alexander II ascended to the throne. The senate collected proposals from different sources. Uno Cygnaeus also sent a proposal which gained the senate's support and Cygnaeus was appointed to develop a folk school system. He travelled via Sweden and Denmark to the German States and to Switzerland to collect information about different educational systems. He was most influenced by the kindergartens in Hamburg and the Swiss school system. Cygnaeus drew up a plan on the basis of notes, which he took during his journeys and the senate approved his plan in 1861. Cygnaeus advocated separating schools from the supervision of the church and establishing a teacher training college. Cygnaeus's plan formed the basis for the folk school regulation, which was laid down in 1866. The Sloyd system became compulsory for boys in all rural schools (it still is all over the country-2007) and for all male teachers in teacher training institutions. Students learned about metals, about fabrication techniques, about selecting appropriate wood samples from the forests, about the care necessary for working with materials and finally the need for collaborative efforts to accomplish tasks. Sweden adopted these ideas a few years after Finland. A 'Sloyd Training School' was set up in N√§√§s, Sweden in the 1870s by Otto Salomon. Thousands of teachers from all over the world attended classes at N√§√§s. Some of the countries in which Sloyd was successfully introduced were the UK, the US, Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, and the Scandinavian countries. Currently, Sloyd is still part of the compulsory school curriculum in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The influence of Cygnaeus also reached the United States (Bennet 1937) when Larsson, trained by Otto Salomon, moved to the U.S. and founded the ‚ÄòBoston Sloyd School‚Äô in 1888. This institution is still regarded as an important step in American technological education (Phillips 1985). The views of the American educator John Dewey were based on then current global trends, one of the most important one being the Sloyd movement begun by Cygnaeus. D.W. Olson, the first American researcher writing about technology education, values Cygnaeus quite highly. Finnish general education still has educative handicraft [‚Äúk√§sity√∂‚Äú] as a school subject. It is divided into two separate subjects: textile work [‚Äútekstiility√∂‚Äú] and technical work [‚Äútekninen ty√∂‚Äú]. They are taught as compulsory subjects from the third grade of primary education. Students can choose either ‚Äútekninen ty√∂‚Äú or ‚Äútekstiility√∂‚Äú. From 1863 until 1869, Cygnaeus served, besides being a chief inspector of the country's school system, as the director of a Finnish seminary at Jyv√§skyl√§. After that he returned to full- time job as chief inspector and 1870‚Äì87 he was also a member of the supreme board of education. Death Cygnaeus died on 2 January 1888 in Helsinki, Finland. Family His cousin, Fredrik Cygnaeus, was a Swedish-language poet.

He created the Sorcerer role-playing game, the GNS theory of gameplay, and The Big Model. Edwards is also co-founder of The Forge, an online community to support indie RPG design and publication. Early role-playing Ron Edwards first started playing RPGs in 1978 when he was 14, starting with Dungeons & Dragons, which had been published four years earlier. He also tried other RPGs such as Tunnels & Trolls, Runequest, and his early favorite, The Fantasy Trip. Through high school and university, he continued to play RPGs, and entered an experimental phase in the 1980s and 1990s, playing as many as 200 different RPGs, including Champions, Stormbringer, GURPS, Rolemaster, Cyberpunk 2020, Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game and Over the Edge. Game design While Edwards was a graduate student and biology instructor at the University of Florida, working on his PhD and writing a dissertation focused on evolutionary theory, he began to design an RPG he called Sorcerer. He sent the finished game to an existing RPG publisher; the publisher agreed to publish it and sent Edwards a standard contract, which gave the publisher the right to control artwork and marketing, to revise the book in the future if the author did not want to and to terminate the contract at their discretion. Edwards found the proposed contract unacceptable ‚Äî inspired by indie comic creator Dave Sim, he believed that creators should have control over their own works. As a result, he turned down the offer to publish, and in 1996, he printed copies of Sorcerer and distributed them using the shareware model, mailing a copy to anyone who asked for it and asking for $5 in return if they liked the game. Soon afterward he produced an ashcan of the game to sell at conventions. He continued to playtest Sorcerer and produced a fully rewritten version of the game that he began selling in PDF form after acquiring the sorcerer-rpg.com domain. He also produced two PDF supplements ‚Äì Sorcerer & Sword (1999) and The Sorcerer's Soul (2000) ‚Äì and also licensed Concept Syndicate to sell Sorcerer on a CD-ROM. Game theory During the 1990s, Edwards was involved in discussions on Usenet about the theory of gameplay during RPGs, debating topics such as the fiction generated during role-playing ‚Äî in Edwards' words, \\"when it is or isn't a story, and if it is, how it got that way.\\" As Edwards monitored the Usenet discussions, he realized that different players brought dramatically different priorities to the table ‚Äî what he called Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism. In an online article in 1999, Edwards started to posit what would become his \\"GNS Theory\\" of how those three elements were related to techniques used during role-playing. He also began to discuss the \\"Big Model\\" of role-playing, saying, \\"We needed to be discussing roleplaying as a social event, which was even bigger than individual, or better, expected shared-group priorities. The name 'Big Model' refers to this 'bigness,' starting with everything that plays into who we are and why we sit down to play together.\\" In the \\"Big Model\\", Edwards explores the layers of the role- playing game: the social event as the outer layer, the imaginary material lying beneath that, and the rules system as the inner core. The Forge and Adept Press With Ed Healy, Edwards created the website Hephaestus's Forge in December 1999, as a creator-owned-game publisher site. The original site closed in late 2000 due to hosting problems, but Edwards and Clinton R. Nixon resurrected the site as \\"The Forge\\" in April 2001, hosted at indie-rpgs.com. It continued to run successfully until 2012. After seeing Obsidian: The Age of Justice, an RPG independently published by Micah Skaritka, Dav Harnish, and Frank Nolan, for sale at Gencon 33 in 2000, Edwards decided he could publish his own RPG books while retaining ownership. He created Adept Press, through which he published his second RPG, Elfs (2001) as a PDF. He also re-published Sorcerer as a 128-page hardcover volume in 2001. RPG historians Steven Torres- Roman and Cason Snow believe this was a turning point for indie RPGs, saying that when Edwards released the hardcover version, he \\"showed independent game designers the way to publish their own games.\\" Ron Edwards and Sorcerer subsequently won the second annual Diana Jones Award for \\"excellence in gaming\\" in 2002. Edwards purchased a booth at GenCon 34 in 2001 for Adept Press; the following year, the booth was doubled in size to also include The Forge. In a departure from his Sorcerer material, Edwards released the unusual RPG Trollbabe in 2002, where all players take on the role of Trollbabes, large female trolls. In 2004, he returned to Sorcerer with the third supplement, Sex and Sorcery. In 2006, he created an RPG called It Was a Mutual Decision during a 24-hour challenge that he himself had set for other RPG designers. In 2007, he createded Spione: Story Now in Cold War Berlin, an RPG set in World War II Berlin. In 2009, he published the unusual two-player RPG S/lay w/Me, where one player is the hero while the other takes on the role of both the hero's lover and his monstrous opponent. In 2015, Edwards created Circle of Hands, a gritty low-magic RPG set in the Iron Age. Awards In 2002, Ron Edwards and his role-playing game Sorcerer were awarded the Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming. The award citation reads in part \\"First self-published online for as a for-sale PDF, Sorcerer ‚Äî together with its creator and publisher Ron Edwards ‚Äî represent the potential of the independent innovator in today‚Äôs RPG industry [...] His successful nurturing of an online forum dedicated to creator-controlled games have leveraged a mere brilliant game design into the seed crystal of something with the potential to greatly improve adventure gaming.\\" Also in 2002, Edwards was awarded an Indie RPG Award in the category \\"Human of the Year\\". His award citation reads in part \\"He has single-handedly done more for the indie RPG industry than anyone by helping folks get started or into the industry, promoting others' games, and generally being an amazing rescource to us all [...] He is a bloody powerhouse of rock and roll game- designerdom. The man is unstoppable.

It was intended to replace the Settlement Plan of 1991, which was further detailed in the Houston Agreement of 1997. Background Western Sahara's administration by Morocco since 1975 is challenged by Polisario guerillas living in exile in neighbouring Algeria. Since 1991, a ceasefire has been in place, accepted by both parties with the understanding that the UN would organize a referendum on independence. The 1991 referendum plan was stalled, however, due to disagreements on voter eligibility. Morocco demanded the inclusion of all people now living in the territory, including all Moroccan settlers. Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored settlement schemes enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two-thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants. The Polisario Front insisted on inclusion of only found in the 1974 final Spanish census and their descendants; the 1974 census had been mentioned as the basis of voter lists in the 1991 agreement. Specialized Minurso identification teams eventually found in favor of some 80,000 voters deemed to be indigenous to the territory. That number corresponded quite closely to the Spanish census of 75,000 persons, which caused Morocco to launch appeals against the voter list on behalf of over 100,000 rejected applicants from the Moroccan side. This stalled the process, and by the late 1990s, Morocco had begun declaring the referendum a \\"dead option.\\" Baker I and II The first draft of the plan, called Baker I or the Framework Agreement, was circulated by the UN special envoy James Baker in 2000, but never presented formally to the Security Council. Although based on Baker's proposals, it was drafted by a Morocco-sponsored legal team. It offered the people of Western Sahara autonomy within the Moroccan state. Except for defense and foreign policy, all other decisions would be the responsibility of local government. Morocco accepted the plan, but Algeria and the Polisario front rejected it. Algeria countered by proposing that the territory be divided between the parties. The second version (informally known as Baker II) envisioned Saharan self-rule under a Western Sahara Authority for a period of five years, with a referendum on independence to follow. In this referendum, the entire present-day population of Western Sahara would participate, including people who had migrated from or been settled by Morocco post-1975, something which Polisario had so far refused. On the other hand, a provision that the interim local government (the Western Sahara Authority) would be elected only by a restricted voters' list (those identified as original inhabitants of the territory by Minurso) alienated Morocco. After Morocco had voiced early objections to Baker II, Algeria and the Polisario front reluctantly accepted the plan as a basis for negotiations. In July 2003, the UN Security Council endorsed the plan, something that it had not done with Baker's first draft, and unanimously called for the parties to implement it. Morocco, however, then rejected the plan, saying that it would no longer agree to any referendum that included independence as an option. After this, Baker resigned in protest, the second UN envoy to Western Sahara to do so. He indicated that given the irreconcilable positions of the parties and the Security Council's refusal to enforcing a solution over the objections of either party, there no longer appeared to be a feasible way to implement the 1991 Settlement Plan or to reach another compromise solution. While the Polisario, anxious to have a strong mediator with US backing in charge of the UN process, deplored his resignation, Moroccan officials viewed it in a positive light; foreign minister Benaissa publicly called the resignation a result of \\"the tenacity of Moroccan diplomacy\\". Status of the Baker Plan Since early 2005, the UN Secretary General has not referred to the plan in his reports, and by now it seems largely dead. No replacement plan exists, however worries persist that the political vacuum will result in renewed fighting. Morocco has proposed autonomy for the territory as a final solution to the conflict.

It took place on 28 June 2005, as part of the Trafalgar 200 celebrations to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. For the celebrations to mark Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee in 2012, instead of a Fleet Review such as marked that of Queen Victoria, there was a cavalcade of boats down the Thames.  2005 Review Line-up  In the Solent ready for the International Fleet Review, 2005. During the afternoon of 28 June 2005, Queen Elizabeth II, as Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, embarked on board HMS Endurance. Led by THV Patricia, and with following as \\"Sovereign's Escort\\", Her Majesty set sail to review a fleet of over 167 ships of the Royal Navy and of over 30 other nations, as well as other non-naval vessels such as the passenger liner QE2. The previous fleet review by the Queen in the United Kingdom was in 1999 for the commemoration of the anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic. The review took place at Spithead, on the Solent, between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, in England. The Fleet Review is a 600-year-old British tradition, and until the 2005 review consisted of mainly Royal Navy ships, with a small number of invited foreign ships, but there are today no longer enough Royal Navy warships available in home waters for this to be worthwhile. This review, therefore, went with the modern trend of inviting foreign warships too, and was the largest on record in terms of nations attending and of number of shipsMod Trafalgar 200 Foreign Navies Enroute for International Fleet Review \\\\- 167 naval and merchant ships attended, including 57 British warships. The Queen reviewed the fleet from on board the Royal Navy's Antarctic Patrol Vessel HMS Endurance. Huge crowds gathered along Southsea Common and Gosport Sea Front, to witness the largest gathering of naval vessels in the Solent since the Queen's Silver Jubilee Fleet Review in 1977. The crowd was entertained by aerobatic and flying displays, including an appearance by a Spitfire, helicopter aerobatics and a special performance by the Red Arrows. While the weather had been very wet, the clouds appeared to clear in time for each display. At the end of the day's festivities, centered on the review, a massive firework display was held as a 'reconstruction' of the Battle of Trafalgar (with Grand Turk standing in for HMS Victory, and with a red and a blue side rather than French and British ones), now known to be one of the largest firework displays in recorded history.

Although a variety of disasters are the subject of subsequent disaster tourism, the most common disaster tourist sites are the areas surrounding volcanic eruptions. Opinions on the morality and impact of disaster tourism are divided. Advocates of disaster tourism often claim that the practice raises awareness of the event, stimulates the local economy, and educates the public about the local culture, while critics claim that the practice is exploitative, profits on loss, and often mischaracterizes the events in question. Motivations of disaster tourists An Article by smartertravel defines the conventional motivations present in individuals practicing disaster tourism. Attraction is typically derived from personal connection in a social, academic or cultural essence. Another population of visitors hope to aid in providing relief to the affected areas‚Äîsome directly through volunteer work and some indirectly through donations. Other visitors have no connection to the site or the event, but happen to be there as tourists and visit those places as part of their sightseeing. A common example of this is tourists who come to Italy to sightsee in Rome and end up visiting Pompeii and its neighboring cities without initially intending to do so.  Reception of disaster tourism  Disaster tourism has had a mixed reception, with critics labelling it as voyeuristic and profiting off of loss and with advocates arguing that the tourism stimulates the recovering economy and brings awareness to local culture. Although the public perception of tourism depends on a wide variety of factors, such whether the disaster was man-made or natural and how long it has been since the incident, there are some general trends in the reception of tourism. Depending on the site or tour, disaster tourism can be seen to be an educational experience or exploitative. Whether or not a tourist site is handled in a respectful and tactful manner often is determined both by those organizing the events and the tourists themselves. Moreover, advocates of disaster tourism point out that attractions are capable of re-examining disasters in an educational manner despite that the operators are motivated by profit. Many of these advocates argue that when distasteful disaster tourism occurs, the blame lies primarily on the tourists for providing an insensitive demand rather on the operators for fulfilling such a demand. For both tourists and operators, however, parsing the difference between an educational and an exploitative one requires asking what areas are crucial for understanding the disaster and clarifying how behavior that is appropriate in a destroyed area is often different from behavior that is appropriate in newly built homes or temporary camps. The effect of tourism on the local economy is often nuanced due to the specifics in how tourism affects local income. It is generally accepted that if the tours comprise public events organized by volunteers, then there are consistent but small increases to charity donations. However, if the tours are organized by private companies, then it is not always clear how what proportion of the profits go back into relief efforts. Furthermore, while governmental regulation typically prevents private tours from slowing down or reversing reconstruction in areas where reconstruction has already began, critics argue that private touring may deincentivize the reconstruction of locations and sites, in which reconstruction has yet to occur. Another possible situation is that the tours are not organized by formal entities but instead by less cohesive groups of citizens. These cases are relatively unstudied due to their rarity. Similarly, visiting disaster sites is thought to have an effect on empathy, but the nature of the effect it has depends on the particulars of the visit. Unorganized visits, for example, can often raise empathy by forcing the visitors to see suffering up close and prompting them to consider how to interact with victims. More organized visits, on the other hand, have been accused of lowering empathy because they comprised tourists ‚Äúacting like tourists and dressing like tourists,‚Äù which dilutes and sanitizes the experience.  Virtual reality in disaster tourism  = Facebook's virtual tour of Puerto Rico = In September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria is estimated to caused 4,645 deaths total, and in Puerto Rico, it is estimated to have caused $94 billion in property damage and displaced approximately 60,000 people. On October 9, 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook social VR chief Rachel Franklin used a livestream to showcase Facebook‚Äôs new VR app, Facebook Spaces, by taking a virtual tour of the devastated areas Puerto Rico. During the 10 minute video, Zuckerberg explains how Facebook partnered with Red Cross to build population map from satellite imagery and better allocate the relief effort. The public reception to the tour was unanimously negative. Zuckerberg drew criticism for describing VR as \\"magical\\" in its ability to transport people to disaster zones, and most viewers considered the cartoon avatars of Zuckerberg and Franklin to be an inappropriately jovial tone. The day following the livestream, Zuckerberg apologized, explaining, \\"When you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen.\\" Examples of disaster tourism = 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius = When the nearby volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, the eruption buried the city of Pompeii and the nearby city of Herculaneum and preserved everything from its streets to its frescoes under mounds of pumice and ash. Although Pompeii was initially rediscovered in 1599, tourism was undesirable until Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre performed a much larger excavation in 1748, which revealed many noteworthy structures, such as a fully intact Roman theatre. Today, Pompeii belongs to the much larger Vesuvius National Park and is one of Italy‚Äôs most popular tourist sites, attracting approximately 2.5 million visitors annually. = Hindenburg incident (1937) = In the early evening of May 6, 1937, the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg burst into flame during a docking attempt at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station, just outside Lakehurst, New Jersey. With the cause of the fire unknown and a death toll of thirty-seven passengers, the Hindenburg disaster became one of the biggest news stories of its time. Today, a bronze plaque and cement outline the site of the incident. Immediately east of the crash site, volunteers of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society will conduct public tours of Historic Hangar One, the location where the Hindenburg was kept. = 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion = On the morning of April 26, 1986, the number four reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, producing airborne radioactive materials and a fire that burned for ten days. The Chernobyl explosion caused dozens of direct deaths and thousands of deaths due to long-term exposure. In the aftermath, 350,000 residents were displaced from Chernobyl and the nearby city of Pripyat. The other three reactors at Chernobyl power plant continued running at the time but were gradually lessened until the power plant‚Äôs shutdown in 2000. The Ukraine-based tour company SoloEast Travel currently runs daylong tours through Chernobyl‚Äôs exclusion zone, a 2600 square-kilometer area that includes the plant. The highlights of the tour include visiting Red Forest, a pine tree woodland destroyed by radioactive contamination, exploring Kopachi, a nearby village that was demolished due to high contamination levels, and finally coming within 305 meters of the remains of the number four reactor. These tours are met with some controversy because despite that SoloEast Travel claims that publicly accessible areas surrounding the power plant contain low levels of radiation and are deemed safe, a number of third party scientists disagree. = 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill = In 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Alaska's Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and leaked crude oil into the sound. An estimated 30 million plus gallons spilled. Oil from the spill would eventually contaminate more than 11,000 square-miles of ocean and 1300 miles of coastline. The spill killed hundreds of sea otters, harbor seals, and eagles and hundreds of thousands of seabird in the days following the spill. Despite that it is not the world's largest oil spill, the Exxon Valdez oil spill is typically considered the most notorious in American history. Having been among the first responders, the family-run Stan Stephens Cruises operates glacier tours out of Prince William Sound that highlight the history surrounding the Exxon Valdez spill and its aftermath. = Hurricane Katrina (2005) = In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the American city of New Orleans. Although 80‚Äì90% of the population was evacuated prior, twenty- three breaches in navigational canal levees, drainage canal levees, and floodwalls occurred as a result of Katrina‚Äôs storm surge. With these failures, 80% of New Orleans became flooded, which in turn caused over 200,000 homes to be destroyed and 800,000 residents to be displaced. At the time, the disaster had a large impact on the politics, population, and economics for a sizable portion of the United States. A decade after the incident, the effects of Hurricane Katrina are still visible and catastrophic. Although many companies offer bus tours of the still-damaged regions, critics argues that these tours interfere with the relief effort. Some have suggested that curious tourists should instead go on bike tours in order to restrict the disruption to residents trying to get their lives back on track. Quite frequently, tours will focus on showcasing the culture of specific districts and neighborhood, treating Hurricane Katrina as the most recent event in a much longer cultural history. Many tours donate their profits or a portion of their profits to local relief organizations. =2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull= Eyjafjallaj√∂kull, in Iceland, began erupting on 20 March 2010.Volcano Erupts Under Eyjafjallaj√∂kull , Reykjav√≠k Grapevine, March 21, 2010 At this time, about 500 farmers and their families from the areas of Flj√≥tshl√≠√∞, Eyjafj√∂ll, and Landeyjar were evacuated overnight, but allowed to return to their farms and homes after Civil Protection Department risk assessment. On 14 April 2010, Eyjafjallaj√∂kull erupted for the second time, requiring 800 people to be evacuated. In the wake of the first eruption, tour companies offered trips to see the volcano.Tom Robbins. The Guardian. Iceland's erupting volcano. Retrieved 2010-04-15. However, the ash cloud from the second eruption disrupted air traffic over Great Britain and most of northern and western Europe, making it difficult to travel to Iceland even though Iceland's airspace itself remained open throughout. = 2010 eruption of Mt Merapi = In the November of 2010, the active Indonesian volcano of Mt Merapi had its second eruption in a century, which led to direct deaths of 353 people and the displacement of approximately 400,000 people in nearby villages. Mt Merapi is unique among disaster tourist sites because Merapi was a popular tourist site prior to the volcano‚Äôs eruption, and tourism had already made up a significant portion of the local economy. While many tour companies and travel agencies hold more standard sightseeing tours of the affected areas, some programs provide more direct paths to donating to local charities and getting involved in the relief effort. For example, the Go Green Campaign encourages tourists to purchase small trees or seeds and plant them in local villages.

The goal was to transform education, by enabling children in low-income countries to have access to content, media and computer-programming environments. When the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so achieving this objective required bringing a low- cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support. The OLPC project was the subject of much discussion. It was praised for pioneering low-cost, low-power laptops and inspiring later variants such as Eee PCs and Chromebooks; for assuring consensus at ministerial level in many countries that computer literacy is a mainstream part of education; for creating interfaces that worked without literacy in any language, and particularly without literacy in English. It was criticized from many sides regarding its US-centric focus ignoring bigger problems, high total costs, low focus on maintainability and training and its limited success. In 2014, after disappointing sales, the Foundation shut down.  History  A short video covering OLPC's main mission principles Thank You from the Children of OLPC The OLPC program has its roots in the pedagogy of Seymour Papert, an approach known as constructionism, which espoused providing computers for children at early ages to enable full digital literacy. Papert, along with Nicholas Negroponte, were at the MIT Media Lab from its inception. Papert compared the old practice of putting computers in a computer lab to books chained to the walls in old libraries. Negroponte likened shared computers to shared pencils. However, this pattern seemed to be inevitable, given the then-high prices of computers (over $1,500 apiece for a typical laptop or small desktop by 2004). In 2005, Negroponte spoke at the World Economic Forum, in Davos. In this talk he urged industry to solve the problem, to enable a $100 laptop, which would enable constructionist learning, would revolutionize education, and would bring the world's knowledge to all children. He brought a mock-up and was described as prowling the halls and corridors of Davos to whip up support. Despite the reported skepticism of Bill Gates and others, Negroponte left Davos with committed interest from AMD, News Corp, and with strong indications of support from many other firms. From the outset, it was clear that Negroponte thought that the key to reducing the cost of the laptop was to reduce the cost of the display. Thus, when, upon return from Davos, he met Mary Lou Jepsen, the display pioneer who was in early 2005 joining the MIT Media Lab faculty, the discussions turned quickly to display innovation to enable a low-cost laptop. Convinced that the project was now possible, Negroponte led the creation of the first corporation for this: the Hundred Dollar Laptop Corp. At the 2006 Wikimania, Jimmy Wales announced that the One Laptop Per Child Project would be including Wikipedia as the first element in their content repository. Wales explained, \\"I think it is in my rational self interest to care about what happens to kids in Africa,\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jimmy_Wales&diff;=55321582&oldid;=55105689 elaborating in his fundraising appeal: At the 2006 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) announced it would back the laptop. UNDP released a statement saying they would work with OLPC to deliver \\"technology and resources to targeted schools in the least developed countries\\". Starting in 2007, the Association managed development and logistics, and the Foundation managed fundraising such as the Give One Get One campaign (\\"G1G1\\"). OLPC XO-1 original design proposal Intel was a member of the association for a brief period in 2007. Shortly after OLPC's founder, Nicholas Negroponte, accused Intel of trying to destroy the non-profit, Intel joined the board with a mutual non-disparagement agreement between them and OLPC. Intel resigned its membership on January 3, 2008, citing disagreements with requests from Negroponte for Intel to stop dumping their Classmate PCs. In 2008, Negroponte showed some doubt about the exclusive use of open-source software for the project, and made suggestions supporting a move towards adding Windows XP, which Microsoft was in the process of porting over to the XO hardware. Microsoft's Windows XP, however, is not seen by some as a sustainable operating system. Microsoft announced that they would sell them Windows XP for $3 per XO. It would be offered as an option on XO-1 laptops and possibly be able to dual boot alongside Linux. In response, Walter Bender, who was the former President of Software and Content for the OLPC project, left OLPC and founded Sugar Labs to continue development of the open source Sugar software which had been developed within OLPC. No significant deployments elected to purchase Windows licenses. OLPC XO-1 laptop in e-book mode Charles Kane became the new President and Chief Operating Officer of the OLPC Association on May 2, 2008. In late 2008, the NYC Department of Education purchased some XO computers for use by New York schoolchildren. Advertisements for OLPC began streaming on the video streaming website Hulu and others in 2008. One such ad has John Lennon advertising for OLPC, with an unknown voice actor redubbing over Lennon's voice. In 2008, OLPC lost significant funding. Their annual budget was slashed from $12 million to $5 million which resulted in a restructuring on January 7, 2009. Development of the Sugar operating environment was moved entirely into the community, the Latin America support organization was spun out and staff reductions, including Jim Gettys, affected approximately 50% of the paid employees. The remaining 32 staff members also saw salary reductions. Despite the downsizing, OLPC continued development of the XO-1.5 laptops. In 2010, OLPC moved its headquarters to Miami. The Miami office oversaw sales and support for the XO-1.5 laptop and its successors, including the XO Laptop version 4.0 and the OLPC Laptop. Funding from Marvell, finalized in May 2010, revitalized the foundation and enabled the 1Q 2012 completion of the ARM-based XO-1.75 laptops and initial prototypes of the XO-3 tablets. OLPC took orders for mass production of the XO 4.0, and shipped over 3 million XO Laptops to children around the world.  Criticism  At the World Summit on the Information Society held by the United Nations in Tunisia from November 16‚Äì18, 2005, several African representatives, most notably Marthe Dansokho (a missionary of United Methodist Church), voiced suspicions towards the motives of the OLPC project and claimed that the project was using an overly \\"U.S. mindset\\", pointing out that the presented solutions were not applicable to specifically \\"African problems\\". Dansokho said the project demonstrated misplaced priorities, stating that African women would not have enough time to research new crops to grow. She added that clean water and schools were more important. Mohammed Diop specifically criticized the project as an attempt to exploit the governments of poor nations by making them pay for hundreds of millions of machines and the need of further investments into internet infrastructure. Others have similarly criticized laptop deployments in very low income countries, regarding them as cost-ineffective when compared to far simpler measures such as deworming and other expenses on basic child health. Lee Felsenstein, a computer engineer who played a central role in the development of the personal computer, criticized the centralized, top-down design and distribution of the OLPC. = Cost = The project originally aimed for a price of 100 US dollars. In May 2006, Negroponte told the Red Hat's annual user summit: \\"It is a floating price. We are a nonprofit organization. We have a target of $100 by 2008, but probably it will be $135, maybe $140.\\" A BBC news article in April 2010 indicated the price still remained above $200. In April 2011, the price remained above $209. In 2013, more than 10% of the world population lived on less than US$2 per day. The latter income segment would have to spend more than a quarter of its annual income to purchase a single laptop, while the global average of ICT spending is 3% of income. Empirical studies show that the borderline between ICT as a necessity good and ICT as a luxury good is roughly around the \\"magical number\\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year. John Wood, founder of Room to Read (an NPO which builds schools and libraries), emphasizes affordability and scalability over high-tech solutions. While in favor of the One Laptop per Child initiative for providing education to children in the developing world at a cheaper rate, he has pointed out that a $2,000 library can serve 400 children, costing just $5 a child to bring access to a wide range of books in the local languages (such as Khmer or Nepali) and English; also, a $10,000 school can serve 400‚Äì500 children ($20‚Äì$25 a child). According to Wood, these are more appropriate solutions for education in the dense forests of Vietnam or rural Cambodia. The Scandinavian aid organization FAIR proposed setting up computer labs with recycled second-hand computers as a cheaper initial investment. Negroponte argued against this proposition, stating the expensive running cost of conventional laptops. Computer Aid International doubted the OLPC sales strategy would succeed, citing the \\"untested\\" nature of its technology. CAI refurbishes computers and printers and sells them to developing countries for ¬£42 a piece (compare it to ¬£50 a piece for the OLPC laptops). = Teacher training and ongoing support = The OLPC project has also been criticized for allegedly adopting a \\"one-shot\\" deployment approach with little or no technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The \\"children‚Äôs machines\\", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes due to a lack of knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged: a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less than once a week. In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom use the computer for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights. The organization has been accused of simply giving underprivileged children laptops and \\"walking away\\". Some critics claim this \\"drive-by\\" implementation model was the official strategy of the project. While the organisation has learning teams dedicated to support and working with teachers, Negroponte has said in response to this criticism that \\"You actually can\\" give children a connected laptop and walk away, noting experiences with self-guided learning. Other explanations of failure included a high minimum order, low relability and maintainability, unsuitibility to local conditions and culture, and encouragement of children to learn new ways of thinking instead of remaining loyal to old ways.  Technology  OLPC XO-1 laptop XO-3 concept The XO, previously known as the \\"$100 Laptop\\" or \\"Children's Machine\\", is an inexpensive laptop computer designed to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world, to provide them with access to knowledge, and opportunities to \\"explore, experiment and express themselves\\" (constructionist learning). The laptop is manufactured by the Taiwanese computer company Quanta Computer. The rugged, low-power computers use flash memory instead of a hard drive, run a Fedora-based operating system and use the SugarLabs Sugar user interface. Mobile ad hoc networking based on the 802.11s wireless mesh network protocol allows students to collaborate on activities and to share Internet access from one connection. The wireless networking has much greater range than typical consumer laptops. The XO-1 has also been designed to be lower cost and much longer-lived than typical laptops. In 2009, OLPC announced an updated XO (dubbed XO-1.5) that takes advantage of the latest component technologies. The XO-1.5 includes a new VIA C7-M processor and a new chipset providing a 3D graphics engine and an HD video decoder. It has 1GB of RAM and built-in storage of 4 GB, with an option for 8 GB. The XO-1.5 uses the same display, and a network wireless interface with half the power dissipation. Early prototype versions of the hardware were available in June 2009, and they are available for software development and testing available for free through a developer's program. An XO-1.75 model was developed that used a Marvell ARM processor, targeting a price below $150 and date in 2011. XO-3 production model The XO-2 two sheet design concept was canceled in favor of the one sheet XO-3. An XO-3 concept resembled a tablet computer and was planned to have the inner workings of the XO 1.75. Price goal was below $100 and date was 2012. As of May 2010, OLPC was working with Marvell on other unspecified future tablet designs. In October 2010, both OLPC and Marvell signed an agreement granting OLPC $5.6 million to fund development of its XO-3 next generation tablet computer. The tablet was to use an ARM chip from Marvell. At CES 2012, OLPC showcased the XO-3 model, which featured a touchscreen and a modified form of SugarLabs \\"Sugar\\". In early December 2012, however, it was announced that the XO-3 would not be seeing actual production, and focus had shifted to the XO-4. The XO-4 was launched at International CES 2013 in Las Vegas The XO Laptop version 4 is available in two models: XO 4 and XO 4 Touch, with the latter providing multi-touch input on the display. The XO Laptop version 4 uses an ARM processor to provide high performance with low power consumption, while keeping the industrial design of the traditional XO Laptop. = Software = The laptops include an anti-theft system which can, optionally, require each laptop to periodically make contact with a server to renew its cryptographic lease token. If the cryptographic lease expires before the server is contacted, the laptop will be locked until a new token is provided. The contact may be to a country-specific server over a network or to a local, school-level server that has been manually loaded with cryptographic \\"lease\\" tokens that enable a laptop to run for days or even months between contacts. Cryptographic lease tokens can be supplied on a USB flash drive for non-networked schools. The mass production laptops are also tivoized, disallowing installation of additional software or replacement of the operating system. Users interested in development need to obtain the unlocking key separately (most developer laptops for Western users already come unlocked). It is claimed that locking prevents unintentional bricking and is part of the anti-theft system. In 2006, the OLPC project was heavily criticised over Red Hat's non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Marvell concerning the wireless device in OLPC, especially in light of the OLPC project being positioned as an open-source friendly initiative. An open letter for documentation was inked by Theo de Raadt (a recipient of the 2004 Award for the Advancement of Free Software), and the initiative for open documentation has been supported by Richard Stallman, the President of the Free Software Foundation. De Raadt later clarified that he finds an issue with OLPC having proprietary firmware files that are not allowed to be independently re-distributed (even in the binary form) by third-party operating systems like OpenBSD, as well as receiving no documentation to write the necessary drivers for the operating system. De Raadt has pointed out that the OpenBSD project requires no firmware source code, and no low-level documentation to work on firmware, only requiring the binary distribution rights and documentation to interface with the said binary firmware that runs outside of the main CPU, a quite simple request that is generally honoured by many other wireless device vendors like Ralink. Stallman fully agreed with de Raadt's request to open up the documentation, since Stallman is known to hold an even stronger and more idealistic position in regards to the proprietary components, and requires that even the firmware that runs outside of the main CPU must be provided in its source code form, something de Raadt does not require. De Raadt later has had to point out that such more idealistic and less realistic position has instead been misattributed to OpenBSD's more practical approach to make it look unreasonable, and stood on record that OpenBSD's position is much easier to satisfy, yet it nonetheless remained unresolved. OLPC's dedication to \\"Free and open source\\" was questioned with their May 15, 2008, announcement that large-scale purchasers would be offered the choice to add an extra cost, special version of the proprietary Windows XP OS developed by Microsoft alongside the regular, free and open Linux-based operating system with the SugarLabs \\"Sugar OS\\" GUI. Microsoft developed a modified version of Windows XP and announced in May 2008 that Windows XP would be available for an additional cost of 10 dollars per laptop. James Utzschneider, from Microsoft, said that initially only one operating system could be chosen. OLPC, however, said that future OLPC work would enable XO-1 laptops to dual boot either the free and open Linux/Sugar OS or the proprietary Microsoft Windows XP. Negroponte further said that \\"OLPC will sell Linux-only and dual-boot, and will not sell Windows-only [XO-1 laptops]\\". OLPC released the first test firmware enabling XO-1 dual-boot on July 3, 2008. This option did not prove popular. As of 2011, a few pilots had received a few thousand total dual-boot machines, and the new ARM-based machines do not support Windows XP. No significant deployment purchased Windows licenses. Negroponte stated that the dispute had \\"become a distraction\\" for the project, and that its end goal was enabling children to learn, while constructionism and the open source ethos was more of a means to that end. Charles Kane concurred, stating that anything which detracted from the ultimate goal of widespread distribution and use was counterproductive. = Bugs = The organization has been criticized for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays). On the software side, the Bitfrost security system has been known to deactivate improperly, rendering the laptop unusable until it is unlocked by support technicians with the proper keys. (This is a time-consuming process, and the problem often affects large numbers of laptops at the same time). The Sugar interface has been difficult for teachers to learn, and the mesh networking feature in the OLPC XO-1 was buggy and went mostly unused in the field. The OLPC XO-1 hardware lacks connectivity to external monitors or projectors, and teachers are not provided with software for remote assessment. As a result, students are unable to present their work to the whole class, and teachers must also assess students' work from the individual laptops. Teachers often find it difficult to use the keyboard and screen, which were designed with student use in mind. = Environmental impact = In 2005 and prior to the final design of the XO-1 hardware, OLPC received criticism because of concerns over the environmental and health impacts of hazardous materials found in most computers. The OLPC asserted that it aimed to use as many environmentally friendly materials as it could; that the laptop and all OLPC-supplied accessories would be fully compliant with the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS); and that the laptop would use an order of magnitude less power than the typical consumer netbooks available as of 2007 thus minimizing the environmental burden of power generation. The XO-1 delivered (starting in 2007) uses environmental friendly materials, complies with the EU's RoHS and uses between 0.25 and 6.5 watts in operation. According to the Green Electronics Council's Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, whose sole purpose is assessing and measuring the impact laptops have on the environment, the XO is not only non-toxic and fully recyclable, but it lasts longer, costs less, and is more energy efficient. The XO-1 is the first laptop to have been awarded an EPEAT Gold level rating. = Anonymity = Other discussions question whether OLPC laptops should be designed to promote anonymity or to facilitate government tracking of stolen laptops. A June 2008 New Scientist article critiqued Bitfrost's P_THEFT security option, which allows each laptop to be configured to transmit an individualized, non- repudiable digital signature to a central server at most once each day to remain functioning.  Distribution  At a primary school in Kigali, Rwanda in 2009, running Scratch The laptops are sold to governments, to be distributed through the ministries of education with the goal of distributing \\"one laptop per child\\". The laptops are given to students, similar to school uniforms and ultimately remain the property of the child. The operating system and software is localized to the languages of the participating countries. OLPC now also works directly with program sponsors from the public and private sectors to implement its educational program in entire schools and communities. As a non-profit organization, OLPC does require a source of funding for its program so that the laptops are given to students at no cost to child or to his/her family. = Early distributions = Approximately 500 developer boards (Alpha-1) were distributed in mid-2006; 875 working prototypes (Beta 1) were delivered in late 2006; 2400 Beta-2 machines were distributed at the end of February 2007; full-scale production started November 6, 2007. Around one million units were manufactured in 2008. = Give 1 Get 1 program = OLPC initially stated that no consumer version of the XO laptop was planned. The project, however, later established the laptopgiving.org website to accept direct donations and ran a \\"Give 1 Get 1\\" (G1G1) offer starting on November 12, 2007. The offer was initially scheduled to run for only two weeks, but was extended until December 31, 2007 to meet demand. With a donation of $399 (plus US$25 shipping cost) to the OLPC \\"Give 1 Get 1\\" program, donors received an XO-1 laptop of their own and OLPC sent another on their behalf to a child in a developing country. Shipments of \\"Get 1\\" laptops sent to donors were restricted to addresses within the United States, its territories, and Canada. Some 83,500 people participated in the program. Delivery of all of the G1G1 laptops was completed by April 19, 2008. Delays were blamed on order fulfillment and shipment issues both within OLPC and with the outside contractors hired to manage those aspects of the G1G1 program. OLE Nepal, One Laptop Per Child image from Nepal Between November 17 and December 31, 2008, a second G1G1 program was run through Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. This partnership was chosen specifically to solve the distribution issues of the G1G1 2007 program. The price to consumers was the same as in 2007, at US$399. The program aimed to be available worldwide. Laptops could be delivered in the US, in Canada and in more than 30 European countries, as well as in some Central and South American countries (Colombia, Haiti, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay), African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Madagascar, Rwanda) and Asian countries (Afghanistan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal). Despite this, the program sold only about 12,500 laptops and generated a mere $2.5 million, a 93 percent decline from the year before. OLPC no longer advertises direct to consumers, focusing instead on fundraising efforts. In 2011, they launched a new website designed by Pentagram and Upstatement. = Laptop shipments = The first of shipment OLPC machines in Cambridge, MA Children in a remote Cambodian school where a pilot laptop program has been in place since 2001 An OLPC class in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia , OLPC reports 'more than 3 million laptops' have been shipped.  Regional responses  = Uruguay = In October 2007, Uruguay placed an order for 100,000 laptops, making Uruguay the first country to purchase a full order of laptops. The first real, non-pilot deployment of the OLPC technology happened in Uruguay in December 2007. Since then, 200,000 more laptops have been ordered to cover all public school children between 6 and 12 years old. President Tabar√© V√°zquez of Uruguay presented the final laptop at a school in Montevideo on October 13, 2009. Over the last two years 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers have been involved, and has cost the state $260 (¬£159) per child, including maintenance costs, equipment repairs, training for the teachers and internet connection. The annual cost of maintaining the programme, including an information portal for pupils and teachers, will be US$21 (¬£13) per child. The country reportedly became the first in the world where every primary school child received a free laptop on October 13, 2009 as part of the Plan Ceibal (Education Connect). Unfortunately, even though roughly 35% of all OLPC computers went to Uruguay, a 2013 study by the Economics Institute (University of the Republic, Uruguay) of the Ceibal plan concluded that use of the laptops did not improve literacy and that the use of the laptops was mostly recreational, with only 4.1% of the laptops being used \\"all\\" or \\"most\\" days in 2012. The main conclusion was that the results showed no impact of the OLPC program on the test scores in reading and math.Gioia del Melo et al (August 1, 2013) \\" Exploring the Effects of the Plan Ceibal\\" = United States = Originally, OLPC announced the United States would not be part of the first-year effort. In 2008, Nicholas Negroponte said \\"OLPC America already has a director and a chairman and will likely be based in Washington, D.C.,\\" however such an organization was not set up. As of 2010, Birmingham, Alabama is the largest deployment in the US. Some said the changing economic landscape forced OLPC to adjust their distribution strategy. Negroponte cited patriotism, \\"building critical mass\\", and providing a means for children all over the world to communicate. = Artsakh = On January 26, 2012, prime minister Ara Harutyunyan and entrepreneur Eduardo Eurnekian signed a memorandum of understanding launching an OLPC program in Artsakh. The program is geared towards elementary schools throughout Artsakh. Eurnekian hopes to decrease the gap by giving the war-zoned region an opportunity to engage in a more solid education. The New York-based nonprofit, Armenian General Benevolent Union, is helping to undertake the responsibility by providing on- the-ground support. The government of Artsakh is enthusiastic and is working with OLPC to bring the program to fruition. = Nigeria = Lagos Analysis Corp., also called Lancor, a Lagos, US-based Nigerian-owned company, sued OLPC in the end of 2007 for $20 million, claiming that the computer's keyboard design was stolen from a Lancor patented device. OLPC responded by claiming that they had not sold any multi-lingual keyboards in the design claimed by Lancor, and that Lancor had misrepresented and concealed material facts before the court. In January 2008, the Nigerian Federal Court rejected OLPC motion to dismiss LANCOR's lawsuit and extended its injunction against OLPC distributing its XO Laptops in Nigeria. OLPC appealed the Court's decision, the Appeal is still pending in the Nigerian Federal Court of Appeals. In March 2008, OLPC filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts to stop LANCOR from suing it in the United States. In October 2008, MIT News magazine erroneously reported that the Middlesex Superior Court granted OLPC's motions to dismiss all of LANCOR's claims against OLPC, Nicholas Negroponte, and Quanta. On October 22, 2010 OLPC voluntarily moved the Massachusetts Court to dismiss its own lawsuit against LANCOR. In 2007, XO laptops in Nigeria were reported to contain pornographic material belonging to children participating in the OLPC Program. In response, OLPC Nigeria announced they would start equipping the machines with filters. = India = India's Ministry of Human Resource Development, in June 2006, rejected the initiative, saying \\"it would be impossible to justify an expenditure of this scale on a debatable scheme when public funds continue to be in inadequate supply for well-established needs listed in different policy documents\\". Later they stated plans to make laptops at $10 each for schoolchildren. Two designs submitted to the Ministry from a final year engineering student of Vellore Institute of Technology and a researcher from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in May 2007 reportedly describe a laptop that could be produced for \\"$47 per laptop\\" for even small volumes. The Ministry announced in July 2008 that the cost of their proposed \\"$10 laptop\\" would in fact be $100 by the time the laptop became available. In 2010, a related $35 Sakshat Tablet was unveiled in India, released the next year as the \\"Aakash\\". In 2011, each Aakash sold for approximately $44 by an Indian company, DataWind. DataWind plans to launch similar projects in Brazil, Egypt, Panama, Thailand and Turkey. OLPC later expressed support for the initiative. In 2009, a number of states announced plans to order OLPCs. However, as of 2010, only the state of Manipur had deployed 1000 laptops.

By May 2001, Grupo Vista Alegre joined with the Atlantis group and created the largest national tableware Group and the sixth in the world in this speciality: the Grupo Vista Alegre Atlantis. Fabrica de Porcelana Vista Alegre, with its historical background and tradition is the most representative industrial unit of the eleven ones of the Group, producing around 10 million pieces a year, in decorative and domestic porcelain. In 2002 it finished an industrial re-engineering process to increase both its capacity and production volume. An integration project was also under way for the two porcelain production centres of the Group, (FPVA and Chousa Nova). History Influenced by the success of the Marinha Grande glass factory, Pinto Basto decided to create a ‚Äúporcelain, glass and chemical processes‚Äù factory. He started, in 1815, by acquiring the mansion Quinta da Ermida, a beautiful place near √çlhavo town and by the Aveiro estuary, in a region rich in the essential manufacturing elements of porcelain and glass, such as fuels, clay, white and thin sands and crystallized pebbles. Later on he also bought the surrounding 100 acre (0.4 km¬≤) premises, where he launched his project. The patent authorising the operation of the Vista Alegre Factory was granted in 1824 by King D. Jo√£o VI, benefiting of ‚Äúall graces, privileges and exceptions enjoyed, or to be enjoyed in the future, by the National Factories‚Äù. The, just five years later, Vista Alegre was granted the title of Royal Factory, to honor its art and industrial success. From 1832 on, the Factory intensified its work and concentrated on perfecting porcelain, reaching a golden period that culminated late in the 19th century. The contribution from foreign artists such as Victor C. Rousseau was important, mainly for the creation of a painting school. There were very relevant facts during this period of Vista Alegre's history such as the development of a social work; the introduction of golden decorations, landscape motifs and delicate flowers; the involvement in contests (Paris, Pal√°cio de Cristal in Porto) and, finally, in 1880, the end of glass production. During the following years and until the end of World War I, the brilliant previous period tarnished by social unrest led the firm to harsh difficulties. Nevertheless, the spirit bred by the founder as well as the support of the drawing and painting school by artist Duarte Jos√© de Magalh√£es boosted the reorganization and modernization of the firm. And so, Vista Alegre, while celebrating its first centennial, began restructuring itself that was a landmark in the company as it became an incorporated firm, updated the Factory's structures, inaugurated two stores and boosted the design workshops. As of 1947 and until 1968, the international contacts, the formation of specialized technical teams, the purchase of both Empresa Electro-Cer√¢mica (its main competitor so far) and Sociedade de Porcelanas, sent Vista Alegre on the technological development and industrial path, as well as opening new markets. By the 1970s, F√°brica de Porcelana de Vista Alegre took important measures to update its technological segment and enhanced the formation of new young painters. By 1983 it created the Artistical Orientation Board, GOA in Portuguese, as for Gabinete de Orienta√ß√£o Art√≠stica, and in 1985, the CADE - Centro de Arte e Desenvolvimento da Empresa, to encourage creativity and to contribute to the formation in the design, painting and sculpting areas, support the Factory technically and artistically by promoting its development. The company was bought by Visabeira in 2009.

But unlike her diaries and erotica, House of Incest does not detail the author's relationships with famous lovers like Henry Miller, nor does it contain graphic depiction of sex. Rather, House of Incest is a surrealistic look within the narrator's subconscious mind as she attempts to escape from a dream in which she is trapped, or in Nin's words, as she attempts to escape from \\"the woman's season in hell.\\"  Plot introduction  Nin's usage of the word incest in this case is metaphorical, not literal. In other words, in this book the word \\"incest\\" describes a selfish love where one can appreciate in another only that which is similar to oneself. One is then only loving oneself, shunning all differences. At first, such a self-love can seem ideal because it is without fear and without risk. But eventually it becomes a sterile nightmare. Toward the end of the book, the character called \\"the modern Christ\\" puts Nin's use of the word into context: ‚ÄúIf only we could all escape from this house of incest, where we only love ourselves in the other.\\" Nin was under the analysis of Otto Rank during the period of writing House of Incest. Rank was an early disciple of Freud, serving as the secretary and youngest member of his Vienna group, but had long since dissented from Freudian orthodoxy and developed his own theoretical school. Incest: From a Journal of Love\\"‚ÄîThe Unexpurgated Diary of Ana√Øs Nin (1932‚Äì1934) reveals that the two were also having an affair. Rank helped Ana√Øs edit House of Incest. He had experience with this topic, as Otto Rank's most famous book is The Trauma of Birth. House of Incest is largely an attempt by the narrator to cope with the shock of the trauma of birth. Ana√Øs Nin describes the process as akin to being \\"[e]jected from a paradise of soundlessness.... thrown up on a rock, the skeleton of a ship choked in its own sails.\\"  Literary significance & criticism  In Ana√Øs Nin: An Introduction, authors Duane Schneider and Benjamin Franklin V both argue that the basic theme of House of Incest is that ultimately life in the real world, which contains both pleasure and pain, is preferable to any self-created world that attempts to include only pleasure. Franklin and Schneider argue that a world consisting only of pleasure is ultimately a sterile world where intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth is not possible, and what results is stunted people. In this, they offer the passage from House of Incest wherein Ana√Øs Nin writes, \\"Worlds self-made and self-nourished are so full of ghosts and monsters.\\" = The prose of House of Incest = The prose of House of Incest is considered by many to be one of the major challenges of the work. The prose and tone of the work is not linear and does not utilize everyday language. Rather, the book is written in prose that is often described as either surrealist or symbolist. :\\"My first vision of earth was water veiled. I am of the race of men and women who see all things through this curtain of sea and my eyes are the color of water. I looked with chameleon eyes upon the changing face of the world, looked with anonymous vision upon my uncompleted self.\\" (Page 15) Duane Schneider and Benjamin Franklin V write that the prose of House of Incest is so challenging that it requires the total attention of the reader. ...  Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science  = Incest in the Nin family = As was eventually revealed in the 1990s when the unexpurgated versions of Ana√Øs Nin's diaries were published, Ana√Øs Nin claims to have had an incestuous relationship with her own father during her late 20s. It has been claimed that this incestuous relationship was encouraged by one of her therapists, who suggested that in retaliation for her father's abandonment of her during her childhood, Ana√Øs Nin should seduce her father in adulthood and then abandon him. In theory, this was supposed to leave Ana√Øs Nin feeling empowered. It has been written that at the time of the publication of \\"House of Incest,\\" which took place at around the same time that Ana√Øs Nin was having an incestuous relationship with her father, some members of the Nin family who knew about the incestuous relationship were \\"horrified\\" to know that Ana√Øs Nin was writing a book with this title. They assumed that the book was going to be an expos√© on the father/daughter incestuous relationship. As has been discussed above, the \\"incest\\" referred to in the book is largely a metaphor for a type of self-love or obsession with what is the same or similar to oneself. However, Nin's relationship with her father is present in some instances, such as: :\\"Stumbling from room to room I came into the room of paintings, and there sat Lot with his hand upon his daughter's breast while the city burned behind them, cracking open and falling into the sea.\\" (Page 52) The book itself, and its meanings as well as subtleties, are derived directly from the experiences shared between herself and her father. The sameness and feeling of love for each other were in actuality the facades of a love which reflected only themselves and their similarities. Her use of the word \\"incest\\" is not only metaphorical in the sense that it describes such an inter-relationship between states, but between psychological aspects as well as the obviously physical interactions they may contain. = Love in Incest = Other sources claim Nin's writings in House of Incest are a symbolic representation of the passionate love affair between Nin and Henry Miller, a continuation of Henry and June: :\\"In her published fiction ... Ana√Øs Nin could disguise biographical facts, the truth told as a \\"fairy tale\\"--as she clued in readers of her first book of poetic prose, House of Incest\\"  Trivia  * In the documentary film Ana√Øs Observed (1973) by Robert Snyder, Nin says House of Incest was based on dreams she'd had for more than a year.

Leslie and his two brothers (Walter and George) were the first to settle on the Darling Downs, and he was the first person to buy land in Warwick. Early life Patrick Leslie sculpture Partick Leslie was born in Warthill, also known as Meikle Wartle Meikle Wartle is located at in Aberdeenshire on 25 September 1815. He was the second son of William and Jane Leslie. His father was the 8th Laird of Folla and 9th Laird of Warthill, JP, DL, 27th in line of descent from the 1st Baron of Balquhain. The Leslies were members of the Church of Scotland. In December 1834, Leslie left London as a passenger aboard the convict transport Emma Eugenia, arriving in Sydney in May 1835. By 1836 he was managing Collaroi, a property owned by his uncle, Walter Stevenson Davidson, in the Cassilis district of New South Wales. Later on he rented Dunheved farm at Penrith. Leslie was a poor manager however, and his activities drew criticism from his uncle, who was forced to sell the property to his relations, E. W. T. Hamilton and George Clive, by 1840. Leslie was left deeply in debt to Davidson as a result of this episode. When his brothers Walter and George arrived in the colony, Patrick decided to look for new land to the north. Activity on the Darling Downs In 1840 Patrick Leslie started with stock from a New England station, then the most northerly settled district in New South Wales, and squatted Toolburra and Canning Downs (at ), the first stations on the Condamine River, before the river had been identified as a tributary of the Darling River. Leslie met explorer Allan Cunningham at the home of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur in Parramatta. In 1840 Leslie, accompanied by a convict named Peter Murphy, followed in the footsteps of the explorer. On the return trip to Sydney he marked a trail by cutting into the trees. This became known as \\"Leslie‚Äôs marked tree line\\". Plaque near Toolburra On his return to Sydney Leslie married Catherine (Kate), daughter of Hannibal Hawkins Macarthur, at Parramatta on 9 September 1840. His best man at the wedding was Stuart Donaldson. On 2 July 1840, the first head station was established by Walter Leslie at Toolburra. Walter and George Leslie then set about building a residence at Canning Downs. Although the three Leslie brothers claimed all the land to the head of the Condamine River, including its tributaries, they were forced to give up most of the claim to new arrivals because of the requirement that all land claimed had to be adequately stocked. thumb In 1841 Leslie and his wife traveled from Sydney to Brisbane aboard the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company steamer, Shamrock. They were then counted as the first family to make the journey from Brisbane to the Darling Downs. By 1841 the Leslies had sold their interest in 'Toolburra' and moved to 'Canning Downs' which was managed by George and Walter Leslie. When the Leslies first settled on Canning Downs, they had 6000 sheep, two teams of bullocks and drays, one team of horses and a dray, 10 saddle horses, and 22 convict employees. The task of building up the property during a time of depression proved too difficult and Patrick Leslie was ruined financially by 1844. In 1845 Leslie acquired 14 hectares of land in his father's name on the banks of Breakfast Creek, Brisbane and built Newstead House (), where he lived while pasturing flocks at Canning Downs. In 1846 he acquired 'Goomburra' on the Darling Downs. Newstead House was sold to his brother-in-law, John Clements Wickham, the following year.The Leslie Sculptures, Leslie Dam near Warwick. In 1847 the New South Wales Government asked Leslie to select a site for a town on Canning Downs station. It was to be known as Canningtown, the local Aborigines knew the area as Gooragooby, but the name Warwick was eventually chosen. At the first land sale in Warwick 1848 Patrick Leslie bought the first allotment. Today much of the water supply for city of Warwick is drawn from Leslie Dam, and larger than life granite sculptures of and Patrick and Catherine Leslie are located in a park adjacent to the dam wall. In 1851, Leslie also bought nearby Gladfield Station. In 1854 after selling Goomburra to Robert Tooth, Leslie left Australia with his wife and son and returned to Britain. Politics Leslie was elected as member of the NSW Legislative Assembly for the seat of Moreton, Wide Bay, Burnett and Maranoa from 19 November to 19 December 1857, when the parliament was dissolved. Leslie did not contest the 1858 election. New Zealand Patrick Leslie and his family moved to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on 20 October 1868. He purchased land in Waikato, where he established a productive farm and sheep stud at Wartle, just south of Hamilton, on New Zealand's North Island. He sold his New Zealand holdings due to failing health in 1879, returning to Australia in his retirement. Retirement and death In 1879 he retired to Milson's Point, Sydney, where he died on 12 August 1881 following a short illness. He was buried in plot 799 at St Thomas‚Äô Anglican Church Cemetery in West Street, Crows Nest, Sydney. Leslie was survived by his wife, Catherine and four grandchildren. Legacy Leslie centenary memorial gates, 2015 The Leslie brothers are memorialised by a set of gates to Leslie Park in Warwick on the corner of Fitzroy and Guy Streets. These gates were taken from the Glengallan Homestead and re-erected in the Park to commemorate the centenary of the Leslie brothers establishing Canning Downs pastoral run.

It has taken place annually in Nova Scotia's capital, Halifax since 1979. It is currently held in the Halifax Scotiabank Centre. Background 2015 Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo. The Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo is unique among other Tattoos in the world in that it is more theatrical in nature with a mixture of both military and civilian performers. It takes place in the Halifax Metro Centre's hockey arena, a venue that, to some degree, resembles a traditional theatre in the round. The show is heavily costumed and intensively rehearsed with technical staff, choreographers, assistant directors, wardrobe staff and designers as part of the production team, which also sets it apart from traditional Tattoos. A recurring theme of Bond of Friendship is woven into the Nova Scotia Tattoo each year that is intended to confirm and to build international relationships. Additional themes, usually connected with military anniversaries, are added each year. The show has been seen by well over 2,000,000 spectators and has hosted tens of thousands of performers from 21 countries. In terms of annual economic impact, it generates tens of millions for the Province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality. The Tattoo is presented by the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo Society, which is supported by subsidies and in-kind support from the Government of Canada, the Province of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Halifax Regional Municipality and the Corporate Community. Run mainly by volunteers, the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo is a registered charity of Canada. History The word Tattoo is derived from Dutch doe den tap toe (translated to turn off the taps). In 17th century Dutch villages when British soldiers were required back at their barracks, a drummer would march through the streets playing the drumbeat doe den tap toe. While the first Nova Scotia Tattoo actually took place in 1979, the event that had the greatest impact on the Nova Scotia Tattoo was the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo. As part of the Centennial Celebrations, the 1967 Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo was the largest touring show ever presented in the world. Beginning in the summer of 1967, when it was part of Canada's centennial celebrations, the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo made stops in Victoria, Vancouver, Hamilton, Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal. The tour continued for a total of eight months. An officer with the Black Watch, Ian Fraser, had had experience working on Tattoos because of the Soldiers of the Queen production that had been put together in 1959 at Gagetown, NB. Fraser was called to Ottawa from the Staff College in India in order to produce the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo. From that successful show, Fraser was once again called upon in 1979 to mark the visit to Nova Scotia of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother by organizing a Tattoo for the International Gathering of the Clans. This would be the first time the International Gathering of the Clans would take place outside Scotland. Fraser was commanded to organize the show in six months. After the 1979 debut, the provincial government established the Nova Scotia Tattoo as a permanent tourist attraction. This show evolved into a cultural fixture and economically important nine-day production; a mainstay in the Halifax Regional Municipality. In recognition of how much the 1979 show had evolved on an international level, in 1988 the name was formally changed to The Nova Scotia International Tattoo. On May 4, 2006, it was announced that the Tattoo had received the designation \\"Royal\\" from Queen Elizabeth II. The announcement was made at Government House in Nova Scotia by Lieutenant-Governor Myra Freeman.Nova Scotia News - TheChronicleHerald.ca Controversy Tattoo organizers ignited a controversy in 2010 when Queen Elizabeth II canceled a special Royal Tour appearance at the Tattoo because the event organizers, citing safety reasons, refused to allow her to climb up a set of steps on the Tattoo stage.

She was a victim of judicial murder, convicted and executed by the nation's Communist Party on fabricated charges of conspiracy and treason. Many prominent figures in the West, including Albert Einstein, Vincent Auriol and Winston Churchill, petitioned for her life. She was executed at Prague's Pankr√°c Prison using a primitive variant of execution by hanging. She died after being strangled for more than 13 minutes. Her remains were never found. Her conviction was annulled in 1968. She was fully rehabilitated in the 1990s and posthumously received the Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk (1st Class) and Order of the White Double Cross (1st Class). Early life Dr Hor√°kov√° was born Milada Kr√°lov√° in Prague. At the age of 17, in the last year of the First World War, she was expelled from school for participating in an anti-war demonstration. She completed her secondary education in the newly formed Czechoslovakia and went on to study law at Charles University, graduating in 1926. Her early political life was influenced by senator Franti≈°ka Plam√≠nkov√°, the founder of Women's National Council. Hor√°kov√° married her husband Bohuslav Hor√°k in 1927. Their daughter, Jana, was born in 1933. From 1927 to 1940 she was employed in the social welfare department of the Prague city authority.

Together with her husband, she was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo in 1940, in her case because of her pre-war political activity. She was sent to the concentration camp at Terez√≠n and then to various prisons in Germany. In the summer of 1944, Hor√°kov√° appeared before a court in Dresden.

She became a member of the Provisional National Assembly. In 1946, she won a seat in the elected National Assembly representing the region of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in southern Bohemia. Her political activities again focused on enhancing the role of women in society and preserving Czechoslovakia's democratic institutions. Shortly after the Communist coup in February 1948, she resigned from the parliament in protest. Unlike many of her political associates, Hor√°kov√° chose not to leave Czechoslovakia for the West, and continued to be politically active in Prague. On 27 September 1949, she was arrested and accused of being the leader of an alleged plot to overthrow the Communist regime.\\"Milada Hor√°kov√°\\" Radio Praha (Accessed 14 November 2017) Trial and execution Before facing trial, Hor√°kov√° and her co-defendants were subjected to intensive interrogation by the StB, the Czechoslovak state security organ, using both physical and psychological torture. She was accused of leading a conspiracy to commit treason and espionage at the behest of the United States, Great Britain, France and Yugoslavia. Evidence of the alleged conspiracy included Hor√°kov√°'s presence at a meeting of political figures from the National Socialist, Social Democrat, and People's parties, in September 1948, held to discuss their response to the new political situation in Czechoslovakia. She was also accused of maintaining contacts with Czechoslovak political figures in exile in the West. The trial of Hor√°kov√° and twelve of her colleagues began on 31 May 1950. It was intended to be a show trial, like those in the Soviet Great Purges of the 1930s. It was supervised by Soviet advisors and accompanied by a public campaign, organised by the Communist authorities, demanding the death penalty for the accused.

Born at Trawsfynydd, Meirionnydd, he was the second of the seven children of the village shoemaker, William Jones and his wife Catherine He was educated at the local school, then, with scholarships, proceeded to Friars School, Bangor and Christ College, Brecon. After that he attended Jesus College, Oxford, where he gained a first class degree in divinity in 1886, an MA and BD in 1907 and a DD in 1914. After curacies in Caernarfon and Welshpool, he became a forces chaplain. From 1890 to 1916 he served as chaplain to the Forces in many parts of the world, including six years in Malta and time in South Africa during the Boer War. He continued to study wherever he was stationed; in 1914 he was awarded a DD for his book, St Paul the Orator. On his return to Britain, he was offered the benefice of Rotherfield Peppard (Jesus College being the Patron of the benefice); he remained there until 1923 when he was appointed Principal of St David's University College, Lampeter. When he arrived, the college had less than 70 students, and he worked steadfastly to increase their number. Indeed, he has been described as acting as a one-man recruitment campaign. When he left in 1938, there were more than 200 students. Jones' involvement with higher education did not come to an end on his departure from Lampeter, for he was later external examiner for both Oxford and the University of Wales. He was also a Fellow of Jesus College. He was a member of the Gorsedd of Bards, with the bardic name of Meurig Prysor, and was treasurer of the Gorsedd from 1925 to 1938, when he was elected Gorsedd Bard. He was attendant druid from 1947 to 1957, and only narrowly missed election to become archdruid in 1955. In that same year, however, he was made a Fellow of the National Eisteddfod. He was also chairman of Cymdeithas Ceredigion Cerdd (The music and poetry society of Ceredigion) and Vice-President of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion. He was a sparkling preacher in both Welsh and English.

Nin would later say she had begun the diary as a letter to her father, Cuban composer Joaqu√≠n Nin, who had abandoned the family a few years earlier. Over the years, the diary would become Nin's best friend and confidante. Despite the attempts of her mother, therapists Rene Allendy and Otto Rank, and writer Henry Miller, to break Nin of her dependence on the diary, she would continue to keep a diary up until her death in 1977. As early as the 1930s Nin had sought to have the diary published. Due to its size (in 1966, the diary contained more than 15,000 typewritten pages in some 150 volumes) and literary style, she would not find a publisher until 1966, when the first volume of her diary would be published, covering the years 1931‚Äì1934 in her life. The published version of her diary would be very popular among young women, making Nin a feminist icon in the 1960s. Six more volumes of her diary would follow. Expurgated diaries The series of published diaries that made their appearance starting in 1966 are now sometimes referred to as the \\"expurgated\\" editions. This is because in 1986, Rupert Pole, Nin's widower and literary executor, began to publish what are now termed the \\"unexpurgated\\" versions of the diary. The \\"unexpurgated\\" versions of the diaries are more sexually frank than the versions published in the 1960s and 1970s. The expurgated editions were published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. =Volume I (1931‚Äì1934)= Marjorie Ana√Øs Housepian Dobkin in a first edition of the original volume First published in 1966, it depicts Nin living in Louveciennes, just outside Paris, with her husband, banker Hugh Parker Guiler. Guiler's name is not once mentioned in this volume. Volume One covers the most important years of her relationship with Henry Miller. She has just published her study of D. H. Lawrence. Many of the early entries deal with Henry and his fascinating wife June. She discusses her psychoanalytic sessions with Rene Allendy and Otto Rank at length. During this period, her father re-enters her life. By the end of this volume, Henry has published Tropic of Cancer and she had completed House of Incest (published, 1936) and Winter of Artifice (published 1939). During his time, Henry Miller started to influence the writings published in Louveciennes in 1966. Nin's impression of Miller was rather startling, as she fell in contemplation of his literacy. =Volume II (1934‚Äì1939)= =Volume III (1939‚Äì1944)= =Volume IV (1944‚Äì1947)= =Volume V (1947‚Äì1955)= Volume V was published in 1974, describes her first trip to Acapulco, the beginning of her double life in Sierra Madre, California as well as in New York, the death of her mother and the progress of her feelings and career. Her love life, including the existence of both her husbands is still deleted. =Volume VI (1955‚Äì1966)= Volume VI was published in 1976, and was edited by Gunther Stuhlmann. It was dedicated to the team of doctors who saved her life in January 1975. It opens with her description of the aftereffects of having taken LSD, and closes with her mentioning the publication of Volume I of her diaries and her belated recognition as a writer. Other subjects include a debate with Aldous Huxley over psychedelics, a visit to the Brussels World's Fair of 1958, and working as an editor for the magazine Eve. She was a witness to the Caresse Crosby incident at Delphi.The Diary of Ana√Øs Nin: Volume VI 1955-1966, edited and with a preface by Gunther Stuhlmann. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1976) =Volume VII (1966‚Äì1974)= Unexpurgated diaries In 1986, Rupert Pole, Nin's surviving widower and literary executor of the bigamous diarist, began to publish what are now termed the \\"unexpurgated\\" versions of the diary. The \\"unexpurgated\\" versions of the diaries are more sexually frank than the versions published in the 1960s and 1970s. The unexpurgated editions were published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and by Swallow Press, an imprint of Ohio University Press that was the original US publisher of Nin's work. =Henry and June: From \\"A Journal of Love\\" -The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932)= Henry and June spans a single year in Nin's life when she discovers love and torment in one insatiable couple. From late 1931 to the end of 1932, Nin falls in love with Henry Miller's writing and his wife June's striking beauty. When June leaves Paris for New York, Henry and Nin begin a fiery affair that liberates her sexually and morally, but also undermines her marriage and eventually leads her into psychoanalysis. As she grapples with her own conscience, a single question dominates her thoughts: What will happen when June returns to Paris? An intimate account of one woman's sexual awakening, Henry and June exposes the pain and pleasure felt by a single person trapped between two loves. =Incest: From \\"A Journal of Love\\" -The Unexpurgated Diary of Ana√Øs Nin (1932-1934)= Published in 1993, This is the continuation of the story begun in Henry and June, exposing the shattering psychological drama that drove Nin to seek absolution from her psychoanalysts for the ultimate transgression. This portion of Nin's diary, which was cut from the expurgated editions published in her lifetime, records her steamy love affair with Henry Miller in Paris, but here her intense adoration gives way to disillusionment. She describes Miller as crude, egotistic, imitative, childishly irresponsible, \\"a madman.\\" Her real focus, however, is her father, Joaquin Nin, a Spanish pianist and aristocratic Don Juan who seduced her after a 20-year absence. Her graphic account of their lovemaking and of her incestuous romantic feelings is fairly shocking. Nin sought absolution from her psychiatrist and lover, Otto Rank, who advised her to bed her father, then dump him as punishment for abandoning her when she was 10. Nin's ornate, hothouse prose is much rawer than the chiseled style of the expurgated diaries. She seethes with jealousy at Miller's wife June, swoons over poet and actor Antonin Artaud, neglects her protective husband, Hugh Guiler, and describes her traumatic delivery of a stillborn child. Her extraordinary, tangled self-analysis is a disarming record of her emotional and creative growth. =Fire: From \\"A Journal of Love\\" The Unexpurgated Diary of Ana√Øs Nin, 1934-1937= The third volume of Nin's provocative and provoking uncensored diaries, published in 1996, finds our madly scribbling femme fatale in New York, where she's gone to get away from her doggedly loyal husband and from adored lover Henry Miller and indulge her fancy for analyst Otto Rank. Once again, Nin is blithely honest about her profound dishonesty, admitting that she loves telling \\"marvelous lies\\" to the men who desire her. She tires of Rank just as Miller and her husband catch up with her, then, suddenly, enters a whole new realm of potent romance with a fiery man of Inca descent, Gonzalo More. More, a man of conscience and lyrical intensity, inspires Nin to new poetic and mystical heights. These unexpurgated volumes are of particular interest to readers of the original published versions because they fill in so many puzzling omissions, but they are also remarkable for their audacity and prolificity. Just one page of Nin's extraordinary diaries contains more sex, melodrama, fantasies, confessions, and observations than most novels, and reflects much about the human psyche we strive to repress. =Nearer the Moon: From a Journal of Love : The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1937-1939= Published in 1996, one would hardly know that in this part of her diaries Nin was living in a France on the brink of war. \\"I dream, I kiss, I have orgasms, I get exalted, I leave the world, I float, I cook, I sew, I have nightmares, I follow a gigantic creative plan,\\" she claims. Her self-description says it all. Here Nin often pauses to improve upon life, which in the two years, spent mostly in Paris, covered in this volume, consisted largely of cadging from her complaisant banker husband, Hugh Guiler, to support her lovers. One was the gaunt, bald sexual athlete and expatriate novelist, Henry Miller, who by then had parted from his wife, June. Another was the swarthy Communist activist Gonzalo More, whose appetite for sex overwhelmed his passion for politics, and whose wife, Helba Huara encouraged his income-producing infidelity. Nin betrayed all three men, even on days (and nights) when she bedded them all. In her middle 30s, her erotomania left her little time for much else, but she managed to write pornographic (and then censorable) short fiction and reams of what later skeptics called a \\"liary.\\" She was \\"a true Catholic,\\" More told her. \\"You love the sin and absolution and regrets and sinning again.\\" Yet she had few regrets but the unpublishability of her diaries. At the outbreak of World War II she leaves for America. She will never live in Paris again. =Mirages: The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin, 1939-1947= Mirages, published in 2013 by Swallow Press, opens at the dawn of World War II, when Nin fled Paris, where she had lived for fifteen years with her husband, banker Hugh Guiler, and ends in 1947 when she meets Rupert Pole, the man who would be ‚Äúthe One,‚Äù the lover who would satisfy her insatiable hunger for connection. In the middle looms a period Nin describes as ‚Äúhell,‚Äù during which she experiences a kind of erotic madness, a delirium that fuels her search for love. At times desperate and suicidal, Nin finds life more fulfilling when it conforms to her dreams‚Äîa series of mirages she conjures to avoid reality, the horrors of war, and an America she finds abysmally immature. Often in a state of semi-delirium where she finds herself drowning in her unconscious, she writes that she needs love so abnormally that it all seems natural to keep several relationships going at once, all the one and the same love. Her lovers included Henry Miller, 17-year-old Bill Pinckard, Edmund Wilson, and dozens of others, including an emotionally charged, but physically unfulfilled, relationship with Gore Vidal. As a child suffering abandonment by her father, Nin wrote, ‚ÄúClose your eyes to the ugly things,‚Äù and, against a horrifying backdrop of war and death, Nin combats the world‚Äôs darkness with her own search for light. Mirages collects, for the first time, the story that was cut from all of Nin‚Äôs other published diaries, particularly volumes 3 and 4 of The Diary of Ana√Øs Nin, which cover the same time period. Mirages answers the questions Nin readers have been asking for decades: What led to the demise of Nin‚Äôs love affair with Henry Miller? Just how troubled was her marriage to Hugh Guiler? What is the story behind Nin‚Äôs ‚Äúchildren,‚Äù the effeminate young men she seemed to collect at will? Mirages is a deeply personal story of heartbreak, despair, desperation, carnage, and deep mourning, but it is also one of courage, persistence, evolution, and redemption that reaches beyond the personal to the universal. =Trapeze: The Unexpurgated Diary of Ana√Øs Nin, 1947‚Äì1955= Trapeze, (2017, Swallow Press), marks the start of what Nin came to call her ‚Äútrapeze life,‚Äù swinging between her longtime husband, Hugh Guiler, in New York and her lover, Rupert Pole, in California, a perilous lifestyle she continued until her death in 1977. Today what Nin did seems impossible, and what she sought perhaps was impossible: to find harmony and completeness within a split existence. It is a story of daring and genius, love and pain, largely unknown until now.

Hyperdescent is the opposite of hypodescent (the practice of classifying a child of mixed race ancestry in the more socially subordinate parental race). Both hyperdescent and hypodescent vary from, and may not be mutually exclusive with, other methods of determining lineage, such as patrilineality and matrilineality.  Examples  = Australia = Until well into the 20th century, Australian state and federal governments engaged in a program of forcibly separating Aboriginal children with white ancestry from their Aboriginal families, and raising them in institutions that were intended to prepare them for white foster homes, jobs under white employers and/or marriage to whites. This occurred according to theories of hyperdescent that were popular among white people. These ideas were not usually shared by Aboriginal people. White politicians and officials utilised pseudo-scientific theories that Aboriginal people were genetically and culturally inferior to whites, and were becoming extinct. These authorities believed that it was therefore improper for part-white children to live as Aboriginal people. It was also widely believed that if Aboriginal people whose descendants had children with whites for several generations, successive generations of descendants would be less and less distinguishable from whites. In Australia, while there were many racist laws intended to keep Aboriginal people in a socially inferior position, there were no anti- miscegenation laws and hence no barriers to marriages between Aboriginal and white partners.Doris Pilkington & Nugi Garimara, Follow the Rabbit-proof Fence, University of Queensland Press, 1996 (republished as Rabbit-proof Fence in 2002 and 2004)[Australian] Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's \\"Bringing Them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families \\" (1997) = Latin America =  Brazil  Brazil is an example of a country with a history of European slavery of black Africans somewhat analogous to that of the United States of America. However, in the United States, hypodescent was applied, gradually classifying anyone with African American ancestry as black, specifically in one-drop rule laws passed in Virginia and other states in the 20th century. In Brazil, by contrast, people of mixed race who were fair- skinned or were educated and of higher economic classes were accepted into the elite. Thomas E. Skidmore, in Black into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought explains that many of the Brazilian elite encouraged a national process of \\"whitening\\" through miscegenation. Skidmore writes (p. 55): \\"In fact, miscegenation did not arouse the instinctive opposition of the white elite in Brazil. On the contrary, it was a well-recognized (and tacitly condoned) process by which a few mixed bloods (almost invariably light mulattoes) had risen to the top of the social and political hierarchy.\\"  Hispanic America  Hyperdescent is the rule in the rest of Latin America as well. The mestizo populations of Latin America usually consider themselves to be of European culture rather than American Indian. This is also apparent in the United States, where the practice of hypodescent is the rule among the non-Hispanic population contrasting with hyperdescent among Hispanics. Nearly half of U.S. Hispanics called themselves \\"white\\" in the 2000 Census, along with 80% of the population of Puerto Rico. Non-Hispanics, on the other hand, if they are of mixed race, will usually call themselves white only if they are a small fraction (1/8 or 1/16) American Indian, but otherwise will claim being of mixed race or even of the minority race. In the 2000 Census, of 35,305,818 Hispanics, only 407,073 (or just over 1%) called themselves American Indian, and only 2,224,082 (just over 6%) claimed to be of mixed race, even though these Hispanic groups (such as Mexicans) are majority mestizo in their home countries. About 41.2% of U.S. Hispanics identify as \\"Some other race\\" as of 2006, but government agencies which do not recognize \\"Some other race\\" (such as the FBI, the CDC, and the NCHS) include this group, and therefore over 90% of Hispanics, within the white population. In such cases, such as with the NCHS, separate statistics are often kept for \\"White\\" (which includes whites and over 90% of Hispanics) and \\"non-Hispanic white\\". = Iceland = Another example of hyperdescent is in Iceland, which was initially populated by Norsemen, who took with them slaves from Ireland, Scotland and the Ancient Britons, including some women. Modern Icelanders are considered to be a Scandinavian people ethnically, although many of the founding generations were Irish, Scots, or English women.

It achieved world-wide popularity in the 1920s after the breed broke numerous world records for number of eggs laid and has been a popular breed in the western world since. It is one of eight poultry breeds created in Australia and recognised by the Australian Poultry Standards. The most popular colour of the breed is black, which is the only colour recognised in the United States of America, but blue and white are also recognised in Australia and the Poultry Club South Africa recognises buff, splash, wheaten laced and golden in addition. History Black hen The original stock used in the development of the Australorp was imported to Australia from England out of the Black Orpington yards of William Cook and Joseph Partington in the period from 1890 to the early 1900s with Rhode Island Red. Local breeders used this stock together with judicious out-crossings of Minorca, White Leghorn and Langshan blood to improve the utility features of the imported Orpingtons. There is even a report of some Plymouth Rock blood also being used. The emphasis of the early breeders was on utility features. At this time, the resulting birds were known as Australian Black Orpingtons (Austral-orp). The origin of the name \\"Australorp\\" seems to be shrouded in as much controversy as the attempts to obtain agreement between the States over a suitable national Standard. The earliest claim to the name was made by one of poultry fancy's institutions, Wiliam Wallace Scott, before the First World War. From 1925 Wal Scott set to work to have Australorp recognised as a breed with the Poultry Society as he developed the breed. Equally as persuasive a claim came in 1919 from Arthur Harwood who suggested that the \\"Australian Laying Orpingtons\\" be named \\"Australs\\". The letters \\"orp\\" were suggested as a suffix to denote the major breed in the fowl's development. A further overseas claim to the name came from Britain's W. Powell-Owen who drafted the British Standard for the breed in 1921 following the importation of the \\"Australian Utility Black Orpingtons.\\" It is certain that the name \\"Australorp\\" was being used in the early 1920s when the breed was launched internationally. In 1929, the Australorp was admitted to the Standard of Perfection.  Characteristics  White cock bird There are both bantam and standard sized Australorps. The Australorp has three recognised colours according to the Australian Poultry Standard: black, white and blue. White Australorps have been recorded since 1949 but they were only recognised in the 2nd Edition of the Australian Poultry Standards in 2011. South Africa recognises further colours; buff, splash, wheaten laced and golden. Eggs Three-day-old chick It was the egg- laying performance of Australorps that attracted world attention when in 1922-23 a team of six hens set a world record by laying 1857 eggs for an average of 309.5 eggs per hen during a 365 consecutive day trial. These figures were achieved without the lighting regimens of the modern intensive shed. Such performances had importation orders flooding in from England, United States of America, South Africa, Canada and Mexico. Well looked after Australorps lay approximately 250 light-brown eggs per year. A new record was set when a hen laid 364 eggs in 365 days.

Alexander was of the Court of King James II, while on his expedition to the south country against James, 9th and last Earl of Douglas. On 18 July 1452, he went into the tent of Lord Chancellor of Scotland (Crichton), where he resigned into the King's hands his lands in Ayr including Kilmaurs, as well as the sheriffdom of Ayr, and the lands of Kilmarnock in Stirling, Finlaystone in Renfrew, Glencairn in Dumfries, and Hilton in Berwick. After a pause, King James II regranted and gave the said lands to Alexander and his heirs. In 1458 Alexander acted as Bailie of Cunningham in 1458. Alexander was subsequently accused of having dealings with the traitor Earl of Douglas, and on 13 January 1464, he complained to the King in Parliament that there was a rumor that he had assisted James of Douglas, notwithstanding a letter of February 8, 1463, from the King James III declaring him innocent. He then offered purgation by a court of his peers, by the purgation of 100 knights and esquires, or to defend himself according to the laws of arms. Parliament declared him innocent. That is the first reference to Alexander as Lord Kilmaurs, a dignity to which he had been raised between 8 February 1463, the date of the royal letter, where he is styled Alexander Cunynghame, Lord of Kilmaurs, and 13 January 1464, when as Lord Kilmaurs he complained in Parliament. On 15 October 1464, Alexander witnessed a charter ' Alexander Dominus Kilmaurs. On 13 January 1478, he had a charter as Alexander Dominus de Kilmaweris of his lands of Drips, in the lordship of Kilbride, Lanark. Alexander sat continually in Parliament as Lord Kilmaurs from 1464 to 1488. In 1488 a great part of the Scottish nobles rebelled against King James III, on 2 February 1488, the prince his son, then about sixteen years of age, left Stirling Castle and joined the rebels. Alexander, Lord Kilmaurs, who was then very powerful, brought his forces to aid the King's party and assisted in the defeat of the rebels at Battle Blackness. For his service, and as a mark of Royal favor, Alexander Cuninghame, Lord Kilmaurs was, on 28 May 1488, advanced to the dignity of Earl of Glencairn by royal charter, in which he is designated Alexander, Earl of Glencairn and Lord Kilmaurs. The words used are 'facimus et creamus eundem nostrum consanguineum Comitem in exaltationem sui honoris, perpetuis futuris temporibus Comitem de Glencairn et Dominum de Kilmauris nuncupandum.' https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun04pauluoft#page/232/mode/2up In support of this honor, the King James III, by the same deed, granted Alexander, Earl of Glencairn thirty-pound lands of Drummond and the ten-pound lands of Duchray, in the Earldom of Lennox, to be held by the Earl and his heirs and successors forever. Alter the battle of Blackness a proposal was made for a treaty between the opposite parties, and articles were drawn up for that purpose. These articles were not observed. The prince's party accused the King and others of having entered into a treaty with England. The war broke out again, and on 11 June 1488, during the Battle of Sauchieburn near Stirling, Alexander Cuninghame, Earl of Glencairn was killed.

During the next three years he travelled in the southern Urals, collecting specimens and sending them to Hinrich Lichtenstein at the university of Berlin. Eversmann had for a long time planned to travel into central Asia to collect natural history specimens. He had studied the languages, customs and Muslim religion of the peoples of the area. In 1820 he set of for Bukhara disguised as a merchant, a journey he described in Reise Orenburg nach Buchara (1823), with a natural history appendix by Lichtenstein. In 1825 he travelled with a military expedition to Khiva. In 1828 he was appointed professor of zoology and botany at the university of Kazan. During the next thirty years he wrote numerous publications and is considered the pioneer of research into the flora and fauna of the southeast steppes of Russia between the Volga and the Urals. His name is commemorated in a number of birds, such as Eversmann's redstart,Eversmann's Redstart butterflies, including Eversmann's parnassian and moths, such as Eversmann's rustic.

Diard studied zoology and anatomy under Georges Cuvier and assisted him in researches on the development of the foetus and on the eggs of quadrupeds. In 1816, he traveled to the East Indies.Deleuze, J. P. F. (1823) History and description of the Royal Museum of Natural History, published by order of the administration of that establishment (Volume 2) Paris, A. Royer  Journeys in South and Southeast Asia  In May 1818, he met Alfred Duvaucel in Calcutta. Together, they moved to Chandernagore, then a trading post of the French East India Company, and started collecting animals and plants for the Paris Museum of Natural History. They employed hunters who supplied them daily with live and dead specimens, which they described, drew and classified. They also received objects from local rajahs and went hunting themselves. In the garden of their compound, they cultivated local plants and kept water birds in a basin. In June 1818, they sent their first consignment to Paris, containing a skeleton of a Ganges river dolphin, a head of a Tibetan ox, various species of little known birds, some mineral samples and a drawing of a tapir from Sumatra that they had studied in Hastings menagerie. Later consignments included a live Cashmere goat, crested pheasants and various birds. In December 1818, Thomas Stamford Raffles invited them to accompany him on his journeys and pursue their collections in places, where he would have to go officially. He offered to establish a menagerie in his Bencoulen residence. By end of December, they left with him on the basis that would equally share the collected animals. In Pulo-Pinang, they collected two new fish species and some birds. In Achem, they collected only a few plants, insects, birds, snakes, fish and two deer. In Malacca, they bought a bear, an argus and some other birds. In Singapore, they obtained a dugong, of which they prepared drawings and a description that Raffles sent to the Royal Society. These were published in 1820 by Everard Home and planned for publication in the Histoire naturelle des mammif√®res by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier. After their arrival at Bencoulen in August 1819, Raffles requisitioned most of their collection and left them copies of their drawings, descriptions and notes. Diard and Duvaucel took leave, sent their share to Calcutta and parted. Diard set off to Batavia. From Java, he sent a large consignment to Paris comprising 95 mammal species, 126 bird species, about 100 snake species including skeletons and skins of Malayan tapir and Javan rhinoceros. He proceeded to Borneo. By spring 1824, he was assumed to sojourn in Cochinchina. In 1826, he traveled and collected in the areas of Banjarmasin, Pontianak and Sungei Barito. In 1829, he joined the Natural History Commission of the Dutch Indies and was appointed its head in 1832.Das, I.

He collected a number of natural history specimens, some of which were sent back the Coenraad Jacob Temminck at Leiden. He also helped contribute with the early Roman Catholic missionaries in New France.  Publications  Common treeshrew (Tupaia glis) In February 1820, the Asiatick Society (Calcutta, India) published an article jointly written by Diard and Duvaucel entitled \\"Sur une nouvelle esp√®ce de Sorex ‚Äî Sorex Glis\\" including a drawing of a common treeshrew.Diard, P.M., Duvaucel, A.

Bengal Military Orphans Press, 1822  Legacy  The Paris Museum of Natural History received nearly 2000 animals collected jointly by Diard and Duvaucel during their stay of more than a year in the Greater Sunda Islands. Their consignments comprised 88 mammal species, 630 bird species, 59 reptile species and contained stuffed animals, skins, skeletons, drawings and descriptions of such notable species as the Malayan tapir, Sumatran rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, gibbons, leaf monkeys, two previously unknown fruit bat species, tree shrews, skunks, binturong and sun bear. Several of these species were first described by French zoologists working at the Museum. Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest described the Malayan tapir in 1819; the Sunda stink badger and Paradoxurus hermaphroditus bondar, a subspecies of the Asian palm civet in 1820; the Sunda pangolin, the Javan rhinoceros, the Malayan weasel, and the genus of Semnopithecus in 1822. In 1821, Raffles published descriptions of the species jointly collected by Diard and Duvaucel in Sumatra, including first descriptions of the sun bear, the binturong, the crab-eating macaque, the Sumatran surili, the siamang gibbon, the silvery lutung, the large bamboo rat, the large treeshrew and the cream-coloured giant squirrel. Coilodera diardi Diard collected the first specimen of the Borneo freshwater crocodile first described as Crocodylus raninus by Salomon M√ºller and Hermann Schlegel in 1844. Schlegel also first described several snake species collected by Diard in Borneo.

E. Muller, ‚ÄúAsynchronous logics and application to information processing,‚Äù Proc. Symp. Application of Switching Theory in Space Technology, H. Aiken and W. F. Main, Ed. , pp. 289-297, 1963. is an asynchronous design methodology making the least possible timing assumptions. Assuming only the quasi-delay-insensitive delay model the generated designs need little if any timing hazard testing. The basis for DIMS is the use of two wires to represent each bit of data. This is known as a dual-rail data encoding. Parts of the system communicate using the early four-phase asynchronous protocol. The construction of DIMS logic gates comprises generating every possible minterm using a row of C-elements and then gathering the outputs of these using OR gates which generate the true and false output signals. With two dual-rail inputs the gate would be composed of four two-input C-elements. A three input gate uses eight three-input C-elements. Latches are constructed using two C-elements to store the data and an OR gate to acknowledge the input once the data has been latched by attaching as its inputs the data output wires. The acknowledge from the forward stage is inverted and passed to the C-elements to allow them to reset once the computation has completed. This latch design is known as the 'half latch'. Other asynchronous latches provide a higher data capacity and levels of decoupling. DIMS designs are large and slow but they have the advantage of being very robust.

He was also the chief of Clan Cunningham. William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn, by follower of John Michael Wright The eldest son of William Cunningham, 8th Earl of Glencairn, on 21 July 1637 this William obtained a ratification from King Charles 1st, under the Royal Sign Manual, of the original Glencairn Letters Patent of 1488. He was sworn a member of the Privy Council of Scotland and in 1641 was appointed a Commissioner of the Treasury. Royalist The Earl supported the Royalist cause of his King, and in 1643 joined with the Duke of Hamilton and the Earls of Lanark and Roxburgh, in opposing the sending of a Scottish army into England to assist the English Parliamentary Army. For this loyalty he received a (now published) personal letter from the King. He was appointed Lord Justice General by parliament in 1646. He knew of and is said to have \\"entered heartily into\\" the attempted rescue of Charles I in 1648, and was subsequently deprived by parliament of this post on 15 February 1649, under the Act of Classes. The parliament, now being dominant, at the instance of the Public Prosecutor, then passed a Decreet, on 2 March 1650, annulling the original Glencairn Letters Patent of 1488. (This was rescinded at the Restoration). Glencairn then led an insurrection in the Highlands in 1653 (See: Royalist rising of 1651 to 1654) in favour of King Charles II, when General Monck had possession of Scotland. In January 1654 he was commissioned by Charles II to command the Royal forces in all of Scotland, numbering some 3,500 men, pending the arrival of General Middleton. The insurrection of that year is generally known as \\"Glencairn's rising\\", although he later handed his command to Middleton. About this time Glencairn and Lieutenant-General Sir George Munro, 1st of Newmore engaged in a duel with both pistols & swords two miles to the south of Dornoch. Munro had poured scorn on the quality of their forces and Glencairn had defended them, challenging Munro, who lost but was only wounded. Middleton initially placed the Earl under arrest, but the Earl left the army a fortnight later. He was then arrested by Monck in 1655, who later permitted him to return home. Glencairn was excepted from Cromwell's Act of Grace and Pardon. Restoration He was one of the peers whom Monck called to the Convention he summoned when he was about to march into England in 1659. It was at this Convention that Glencairn called for Monck to declare for a free parliament. Upon the Restoration Glencairn waited upon King Charles II at London, when he was again sworn a Privy Councillor and appointed Sheriff Principal of Ayrshire. On 19 January 1661, he was constituted Lord Chancellor of Scotland for life, upon the resignation of the Earl of Loudoun. Glencairn was Chancellor of the University of Glasgow from 1660, and was one of the principal advisors of the re-establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland. He was not, however, opposed to Presbyterianism, and the subsequent bitter disputes between the two religious factions, and particularly against James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews, greatly distressed him and affected his health. The Earl died at Belton, East Lothian, on 30 May 1663, aged 54 years. According to some sources he was buried, with great pomp, in the south-east aisle of St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, on 28 July following. He had a daughter, Margaret, who married in 1662, John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Bargany, a descendant of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran (1517‚Äì1575). According to other sources, he was/is not buried in St Giles Cathedral Edinburgh. It was not a burial Church but it does contain memorials of other celebrated Scots.

Under Tongan law, Fuaamotu International Airport is closed on Sundays ‚Äî only to be opened in distress, after the minister's approval. Air traffic control Fuaamotu is a total controlled aerodrome and all traffic are guided by air traffic control. The tower is contactable on 118.5, and Ground on 121.9.

Runway 11/29: (Elev 91 ft/28m) PCN 45 FBXT (Flexible pavement, medium subgrade strength, medium tyre pressure (), technical evaluation completed). Runway End Identifier Lights are installed at each end of the runway, as are T-VASI glidescope indicators. Low Intensity Runway Lighting is provided, and a simple Low Intensity Lighting Approach Lighting System is installed on Runway 11. Size restrictions Map of Fuaamotu International Airport. It is the strength of the runway rather than the length that restricts operations from Fuaamotu. Even a fully laden Boeing 767-300ER on a flexible pavement B strength, such as at this airport, requires a Pavement Classification Number (PCN) of 59, therefore is not allowed to takeoff with full load. The same can be said of a Boeing 747-400, which theoretically could take off and land at Fuaamotu length-wise, but needs a PCN of 66, and would therefore damage the runway severely in the process (A B747-400 weighs over twice as much as a B767-300ER).Boeing commercial aircraft specifications Access There is no public bus service to the airport, but several hostels and hotels in Nukualofa meet flights and taxis are available.

The station is owned by Kongsue Xiong, through licensee Asian American Broadcasting, LLC. On July 21, 2010, former owner Clear Channel Communications announced it would donate the station through the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council (MMTC)-Clear Channel Ownership Diversity Initiative. In September 2011, the station switched to an ethnic-based format catering to the local Hmong-American community.http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/129320233.html KFXN is essentially a daytime-only station, broadcasting at 500 watts, though it does have a four watt signal during nighttime hours with very limited reach. This is likely to protect CKGM in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The transmitter and three-tower antenna array are located in New Hope on Winnetka Avenue north of 36th Avenue. This has been the only transmitter location for the station since it signed on the air on April 5, 1962. In August 2009, KHTC (96.3 FM) relocated its transmission facilities from Watertown to the KFXN site. History The station signed on in 1962 with the KTCR call sign, and a country music format. In 1968, new owner Al Tedesco purchased a companion FM station, KWFM, renaming it KTCR-FM. In 1983, both stations were sold to John and Kathleen Parker, who gave the stations a makeover. The FM was changed to an adult album alternative/new-age music format as KTCZ-FM, and KTCR became jazz as KTCJ to complement 'Cities 97'. The AM's jazz format lasted several years and the station was among the early market adopters of AM stereo, but eventually ceded to a simulcast with KTCZ-FM. On April 17, 1997, KTCJ, the sole remaining AM simulcasting an FM in the market, switched to classic country music. The call letters were changed to KXBR (\\"The Bear\\") that December. Former Score 690 logo In December 1998, KXBR dropped country and became KFXN, a counterpart to sports-formatted sister KFAN 1130. The station was branded as \\"Score 690\\" airing a complementary sports talk format, which consisted mostly of syndicated shows from Fox Sports Radio and Sporting News Radio, as well as Jim Rome's nationally syndicated program, and repeats of KFAN's local shows. With its 2011 divestiture of KFXN and resulting format change by the new owner, Clear Channel moved the sports format of \\"The Score\\" to the HD2 subchannel of KTCZ-FM. The station was sold by MMTC to Asian American Broadcasting, LLC in a transaction that was consummated on May 5, 2014. The purchase price for the station was $255,000.

After he had completed his apprenticeship he returned to Wick and started his own shipbuilding yard in Pulteneytown, near Wick Harbour, where he built 56 or more vessels, ranging in size from 45 tons to 600 tons. At this time, he also became well known throughout the United Kingdom for his skills in rescuing sunken and stranded vessels. When there was an insurrection in Wick he treated the injuries of combatants from both sides and was tried for Sedition as a consequence. His peers found him Not Guilty and he was carried from the court on the shpoulders of the cheering local populace. 150px When, in 1846, Brunel's SS Great Britain went aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland, it is to his son, Alexander Bremner, that Brunel turned for help after various leading salvage experts had either declared the salvage impossible or had failed in an attempt. Alexander called in his father to develop a successful methodology. The method used by Bremner was later used to refloat her off a beach in South Georgia over a century later, after which she was brought back to her final resting place as a tourist attraction in Bristol. He frequently corresponded with Thomas Telford and was employed by Brunel as an engineering consultant when he built the Blackwall Tunnel under the Thames. His career involved the rescue of perhaps 236 or more stricken vessels. As well as building and rescuing ships, he worked on 19 harbour structures in Scotland, not least an extension to Telford's harbour in Wick Bay. He had watched Winter gales destroy harbour walls by lifting and working loose the hortizontally laid stones. When he rebuilt the walls he simply relaid them on their ends to eliminate this structural weakness. Bremner became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1833, and he was awarded the Telford Medal for several of his papers on engineering. Bremner married early in his life and had numerous sons and daughters. His wife died in 1856 and Bremner himself died in the August of the same year. In 1903 a tall obelisk was erected to his memory on high ground overlooking Wick Harbour, where it stands to this day.

Panarea (; Eu≈çnymos) is the smallest of the seven inhabited Aeolian Islands, a volcanic island chain in north of Sicily, southern Italy. It is a frazione of the comune of Lipari. There are currently about 280 residents living on the island year-round; however the population increases dramatically in summer with the influx of tourists especially during the months of July and August. In recent years, the island has become known internationally for its celebrity visitors. Geography The island is an inactive volcano with a total surface area of only . The highest point on the island, Punta del Corvo, is above sea level. There are thermal springs near the village of Punta di Peppe e Maria. Scuba diving is a popular excursion on this tiny island, and you can even swim to a shipwreck between the offshore rocks of Lisca Bianca and Bottaro. The island is surrounded by several cliffs reachable only by boat that make Panarea unique and easily distinguishable between the other Eolian islands. These cliffs are: Basiluzzo and Spinazzola, Pietra Nave, Dattilo, lisca Bianca and Bottaro, Lisca nera.,Le formiche. History In antiquity, the island was named \\"Euonymos\\"; the nearby islet of Basiluzzo, administered from Panarea, was named \\"Hycesia\\". There is archaeological evidence on the island dating back to Mycenaean inhabitants (~ 1200 BCE); later the island was settled by Romans. There were people still living on the island until pirates and other Mediterranean raiders made life unbearable after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In modern times, Panarea has become a fashionable vacation spot. In 2011, it was described by W magazine as \\"the epicenter of the chicest summer scene in the Mediterranean.\\" Panarea and the entire Aeolian chain were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000. Largely because of this, construction and development are strictly regulated and the community retains its storied insularity. Most residences admit only temporary occupancy, and the few year-round homes available are highly expensive and difficult to obtain.

The album features two original songs and covers of material by Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, George Harrison and Richie Havens. The record has a very strong anti-war message, while also protesting public apathy towards the political process.  Album development  After being off the road for a few months, by February 2005, the Junkies decided it was time to get together and record some music. They invited the Timmins' older brother, John Timmins, to bring his guitar and sit in. The theme the band decided on was to be on war, violence, fear, greed, ignorance, or loss, and everybody had to bring two or three songs written by other people. The Junkies played and interpreted the works of others and recorded their sessions, over the course of five days. The album was recorded at the Cowboy Junkies recording studio, The Clubhouse during February and March of 2005. The genesis of the album were a pair of songs that the Junkies had taken to their heart, \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" by George Harrison which they started performing on the Long Journey Home Tour the previous year, and \\"December Skies\\" which was written and recorded in October 2002 during the One Soul Now sessions and inspired by The Wars by Timothy Findley. The other original song on the album, \\"This World Dreams Of\\" was also written during the One Soul Now session, but they never got a recording they liked. For this recording, they slowed down the song, spacing it out and letting it breathe. One line from the song, \\"more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of\\", is from a Tennyson poem called \\"The Passing of Arthur\\", which inspired the writing of the song. The song \\"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier\\" is unusual for the Junkies because it has a rap break in the song. The band was jamming on the song, and they set up a drum loop. When they listened to their session, they realized there was a hip-hop motion to the loop, so they invited a friend of theirs, Kevin Bond, also known as Rebel, to improvise and record a rap element, using the album themes as a basis. The Junkies then asked Jeff Wolpert to mix the elements together.

It is primarily the home to Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, although the airfield supports several other flying and non-flying units as well. Its name is an amalgamation of its location and the last name of Commander Louis H. Maxfield, who lost his life when the R-38/USN ZR-2 airship crashed during flight on 24 August 1921 near Hull, England. When it was consolidated with McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix in October 2009, it became the naval component of JB MDL ‚Äì a United States Air Force‚Äìcontrolled installation ‚Äì and was placed under the 87th Air Base Wing. However, as with all joint bases, the installation receives support services from the previous installation authorities. Thus, Lakehurst Field is also provided certain services from Naval Support Activity Lakehurst (NSA Lakehurst), whose commander also serves as one of two Base Deputy Commanders. The field was the site of the 1937 Hindenburg disaster. Overview = History = Lakehurst Maxfield Field's history began as a test range for ammunition being manufactured for the Imperial Russian Army in 1916. It was then acquired by the United States Army as Camp Kendrick during World War I. The United States Navy purchased the property in 1921 for use as an airship station and renamed it Naval Air Station Lakehurst (NAS Lakehurst). The United States Navy's lighter-than-air program was conducted at Lakehurst from its inception through the 1930s. NAS Lakehurst was the center of airship development in the United States and housed three of the U.S. Navy's four rigid airships, (ZR-1) Shenandoah, (ZR-3) Los Angeles, and (ZRS-4) Akron. A number of the airship hangars built to berth these ships still survive. Hangar One, in which the Shenandoah was built, held the record for the largest \\"single room\\" in the world. According to an article in the January, 1925 issue of National Geographic Magazine, the airship hangar \\"could house three Woolworth Buildings lying side by side.\\" The base also housed many Navy non-rigid airships, otherwise knowns as \\"blimps,\\" in several squadrons before, during, and after World War II. This included the U.S. Navy's ZPG-3W (EZ-1C), which was deactivated in September 1962. \\\\- \\"After 44 Years, Lakehurst Back in Lighter- Than-Air Flight Research,\\" More, Kirt.

Despite the notoriety and well- documented nature of this incident, today there is a simple memorial that denotes the location of the crash at then‚ÄìNAS Lakehurst in the field behind the large airship hangars on base. A ground marker, painted black, and rimmed by a bright yellow painted chain, locates where the gondola of the German zeppelin Hindenburg hit the ground. = Aviation training = Lakehurst conducts the unique mission of supporting and developing the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment and Support Equipment for naval aviation. Since the 1950s, aviation boatswain's mates have been trained at Lakehurst to operate catapults and arresting systems on aircraft carriers using rail guided jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots tested carrier arresting gear cables and tailhooks.\\"Twin Jet Monorail Test Airplane Arresting Gear.\\" Popular Science, June 1955, p. 97. The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and the Advanced Arresting Gear system that will replace the existing steam catapults and the Mk-7 arresting gear are being developed and tested at Lakehurst at full-scale shipboard representative test facilities here. The former NAS Lakehurst also hosted the U.S. Navy's first helicopter squadrons, HU-1 (later HC-1) and HU-2 (later HC-2); the \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" enlisted training schools for the Aerographer's Mate (AG), Aviation Boatswain Mate (AB, ABE, ABF, ABH), and Parachute Rigger / Aircrew Survival Equipmentman (PR) ratings until their transfer to other Naval Air Technical Training Centers; and an Overhaul & Repair (O&R;) facility for fixed-wing aircraft, the forerunner of the former Naval Air Rework Facilities and Naval Aviation Depots (NADEPs) now known as Fleet Readiness Centers (FRCs). Today the base is used for various Naval Aviation development programs. Lakehurst Maxfield's main airfield has two runways under its own control tower, while a separate test runway ‚Äì equipped with a separate control tower and pavement-mounted catapults and arresting gear for testing aircraft-carrier suitability of new naval aircraft and new flight-deck systems ‚Äì is located approximately a mile to the northwest.  Tenant organizations  Lakehurst is home to Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, which is the largest command on the field, followed by Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 64, operating the Navy Reserve Force's C-130T Hercules. In addition, the field is host to several CNATTU schools, the New Jersey Army National Guard's aviation unit, as well as other tenant organisations from Ocean County, the state of New Jersey, United States Air Force, New Jersey Air National Guard, United States Public Health Service and the United States Department of Justice.  Naval Support Activity Lakehurst  Naval Support Activity Lakehurst (NSA Lakehurst) is the United States Navy element representing USN and USMC entities for the Department of the Navy‚Äìspecific asset and resources at Joint Base McGuire‚ÄìDix‚ÄìLakehurst (JB MDL), and administrative control over Naval personnel who are assigned to units that are assigned to the base. = Background = When the United States Department of Defense announced that Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst (NAES Lakehurst) would be affected by a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action, merging it with two neighboring military bases, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix, it established Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, the nation's only tri-service installation. Each installation's major support services such as MWR, Legal, medical/dental-clinic, and exchange-services roles transitioned over to either Air Force or joint operation. However, both Lakehurst (and also Fort Dix, the third component of the installation) kept several service-specific support services for their personnel. With the disestablishment of NAES Lakehurst as a separate activity from JB MDL, NSA Lakehurst became the official sponsor for these activities. The person who is the Commanding Officer, NSA Lakehurst is also the primary Deputy Commander of JB MDL, and reports to Commander, Naval Region Mid-Atlantic (CNRMA) for all administrative and logistical concerns, and to the Joint Base Commander for operational concerns.Naval Aviation News, Fall 2011, p. 36; published for the Chief of Naval Operations by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD (USPS 323-010; ISSN 0028-1417) References External links * *Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) official website *NAVAIR at Joint Base McGuire- Dix-Lakehurst official website *Lakehurst page (on JB MDL official website) *Naval Air Warfare Center, Lakehurst (from GlobalSecurity.org) *Navy Lakehurst Historical Society *Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary * NAVAIR Lakehurst: One- Stop Shop for the Fleet - Naval Avtaion News (March‚ÄìApril 2003) * ** Category:Airports in New Jersey Category:Manchester Township, New Jersey Category:Military installations in New Jersey Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Ocean County, New Jersey Category:Airships Lakehurst Lakehurst Category:LZ 129 Hindenburg Category:1916 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Lakehurst Maxfield Field"},{"id":"2156257","text":"Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth (January 29, 1802 - August 31, 1856) was an American inventor and businessman in Boston, Massachusetts who contributed greatly to its ice industry. Due to his inventions, Boston could harvest and ship ice internationally. In the 1830s, he was also a mountain man who led two expeditions to the Northwest and set up two trading posts, one in present-day Idaho and one in present-day Oregon. In the 1830s, he became interested in the Northwest and planned an expedition with Hall J. Kelley. In 1832 he proceeded independently, traveling to Fort Vancouver. Two years later in 1834, he led another expedition, founding Fort Hall in present-day Idaho and Fort William in present-day Portland, Oregon. Unable to succeed commercially against the powerful Hudson's Bay Company, he sold both fur trading posts to it in 1837. At the time, both Great Britain and the United States had fur trading companies, settlers and others in the Pacific Northwest. After they settled the northern boundary in 1846, both forts were considered part of the United States and its territories. After returning to Boston, Wyeth managed his business affairs and amassed a considerable fortune. The Fort Hall site has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is considered the most important trading post in the Snake River Valley through the 1860s. More than 270,000 emigrants reached it while traveling the Oregon Trail. Early life Wyeth was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Jacob and Elizabeth (Jarvis)Hist. of Camb., MA 1630-1877, Paige, p.705 Wyeth. He married Elizabeth Jarvis Stone on January 29, 1824. He began his working career in the 1820s by acting as foreman for a company that harvested ice from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, and thus helping Boston's \\"Ice King\\" Frederic Tudor to establish New England's ice trade with the Caribbean, Europe, and India. He invented a number of tools that revolutionized the ice-harvesting business and increased its productivity greatly. He also invented above-ground ice houses, with double walls for insulation. As the Dictionary of American Biography states, \\"[I]t was said at his death that practically every implement and device used in the ice business had been invented by Nat Wyeth.\\" Oregon Country When Wyeth was 30, Hall J. Kelley convinced him that the Oregon Country had excellent commercial prospects. Wyeth believed that he could become wealthy in the Oregon fur industry, develop farms for growing crops (especially tobacco), and start a salmon fishing and processing industry to rival New England's cod industry. When Kelley's plans for an expedition were long delayed, Wyeth formed one of his own, and as he wrote in his expedition journal: > On 10 March 1832 I left Boston in a vessel with 20 men for Baltimore where I > was joined by four more, and on the 27th left to Rail Road for Fredrick Md > (Frederick, Maryland) from thence to Brownsville we marched on foot, and > took passage from that place to Liberty Mo. on various steamboats, which > place we left for the prairies on 12 May with 21 men, three having deserted, > and on 27 May three more deserted. From there the expedition's route proceeded along what would later become known as the Oregon Trail along the Platte River valley, through the Black Hills, the Grand Tetons, north of the Great Salt Lake, thence to Fort Nez Perc√©s where Pierre Pambrun gave him a new suit and arranged transportation down the Columbia River, finally arriving at Fort Vancouver on October 29. Several days later news was relayed to him that the ship charted to transport the necessary supplies for the venture, the Sultana, had sunk.History of Oregon, Carey, Charles H., Chicago: Pioneer historical Pub. Co., 1922. For his remaining employed men the news was demoralizing as the November 6 entry of Wyeth's journal notes, \\"...my men came forward and unanimously desired to be released from their engagement with a view of returning home as soon as possible.... I am now afloat on the great sea of life without stay or support but in good hands i.e. myself and providence\\".The Correspondence and Journals of Captain Nathaniel J. Wyeth, 1831-6, Eugene, Oregon: University of Oregon Press, 1899 After spending the winter months at Fort Vancouver, Wyeth departed overland with Francis Ermatinger who was headed to the Flathead Post. After reaching the trade station in February 1833 Ermatinger mentioned he had previously come to a Rendezvous with supplies to sell to the mountain men in return for furs.Land of giants; the drive to the Pacific Northwest, 1750-1950, Lavender, David S., Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1958 Wyeth took upon the idea and while at Fort Colvile sent letters to the Hudson's Bay Company Governor George Simpson along with John McLoughlin, the manager of the Columbia District, offering a business proposal. Wyeth offered to purchase supplies from Fort Vancouver then undersell American merchants rendezvous and resell the gained furs at a set price back at Vancouver. Additionally, he stated his intentions to avoid trapping around any HBC post, and limit trapping to south of the Columbia. Wyeth and his remaining men moved with the party of Benjamin Bonneville to the 1833 Rendezvous, held in the vicinity of modern Daniel, Wyoming on the Horse Creek.The adventures of Captain Bonneville, Irving, Washington, New York City, N.Y.: G. P. Putnam's Sons 1868 Before leaving the gathering, Wyeth negotiated with Milton Sublette and Thomas Fitzpatrick of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to furnish $3,000 worth of suppliesCannon, Mike. \\"Fort Hall on the Saptin River.\\" The Washington Historical Quarterly 7, No. 3 (1916): 200 for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company at the next rendezvous. He reached Liberty, Missouri by late September, and then went on to Boston. Although the expedition had not been a commercial success, he brought with him a collection of plants previously unknown to botany. In 1834 Wyeth outfitted a new expedition, with plans for establishing fur-trading posts, a salmon fishery, a colony, and other developments. Included in the company were two noted naturalists, Professor Thomas Nuttall (1786‚Äì1859) of Harvard University, and John Kirk Townsend, plus the missionary Jason Lee. Wyeth's party headed to the rendezvous held on the Hams Fork, near by what is now Granger, Wyoming, with 13,000 pounds of goods and reached there on the 19th of June. William Sublette had become aware of the contract between Wyeth and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and forced the company to forfeit the contract. Continuing west with Thomas McKay, a stepson of McLoughlin, Wyeth quickly founded Fort Hall (July 1834) in southeastern Idaho. The Methodists were guided by McKay to Fort Nez Perc√©s, but by the time Wyeth reached there he had left back east, leaving the missionaries with Pambrun. Unknown to Wyeth at that time was the construction of Fort Boise by McKay to undermine Fort Hall.Reference Series: \\"Fur Trade Posts in Idaho\\", Idaho State Historical Society Following the Columbia River Wyeth's second trading station Fort William was built on Wapato Island at present-day Portland, Oregon. Upon seeing the deserted Multnomah villages caused from recent disease epidemics, Wyeth noted that \\"providence has made room for me and with doing them [Natives] more injury than I should if I had made room for myself viz Killing them off.\\" Wyeth reports in his journal that on September 15, 1834, he > met the Bg [Brig] May Dacre in full sail up the River boarded her and found > all well she had put into Valpara√≠so having been struck by Lightning and > much damaged. Capt Lambert was well and brot me 20 Sandwich Islanders and 2 > Coopers 2 Smiths and a Clerk. Despite some success in its trapping, Wyeth and his company could not compete against the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), whose operations undercut his trading posts. Fort Vancouver remained the primary trading post on the Columbia, with Fort William generally ignored. Fort Hall, while later an important stop on the Oregon Trail, did not net much profits with Fort Boise undercutting his activities. In 1837, after selling Fort William and Fort Hall to the HBC, Wyeth returned to Boston in debt of $20,000 after five years of attempts at establishing a commercial outpost in the Oregon Country. The second expedition was scientifically useful. Nuttall collected and identified 113 species of western plants, including sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata and \\"mule's ear\\", a sunflower genus, which he named Wyethia in Wyeth's honor. Later life Although he failed in his two ventures in the Northwest, Wyeth returned to the ice-harvesting industry and established a sizable fortune.

Alongside Roberto Ivens, he is famous for being the first European to cross Central Africa from coast to coast between Angola and Mozambique. Hermenegildo Capelo later rose to become aide-de-camp to King Luis I of Portugal and afterwards to King Carlos I and, later still, vice-admiral. His military career ended in 1910 when King Manuel II of Portugal was exiled. Early life Hermenegildo de Brito Capelo was born in Palmela, Portugal, a town about south of Lisbon. He was one of six brothers and his father was Major F√©lix Ant√≥nio Gomes Capelo. In 1860, Capelo sailed to Angola, in southwest Africa, and served on board the D Estef√¢nia as a member of the Portuguese Navy, which was commanded by Prince Lu√≠s, staying for three years at a naval station before returning to Lisbon in 1863. He sailed to Africa again in 1866, visiting Angola, where he remained until 1869. Before returning to Lisbon in 1876, his travels took him to Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea and Qing Dynasty China. Journeys of exploration In 1875, Luciano Cordeiro, the founder of the Lisbon Geographic Society (Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa) created the Portuguese National Commission of Exploration and Civilization of Africa ('), more commonly known as the Commission of Africa. Cordeiro's aims were to awaken public awareness of Portugal's African colonies and to raise funds by public subscription for the scientific-geographic expeditions necessary to define a single political Portuguese territory in Africa. These expeditions led to the recognition of the Kwango River and its relations with the Zaire River. They led also to the charting of the hydrographic basin of the Zambezi River, which helped to complete the map of southern Africa. By writing in defense of the Portuguese position in Africa, he helped to create a European expansionist movement, the Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa. The political motivation of these expeditions anticipated the historic Berlin Conference which took place in 1885. Explorers of all European nations had launched themselves into rivalry for territorial gains, compelling Portugal to urgently review its own colonial position and the effectiveness of its presence in Africa. Portuguese ambitions to incorporate the area between Angola and Mozambique into a larger Portuguese territory led to Britain issuing the British Ultimatum to Portugal in 1890. =Benguela and the lands of Iaca= Planning Hermenegildo Capelo was chosen on May 11, 1877, to direct a scientific expedition into Central Africa alongside the marine official Roberto Ivens and Serpa Pinto. Under the auspices of the Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa, this expedition aimed at \\"...the study of the Kwango river and its relations with the Zaire [Congo River] and with the Portuguese territories of the west coast...\\", as well as exploration of the region south and southeast of the source of the Zambezi river and the Kunene river. Expedition Hermenegildo Capelo (left) with Roberto Ivens in Iaca. On July 7, 1877, Hermenegildo Capelo, Roberto Ivens and Serpa Pinto set out, but later disagreed over the aims of the expedition. For Serpa Pinto it was to explore eastwards until they reached Mozambique. Capelo, however, saw it as an objective to reach Pretoria and possibly Durban in South Africa and the expedition divided. Capelo and Ivens explored the region of Bi√© and up to the lands of Iaca, having delimited the course of the Luando, Kubango and the Tohicapa rivers. On March 1, 1880, Lisbon received a triumphant communication from Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens. The success of the expedition was recorded in the book De Benguela √†s Terras de Iaca (From Benguela to the Lands of Iaca). =From Angola to the coast of Mozambique= Following a consolidation of gains in the region of the Bi√© Plateau and the Zambezi river and reaching the Victoria Falls, Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens were stimulated and keen to embark upon a second, ambitious expedition. Planning The necessity of creating a general atlas of the Portuguese colonies led Pinheiro Chagas, at the time Overseas Minister, to create, on April 19, 1883, a Commission of Cartography. One of its intentions was to map a commercial route between Angola and Mozambique. This objective was decided upon on November 5 and the commission proceeded to make the necessary arrangements. The choice of two marine officials for this important mission was complicated by the uncertainty of what they would have to face, thus making age, as well as mapping skills and enthusiasm, an important factor in the choice. Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens were chosen to carry through this new exploration of Africa. Expedition Between 1884 and 1885, Capelo and Ivens explored between the coastline of Angola and the Huila plain and later through the interior of Quelimane in Mozambique. As they continued their hydrographic studies and observations of river flow and drainage patterns, but also taking notes on the ethnographic and the linguistic characters of the people they encountered, they established a long-sought- after route via land between the coasts of Angola and Mozambique, exploring the vast regions of the interior located between these two territories. Their achievements were recorded in a two-volume book titled: De Angola √† Contra- Costa (From Angola to the Other Coast). Capelo and Ivens began this expedition on January 6, 1884, and returned to Lisbon on September 20, 1886, where they were triumphantly received by King Lu√≠s I of Portugal. Later career Hermenegildo Capelo was made vice-president of the Overseas Institute, of which the first president was Queen Dona Am√©lia. His vision and his eminent skills at organization and direction were of great service to Portugal, alongside Roberto Ivens, Andrade Corvo, Luciano Cordeiro, Pinheiro Chagas, Ant√≥nio Enes and Oliveira Martins. The Portuguese government recognized the value of these important contributions to Portuguese achievement. Capelo became aide-de-camp to King Luis I and King Carlos I of Portugal and chief of the military house of King Manuel II, Plenipotentiary Minister of Portugal with the Sultan of Zanzibar and created a geographical map of the province of Angola. Capelo was promoted to rear-admiral on May 17, 1902, and to vice- admiral on January 18, 1906. Dedicated to King Manuel II, Capelo accompanied His Majesty until he was exiled on October 5, 1910. On the 24th of the same month, Capelo was dismissed and his military career ended. Honours In Oporto, a street and a metro station are named after him.

Comprising all Latino members, the band paved the way for later Spanish-speaking punk bands in the United States and helped to increase the presence of Latinos in the country's predominantly white punk subculture. Los Crudos express a Left-wing political critique of issues affecting Latin America and the Latino community, such as U.S. imperialism, racism, xenophobia, and economic inequality. They have been described as \\"one of '90s punk's truly great bands\\" and \\"one of the greatest hardcore bands...ever.\\" Paul Kennedy additionally describes them as \\"very popular in both the 'crusty' and Emo/straight edge scenes in North America.\\" History The band formed in the early 1990s by singer Martin Sorrondeguy and guitarist Jos√© Casas, who remained the group's consistent members through changing rhythm sections. Their lyrics were almost always sung in Spanish; the song \\"We're That Spic Band\\" (written in response to an audience member calling them a \\"spic band\\") is the sole exception. Los Crudos' lyrics were explicitly political, addressing issues such as class, police brutality, homophobia, and California ballot propositions directed against immigrants. At concerts, Sorrondeguy would often speak at length about the songs' meanings between songs, partly as a way of getting around the language barrier (audiences were not always happy about this). Their music was loud, fast, and energetic with songs built around three chords or fewer. \\"We're That Spic Band\\" and \\"Asesinos\\" (about \\"the disappearances of radical youth during military dictatorships in Latin America\\") have both been described as their most well- known songs. The band's first shows were in Pilsen, the Latino neighborhood in Chicago where the band members lived, and many of their lyrics were first sung there. Sorrondeguy has said that, \\"One of the main reasons for singing in Spanish was to communicate directly with kids in our neighborhood.\\" In Pilsen, the band also worked closely with community agencies such as Project Vida, an AIDS prevention organization, and Project Hablo, a domestic violence support group. Los Crudos incorporated DIY ethics into every aspect of the band's existence, including promoting and booking shows, recording music, touring, and silk-screening T-shirts. They toured Mexico (in 1994), South America, Europe, and Japan, as well as touring the US many times. The band's recordings were released on independent record labels such as Flat Earth Records, Ebullition Records, and Sorrondeguy's label Lengua Armada Discos. The group's final rhythm section included bassist Juan Jimenez and drummer Ebro Virumbrales (also a member of Charles BronsonSinker, 255 and MK-ULTRA). Los Crudos played its last shows in October 1998,in the neighborhood which they started in, Pilsen. After the band's breakup, Sorrondeguy became the vocalist for Limp Wrist, as well as releasing a documentary about Chicano and Latino punk (Beyond The Screams: A U.S. Latino Hardcore Punk Documentary). He has also been in the bands Harto and Tragatelo. Guitarist Jose now plays in the Chicago punk band I Attack. Drummer Ebro became the vocalist for Chicago band Punch in the Face. The band played an unannounced reunion show in June 2006 at Southkore (America's first and largest Latino punk festival), in Chicago's Little Village. The festival attracted more than 400 fans. They also played reunion shows in 2008's Chaos in Tejas festival in Austin, Texas and in Los Angeles, California in 2008. In 2016, Crudos played shows in the Midwest and readied for a tour of the U.K. and numerous Scandinavian cities.

It is considered to have taken place at Al-Maghtas, located in Jordan. Most modern theologians view the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. Along with the crucifixion of Jesus, most biblical scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting point for the study of the historical Jesus. The baptism is one of the events in the narrative of the life of Jesus in the canonical Gospels; others include the Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension.Essays in New Testament Interpretation by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 p. 63The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key by Vigen Guroian 2010 p. 28 Most Christian denominations view the baptism of Jesus as an important event and a basis for the Christian rite of baptism (see also ). In Eastern Christianity, Jesus' baptism is commemorated on 6 January (the Julian calendar date of which corresponds to 19 January on the Gregorian calendar), the feast of Epiphany.–ë–æ–≥–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –†–æ–∂–¥–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–æ In the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Churches and some other Western denominations, it is recalled on a day within the following week, the feast of the baptism of the Lord. In Roman Catholicism, the baptism of Jesus is one of the Luminous Mysteries sometimes added to the Rosary. It is a Trinitarian feast in the Eastern Orthodox Churches. In the Synoptic Gospels Mark, Matthew, and Luke depict the baptism in parallel passages. In all three gospels, the Holy Spirit is depicted as descending upon Jesus immediately after his baptism accompanied by a voice from Heaven, but the accounts of Luke and Mark record the voice as addressing Jesus by saying \\"You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\\", while in Matthew the voice states \\"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\\" ().Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible by James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson 2003 p. 1010The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke by J√°n Majern√≠k, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 pp. 27‚Äì31 After the baptism, the Synoptic gospels describe the temptation of Jesus, where Jesus withdrew to the Judean desert to fast for forty days and nights. =Matthew= In Matthew 3:14, upon meeting Jesus, John said: \\"I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?\\" However, Jesus convinces John to baptize him nonetheless. Matthew records that the voice from heaven says \\"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\\", but does not indicate who is addressed. =Mark= Mark's account is roughly parallel to that of Matthew, except for Matthew 3:14‚Äì15 describing John's initial reluctance and eventual consent to baptize Jesus, which is not described by Mark. Mark uses an unusual word for the opening of the heavens, Greek: œÉœáŒØŒ∂œâ, schiz≈ç, which means \\"tearing\\" or \\"ripping\\" (Mark 1:10). It forms a verbal thread (Leitwortstil) with the rending of the Temple veil in Mark 15:38, inviting comparison between the two episodes.David Rhoads, Joanna Dewey, and Donald Michie 2012, Mark as Story: An Introduction to the Narrative of a Gospel, 3rd ed. Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 48.James L. Resseguie 2005, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 44. =Luke= Luke 1 begins with the birth of John the Baptist, heralded to his father Zacharias by the angel Gabriel. Six months later Gabriel appears to the Virgin Mary with an announcement of the birth of Jesus, at the Annunciation. At the same, Gabriel also announces to Mary the coming birth of John the Baptist, to her kinswoman Elizabeth, who is the wife of Zacharias. Mary immediately sets out to visit her kinswoman Elizabeth, and stays with her until John's birth. Luke strongly contrasts the reactions of Zacharias and Mary to these two respective births; and the lives of John and Jesus are intertwined. Luke uniquely depicts John as showing public kindness to tax collectors and encouraging the giving of alms to the poor (as in ). Luke records that Jesus was praying when Heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him. Luke clarifies that the spirit descended in the \\"bodily form\\" of a dove, as opposed to merely \\"descending like\\" a dove. In , the ministry of Jesus is described as following \\"the baptism which John preached\\". In the Gospel of John Jesus (left) is being identified by John the Baptist in ,The Lamb of God by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 p. 263 by Ottavio Vannini, 17th century. In rather than a direct narrative, John the Baptist bears witness to the spirit descending like a dove.Jesus of History, Christ of Faith by Thomas Zanzig 2000 p. 118 The Gospel of John () specifies \\"Bethabara beyond Jordan\\", i.e., Bethany in Perea as the location where John was baptizing when Jesus began choosing disciples, and in there is mention of further baptisms in √Ünon \\"because there was much water there\\".Big Picture of the Bible ‚Äì New Testament by Lorna Daniels Nichols 2009 p. 12John by Gerard Stephen Sloyan 1987 p. 11 narrates an encounter, between Jesus and two of his future disciples, who were then disciples of John the Baptist.The People's New Testament Commentary by Eugene M. Boring and Fred B. Craddock 2010, Westminster John Knox Press pp. 292‚Äì93New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 pp. 143‚Äì46 The episode in forms the start of the relationship between Jesus and his future disciples.

Crowther 1999 p. 77The Life and Ministry of Jesus: The Gospels by Douglas Redford 2007 p. 92A Summary of Christian History by Robert A. Baker, John M. Landers 2005 pp. 6‚Äì7 One of the disciples is named Andrew, but the other remains unnamed, and Raymond E. Brown raises the question of his being the author of the Gospel of John himself.The Disciple Whom Jesus Loved by J. Phillips 2004 pp. 121‚Äì23 In the Gospel of John, the disciples follow Jesus thereafter, and bring other disciples to him, and portrays the disciples of John as eventually merging with the followers of Jesus.The Gospel and Epistles of John: A Concise Commentary by Raymond Edward Brown 1988 pp. 25‚Äì27  In the Gospel of the Nazarenes  According to the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes, the idea of being baptized by John came from the mother and brothers of Jesus, and Jesus himself, originally opposed, reluctantly accepted it.Jerome, quoting \\"The Gospel According to the Hebrews\\" in Dialogue Against Pelagius III:2. Benjamin Urrutia avers that this version is supported by the criterion of embarrassment, since followers of Jesus would not have invented an episode in which Jesus changes his mind and comes to accept someone else's plan. Plus, the story came from the community that included the family of Jesus, who would have guaranteed the authenticity of the narrative.Guy Davenport and Benjamin Urrutia, The Logia of Yeshua / The Sayings of Jesus (1996), p. 51.  Location  Part of the ancient Madaba Map showing Bethabara east of the Jordan River The Al-Maghtas ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River was the location for the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist. The Gospel of John () refers to Enon near Salim as one place where John the Baptist baptized people, \\"because there was much water there\\". Separately, states that John the Baptist was baptizing in \\"Bethany beyond the Jordan\\". This is not the village Bethany just east of Jerusalem, but is generally considered to be the town Bethany, also called Bethabara in Perea on the Eastern bank of the Jordan near Jericho. In the 3rd century Origen, who moved to the area from Alexandria, suggested Bethabara as the location.Jesus and Archaeology by James H. Charlesworth 2006, Eedrsmans pp. 437‚Äì39 In the 4th century, Eusebius of Caesarea stated that the location was on the west bank of the Jordan, and following him, the early Byzantine Madaba Map shows Bethabara as (ŒíŒ≠Œ∏Œ±Œ≤Œ±œÅŒ¨). The biblical baptising is related to springs and a Wadi (al- Kharrar) close to the Eastern site of the Jordan River,The Synoptics by Jan Majernik, Joseph Ponessa and Laurie Manhardt 2005 p. 29 not the Jordan itself. The pilgrimage sites, important for both Christians and Jews have shifted place during history. The site of Al-Maghtas (baptism, or immersion in Arabic) on the East side of the River in Jordan has been deemed the earliest place of worship. This site was found following UNESCO-sponsored excavations. Al- Maghtas was visited by Pope John Paul II in March 2000, and he said: \\"In my mind I see Jesus coming to the waters of the river Jordan not far from here to be baptized by John the Baptist\\".Vatican website: Address of John Paul II at Al-Maghtas The Muslim conquest put an end to the Byzantine buildings on the east bank of the Jordan River, the later reverence took place just across the river in the West Bank at Qasr el Yahud. The valley around the Dead Sea, which the Jordan River flows into from the North, is also the lowest place on planet Earth.  Chronology  The baptism of Jesus is generally considered as the start of his ministry, shortly after the start of the ministry of John the Baptist.Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 pp. 224‚Äì29Christianity: An Introduction by Alister E. McGrath 2006 pp. 16‚Äì22The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J.

Evans 2003 pp. 67‚Äì69 > In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar‚Äîwhen Pontius Pilate > was governor of Judea ... , the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in > the wilderness. There are two approaches to determining when the reign of Tiberius Caesar started. The traditional approach is that of assuming that the reign of Tiberius started when he became co-regent in 11 AD, placing the start of the ministry of John the Baptist around 26 AD. However, some scholars assume it to be upon the death of his predecessor Augustus Caesar in 14 AD, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in 29 AD.Luke 1‚Äì5: New Testament Commentary by John MacArthur 2009 p. 201 The generally assumed dates for the start of the ministry of John the Baptist based on this reference in the Gospel of Luke are about 28‚Äì29 AD, with the ministry of Jesus with his baptism following it shortly thereafter.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J.

Most modern scholars believe that John the Baptist performed a baptism on Jesus, and view it as a historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.The Gospel of Matthew by Daniel J. Harrington 1991 p. 63Christianity: A Biblical, Historical, and Theological Guide by Glenn Jonas, Kathryn Muller Lopez 2010, pp. 95‚Äì96Studying the Historical Jesus: Evaluations of the State of Current Research by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 pp. 187‚Äì98 James Dunn states that the historicity of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus \\"command almost universal assent\\".Jesus Remembered by James D. G. Dunn 2003 p. 339 Dunn states that these two facts \\"rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts\\" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. John Dominic Crossan states that it is historically certain that Jesus was baptised by John in the Jordan.Who Is Jesus? by John Dominic Crossan, Richard G. Watts 1999 pp. 31‚Äì32 In the Antiquities of the Jews (18.5.2) 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus also wrote about John the Baptist and his eventual death in Perea.Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible 2000 p. 583Behold the Man: The Real Life of the Historical Jesus by Kirk Kimball 2002 p. 654 The existence of John the Baptist within the same time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus and the overwhelming majority of modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic.Craig Evans, 2006 \\"Josephus on John the Baptist\\" in The Historical Jesus in Context edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al. Princeton Univ Press pp. 55‚Äì58The New Complete Works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus, William Whiston, Paul L. Maier pp. 662‚Äì63 Josephus establishes a key connection between the historical events he recorded and specific episodes that appear in the gospels. The reference in the Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus to John's popularity among the crowds (Ant 18.5.2) and how he preached his baptism is considered a reliable historical datum.John the Baptist: Prophet of Purity for a New Age by Catherine M. Murphy 2003 p. 53 Unlike the gospels, Josephus does not relate John and Jesus, and does not state that John's baptisms were for the remission of sins.Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times by Paul Barnett 2009 p. 122Claudia Setzer, \\"Jewish Responses to Believers in Jesus\\", in Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Z. Brettler (editors), The Jewish Annotated New Testament, p. 576 (New Revised Standard Version, Oxford University Press, 2011). However, almost all modern scholars consider the Josephus passage on John to be authentic in its entirety and view the variations between Josephus and the gospels as indications that the Josephus passages are authentic, for a Christian interpolator would have made them correspond to the Christian traditions.Evans, Craig A. (2006). \\"Josephus on John the Baptist\\". In Levine, Amy-Jill. The Historical Jesus in Context. Princeton Univ Press. . pp. 55‚Äì58Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition. . p. 130 One of the arguments in favour of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John is that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent, typically referred to as the criterion of embarrassment in historical analysis.Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching by Maurice Casey 2010 p. 35 Based on this criterion, given that John baptised for the remission of sins, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, the invention of this story would have served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus.Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee by Mark Allan Powell 1998 p. 47The Historical Jesus: a Comprehensive Guide by Gerd Theissen, Annette Merz 1998 p. 207 The Gospel of Matthew attempts to offset this problem by having John feel unworthy to baptise Jesus and Jesus giving him permission to do so in . The gospels are not the only references to the baptisms performed by John and in , the apostle Peter refers to how the ministry of Jesus followed \\"the baptism which John preached\\".Who is Jesus?: An Introduction to Christology by Thomas P. Rausch 2003 p. 77 Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation.John the Baptist: Prophet of Purity for a New Age by Catherine M. Murphy 2003 pp. 29‚Äì30 Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity.Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies by Craig A.

Background J√≥n Arason was born in Gryta, educated at Munka√æver√°, the Benedictine abbey of Iceland, and was ordained a Catholic priest about 1504. Having attracted the notice of Gottsk√°lk Nikul√°sson bishop of H√≥lar, he was sent on two missions to Norway. In 1522, he succeeded Gottsk√°lk in the episcopal see of H√≥lar, but he was soon driven out by the other Icelandic bishop, √ñgmundur P√°lsson of Sk√°lholt. Bishop √ñgmundur later opposed the imposition of Lutheranism to Iceland, but being old and blind by that time his opposition proved effectively meaningless. By this point J√≥n Arason had become known for his great talents if somewhat erratic faith. He fathered numerous children who fought for his causes figuratively and later literally. This was despite the canonical obligation that Catholic bishops are to be celibate, but Iceland was distant enough from Rome for clerical discipline in that age to be very lax. Struggle with the king Bishop J√≥n became involved in a dispute with his sovereign, King Christian III, because of the bishop's refusal to promote Lutheranism on the island. Although initially he took a defensive rather than an offensive position on the matter, this changed radically in 1548. At that point he and Bishop √ñgmundur joined their forces to attack the Lutherans. Bishop √ñgmundur's contribution did not last, however, because of his infirmities, and he quickly faced exile to Denmark. J√≥n's continued resistance is thought to have come from a kind of primitive nationalism and simple ambition as much as religion. He resented the Danes' changing the religious landscape of Iceland and felt their culture would be less disrupted by staying Catholic. Hence he took encouragement from a letter of support from Pope Paul III in continuing his efforts against the Lutheran cause. J√≥n knew no bounds in his zeal toward that cause, as he fought for what he deemed to be a Catholic Iceland, in a personal struggle against the Danes. In this struggle he had the help of his illegitimate children, who fought with him in various battles. However his attempt to capture his greatest adversary, Da√∞i Gu√∞mundsson at the Battle of Sau√∞afell led to him being taken prisoner and handed over to the king's bailiff. Legend states that, on hearing this, one of his daughters rallied her forces to save him, but even if this is so her efforts proved unsuccessful. In 1550, J√≥n and two of his sons, Ari and Bj√∂rn, were captured and beheaded. Christian Skriver, the king's bailiff who had pronounced the bishop's death sentence, was later killed by fishermen who favored J√≥n's cause; they were persuaded to assassinate him by √ûj√≥runn J√≥nsd√≥ttir, a wealthy female chieftain and the illegitimate daughter of J√≥n, and by Helga Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, J√≥n's mistress of many years. Skriver's death was thus every bit as much very personal revenge for J√≥n's death as it was born of any sectarian strife between Catholics and Lutherans. Legacy Memorial at the place of execution of Jon Arason, in Sk√°lholt, south Iceland Legends claim that as he was about to be beheaded, a priest called Sveinn was by his side to offer him comfort. Sveinn told J√≥n: L√≠f er eftir √æetta, herra! (\\"There is a life after this one, Sire!\\") J√≥n turned to Sveinn and said: Veit √©g √æa√∞, Sveinki! (\\"That I know, little Sveinn!\\") Ever since veit √©g √æa√∞, Sveinki has been a part of the Icelandic treasury of sayings, in this case meaning that something totally obvious has been stated. Gunnar Gunnarsson wrote J√≥n Arason (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1930), a fictionalized account of the life of J√≥n. Originally written in Danish, the book has been translated into other languages, including English.

The north slope of the mountain borders the Winooski River, which has carved through the Green Mountains over eons. At , it is tied (with Mount Ellen) for the third-highest mountain in Vermont. Surrounded by of alpine tundra, the mountain is the most significant feature in Camel's Hump State Park. Because of its distinctive profile, it is perhaps the state's most recognized mountain, featured on the state quarter. Name Since Europeans first saw the mountain, probably on Samuel de Champlain's 1609 trip down Lake Champlain to the west, the mountain has had a number of names related to its distinctive shape. De Champlain named the mountain \\"Le Lion Couchant\\", a heraldic image which roughly translates as \\"The Resting Lion\\". Ira Allen later referred to the mountain as \\"Camel's Rump\\" on a map from 1798. It was not until 1830 that the name \\"Camel's Hump\\" came into usage. The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) lists twelve variant names including Tah-wak-be-dee-ee-so wadso and Catamountain. While place names are determined by local usage the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) serves as a central authority in the United States concerning place names. Since its inception in 1890 the BGN has discouraged the use of the genitive apostrophe. Local usage is often at odds with this policy and so the name of this mountain is alternatively spelled with and without an apostrophe. Geology Camel's Hump is more notable for its shape than its height. Isolated from neighboring peaks by the Winooski Valley and glacial action, the mountain's conical silhouette is distinctive, if misleading. It has two \\"humps\\", with the southernmost being the higher, and a steep drop to the south as a result of a quarrying action of the ice passing over it. The movement of glacial ice shaped it into what is referred to as a roche moutonn√©e. The bedrock consists of phyllite, quartzite and schist. In 1968 the National Park Service designated Camel's Hump a National Natural Landmark, citing the peak as \\"an exceptional illustration of the complex anticlinal deformation which formed the Green Mountains\\". The landmark area consists of approximately from the summit down to .  Botany  Alpine tundra grasses at the summit of Camel's Hump, Vermont, June 2008. The summit of Camel's Hump is home to of alpine tundra vegetation. Common plants found in this area include: Bigelow's sedge (Carex bigelowii), alpine bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), mountain sandwort (Minuartia groenlandica), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), and Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum). A direct result of glacial formation, these alpine species were once widespread but as the lower elevations warmed, only the very peak of Camel's Hump remained hospitable to the fragile plants. There are 18 species of plants at or near the summit of Camel's Hump that are thought to be rare or very rare. Of these, five species are protected by the Vermont endangered and threatened species rule: Boott's rattlesnake-root (Nabalus boottii, generically known as white lettuce), bearberry willow (Salix uva-ursi), lesser wintergreen (Pyrola minor), alpine sweetgrass (Anthoxanthum monticola), and squashberry (Viburnum edule). The Green Mountain Club's Summit Caretaker program actively promotes Leave No Trace principles and helps to protect the alpine tundra natural community on the summit of Camel's Hump. Despite extensive logging during the late 1800s and a great fire in 1903, Camel's Hump continues to support a significant population of red spruce (Picea rubens). Starting in the 1960s, Hub Vogelmann and his graduate students from the University of Vermont observed an extensive decline in the red spruce population on the west slope of Camel's Hump. Vogelmann's 1982 landmark paper ‚ÄúCatastrophe on Camel‚Äôs Hump‚Äù identified the cause of the decline to be acid rain. Similarly the Forest Decline Project at the University of Vermont published a study in 1991 that again cited acid rain as the culprit. These findings raised public awareness and eventually led to a revision of the Clean Air Act. By 2017, with mounting evidence that the health of red spruce was on the rise, the scourge of acid rain in the northeast had largely come to an end. The Vermont state quarter depicts Camel's Hump and Maple trees with sap buckets  History  The Abnaki name for the mountain was \\"ta wak be dee esso wadso,\\" or \\"tahwahbodeay wadso\\" (wadso meaning mountain), which has been variously translated as \\"resting place\\", \\"sit-down place\\", and \\"prudently, we make a campfire in a circle near water (and rest) at this mountain.\\" In 1905, publisher and philanthropist Joseph Battell donated of virgin forest, including the summit of Camel's Hump, to the State of Vermont. The bequest was intended to form a state park to be kept in a \\"primitive state\\" and in 1911 the state forester was given charge of the area who managed the land in accordance with Battell's wishes. Since then, Vermont has adopted new legislation to preserve its natural areas and in 1969 created a Forest Reserve enclosing the mountain. Camel's Hump State Park has grown since the original bequest and in 1991 totalled approximately . In October 1944, during World War II, a B-24J bomber on a training mission crashed into the side of the mountain near the summit. While most of the plane was salvaged and removed, portions of the wreckage (principally a wing section) still remain. The Alpine Trail passes by the site. Though protected, the Camel's Hump area is a favorite recreational venue for hikers. Trail work began on Camel's Hump at the formation of the Green Mountain Club (GMC) and by 1912, a trail had been constructed between the mountain and Sterling Pond. This initial trail would later become a high point in the \\"footpath in the wilderness\\" known as the Long Trail. In the 1950s, the GMC constructed shelters along the trail and at the summit. The GMC now trains and pays a caretaker to reside near the summit during the summer and educate hikers to respect the fragile alpine ecosystem that exists on the mountain. In 1999, an image of Camel's Hump was chosen as a prominent feature for the Vermont state quarter. While many other options were considered, including covered bridges and the snowflake photographs of Wilson Bentley, the seven-person panel ultimately decided on Camel's Hump stating that it was \\"perfect for the quarter.\\" The panels findings explained the choice: \\"It's wild and natural, like the Vermont countryside. It's unique and asymmetrical, like the independent and quirky reputation Vermonters have.\\" Many notable Vermont institutions have adopted its memorable name, including the children's radio show \\"Camel's Hump Radio\\" hosted by Bill Harley on Vermont Public Radio. The profile of Camel's Hump appears in the Vermont coat of arms on the Vermont flag. Hiking Summit marker on Camel's Hump. Notice the inscription reads \\"Camels Rump\\" \\"With the only undeveloped alpine area in the Green Mountain State and a skyline that sets it apart from everything else, Camel's Hump may be Vermont's finest peak,\\" says Michael Lanza in his guidebook for New England hiking enthusiasts. The views from the summit are panoramic, and on a clear day one can see the highest peaks of the following states: Mount Marcy in New York, Mount Washington in New Hampshire, as well as Vermont's Mount Mansfield. The most popular access points for hikers are the Burrows Trailhead east of Huntington and the Monroe Trailhead south of Duxbury. In 2016, almost 26,000 visitors signed the trail registers at these two trailheads. Parking is also available along Duxbury Road west of Duxbury, but this parking area is much further from Camel's Hump. There are multiple trails in the vicinity of Camel's Hump.

Bauska is located from the Latvian capital Riga, 62 km (38.5 mi) from Jelgava and from the Lithuanian border on the busy European route E67. The town is situated at the confluence of the shallow rivers M≈´sa and Mƒìmele where they form the Lielupe River. Average temperatures in January are , and in July. Rainfall averages annually. The 80.4% of Bauska Municipality territory is agricultural land and 13% of forests. In previous centuries city was known in German as Bauske, in Yiddish as Boisk and in Lithuanian as Bauskƒó. The population of Bauska is estimated to be 8 200. Bauska is the centre of Bauska Municipality, a first-level national subdivision that has a population of 24 370 with an approximate density of 30 people per km2. History Painting of the Bauska Castle ruins with the Church of the Holy Spirit in the background, 1792 By the early 13th century this territory was inhabited by Semigallian tribes. In the mid-15th century, Bauska castle was built by Germans of the Livonian Order, who then were a part of the Terra Mariana confederacy. In the shadow and protection of the castle a small town called Schildburg grew on the narrow peninsula formed by the M≈´sa and Mƒìmele rivers. Around 1580 on the orders of Duke Gotthard Kettler this settlement was relocated to the present location of Bauska Old Town, eventually receiving city rights sometime before 1609. After the Livonian War, Bauska became part of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and prospered. The castle and city suffered heavily in the 17th and 18th centuries, under attacks from Sweden in the Polish-Swedish War and the Russians in the Great Northern War. In 1706. retreating Russians blow up the castle. In 1711 an outbreak of plague ravaged Bauska, exterminating half of the population, and war returned once more in 1812, when Bauska, after short skirmishes, became one of Napoleon's army's transit points en route to Moscow. Between 1812 and 1914, Bauska enjoyed a period of stability, and grew as a trade center between Riga and Lithuania. Many inhabitants were merchants or worked in ceramic-making, but there was a large brewery and sawmill as well. Bauska was still primarily built of wooden houses: in 1823, only 6 of the 120 houses within the city were built of brick or stone. For this reason, devastating fires were not uncommon. Historically, all social affairs had been in the hands of the privileged Baltic Germans. After 1820 Jews were allowed to settle in the city, and by 1850 made up half the population, diluting the strong German influence. The city was taken by the German Imperial Army on July 18, 1915, and roughly half the population fled (Jews were moved out on the orders of the Russian army). In 1916, the Germans installed the city's first electrical grid and built a narrow-gauge railway connection with Jelgava‚ÄìMeitene Railway. During the Latvian War of Independence Bauska experienced a couple of months of Red Army occupation, followed by the periods of rule by the Baltische Landeswehr and West Russian Volunteer Army until it was liberated in the early hours of November 17, 1919 by the Latvian army. From 1918 to 1940, the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the population grew strongly, making up 75% of the population, though the Jews and Germans still maintained a noticeable presence. In 1939, just before World War II, virtually the entire Baltic German population of Bauska repatriated to the recently occupied Reichsgau Wartheland, causing the city to lose one of its traditional ethnic populations. As part of the Holocaust during the June‚ÄìAugust 1941, Bauska's other traditional minority, the Jews were exterminated. During Operation Bagration, the Soviet army reached Bauska on July 29, 1944. For the next six weeks city was defended by assortment of Latvian policemen, forcibly mobilized Latvian Legion soldiers and Wehrmacht grenadiers. After Soviet shelling and air raids almost one third of the city was destroyed and finally captured on September 14, 1944. Post-war reconstruction was slow. Rubble remained in the streets until the 1950s. During the Soviet period, the population surpassed 10,000, as the Latvian and especially Russian populations strongly increased. =History of Jewish community= Bauska was home to a thriving Jewish community in the 19th century,Bauska, Latvia many employed as scholars or in occupations such as baking and distilling. The town hosted several notable rabbis, including Abraham Isaac Kook, later chief rabbi of Israel, Mordechai Eliasberg, and Chaim Yitzchak Bloch Hacohen.L Dribins, A Guttmanis, and M Vestermanis, \\"Latvia's Jewish Community: History, Tragedy, Survival\\", Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia, ca. 2001. In 1850, Jews made up 50% of Bauska's population, and 60% in 1881. By 1920, the Jewish population had dwindled to about a sixth of the size it had been 40 years earlier.JewishGen In 1941, following the Nazi invasion, the remaining Jews of Bauska and environs were tortured and executed.The Murder of the Jews in Latvia: 1941-1945 An exhibition on the city's Jewish history was opened in 2011 in Bauska museumJews in Bauska following a conference on Bauska's Jewish cultural heritage in the 1990s. A group of Jews who were former inhabitants of Bauska proposed to establish a memorial on the site of the synagogue that was burnt down in July 1941 but so far have been refused by the City council.Bauska memorial  Demographics  Ethnicities in Bauska In December 2004, there were 10,178 inhabitants, 55% female and 45% male.

Licensed to serve Brainerd, Minnesota, United States, it serves the Brainerd Lakes area. It first began broadcasting in 1946. The station is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. KLIZ's programming is primarily supplied by the Fan Radio Network, based out of KFXN-FM in Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul. History KLIZ signed on August 6, 1946 on 1400 AM under the ownership of Brainerd Broadcasting Company. It joined the Mutual Broadcasting System on December 15, 1946. The station moved to 1380 AM in 1956. By 1971, KLIZ was airing middle of the road and country music, and was affiliated with the NBC Radio Network. In 1973, the station went to a full-time country music format. It moved to a middle of the road format in 1982. Sequel Communications bought KLIZ and its FM sister station, KLIZ-FM (107.5), in 1985. CD Broadcasting bought the stations in 1987 and changed KLIZ to a contemporary country format. In 1988, news and talk programming were added, along with affiliations with the Associated Press, NBC Talknet, and the Minnesota News Network. CD Broadcasting exchanged the KLIZ stations to Sioux Valley Broadcasting for KJJQ and KKQQ in Volga, South Dakota in 1989. Sports programming was added to KLIZ's format in 1992. The KLIZ stations, along with KLLR and KLLZ in Walker, were acquired by Ingstad Broadcasting in a 1994 swap that saw Sioux Valley acquire North Dakota radio stations KDDR and KOVC AM-FM from Ingstad. Country music was dropped in December 1995 in favor of programming from One on One Sports. In 1996, Jim Ingstad Broadcasting sold nine of its northern Minnesota stations, including KLIZ, to the Provident Investment Council; the station's license was transferred to Kommerstad Communications. That May, KLIZ dropped sports for a simulcast of the news/talk programming of sister station KVBR (1340 AM); in November, KLIZ switched to an adult contemporary format provided by Westwood One. In January 1998, KLIZ returned to a talk radio format; by 2000, the station had affiliations with the USA Radio Network and Westwood One. Omni Broadcasting agreed to acquire the Kommerstad stations in 2003; the purchase had been planned since 2002. Shortly after Omni's BL Broadcasting subsidiary took over in 2004, BL swapped the formats of KLIZ and KVBR; KLIZ became sports radio station \\"The Fan\\", with programming being provided by the Fan Radio Network (then based out of KFAN in Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul) and Sporting News Radio. Hubbard Broadcasting announced on November 13, 2014 that it would purchase the Omni Broadcasting stations, including KLIZ; the $8 million sale was completed on February 27, 2015.

It airs a sports radio format branded as \\"Northland Fan.\\" The AM station feeds an FM translator W293CT at 106.5 MHz. While the FM station is limited in its coverage area, the AM station can be heard through much of Northeastern Minnesota and Northwestern Wisconsin. It is powered at 5,000 watts around the clock. The studios and offices are shared with its three other sister stations at 14 East Central Entrance in the Duluth Heights area of Duluth, MN. History WEBC is the oldest radio station in the Duluth-Superior market and was founded by Leslie Ross, who owned Ross Electric Shop in Superior, WI. Ross ran WEBC as a hobby; it was funded on a \\"shoe- string budget\\" by proceeds from Ross Electric Shop. WEBC was broadcast from a small top-floor room of the three-story Superior Evening Telegram newspaper building. Atop the building were two towers, one on each end of the building, with the transmitting antenna hung between them, as was the manner of broadcast stations of the day. Ross's tower engineer was Walter C. Bridges, who on June 1, 1924 helped WEBC sign on using 50 watts of power on AM 1240. For its first year, WEBC was operated out of Bridges's home in the upstairs of the Evening Telegraph building. Duluth studios were established in 1926 on the second floor of the Spalding Hotel. The community of license was later changed to Duluth, though WEBC's transmitter has always remained on the Wisconsin side of the bridge. The station was temporarily raised to 500 watts in 1928 in order to provide radio service to President Calvin Coolidge, who was vacationing nearby. Charles B. Persons, who Ross hired at the age of 17 in 1926, produced and broadcast content that included details of Coolidge's activities, such as fishing on the Brule River in Wisconsin during his three- month vacation, as well as Mr. & Mrs. Coolidge touring the streets of Duluth by chauffeured motorcar to greet devoted supporters. The New York Times nicknamed WEBC \\"The President's Station.\\" WEBC joined NBC at this time in order to provide the vacationing president with coverage of the national political conventions. Persons continued to work for WEBC for 28 years, covering local and national news, sports, presidential administrations and wars. WEBC's owners founded WMFG in Hibbing, Minnesota in 1935 and WHLB in Virginia, Minnesota in 1936. The three stations were linked for local programming as part of the Arrowhead Radio Network. WEBC's influence in regional programming was strengthened in 1942 when WMFG and WHLB switched to NBC from CBS. WEBC and its NBC programming dominated the market in the 1930s and 1940s. Like most other stations in the \\"Golden Age of Radio\\", WEBC carried a general entertainment format as the local affiliate of the NBC Radio Network. The station ended up on 560 in the mid-1950s after a series of upgrades and frequency changes. In 1955, with radio losing listeners to TV, WEBC dropped NBC and adopted a new format: Top 40. WEBC featured announcers such as Lance \\"Tac\\" Hammer, Lew Latto and \\"Doctor\\" Don Rose, among many others. Bridges was an early adopter of frequency modulation and created a sister station in 1940, WEBC-FM. Ultimately, the station was not a financial success and went off the air in 1950. Although Bridges and Head of the Lakes Broadcasting Company applied to construct a television station in June 1949, this never came to pass. Instead, WDSM and KDAL overcame their longtime rival by going into television first in 1953. WDSM-TV (now KBJR-TV) became an NBC-TV affiliate, which contributed to WEBC's 1955 switch to Top 40 programming. WEBC's first ownership change came in 1958 when Bridges sold the station to George Clinton of Clarkesburg, West Virginia for $250,000. At the time of the purchase, Clinton also owned WTMA and WTMA-FM in Charleston. WEBC began carrying ABC Radio newscasts in 1964. WEBC was a top-rated station until the mid-1970s, when FM began to attract more listeners. WEBC briefly switched to country music and then became a forerunner to the classic hits format. Talk programming was added to the lineup by the late-1980s and took over the entire schedule by 1990. The format was then changed to All-Sports in 2003 after a sale to Clear Channel Communications, which syndicated the \\"FAN\\" radio network from KFAN in Minneapolis to a number of its stations in the region. After the station was sold to GapWest Broadcasting in 2007, WEBC joined ESPN Radio, with \\"FAN\\" programming soon moving to rival KQDS. GapWest was folded into Townsquare Media on August 13, 2010. At 6 p.m. on September 30, 2015, WEBC dropped its sports format and began stunting with Christmas music, branded as \\"Ho Ho 106.5\\" (now simulcasting on FM translator W293CT 106.5 FM Duluth).WEBC Duluth Stunting With Christmas At 1 p.m. on October 6, WEBC flipped to classic rock as \\"Sasquatch 106.5\\" after a 23-hour marathon of the 1975 song \\"Bigfoot\\" by Bro Smith.Sasquatch Squashes Santa on Duluth Radio Dial On January 30, 2020, Townsquare Media announced that it would acquire WWAX with Townsquare assuming control of WWAX via local marketing agreement on February 1, at which point the classic rock format of WEBC began simulcasting on WWAX as \\"Sasquatch 92.1\\".

His reign was marred by uprisings, which would eventually lead to his suicide in 1803 to prevent an Ashanti civil war. Early life Osei Kwame Panyin was born at some point between 1762 and 1765, to a woman named Akyaama, and Safo Kantanka, the King of Mampong. At the time, the region was a founding part of the Ashanti Empire, and was known as the Islamic gateway to the empire due to its location in the north. Rulership =Rise to power= Prior to his death, the Ashanti King Osei Kwadwo Okoawia had declared Panyin to be his successor. However, upon Okoawia's death in 1777, when Panyin was around 17 years old, Okoawia's family members and councillors decided to ignore the former ruler's wishes resulting in an uprising by Atakora Kwame. He led an army to the Ashanti capital, Kumasi, and the northern provinces rose up in support of Panyin. Shortly after Panyin was made Asantehene (King), Kwame was overthrown from his position as councillor, leaving Panyin to deal with the political involvement of the former Queen Mother Konadu Yaadom. =Consolidation and uprising= Panyin consolidated his position over the course of the 1780s by removing former councillors from their positions and replacing them with allies. Where they could not be replaced, Panyin had those officials executed. Following the death of Yaadom's son Opoku Kwame, she accused the King of poisoning him. After Panyin refused to attend the Odwira festival, Yaadom took this as a reason to rise up against him, eventually placing Panyin under house arrest. She then proceeded to execute Panyin's former high-ranking allies. He fled his captors, and briefly found romance in Ama Sewaa, although he would be accused of undertaking an incestuous relationship with her. When Yaadom gathered the majority of the Ashanti clans against Panyin in 1803, he committed suicide rather than trigger a civil war.

Client and tracker software in this era was in development as much as the transmission protocols, so the file trading software was not always as reliable as it could have been. =2000= * January ‚Äì My.MP3.com is released by MP3.com. * March ‚Äì Scour Exchange is released as a P2P file exchange service to compete with Napster. In addition to audio files, it also supports sharing of other media as well as software. * March ‚Äì Gnutella becomes the first decentralized file sharing network with the release of a network client by Justin Frankel and Tom Pepper of Nullsoft.

In September 2003, the RIAA would file suit against private individuals allegedly sharing files via Kazaa. In September 2005, UMA v. Sharman would be ruled against Sharman by the Federal Court of Australia. Sharman's non-compliance would prompt censorship of the program in Australia. In July 2006, the MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. would cause Sharman to settle for $100 million and convert Kazaa to a legal-only file sharing program. * April ‚Äì Morpheus is released by MusicCity (later StreamCast), after licensing the FastTrack protocol. MusicCity had previously operated OpenNap servers. Morpheus would become a popular FastTrack client, with 4.5 million users, until licensing disputes and a protocol switch in February 2002. In March 2003, the Morpheus client was re-released to operate on Gnutella, using Gnucleus servant as its core. In June 2005, a redesigned Morpheus client would be released. In June 2005, MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. would be decided against StreamCast.

The station became fully licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 28, 2007 originally owned by Jeffrey Dress of Kennewick, Washington, and had been on the air since with a classic country format. Although the radio industry already had speculated so, KKAG was originally planned to be operated by the late Robert Ingstad, but the project was put on the back burner when Robert Ingstad's brother, James Ingstad, purchased the Clear Channel radio station group of Fargo in January 2007.

The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. Most of the station's daytime programming is from co-owned KFAN in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and nighttime programming is from ESPN Radio. History =KILO= In 1923, the University of North Dakota started KFJM. This station carried educational as well as commercial programming, which had since 1929 been overseen by Dalton LeMasurier of Grand Forks. As part of this venture, in addition to studios and a transmitter on the university campus, KFJM maintained studios in the First National Bank building downtown. The University of North Dakota began planning in March 1941 to unwind this arrangement and exit the commercial broadcasting business, which resulted in the award to LeMasurier of a second license. On November 1, 1941, KILO signed on, sharing the 1440 kHz frequency with KFJM. Under the arrangement, KFJM broadcast from 3 to 5 p.m. each day, with KILO broadcasting at other times and frequently assuming those hours in the summer. In a 10-year contract with the university, LeMasurier was responsible for the maintenance of the transmitter shared by the two licenses, as well as other equipment which was owned by the university, and paid $250 a month to UND. The entire KFJM commercial operation transferred to the new license, including staff and advertising contracts; no new construction was involved. A national network affiliation was stated as being in the offing when KILO launched, and this came to fruition on January 1, 1942, when KILO became an affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System. Jack Horner, who later worked in Minnesota, worked at commercial KFJM prior to the split and returned to KILO in 1942 to call Grand Forks Chiefs baseball games. LeMasurier sold KILO in 1948 to the Grand Forks Herald newspaper, which surrendered a construction permit it held to build a station at 1260 kHz. KFJM was authorized to move to 1370 kHz and resume full-time broadcasts in February 1957, leaving KILO alone on 1440; the end of the arrangement also saw KILO move to a new transmitter site. The Herald owned KILO until 1962, when it sold the station to Carl Bloomquist of Eveleth, Minnesota. Bloomquist, through KILO, Inc., paid $125,000. =KKXL= The Ingstad family acquired KILO from Bloomquist in 1973, paying $300,000 for the station. It was the Tom Ingstad Radio Group's first purchase. Immediately upon the Red River Valley Broadcasting Company assuming control, the call letters were changed to KKXL. Under Ingstad, KKXL added a simulcasting FM, KKXL-FM 105.3 (known as KKDQ between 1975 and 1981), which started on December 23, 1974. A 1982 windstorm collapsed the station's tower on the Fourth of July; the AM returned the next day and the FM a night later. In 1985, Vaughns, Inc., acquired six Ingstad- owned radio stations, including KKXL-AM-FM, for nearly $9 million; general manager Duane Cariveau was tapped to head the new station group from Grand Forks. Cariveau and other managers of the KKXL stations, organized as Excel Broadcasting, bought the pair from Vaughns three years later. KKXL AM was broadcasting country music by 1994 but flipped to talk and sports in 1996. In 1997, Excel sold the stations‚Äîto the Ingstads, who at the time were also buying two other Grand Forks radio stations, for $2.75 million. That year, the stations were off air for months as the result of another tower collapse and the flooding of the Red River. Upon returning to the air, the station aired an adult standards format from Westwood One.

Eventually, Delirious was able to beat Sydal at the second night of the 2004 King of the Death Match Tournament and won the IWA-MS Light Heavyweight Championship. After that, Delirious began a feud with Jimmy Jacobs. The two exchanged in several matches with the title trading hands. Jimmy won the belt in early August on a Coliseum Championship Wrestling event in Evansville, Indiana. Two weeks later in Highland, Indiana, they wrestled to a double pin for the title.

After they stapled his mask to his face back in 2007, he began using violent tactics to defeat them such as using weapons and spitting mist into their faces. He also changed his usual green and black attire to \\"Red Poison\\", a red and black version, at Rising Above on December 29, 2007, to reflect his newly violent tactics. Delirious later attempted to gain the attention of Daizee Haze only to be interrupted and overshadowed by Rhett Titus. After seeing footage of Titus and Haze together, he turned heel and joined up with Jimmy Jacobs and his Age of the Fall stable and began wearing a black version of his attire. On March 13 in Collinsville, Illinois, after Jacobs hit Haze with his spike, Delirious turned on him and broke away from the Age of the Fall. Delirious then started a feud with Sonjay Dutt, which ended rather quickly. Delirious later feuded with Austin Aries, starting on the May 3, 2010 edition of Ring of Honor Wrestling, when Aries kicked Delirious in the throat mid-match, causing a disqualification, followed by a beat down of both Delirious and his valet, Daizee Haze by Aries, Kenny King, and Rhett Titus. He teamed with Jerry Lynn to feud with them. On August 15, 2010, Johnston replaced Adam Pearce as the head booker of Ring of Honor. Since this change, Delirious has wrestled only sporadically for the promotion, when he ended his feud with Aries by defeating him in a steel cage match on the September 20 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling. Delirious made his return to a Ring of Honor ring on May 7 in Toronto, when he wrestled Colt Cabana in a Larry Sweeney tribute match. His booking style has been criticized due to lack of character development. In 2014, he began to increase his appearances in Ring of Honor more, mainly in their Illinois-based shows. On May 19, 2018, he became one of the trainers at the Baltimore Dojo.https://www.solowrestling.com/new/71108-roh-anuncia-la-apertura-de-su- nuevo-dojo-de-entrenamiento =International Wrestling Cartel (2005‚Äì2009)= Delirious and Matt Sydal debuted at No Excuses 2005 against each other with Delirious picking up the victory with the Chemical Imbalance II.

At November Pain 2, Delirious faced McChesney once again, but this time Haze was barred from ringside. Daizee disguised herself as a wrestling fan but McChesney caught on before she could intervene, resulting in McChesney powerbombing Daizee onto Delirious to get the win. At New Beginning 2, Delirious faced Sterling James Keenan to try to stop Keenan's road to the title. He was not successful, as Keenan hit the MK Ultra for the victory. He then took a break from IWC and did not return until several months later. He returned at November Pain 3 as he was scheduled to be partners with Super Hentai to face \\"The Shooter\\" Brent Albright and Sebastian Dark but it ended up being a 6-man tag team match after Shirly Doe and Delirious' rival John McChesney was added to the match. Shirly Doe picked up the victory by pinning Sebastian Dark after an over the shoulder back to belly piledriver to pick up the win for himself, Delirious, and Super Hentai. Delirious appeared at IWC's 100th show Call to Arms 4 on December 8, 2007 and defeated Eric Young. Throughout the spring and summer of 2008, he unsuccessfully went for the Super Indy title against Larry Sweeney and the IWC Championship against Dennis Gregory. Along with this, Gregory began making chauvinistic threats to Daizee Haze. This eventually climaxed with Delirious and Haze defeating Gregory and Sara Del Rey at Boiling Point 3.

A random draw to determine Hallowicked's partner took place and Delirious was the first chosen wrestler to be present, after The Rockin' Rebel and Roderick Strong. After defeating the team of Rorschach and Crossbones, Up in Smoke (Cheech and Cloudy), and Team DDT (KUDO and MIKAMI), the team went on to the semi-finals in the tournament, where they lost to The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli).Online World of Wrestling ‚Äì Chikara results The team has been moderately successful since then, winning the Campeonatos de Parejas on October 26 at Bruised. Delirious and Hallowicked have also taken to teaming with Cheech and Cloudy (aliases: Deliriouscito and Hallowickedcito) in 3 and 4-man tag team matches. The duo also currently hold the record for most number of successful title defenses of the Campeonatos De Parejas, currently at five successful defenses, including a rematch against the former champions, F.I.S.T. On September 21, 2008, Incoherence lost the titles to the Super Smash Bros. (Player Uno and Player Dos) in Cleveland, Ohio at Laying in the Gutter, Looking at the Stars. On May 23, 2009, Delirious was revealed as the new third member of the rudo (heel) stable The Order of the Neo-Solar Temple, joining UltraMantis Black and Crossbones, after having been abducted by them a month earlier. He was under the influence of UltraMantis' Eye of Tyr, a mysterious jewel that had the ability to control the mind of anyone, so long as it was touched on their foreheads. He came out wearing the colors of the Order and did not run around and scream at the opening bell. He defeated Arik Cannon that night, using UltraMantis Black's Praying Mantis Bomb finisher. The next night, he and the Order defeated the Super Smash Bros. and Create-A-Wrestler, Delirious again using the Praying Mantis Bomb to pick up the win. On November 22, 2009, at Season 8 finale Three-Fisted Tales Delirious and UltraMantis Black defeated Delirious' former team mates Hallowicked and Frightmare to earn their third point, which means that they can now challenge for the Campeonatos de Parejas. However, that same night UltraMantis lost possession of the Eye of Tyr to Tim Donst and the rudo stable Bruderschaft des Kreuzes, led by Ares and Claudio Castagnoli. Delirious and UltraMantis Black used their three points to get a match for the Campeonatos de Parejas on February 28, 2010, at A World of Comforting Illusions, but were defeated by the defending champions The Colony (Fire Ant and Soldier Ant), after Ares came out and used the Eye of Tyr to release Delirious from under the influence of UltraMantis, at which point he went crazy and ran out of the arena.

In April 2011, Delirious represented BDK in the 2011 King of Trios, alongside Tim Donst and Jakob Hammermeier. After defeating Da Soul Touchaz in the first round, the team was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals by The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant). During the tournament the BDK representatives were confronted by Delirious' former partners Hallowicked, Frightmare and UltraMantis Black, the last of whom had announced his intention of righting his past wrongs, namely his manipulation of Delirious. Delirious, seemingly remembering his past, ran out of the arena, while the rest of BDK began brawling with the trio also known as the Spectral Envoy. UltraMantis Black eventually recovered the Eye of Tyr on November 13, 2011, at High Noon and in January 2012 used it to release Delirious from BDK. However, on February 25, 2012, Delirious attacked UltraMantis in the middle of Spectral Envoy's match against F.I.S.T. for the Campeonatos de Parejas, resulting in F.I.S.T. retaining their title. The next night, Delirious, now able to speak in a coherent, intelligible manner due to smashing the Eye of Tyr, cut a promo stating that he remembered everything he had suffered while under the control of the Eye of Tyr and its holders, and he vowed to make UltraMantis suffer until 2014 as revenge for the two years that he had lost since UltraMantis first used the Eye of Tyr on him. On June 2 at Chikarasaurus Rex: How to Hatch a Dinosaur, Delirious formed a new alliance with Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon of The Batiri. At the following pay-per-view, Under the Hood on December 2, Delirious, Kobald, Kodama, Obariyon and Ophidian were defeated in a ten-man tag team match by UltraMantis Black, Frightmare, Hallowicked, Blind Rage and Crossbones, with Delirious being pinned by UltraMantis for the win. After Chikara's one-year hiatus, Delirious returned to the promotion, re-joining BDK on October 26, 2014. On December 6 at Tomorrow Never Dies, Delirious was defeated by UltraMantis Black and was, as a result, forced to leave the promotion. After the match, Delirious used the Eye of Tyr to turn Hallowicked and Frightmare against UltraMantis. =Pro Wrestling Noah (2009‚Äì2011)= In late 2009 Delirious began working for Japanese wrestling promotion Pro Wrestling Noah, making his debut on October 15 in a tag team match, where he and Keith Walker defeated Makoto Hashi and Yoshinari Ogawa.

In 22 career games, he pitched innings and posted a win-loss record of 3‚Äì7, with a 5.23 earned run average (ERA). Born in Thomaston, Georgia, Holloman served in World War II before starting his professional baseball career. From 1946 to 1952, he gradually rose up the minor leagues, and got a spring training invitation from the Chicago Cubs in 1950. After the 1952 season, Holloman was acquired by the St. Louis Browns, who placed him on the major league roster. Holloman made his MLB debut April 18, 1953. In his first start, on May 6, Holloman threw a no-hitter, becoming the only player to do so since 1900. He pitched in 22 games that season for the Browns, before being sold to a minor league team. Holloman spent the rest of 1953 and 1954 in the minor leagues, before retiring from active play. After retiring, he ran an advertising agency and worked as a scout, until his death in 1987. Early life Holloman was born in Thomaston, Georgia, and moved to Athens, Georgia, with his family when he was 17. In Athens, Holloman met Nan Stevens; the two were married on January 24, 1942, and they later had one son. He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II. After returning from the war, Holloman became an apprentice in a machine shop for the Georgia Railroad in Macon, Georgia. While working there, he played amateur baseball, and did well enough for his colleagues to convince him to try out for the Macon Peaches, the local baseball team. Holloman did so, and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers, where he began his professional career. Minor league career Holloman began his professional baseball career by recording a 20‚Äì5 record and a 2.33 ERA for the Packers as a rookie in the Class D Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League in 1946. He played winter baseball in Cuba, then had a record of 18‚Äì17 for the Macon Peaches of the Sally League the next year. Holloman started the 1948 season with Macon, then after winning eight games he was promoted to the Nashville Volunteers of the Class AA Southern Association, where he posted seven wins and two losses. While there, Volunteers owner Larry Gilbert gave Holloman the nickname \\"Bobo\\", because the pitcher reminded him of Bobo Newsom; the nickname stuck with him the rest of his career. In 1949, Holloman again spent the season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17‚Äì10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an invitation to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, for this reason that Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of the season with the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11‚Äì9 record and a 3.87 ERA. The following season, Augusta sold Holloman‚Äôs contract to the Syracuse Chiefs of the AAA International League, and he posted a 16‚Äì7 record and a 2.51 ERA with the team. After the season ended, Holloman played winter baseball in Puerto Rico for the Cangrejeros de Santurce. With Santurce, he had a 15‚Äì5 record during the regular season. After the season ended, Holloman participated in the 1953 Caribbean Series, and won two of the six games Santurce played, allowing them to win the title. Major leagues and later life In October 1952, Holloman was signed by the St. Louis Browns after they traded Duke Markell and $35,000 to acquire him. Heading into the season, manager Marty Marion was high on him, considering Holloman to be a pitcher who could have won 20 games with Syracuse the year prior, had he not missed time due to an appendectomy. Holloman made his MLB debut on April 14, in a relief appearance. He made in three additional relief appearances afterward, allowing five runs in innings through his first four games. As a result, Holloman asked Marion for a start, claiming he was better in that role, and if he was just going to be used as a relief pitcher, he should be sold to another team. Marion gave in, and selected Holloman to start a home game on May 6, against the Philadelphia Athletics. On a rainy night, before a crowd of 2,473 at Sportsman's Park, Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first major league start. He had two hits as a batter, and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6‚Äì0 victory. In his autobiography, Browns owner Bill Veeck called Holloman's no- hitter \\"the quaintest no-hitter in the history of the game,\\" saying that Holloman‚Äôs pitches were \\"belted\\" all night, but he was saved by luck and outstanding defense. Holloman is one of three pitchers to throw a no-hitter in their first major league start. The others were Ted Breitenstein, who accomplished the feat in 1891, and Bumpus Jones, who did so in 1892. However, Breitenstein and Jones threw their no-hitters before the 1893 rule change that moved the pitcher's delivery point back to 60 feet, six inches, from home plate. The no-hitter cemented Holloman's spot in the starting rotation for the next month. In his next start, against the Athletics, Holloman lasted barely an inning, allowing two runs and three walks, before leaving the game due to a blistered finger. His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians, but his third win did not come until a month later, against the Boston Red Sox, where he allowed two hits in eight innings of work. Outside of the three wins, however, Holloman was ineffective; in 22 games, 10 of them starts, Holloman had a 3‚Äì7 record with a 5.23 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 50 walks. As a result, after his final appearance on July 19, the Browns put him on waivers, and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Holloman finished the 1953 season with Toronto, and had a 4‚Äì3 record in 13 games. In 1954, his last professional season, Holloman spent time on five different minor league squads, including former stops Toronto and Augusta, before retiring. The retirement was partially due to a sore arm, the result of pitching too frequently while playing winter ball. After retiring, Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency, and served as a scout for the Baltimore Orioles. He also turned to drinking for many years, but was able to overcome the addiction. He died on May 1, 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens, Georgia of a heart attack.

History Allmusic author, Wilson Neate, stated this of the group, \\"High Tide had the muscularity of a no-nonsense proto-metal band, but they also ventured into prog territory with changing time signatures and tempos, soft-hard dynamics, multi-part arrangements, and even some ornate faux-Baroque interludes\\". High Tide made their first recordings as the backing band on Denny Gerrard's album Sinister Morning.Shaw, Adrian. (2000) \\"Tony Hill interview\\". Perfect Sound Forever magazine. Gerrard returned the favor by producing their first album, Sea Shanties, which was released in October 1969. Though it met with a scathing review in Melody Maker, reviews in the underground press were universally positive, and sales were just enough to convince Liberty to give the green light to a second album.Powell, Mark (2006). \\"High Tide - Sea Shanties\\". In Sea Shanties (pp.8-10) [CD booklet]. London: Eclectic Entertainment Ltd. This second album, High Tide, was released the following year. A third album was being recorded in 1970, but Roger Hadden, who had been suffering from chronic mental instability and depression since before joining High Tide, had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized before the album could be finished. Unable to continue without Hadden, the group split up. During the late 1970s, Hill and House recorded Interesting Times as a duo, taking turns playing bass and using a drum machine to replace Roger Hadden. The album featured heavy use of synthesizers, which to an extent supplanted the use of House's violin. The album was originally released as a mail order cassette, and issued on vinyl and CD in 1989 and 1990.Joynson, Vernon (1995). The Tapestry of Delights . London: Borderline Books. Any possibilities of further recordings from this semi-reunion were dissolved when House rejoined Hawkwind in 1990. However, under the encouragement of drummer Drachen Theaker, Hill pushed out no less than five albums under the High Tide banner by the end of the following year, starting with two discs of retrospective material, and then with three albums recorded by an entirely new band. The first retrospective release, Precious Cargo, consists of sessions recorded in 1970 by the original group, but their exact nature is not specified. It has been theorized, however, that they are the rehearsal sessions for their unfinished third album. One song, \\"The Great Universal Protection Racket\\"(mislabeled on the album as \\"Exploration\\"), had been recorded for Sea Shanties but went unreleased at the time due to space constraints. None of the other six songs were used in any earlier recordings. The second retrospective album, The Flood, is a collection of demos of various origins. It includes four demos recorded by the original High Tide shortly before their breakup, six demos recorded in 1971 and 1976 by Tony Hill and Peter Pavli with other musicians, and a Peter Pavli solo demo from 1979. The new band which recorded the remaining High Tide albums consisted of Tony Hill (guitars and bass), Dave Tomlin (violin and bass), and Drachen Theaker (drums), though various guest musicians also contributed, included a few appearances by Peter Pavli and Simon House. Eschewing the tight, complex compositions which were the staple of the original High Tide, the new band's albums Ancient Gates and The Reason of Success consisted almost solely of lengthy improvised performances with little to no compositional basis. Between these two albums was released A Fierce Nature. Tony Hill wrote all the songs on A Fierce Nature and played everything but the drums. A two disc compilation album, Open Season, was released in 2000. However, with the exceptions of a new Tony Hill solo track, a new Peter Pavli solo track, and a short track from Ancient Gates, the content was drawn entirely from The Flood and The Reason of Success. The tracks \\"Futilist's Lament\\" and \\"Blankman Cries Again\\" are on the United Artists Records 2004 sampler All Good Clean Fun CD re-package (Liberty 8660902), but High Tide did not appear on the original 1971 LP.

It was first released for the PlayStation 2 on December 28, 2004 as an all-ages title, and was followed by an adult version playable on Microsoft Windows and subsequent all-ages versions for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3. This deviated from the release history of the game's predecessor, To Heart, which was originally released with adult content prior to receiving versions with such content removed. The gameplay in To Heart 2 follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction based on the player's decisions. Its story centers on the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters. The game was positively received in both sales and popularity. Its original PlayStation 2 release sold more than 82,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and it was voted as the third best bish≈çjo game by the readers of Dengeki G's Magazine in 2007. It has since received several spin-off titles, including a sequel entitled To Heart 2 Another Days, which was released on February 29, 2008 for Windows, and has also made transitions to other media. There have been six anime adaptations of To Heart 2: an anime television adaptation produced by OLM's Team Iguchi, which was first broadcast in Japan between October 3, 2005 and January 2, 2006; and five original video animation series produced by Aquaplus and Chaos Project. Four manga series, fifteen sets of manga anthologies, three Internet radio shows, two drama CDs, and six novel adaptations based on To Heart 2 have also been produced. Gameplay Average dialogue and narrative in To Heart 2 depicting the main character Takaaki talking to Manaka. To Heart 2 is a romance \\"novel-type adventure game\\" in which the player assumes the role of Takaaki Kouno, who begins his second year of high school after reuniting with a childhood friend. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Takaaki is talking to, appearing over background artwork. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. A gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music is available on the game's title screen. To Heart 2 follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. The game divides each school day of the storyline into four segments. These segments illustrate the events that occur during Takaaki's commute to school, during school, after school, and after he returns home at the end of each day. Depending on the time of the day and the player's actions, he or she may be presented one of three types of events: mandatory events, which occur automatically during certain points in the game's plot line; temporary events, which occur during certain periods of time only if specific conditions are met; or after school events, which occur at the end of each school day. At the end of each school day, the player will be given the option to navigate to various locations within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines. In the PlayStation 2 version, there are nine plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story except Sango and Ruri, who share the same plot line. This is expanded to ten plot lines in the Windows and PlayStation Portable versions with the addition of Sasara's scenario, and further expanded to eleven scenarios in the PlayStation 3 version with the addition of Mio's scenario. In order to view all of the plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in alternate directions. In all versions, the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days scenario in To Heart 2 Another Days, which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines. To Heart 2 X Rated, the Windows version of the visual novel, includes two additional minigames that serve to lengthen the experience the game provides; these minigames do not affect the main plot in any way. In both minigames, the player controls one of the heroines from To Heart 2 storyline, who is made available upon the completion of her scenario in the main portion of the game. The first of the two minigames, titled , is a scrolling shooter in which the player's goal is to progress through a vertically scrolling level, while attacking enemies that resemble confectioneries and dodging their attacks. The second, titled , is a puzzle game in which the player competes against an opponent for the highest score, by connecting three or more books of the same color and eliminating them from the screen. Plot and characters To Heart 2 story revolves around the male protagonist Takaaki Kouno, a high school student who has an aversion to most girls around him, and focuses on his interactions with his schoolmates. The story begins on March 1, 2004, when Takaaki's parents leave for an overseas business trip.Untranslated quote: „Äå‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„ÅÇ„ÄÅ„Åù„ÅÜ„Åã„ÄÇ‰ªäÊó•„Åã„ÇâË¶™Áà∂„ÇÇ„ÅäË¢ã„ÇÇÂá∫Âºµ„ÅßÂÆ∂„ÇíÁïôÂÆà„Å´„Åô„Çã„Åã„Çâ„ÄÅË™∞„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„Å™„ÅÑ„Çì„Å†„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ„Äç Translated quote: \\"...oh, that's right. Because both Dad and Mom left for a business trip today, nobody is home.\\" That morning, Konomi Yuzuhara, Takaaki's childhood friend, comes to meet Takaaki for their commute to school. Konomi is a cheerful and innocent, but childish girl. She is one year younger than Takaaki, who often views her as a younger sister.Untranslated quote: „Äå‰∏Ä‰∫∫„Å£Â≠ê„Å†„Å£„Åü‰ø∫„Å´„Å®„Å£„Å¶„ÅØ„ÄÅÂ¶π„Åø„Åü„ÅÑ„Å™„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åã„Å™„ÄÇ„Äç Translated quote: \\"As I am an only child, [Konomi] is something like a sister to me.\\" The two are also friends with Yuuji Kousaka, who is in the same class as Takaaki. Despite being the son of a wealthy and prestigious family, Yuuji has a frivolous and carefree personality, and often flirts with the girls at school. Takaaki later reunites with Tamaki Kousaka, another childhood friend, who had promised to return before being enrolled into a boarding school. Tamaki has a strong and dominant personality, and tends to act as an elder sister figure to those around her. She later transfers into Takaaki's high school upon the beginning of the new school year. Throughout the story, Takaaki meets several other heroines attending his school. The first is Manaka Komaki, a timid, clumsy, but accommodating girl who is the vice class representative of Takaaki's class. She often spends time in the school library's storage, and helps the library committee with general tasks. Similar to Takaaki, she is inarticulate around the opposite gender. Manaka is also close friends with Yuma Tonami, an aggressive girl who commutes to school by a mountain bike. Yuma sees Takaaki as a rival after she first met him at school, and often challenges him to various duels. She often laments her grandfather's insistence of having her take over the family business, and attempts to hide her family background from Takaaki. Karin Sasamori is a schoolmate of Takaaki's and the founder of the school's mystery club. Karin has a cheerful and energetic personality, and has an odd affection towards the occult and objects such as egg sandwiches. She first meets Takaaki early in the story, and later deceives him into joining the mystery club. Sango Himeyuri is an underclassman who takes a liking to Takaaki. She is lively and innocent, but also intelligent. She is in particular proficient in computer-related subjects, and designed multiple humanoid maid robots as an engineer for Kurusugawa Electronics. Ruri Himeyuri is another underclassman of Takaaki and Sango's younger twin sister. In contrast to her older sister, Ruri has a bad- mouthed and hostile personality. She is very protective of Sango, and often regards Takaaki's interactions with her in bad faith. Lucy Maria Misora is a girl whom Takaaki meets one day on his way home. She has a calm personality and opens up to very few people except him. Lucy claims to be an alien, and speaks a unique language she calls the . She later attends Takaaki's school under the name R≈´ko Kireinasora. Y≈´ki Kusakabe is a gentle and well-mannered girl who often lingers in the school building at night. She was one of Takaaki's classmates in elementary school, but has since transferred away because of her parents' divorce. Two heroines were subsequently added to To Heart 2 story in later versions of the game. Sasara Kusugawa becomes the student council president of Takaaki's school during his second year. She inherits her position from the previous president Ma-ryan, as she is the only remaining student council member after the latter's graduation. Sasara is very diligent, often completing all of the student council's tasks by herself. She is often feared by students for her strict attitude, but is actually disguising a shy and gentle personality. Mio Hanesaki is Takaaki's classmate. She remains largely unnoticed by other students, most of whom remain oblivious of her name. She originally ties her hair up and wears eyeglasses, but later wears contact lens and her hair untied as an attempt by Takaaki to change the impression she gives to others. Development To Heart 2 development originally began as a collaborative effort for the PlayStation 2 between the Osaka and Tokyo studios of Aquaplus. During one of the staff meetings for the partnered project, To Heart 2 was conceived when a staff member jokingly mentioned the possibility of a sequel for the original To Heart. Production began shortly after once the team realized the popularity and success of the forerunner. Naoya Shimokawa, the president of Aquaplus, produced the resulting project, and Tsutomu Washimi served as the game's director. The work on the game's scenario was split between four writers. Sh≈çsuke Miyake drafted the game's overall storyline as well as the scenarios for Sango, Ruri, and Lucy; Nagare Makura wrote the scenarios for Manaka and Yuma; Takeshi Marui for Karin and Y≈´ki; and Munemitsu for Konomi and Tamaki. Likewise, the game's character designs were split amongst four artists. Misato Mitsumi provided the character designs and illustrations for Konomi and Yuma; Hisashi Kawata for Lucy and Karin; Tatsuki Amazuyu for Tamaki and Manaka; and Takeshi Nakamura for Sango, Ruri, and Y≈´ki. The game's music was composed by Shimokawa, Junya Matsuoka, Shinya Ishikawa, Kazue Nakagami, and Michio Kinugasa. Since the development staff had an equal number of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that the development team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem. Rather than creating a new setting for To Heart 2, the development team chose to roll over various inherent features from the original. The majority of the game is set within the same school and town, but instead focuses on the northern side of town, rather than the southern side, which is the primary setting of To Heart. The story is set two years after To Heart, and its lack of mobile phones was an attempt to replicate the technological themes of its predecessor. Despite the story's inclusion of maid robots, the writers stated that the story's setting was influenced by the 1990s, during which To Heart took place. As the only artist to return from the original's development team, Kawata was consulted by the other illustrators for character designs. He commented that the other artists attempted to create their designs with respect to the previous work, but he decided otherwise by attempting to \\"shape a new image\\" for the designs. The illustrators avoided creating a character with green hair as a heroine, because of the overwhelming impression the character Multi had left them in To Heart. Miyake noted that it was difficult for him to write the scenario for To Heart 2 because the game's development began during the time he was writing December When There Is No Angel, and Ruri and Sango's original scenario had to be rewritten because of their overwhelming resemblance to the latter title. =Release history= To Heart 2 was first released as an all-ages title for the PlayStation 2 on December 28, 2004 in three versions: a limited edition, a deluxe edition, and a regular edition. The limited edition release contains the game itself, an original soundtrack disc, a visual concept collection, a calendar, and a special casing; the deluxe edition contains the extras included in the limited edition and a version of To Heart playable on the PS2; the regular edition does not contain the aforementioned extras. The original PS2 version was followed by an adult version entitled To Heart 2 X Rated (stylized as ToHeart2 XRATED). It was first released on December 9, 2005 for Microsoft Windows PCs as a limited edition, and was subsequently followed by a regular edition release on December 23, 2005.

Martlesham remained a strongly agricultural area, but the main settlement shifted over the years from the highest ground (where the church and hall are situated) to the point where the main London to Great Yarmouth road crosses the River Finn , a tributary to the Deben. By the mid-15th century, a bridge had been built across the river at this point. White's 1844 directory of Suffolk describes Martlesham as \\"a neat village near the confluence of a rivulet with the Deben\\" and states that it has in its parish \\"510 inhabitants, and of land, partly in rich marshes washed by the tides of the Deben, and partly a large, sandy, and unenclosed heath, extending about S.W., and affording pasturage for numerous herds of sheep and cattle.\\" In 1917, the Experimental Aircraft Flight of the Central Flying School was transferred from Upavon, Wiltshire to a site on the heathland at Martlesham and,History of Idminton on 16 January 1917, Martlesham Heath Airfield was officially opened as an experimental airfield.

For example, if a court finds that the plaintiff's painting was stolen by the defendant, then the plaintiff has two possible routes to restore the loss. The plaintiff can elect to either receive monetary damages equal to the entire value of the painting, or the plaintiff can ask the court to order the return of the stolen property (plus some minor amount of compensation for the suffering caused by its deprivation). However, the plaintiff cannot have both, and must therefore make an election of one or the other. Under the old common law of England, a party had to make an election of remedies at the time that the complaint was filed. Most jurisdictions have since abandoned that requirement.

Community investment Direct Energy encourages volunteerism within their organization through internal company policies, award programs, and grants. Direct Energy encourages their employees to take their first step into community involvement by offering one paid volunteer day a year. Interested employees can choose a charity or organization to lend their expertise. ;Volunteer Citizen of the Year The Volunteer Citizen of the Year award program allows citizens to nominate individuals or organizations who have through volunteer work made their community better. The winner can choose a charity to receive $5000. Last year, the award went to Paul Garrett for his efforts towards cleaning his community and encouraging sustainable practices. Garret chose to give the donation to the Mechanicsburg Area School District's Trails and Trees Environmental Center. ;Reduce Your Use For Good The Reduce Your Use For Good grant program was created to help organizations increase the energy efficiency of their program or products. In the past the grant has allowed various organization to increase efficiency. In the past the grant was awarded to a Pittsburgh community food bank, Medina Creative Housing, and Animal Protectors of Allegheny Valley. Deregulation position Former CEO Chris Weston has given several speeches stating the need for deregulation of the energy market and the need for consumers to pay the actual price for energy rather than what he considers its current artificially low position. Weston spoke at KEMA‚Äôs 21st Executive Forum on the benefits of a competitive energy market and the value it has to consumers. He has also authored opinion pieces on the subject. Controversies ;Sales employee oversight May 2004 - Direct Energy was fined $157,500 CAD in 2003 after investigators discovered 25 of their sales agents were forging contracts to trap Ontario and US citizens into long-term energy contracts. After the forgeries committed by sales employees were discovered, Direct Energy president Paul Massara reported that \\"action [was taken to] deal with these issues and we've moved on a long way since that time.\\" May 2009 - Some Direct Energy sales people failed to make it clear to customers that they were signing up for unregulated energy rates. In order to prevent this issue from continuing, Direct Energy worked with the Service Alberta to train staff and implement practices that would prevent sales people from purposefully or accidentally misleading citizens about energy plans. The company was fined over $5,000 in penalties for the damages caused by the negligence. The Ontario government has since passed a bill that would require energy retailers to follow up on each contract sold to ensure the customer had willingly made the purchase which should allow energy companies to ensure that customers were not swayed by unethical sales pitches. ;Water Heater Rental Contracts March 2012 - Direct Energy, Reliance Comfort, and other water heater customers allegedly created water heater contracts with high exit fees, long term contracts, and high buyout charges to make it difficult for current customers to switch suppliers. In November 2012, federal Competition Bureau began looking into whether water heater companies are currently engaging in anti-competitive practices. ;Late Penalties March 2014 - An Alberta judge has certified a class action lawsuit against Direct Energy alleging the company violated the Criminal Code and Canada's Interest Act. The lawsuit alleges Direct Energy's late payment penalties were effectively charging customers a 91 percent interest rate on late payments. The class action is still in process.

It lies below a cellular aggregation known as the enamel organ. The dental papilla appears after 8‚Äì10 weeks intra uteral life. The dental papilla gives rise to the dentin and pulp of a tooth. The enamel organ, dental papilla, and dental follicle together forms one unit, called the tooth germ. This is of importance because all the tissues of a tooth and its supporting structures form from these distinct cellular aggregations. Similar to dental follicle, the dental papilla has a very rich blood supply and provides nutrition to the enamel organ. Embryology  Formation of dental papilla occurs in the Cap stage of Odontogenesis. = The cap stage = The cap stage is the second stage of tooth development and occurs during the ninth or tenth week of prenatal development. Unequal proliferation of the tooth bud forms a three-dimensional cap shape. Overlying this cap structure is the ectomesenchyme, which is attached to the mesodermal tissue known as the dental papilla superiorly, and lies within the epithelial concavity. Various types of differentiation occur at this stage; such as cytodifferentiation, histodifferentiation and morphodifferentation. Histodifferentiation is the differentiation of different tissue types during the development of an embryo/ undifferentiated group of cells. Furthermore, morphogenesis is a predominant physiological process during the cap stage. This is due to formation of primordium of the tooth. The primordium contains each of the primordial tissue types, essential for the development of successive teeth. These primordial tissues together form the enamel organ, dental papilla and dental sac. Also during the cap stage is the formation of a depression within the deepest part of each tooth bud of the dental lamina. The dental lamina is a band of epithelial tissue which connects the developing tooth bud to the oral epithelium. The dental lamina eventually disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is reabsorbed. The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins at the sixth week in utero. This is responsible for the cap like structure of the enamel organ. It is important to note that enamel is an ectodermal product as it is originally derived from ectoderm which is the outermost of the three germ layers of the forming embryo. The other two are: the mesoderm and the endoderm. It gives rise to the nervous system, sense organs, outer layer of the skin, teeth and the membrane lining the oral cavity (mouth). A section of the ectomesenchyme (a group of tissue made up of neurocrest cells which are present in the initial development of an embryo. This forms the hard and soft tissues of the neck and skull), condenses into a mass within the concavity of the cap of the enamel organ. This mass is now considered the dental papilla. Note that dental papilla is originally derived from ectomesenchyme. Ectomesenchyme (type of mesenchyme) is derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). A basement membrane exists between the enamel organ and dental papilla which will be the site of the future dentinoenamel junction. The dentinoenamel junction is the surface at which the enamel and the dentin of the crown of a tooth are joined.The American Heritage¬Æ Medical Dictionary Copyright ¬© 2007, 2004 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company The existing ectomesenchyme around the outside of the cap of the enamel organ then condenses into the dental sac. A basement membrane separate the enamel organ and the dental sac. The dental sac produces the periodontium in future development. The periodontium is the tissue that surrounds and supports the teeth. It includes the connective tissue and overlying keratinised membrane lining the oral cavity that surrounds the teeth, the periodontal ligament, cementum which provides a protective covering for the root surface and supporting alveolar bone = The Bell Stage = This is the fourth stage of tooth development which occurs between the eleventh and twelfth week of prenatal development. During this stage of Odontogenesis, the epithelial tooth germ forms a bell - shaped structure in the labio - lingual section and is characterised by the formation of the dental sac. The peripheral cells of the dental papilla undergo differentiation, growing larger in size and taking a columnar (uni-layered) form and are now referred to as Odontoblasts (the outer part of the dental pulp). This differentiation begins at the apex of the dental papilla, gradually extending downwards. This differentiation occurs to supplement the development of the dental sac which is responsible which is responsible for cementum, periodontal ligament and the alveolar process.  Epithelium Layers  \\\\- Inner * is separated from the peripheral cells of the dental papilla by a basement membrane and a cell free zone * rich in RNA but do not contain alkaline phosphatase -Outer * involved in the maintenance of the shape of the enamel and the environment * contain very big nuclei and have small quantities of the intra-cellular organelles involved in protein synthesis. The cells contact each other through desmosomes and gap junctions -Stratum Is concerned with: * the synthesis of proteins * the transport of materials to and from the enamel- forming cells in the internal enamel epithelium * the concentration of materials = The Apposition Stage and the Maturation Stage = During the apposition stage the enamel, dentin and cementum are secreted in successive layers. The mesenchymal tissue of dental papilla and dental sac and the ectodermal tissue of enamel undergo induction. The outer cells of dental papilla are induced by preameloblasts (cells within the enamel from which a cell that takes part in forming dental enamel develops)Mosby's Dental Dictionary, 2nd edition. ¬© 2008 Elsevier, Inc. to differentiate into odontoblasts (dentin-secreting cells). The odontoblasts undergo differentiation and repolarization and result in formation of the dentin matrix/pre-dentin (the innermost section of the dentin, which is not mineralized and located adjacent to pulp tissues in the crown area and root area).J Nat Sci Biol Med. 2015 Jul-Dec; The central cells of dental papilla form the primordium of the pulp during root development. These cells then become surrounded by newly formed dentin..  Differentiation  Ectomesenchymal cells will multiply continuously in a localized area such that when the bell stage of development is reached, both the epithelial component and the ectomesenchymal component will seem to have been surrounded by something that presents as a fibrous sac. Therefore, among a complicated mass of highly differentiated cells, it would appear to have three major components, which are: 1) The Dental Follicle ‚Üí The ectomesenchymal cells which are part of the fibrous sac that have been formed 2) The Dental Papilla ‚Üí The ectomesenchymal cells which are lying deep to the enamel organ 3) The Enamel Organ ‚Üí purely the epithelial component The tissues which have been derived from each of the three components are as followed: 1) The Dental Follicle ‚Üí will develop to become the periodontal ligament, the cementum and the alveolar bone 2) The Dental Papilla ‚Üí will develop to become the dental pulp and the dentine 3) The Enamel Organ ‚Üí will develop to create the enamel solely It is important to note that till this point, no dental tissues have been created yet. When all of the individual components of the tooth germ have become developed, the entire cell mass would have appeared to have migrated deeper into the underlying connective tissues. This phenomenon, which will continue throughout the whole life of the teeth, is most possibly due to the cell mass moving towards a rich blood supply that can be found in the deeper parts of the mandible (lower jaw) and the maxilla (upper jaw) The probable need for a rich blood supply would seem to show that the cell mass will soon be highly productive in the formation of dental tissues. Therefore, when the late bell stage of the tooth germ development has been reached, most of the cells would have been differentiated to an apparent endpoint where the cells will now begin their formative role when the first three stages of the tissue development are almost completed, and the tissues can now start to begin secreting.  Nerve and Vascular Supply during Early Development  = Vascular Supply = Clusters of blood vessels are found branching out around the tooth germ in the dental follicle and going into the dental papilla during the cap stage. In the dental papilla the number of blood vessels increase and the matrix deposition will begin once the maximum is reached during the bell stage. Blood vessels going into the dental papilla are formed into groups that coincides with the positions of where the roots will develop in future. As time passes, the viability of the tissue is affected as the blood supply becomes steadily reduced in stages and the volume of pulpal tissue starts decreasing too. = Nerve Supply = During the bud to cap stage of tooth development, the pioneer nerve fibers head towards the developing tooth. The nerve fibers will branch out and create a rich plexus around the tooth germ in that structure as the dental follicle is the clear target of these dental nerve fibers. The dental follicle is a fibrous sac that surrounds the odontogenic organ and developing tooth. The plexus is a system of connections of blood vessels, nerves, or lymphatic vessels. The plexus of Raschkow is a network of nerves immediately beneath the odonblast layer of the dentine, first described by J. Raschkow in 1835. However, the nerve fibers will only begin entering the dental papilla (pulp) when Dentinogenesis starts. The timing is not similar to the establishment of the neural supply and the papillary vascular supply even though a feasible relationship has been assumed between the developing nerve and blood supplies. Furthermore, histo-chemistry studies have shown that in the makeup of pioneer nerve fibers heading towards the tooth germ, automatic nerve fibers are not present. Therefore, the starting innervation of the developing teeth is involved with the sensory innovation of the future periodontal ligament and pulp. Nerve fibers never enters the enamel organ. Nerve-related signaling molecules, such as Glial cell line-derived growth factor, Neurotrophin and semaphoring are among the few which have been studied during the tooth development process. Of which, the verve-related signaling molecules seems to show a trend that suggest an early implication of innervation of tooth development. Similar to how many molecules are able to stimulate axonal growth or migration, various molecules are also within the bounds of possibility of being involved in the initial innervation of the tooth germ.  Odontoblast Differentiation  It is paramount to understand how odontoblast differentiate from ectomesenchymal cells to allow comprehension and explanation of normal development and to be able to affect their recruitment when needed to start repairing the dentin. Growth factors in the cells of the inner enamel epithelium and expressions of signaling molecules bring about the differentiation of odontoblast through normal development of the dental papilla. Exhibiting a central nucleus and few organelles, the dental papilla cells are small and undifferentiated. At this stage, the cells are separated by an acellular zone, that consist of some fine collagen fibrils, from the inner enamel epithelium. Changes will also start occurring in the adjacent dental papilla, very quickly after reversed polarity of the cells of the inner enamel epithelium. To contain increasing amounts of protein-synthesizing organelles, odontoblasts as their cytoplasm ( the liquid inside a cell but outside the nucleus) increases in volume after the ectomesenchymal cells beside the acellular zone rapidly enlarge and elongate to become preodontoblasts. When the odontoblasts differentiate and increase in size to occupy the acellular zone between the dental papilla and the inner enamel epithelium, the zone slowly is removed. With their nuclei positioned away from the inner enamel epithelium, these newly differentiated cells are distinguished by being highly polarized.

At the time of his death it was said he was involved in 497 films as a producer, distributor or financier. Levine was responsible for the US releases of Godzilla, King of the Monsters!; Attila; and Hercules, which helped revolutionize US film marketing. Other films produced included Two Women, Contempt, The 10th Victim, Marriage Italian Style, The Lion in Winter, The Producers, The Graduate, The Night Porter, A Bridge Too Far and Carnal Knowledge. Biography =Birth and early life= Levine was born in a slum in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 9, 1905. The youngest of six children of a Russian-Jewish immigrant tailor, Joe did whatever work he could to help support his mother, a widow who had remarried only to have her second husband abandon her. This led Joe (in his later years) to tell an interviewer that he had known (in his words) \\"not one happy day\\" growing up. At 14 years of age he was hired for full-time work in a dress factory and left school, never to re- enroll. In the 1920s in partnership with two of his older brothers, Joe opened a basement dress shop, whose stock the Levine brothers obtained on consignment. He had multiple other jobs and operated the Cafe Wonderbar in Boston's Back Bay during this period and during the early and middle 1930s. =Marriage and distribution career= In 1937, Levine encountered Rosalie Harrison, then a singer with Rudy Vallee's band, and left the restaurant business for her; within a week of their engagement, at Harrison's insistence, Levine sold the Cafe Wonderbar. They married the following year and moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where Joe bought, and commenced to run, a movie theater. Eventually, he became a successful, if small-time, distributor and exhibitor throughout New England, buying \\"decrepit\\" Westerns at low rates for his theaters, which eventually totalled seven, including three drive-ins. One of Levine's most unusual successes was Body Beautiful, a sex-hygiene film which he saw drawing a line of prospective ticket-buyers who were braving a snowstorm to that end. He later remembered buying it to show in his theaters because \\"it made me sick.\\" He was also a representative for Burstyn-Mayer distributing Italian films such as Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City (1945) and Pais√† (1946), and Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). The Second World War led Levine to run an almost jingoistic promotion of the film Ravaged Earth, which had been shot in China. Renting the Shubert Theater in his native Boston, he spent large sums of his own money on advertisements for the film that he wrote himself; these reflected the anti-Japanese sentiments of the times and used language that would later be considered offensive. Robertson's obituary quotes one of the slogans as reading: \\"Jap Rats Stop at Nothing - See This. It Will Make You Fighting Mad.\\" During the 1950s, he became an area sub- distributor for newly-formed American International Pictures. In 1956, he bought the Australian film Walk Into Paradise, its low box-office revenues led him to change the title to Walk Into Hell, which gave it box-office success. Levine discovered that double features with the same cast members or similar titles brought in higher box-office revenues; this led him to present two films together because they had similar titles. In the 1960s he built two cinemas on 57th Street in New York City - the Lincoln Art Theatre and the Festival Theatre. =Producing career= Embassy Pictures is born He entered film production in 1945, co-producing with Maxwell Finn a documentary Gaslight Follies, a compilation of silent film clips narrated by Ben Grauer, which was released through his own company, Embassy Pictures. He found success in 1956 bringing the Japanese film Godzilla to the American general public, acquiring the rights for $12,000 and spending $400,000 promoting it under the title Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, and earning $1 million in theatrical rentals. He then made a $100,000 deal to bring the 1954 French-Italian film Attila to the U.S. in 1958 and spent $600,000 promoting it, which returned $2 million in rentals. His breakthrough came the following year with Hercules, starring Steve Reeves and released by Warner Bros.. Levine invested $120,000 on dubbing, sound effects and new titles and spent $1.25 million on promoting the film. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, with rentals of $4.7 million. The promotion of Sophia Loren Levine's Embassy Pictures began dealing in art films, often European ones, in the 1960s. During that decade, he reached the peak of his career and his prestige, which he was able to sustain into the 1970s. In 1961, Levine bought North American distribution rights for Two Women after seeing no more than three minutes of its \\"rushes.\\" He was not credited as the \\"executive producer\\" of Two Women, which was based on a novella written by Alberto Moravia, had been directed by Vittorio de Sica, and starred Sophia Loren and Eleanora Brown, who acted out the respective roles of a mother and her young daughter whom World War II had displaced from their home. One segment of it showed Moroccan soldiers raping the mother and the daughter. Levine's promotional campaign focused on one still photograph, which showed Loren, as the mother, wearing a torn dress, kneeling in the dirt, and weeping with rage and grief. Predicting that she would win the Academy Award for her performance, Levine brought Loren to the United States for interviews, bought space for, and placed, large advertisements in newspapers, and saw to it that Two Women appeared in the cities of residence of Academy Award jury members. Levine's efforts paid off when Loren became the first cast member of a foreign-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Actress. It came to be said of him that he \\"nursed\\" Two Women towards its ultimate popularity and success. Later deals and sale of Embassy In 1963, Levine was offered a $30 million deal with Paramount Pictures (making him a major shareholder) to produce films in the vein of his previous successes. Paramount would finance the films and Embassy would receive part of its profits. Following the deal, Levine paid Harold Robbins $900,000 for the rights to three books which were filmed - The Carpetbaggers (1964), Where Love Has Gone (1964) and Nevada Smith (1966). Carroll Baker who had appeared in The Carpetbaggers then starred in the Embassy's Harlow (1965). Levine got to know Mike Nichols who was one of the most in-demand directors on Broadway and signed him to make The Graduate (1967) before he made his feature film debut with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). It was the highest- grossing film of the year. Levine also hired first-time director Mel Brooks to make The Producers (1967). Levine later said \\"I have a knack for betting on unknown directors and actors and getting my money's worth\\". The same year, Levine sold Embassy to Avco for $40 million but stayed on as chief executive officer. He later called the sale a \\"horrible mistake which made me rich\\". The Lion in Winter (1968), Levine's favorite of his films, won an Academy Award for Katharine Hepburn. After the sale, his films did not perform well except for Mike Nichols' Carnal Knowledge (1971) and A Touch of Class (1973), his last hit. He resigned from Avco Embassy in 1974 and formed Joseph E. Levine Presents and spent 2¬Ω years making A Bridge Too Far (1977) with his son Richard. His last film was Tattoo (1981). =Broadway= In April 1964, David Susskind, Daniel Melnick, and Levine took over as producers for the Broadway musical Kelly. Levine financed $250,000 of the $400,000 budget, with the balance coming from Columbia Records and six other investors. The producers also acquired the motion picture rights. Directed and choreographed by Herbert Ross, the musical began previews at the Broadhurst Theatre on February 1, 1965 and opened (and closed) on February 6 after seven previews and one performance, becoming one of the biggest flops in Broadway history. Industry representatives quoted in The New York Times stated they \\"could not recall any other Broadway musical representing such a comparable expenditure that became a casualty so quickly.\\" Costs had ballooned to $650,000, with the biggest loser being Levine, followed by Melnick and Susskind, who had invested a total of $150,000. There had been increasing arguments between the producers and writers, with Susskind complaining that the authors were unwilling to make changes per the recommendations of the investors. Charlap and Lawrence were so upset with changes that they filed suit in New York Supreme Court seeking an injunction to prevent the play from opening. While the judge urged that the parties pursue arbitration, lawyers representing Charlap and Lawrence were threatening to sue for damages that had been caused through \\"unauthorized changes, omissions and additions\\" made to the musical. =Trademarks= Levine became famous in the industry for his massive advertising campaigns, starting with Hercules in 1959. Levine had hired Terry Turner, who had been a former RKO Pictures exploitation expert of the late 1920s and 1930s, where he had exploited King Kong amongst other films. Levine's and Turner's exploitation campaigns were designed to appeal both to the general public and to the film industry and exhibitors. The Adventurers (1970) had a special \\"airborne world premiere\\", as the in-flight movie of a TWA Boeing 747 Superjet making its premiere voyage, flying from New York to Los Angeles, with the film's stars and members of the press aboard. It marked the first time that a movie and a plane premiered in the same event. =Honors= In 1964, Levine received the Golden Globe Cecil B.

Other events of note included a row between the Trotskyists of the RSL/Militant Tendency dominated Labour Party Young Socialists (LPYS) and the festival organisers (the British Labour Party's student wing, the National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS) sided with the organisers in trying to keep the LPYS delegation - led by Tommy Sheridan - out).

Amnesty International described the killings as a \\"massacre\\", saying people in military uniform had killed people suspected of supporting the rebel Patriotic Movement of C√¥te d'Ivoire. The killings were allegedly based on their Muslim names or that the victims were nationals of Mali, Burkino Faso or Guinea.

Jackson, Henry Clews, and Djelal Munif Bey at Columbia University in 1914 He was born in New York City on February 9, 1862. He graduated from Columbia University in 1883. He was a fellow in letters there from 1883 to 1886, and an instructor in Anglo-Saxon and the Iranian languages from 1887 to 1890. After study at the University of Halle from 1887 to 1889 he became an adjunct professor of English language and literature. In 1895, he was appointed public lecturer and also appointed to the newly founded professorship of Indo-Iranian languages at Columbia University, where he remained until 1935. He was well known as a lecturer on English literature and the Orient. In 1901, during a visit to India and Ceylon, he received special attention from the Parsees, who presented to Columbia a valuable collection of Zoroastrian manuscripts in recognition of the instruction there given by him in their ancient texts. In 1903 he made a second journey to the Orient, this time visiting Iran. He also visited Central Asia sometime before 1918. Jackson's grammar of Avestan, the language used in the Zoroastrian scriptures, is still considered to be the seminal work on the topic. Jackson was one of the directors of the American Oriental Society. He died on August 8, 1937.

Polish-Lithuanian army under Stefan Czarniecki and Pawe≈Ç Jan Sapieha forced a Russian retreat through a carefully planned Polish hussar ambush and several tactically effective flanking maneuvers.Frost, R.I., 2000, The Northern Wars, 1558-1721, Harlow: Pearspn Education Limited, The Russian defeat also meant they had to abandon the Siege of Lyakhavichy (Lachowicze).  Background  In late June 1660, after the Treaty of Oliva, a Lithuanian army commanded by Pawe≈Ç Jan Sapieha attacked Russians, who occupied most of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lithuanians were supported by Polish units under Stefan Czarniecki, and their target was to end the siege of Lachowicze. Polish - Lithuanian units, which altogether had 13,000 men and 2 cannons, set off from S≈Çonim. Facing them was a Russian army under Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Tararui), who had unknown number of soldiers (some estimates claim 24,000; while some claim only 8,500). On the morning of 28 June Polish front units, marching towards Baranowicze, crossed the Po≈Çonka river, east of the town of Po≈Çonka. Here, Poles encountered a Russian unit, and a skirmish began. When main Russian forces arrived, the Poles withdrew behind the river, and Polish - Lithuanian army began preparations for the battle. Poles were placed on the right flank, Lithuanians on the left, while central front was protected by mixed, Polish- Lithuanian units, together with artillery. The battle First to attack were the Russians, who stormed the Polonka river levee. They were met with a heavy fire of the Polish-Lithuanian dragoons, and then a Polish hussar unit counterattacked, pushing the Russians back to their starting positions. Khovansky then decided to attack Lithuanian flank, using his cavalry. The Lithuanians, however, fiercely resisted the assault, and did not retreat to the river swamp. When dragoons of Stefan Czarniecki captured eastern bank of the levee, whole Polish - Lithuanian army carried out a frontal assault. Cavalry unit of Colonel Gabriel Wojnillowicz, which had been hidden behind Polish lines, bypassed the swamp and attacked left wing of the Russians. The Polish hussars and pancerni cavalry forced the Russian foot out of prepared positions, while the Commonwealth cavalry on the right attacked the Russian rear, which drove off the Muscovite horse and left the Russian infantry exposed. The Russians retreated towards Polock, and on the way they were chased by the Lithuanians, who killed hundreds. Khovansky himself managed to survive, together with a small cavalry group. Russian infantry, which remained at the battleground, was massacred or captured by the Commonwealth forces.

The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996. Similar to I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, the film spoofs a number of African-American, coming-of-age, hood films such as Juice, Jungle Fever, South Central, Higher Learning, Do the Right Thing, Poetic Justice, New Jack City, Dead Presidents, Friday, Above the Rim, and most prominently Boyz n the Hood and Menace II Society. The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.  Plot  Ashtray, Tray for short, is sent to the inner city to live with his father. Tray gets an education about life on the streets from his psychotic, gun-toting cousin Loc Dog, pot-smoking foul- mouthed Grandma, underage Pops, and gang members Preach and Crazy Legs. At a picnic, Tray falls for the infamous Dashiki, who has 7 kids, much to the distaste of ex-convict Toothpick. When Ashtray and Loc Dog head out to buy some snacks, Toothpick and his posse confront Ashtray and hold him at gunpoint until Loc Dog threatens them with a missile mounted in the back of his van. Toothpick and his gang then flee the scene. Loc Dog and Ashtray get harassed in a Korean store by the owners and Loc Dog shoots at the owners when a remark is made about his mother. The two are then confronted by \\"The Man\\" (a mysterious white government figure), who kills the Koreans and tosses them his gun to frame them and leaves. Meanwhile, Ashtray and Loc Dog's Grandma ride to church and another elderly woman disses her, resulting in a breakdancing contest that Grandma wins. Ashtray visits Dashiki where they engage in sexual intercourse and Dashiki immediately claims he has impregnated her. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Someone from Toothpick's posse threatens Ashtray, Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. Loc Dog knocks him out as he and Preach proceed to stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School. This tactic fails as Toothpick performs a drive-by shooting and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, himself and Loc Dog arrested, and trouble over the Korean store shooting, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and be the father. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another try and they decide to leave the hood as planned. Ashtray then reads a bedtime story to his Pops who is too young to go to a party in which causes him to ejaculate before going to sleep. At the party, Loc Dog meets Keisha, whom he then takes her to his mail truck to drink and have sex. During sexual intercourse, Keisha turns into a demonic monster, strips Loc Dog naked while he tries to run away and forces him to have sex with her while he screams. Ashtray and Loc Dog talk about Ashtray's departure as Toothpick and his posse prepare for another drive-by. He and Loc Dog clash as Ashtray is shot. As Loc and Toothpick continue to exchange gunfire, Grandma pops out of the dumpster and shoots Toothpick's car. Toothpick is flung out and he lands on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find Ashtray hurt and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (who turns out to be his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past. Afterwards, Toothpick and his gang are presumably arrested. Afterwards, everyone goes their separate ways: Ashtray and Dashiki marry and enjoy their lives, Loc Dog becomes a host and introduces himself with extreme profanity, Preach and his crush settle down and perform sexual intercourse, Crazy Legs becomes a dancer as he had dreamed of, and Grandma is, as Ashtray puts it, \\"still Grandma\\" (showing her smoking marijuana).

Greene Roger Sherman Greene (December 14, 1840 - February, 17, 1930) was a United States lawyer, judge, politician and military officer. Early life Greene was a descendant of many of the distinguished families of the Atlantic states. On the maternal side he was the great-grandson of Roger Sherman, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. His mother, Mary Evarts, was a daughter of Jeremiah Evarts and a sister of William M. Evarts, US Secretary of State, US Attorney General and a US Senator from New York. His father, Rev. David Greene, was for twenty years the corresponding secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. In his eighth year the family moved to Westborough, Massachusetts, and two years later to Windsor, Vermont.Sherman Genealogy Including Families of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, England, by Thomas Townsend Sherman He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1859. During his college life, being largely dependent upon his own exertions for support, he taught school in vacations at Windsor in the winter of 1857/58, and at Falmouth, Massachusetts in the winter of 1858/59. Soon after his graduation he began the study of law in the office of Evarts, Southmayd & Choate, in New York City. In this office as student, and afterward as managing clerk, he gained preliminary legal training. In May 1862, in New York City, he was admitted to practice, but he soon abandoned his professional career and to enter the Union army.Ullery, J. G., Fuller, L. Knight, Huse, H. Augustus, Davenport, C. H., Proctor, R. Men of Vermont: an illustrated biographical history of Vermonters and sons of Vermont. Brattleboro: Transcript publishing company, 1894, Part III, p. 74. Civil War In September 1862, he enlisted under commission as 2d Lieutenant of Company I, 3d Missouri Infantry; in March following he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant of the same company, and still later, in 1863, was made captain of Company C, 51st U. S. Colored Infantry., serving until honorably discharged by acceptance of his resignation in November 1865. He also served during this period as judge advocate of the District of Vicksburg at the close of 1864 and beginning of 1865, and judge advocate of the Western Division of Louisiana from June 1865, until retirement from service. He received a gunshot wound through the right arm in the general assault on Vicksburg while in command of his company on May 22, 1863. Just before his military service, Judge Greene was offered the position of Assistant United States District Attorney for the Southern District of New York, but declined the office. Later life Greene in the mid-1890s In January 1866, he resumed a legal practice in Chicago, occupying the same office with Perkin Bass, then United States attorney, with whom he was associated in practice. He remained in Chicago until his appointment by President Ulysses S. Grant to associate justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory, 1870-79. He settled at Olympia, and in 1880 he was commissioned chief justice, at which time he moved to Seattle. In 1883 he was re-appointed chief justice and served until the close of his term in March 1887. In March 1887, he formed a professional copartnership with Honorable Cornelius H. Hanford, who later became a United States District Judge for the District of Washington, and Honorable John H. McGraw, who became Governor of the State of Washington, under the firm name of Greene, Hanford & McGraw; afterward, in August, the firm was enlarged by the addition of another member, Joseph F.

In July 1888, the partnership was dissolved by mutual consent, all the partners retiring from practice, the senior partner on account of temporary ill-health, Messrs. McNaught and McGraw to enter other pursuits and Judge Hanford to become chief justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory. In 1889 Judge Greene resumed the practice of law, and in 1890 formed a partnership with L. Theodore Turner of Seattle, under the firm name of Greene & Turner. In 1889 he was trustee and secretary of the Seattle Investment Co. In 1890 he became trustee and secretary of the Seattle Trust Co, and trustee and vice president of Rainier Power and Railway Co., 1890-1893. Party affiliation Greene was identified with the Republican Party until the year 1888, when he joined the Prohibition movement. He was a Prohibition Party candidate for US Congress from Washington, 1888; and the Prohibition candidate for Governor of the State of Washington, 1892. Religion Religiously, his parents being Congregationalists, his first church connection was with the church of that denomination in Windsor, where his membership remained until after the war. Then he united with the New England Congregational Church of Chicago. Afterward he was a constituent and prominent member of the Lincoln Park Church. On removal to Olympia he joined the Baptist church. Family Judge Greene was married August 17, 1866, at Whitewater, Wisconsin, to Grace, daughter of Jesse and Rhoda (Brockett) Wooster of Naugatuck, Connecticut. They had four children: Agnes Margaret, born October 18, 1868; Roger Sherman, born September 29, 1870; Grace Evarts, born January 15, 1875, and Mary Rhoda, born July 27, 1876.

Sometime in the 1930s, five families who were engaged in fishing landed in the up-end of the river, and settled in the area for easy access to the fishing grounds. The area became known for its bountiful fish catch, and therefore more people from neighboring areas also came and settled. The distinctive visual quality of the area was an endemic species of tree known as \\"barobo\\" (diplodiscus paniculatus), which was plentiful on the site of the settlement. Subsequently, the place became popularly known as Barobo. Barobo subsequently became a barrio under the municipality of Lianga. The creation of the province of Surigao del Sur under R.A. No. 2786, series of June 1960, created the municipality of Barobo on October 24, 1960, by virtue of Executive Order No. 407 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia. Thus the Municipality of Barobo was carved out (in a shape resembling that of a cigar pipe) from its mother municipality, Lianga.

The notion tries to capture the essence of the concept of \\"logical system\\".J. A. Goguen and R. M. Burstall, Institutions: Abstract Model Theory for Specification and Programming, Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery 39, pp. 95‚Äì146, 1992. The use of institutions makes it possible to develop concepts of specification languages (like structuring of specifications, parameterization, implementation, refinement, development), proof calculi and even tools in a way completely independent of the underlying logical system. There are also morphisms that allow to relate and translate logical systems. Important applications of this are re-use of logical structure (also called borrowing), heterogeneous specification and combination of logics. The spread of institutional model theory has generalized various notions and results of model theory, and institutions themselves have impacted the progress of universal logic.Razvan Diaconescu, \\"Three decades of institution theory\\" in Universal Logic: An Anthology edited by Jean-Yves B√©ziau 2012 Springer pp 309-322 T. Mossakowski, J. A. Goguen, R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, \\"What is a Logic?\\", '. In Jean-Yves Beziau (Ed.), Logica Universalis: Towards a General Theory of Logic, pp. 113‚Äì133. Birkh√§user, Basel, 2005, 2nd Edition 2007. Definition The theory of institutions does not assume anything about the nature of the logical system. That is, models and sentences may be arbitrary objects; the only assumption is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences, telling whether a sentence holds in a model or not. Satisfaction is inspired by Tarski's truth definition, but can in fact be any binary relation. A crucial feature of institutions is that models, sentences, and their satisfaction, are always considered to live in some vocabulary or context (called signature) that defines the (non-logical) symbols that may be used in sentences and that need to be interpreted in models. Moreover, signature morphisms allow to extend signatures, change notation, and so on. Nothing is assumed about signatures and signature morphisms except that signature morphisms can be composed; this amounts to having a category of signatures and morphisms. Finally, it is assumed that signature morphisms lead to translations of sentences and models in a way that satisfaction is preserved. While sentences are translated along with signature morphisms (think of symbols being replaced along the morphism), models are translated (or better: reduced) against signature morphisms: for example, in case of a signature extension, a model of the (larger) target signature may be reduced to a model of the (smaller) source signature by just forgetting some components of the model. Formally, an institution consists of * a category Sign of signatures, * a functor sen:Sign \\\\to Set giving, for each signature \\\\Sigma, the set of sentences sen(\\\\Sigma), and for each signature morphism \\\\sigma:\\\\Sigma\\\\to\\\\Sigma', the sentence translation map sen(\\\\sigma):sen(\\\\Sigma)\\\\to sen(\\\\Sigma'), where often sen(\\\\sigma)(\\\\varphi) is written as \\\\sigma(\\\\varphi), * a functor Mod:Sign^{op}\\\\to Cat giving, for each signature \\\\Sigma, the category of models Mod(\\\\Sigma), and for each signature morphism \\\\sigma:\\\\Sigma\\\\to\\\\Sigma', the reduct functor Mod(\\\\sigma):Mod(\\\\Sigma')\\\\to Mod(\\\\Sigma), where often Mod(\\\\sigma)(M') is written as M'_{\\\\sigma}, * a satisfaction relation {\\\\models_{\\\\Sigma}}\\\\subseteq{Mod(\\\\Sigma)\\\\times sen(\\\\Sigma)} for each \\\\Sigma\\\\in Sign, such that for each \\\\sigma:\\\\Sigma\\\\to\\\\Sigma' in Sign the following satisfaction condition holds: M'\\\\models_{\\\\Sigma'}\\\\sigma(\\\\varphi) if and only if M'_{\\\\sigma} \\\\models_{\\\\Sigma} \\\\varphi for each M'\\\\in Mod(\\\\Sigma') and \\\\varphi\\\\in sen(\\\\Sigma). The satisfaction condition expresses that truth is invariant under change of notation (and also under enlargement or quotienting of context). Strictly speaking, the model functor ends in the \\"category\\" of all large categories.

It is accessible from a highway under perpetual reconstruction and further made accessible by exploration roads constructed by mining companies. The terrain is mostly flat, with minimal vegetation, causing minimal turbulence to wind flow in the area. It overlooks the Philippine Sea from the southeast and the north-west directions. Some permanent deformations of small trees indicate that the wind typically comes from the north-east direction. Ground measurements yielded wind speeds of 8‚Äì11 m/s, which, by industry standards has excellent wind power potential. However, further validation studies of at least one year of wind data gathered from the site is nonexistent. Transmission lines of the local cooperative pass through this wind power candidate site, making it more attractive for wind and/ solar energy development to alleviate badly needed energy infrastructure to sustain large scale industrialization and its lofty bid to become the northernmost \\"city\\" of Surigao del Sur.

According to the , it has a population of people. Hinatuan is approximately 44 kilometers (27 miles) north of Bislig, a component city in the same province. History Pre-spanish Era The history of Hinatuan in the annals of historical heritage can be traced back from the time of the Spaniards in this part of Mindanao. The intermingling of tribes such as the Manobos, the Mansakas, Subanons and the Mandayas through assimilation and amalgamation leads to the final unification of a group of people who settled in the old town site known as Da-an Lungsod. Being the first and the earliest settlement, it was later identified as part of the province of Caraga under the administration of the politico - militar of Encomienda Bislig. The name Hinatuan, originally derived from the word \\"Hato\\" and later called \\"Hatudan\\" was handed down from generation to generation through oral version. These words have two versions - \\" Hato \\" in the native dialect simply connotes a method of preserving fish, the place being abundantly noted for fish. In fact, fishing is the major occupation of the inhabitants. To denote a place , a suffix \\" an \\" was added to \\" Hato \\" to become \\" Hatuan \\"meaning a place where to preserve fish. Spanish Era In 1856, the town was transferred to its present site, formerly known as \\"Hinatudan\\" now known as Hinatuan as ordered by the higher Spanish authorities. A political government was set up with Raymundo Bandola, the first captain known as defender of the town against the Moro piracy. He was followed by Capitanes Edobigito Lindo, Atanacio de Castro, Tomas Luna, Fernando Nazareno and Teodoro Villaluz. Eugenio Villaluz was accredited the last capitan under the Spanish regime, the first and last captain under the First Philippine Republic, and the first presidential appointee under the American regime. These mentioned capitanes contributed much to the building of the physical set up of the town. The appointed presidents following Eugenio Villaluz were : Mariano Verano, Pablo Evangelio, Nicomedes Villaluz and Ex-Captain Fernando Nazareno. Domingo Balbuena was the first president - elect and followed by Florencio Villaluz, Antonio Picazales,Victoriano Evangelio, Modesto Raura and Damian Siano. Again, these town executives were responsible for the expansion of the town to a larger area. Japanese Era World War II broke out. A few months later, a strong typhoon hit Hinatuan. Heavy damages inflected to both private and public properties especially to buildings, coconut plantations and other potential crops, forest reserves, and machineries and equipment of the Portlamon Lumber Company. Guerilla activities then sprung up to lessen the influence and strength of the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan and to prepare the people for liberation of the country by the allied forces. Post War After the war, Elpedio Chavez was appointed mayor of the town. He was later followed by the first-elect, Mayor Tito Ca√±edo, Sr., under the Republic of the Philippines. He helped much in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the town. He was followed by Mayor Joaquin Villaluz , Segundo Cuyno, Sr., Candelario Viola, Sr., Jose Pepino, Sr., the mayor under the Martial Law period, LADP scholar Atty. Candelario J.

A little distance from the shoreline, the landscape started to the rise until it reached its peak at the west which is one of the ranges of the enchanted Mount Diwata. The place was thickly forested, blanketed with big trees, varieties of wild flowers aerial plants and vines. On the ground, wild animals of different species roam around the area. White colorful birds and other winged creatures flit from tree to tree. Nature's Music like chirping of birds, humming of bees and other wood land insects intermingling with the sound of roaring waves could be heard from the distance. This truly translates the feeling of being born free with nature. the place was breathtaking to behold. Indeed, it was Paradise where nature remained undisturbed. Then men settled along the cove near river in the south. It was said that these early inhabitants were the Manobos who were ruled by a Chieftain (Datu). Their clothes were made of woven abaca fiber and adorned themselves with multi-colored beads. Land and water resources were abundant, hence they love to hunt in the forest, gather shells along the shores and fish in the rivers. there was peace and harmony among the early inhabitants. They were happy and contended. Later however, as their tribes increased their descendants thought of moving to surrounding areas, so there was rivalry as to who will own choice pieces of land. Whenever disputes overland ownership and quarrel among themselves occurred, it was settled in a duel alongside the river in the North. Whoever won was proclaimed a \\"Daugan\\" o \\"Mananaog\\" by the Chieftain (Datu). The place became popular, hence the river was named Pananag-an. People going to the other side of the river have to wade across it slowly as the current was swift, it always took them such time to reach the other side of the river and they often say to themselves \\"Langan Pagtabok\\" of \\"Malangan Kita\\" (It delays to cross or we will be delayed). One day, as the old folks claimed, a foreigner passed by the place. After having crossed the river, he asked the people the name of the place. Thinking that the stranger was asking what they were doing, they answered \\"Langan pagtabok\\". The foreigner heard \\"Langan\\" and thought it was the name of the place, then people started calling the whole settlement \\"Langan\\". Later, with he influence of the Spanish \\"Li\\" alphabet, Langan was pronounced \\"Liangan\\". As generations passed, the final \\"N\\" in Llangan was dropped and the \\"Ll\\" sound was changed to \\"Li\\", hence says that is how Lianga got its name.Souvenir Program Great Jubilee Year Celebration 2000 History Lianga is one of the oldest towns of the province of Surigao del Sur by virtue of Executive Order No. 27 on October 17, 1919.

It is 90.0 kilometers to the south of Tandag City, the Capital of the Province, 237 kilometers from the City of Davao, 121 kilometers from the Butuan City and 16 kilometers from Prosperidad, the Capital Town of Agusan del Sur (via Lianga‚ÄìLos Arcos Road). In the history of Caraga Region, Lianga was part of the encomienda way back in 1655 under the command of Sergeant Martin Sanchez dela Cuesta. this encomienda covered Palaso (Cantilan). Tandag as its capital, Tago, Marihatag and Lianga. From 1904 to 1936, the Head of the Town was called President, per record obtained, the first elected President of Lianga was Cornelio Layno, whose two- year term covered the period from 1904 to 1906. The first elected Mayor was Otilio Navarro who served from 1937 to 1940. From then on, there were seven (7) elected Mayors of Lianga from 1941 up to the present. Within these periods, two became Mayors by succession, another two by appointment. Almost half a century ago, the territorial land area of Lianga was vast, considering the fact that the present municipalities of San Agustin, Marihatag and Barobo were once a part of Lianga. The births of these three municipalities were the results of political subdivisions authored by the political leaders of the undivided Surigao. San Agustin formerly called (Oteiza) was the first daughter municipality of Lianga created under Executive Order No. 445 in 1951, during the Presidency of then Elpidio Quirino. The Governor of Surigao that time was late Vicente L. Pimentel. Four years later, the Municipality of Marihatag was created under Republic Act No. 1261 on June 10, 1955. As the population of Lianga increased, it was not spared from further political subdivision. The Electorate in the southern barrios of Lianga moved for the creation of another municipality, called the Municipality of Barobo as the seat of the Municipal government. The creation of the Municipality of Barobo was made through Executive Order no. 407 and 2786 on October 24, 1960. Of the three municipalities created from the municipality of Lianga, Marihatag has the largest land area. It is sad to note that among these four municipalities formerly referred to as the \\"BLOM\\" Area (for Barobo, Lianga, Oteiza, and Marihatag) Lianga, the mother municipality has the smallest land area with only 15,000 hectares. Significant development in Lianga has been noted since 1960 with the creation of Surigao del Sur as a Province (Republic Act 2786). It was more evident in the 70's to 80's when the coastal barangay of Diatagon [Jiatagon] became the hub of socio‚Äìeconomic activities with the Lianga Bay Logging Company Incorporated [LBLCI] which was a rich source of income. The town of Lianga, too that time started to gain a breakthrough not only in the infrastructure projects such as roads and government buildings but also in income derived from taxes especially from forest products utilized by the wood processing plant of LBLCI. Barangay Saint Christine has become the minor urban center and Lianga was classified as the influence center of the satellite municipalities of San Agustin, Marihatag, and Barobo. Lianga is relatively urbanized area where 13,830 or 55.30% of the total population live in three urban centers of Barangays Poblacion, Saint Christine, and Diatagon [Jiatagon] and 11,175 or 44.70% lives in the remaining rural barangay with a municipal population density equivalent to 98.70% person/km2. The economic situation in the municipality poses great challenges to its leader and people. Its economy remains predominantly agricultural. It is gifted by its geographic location but is not adequately blessed by nature with substantial endowment necessary to propel itself into a developing economy. The major crop is Coconut, covering an area of 4,236 hectares. Rice ranks second with an area of 1,890 hectares. Other crops are Corn, Banana, and Abaca. The Poblacion and Barangay Diatagon [Jiatagon] are the trading centers with most of the commodities coming from Davao, Butuan, and Surigao. The poor road condition limits the economic activities in the area. Festival Inatu Festival - \\"Inatu\\" is from the kamayo language means \\"our very own\\". Celebrated every January.

These schools are built due to the neglect of the government in providing education to the indigenous peoples. *Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural and Livelihood Development (ALCADEV) Inc. *Tribal Filipino Program of Surigao del Sur (TRIFPSS) Inc. These Lumad schools have been in the vanguard in fighting for the ancestral lands and the rights of the Lumad. And this has become a problem for the mining and logging companies wanting to grab the lands; which is why these schools are constantly being attacked by the paramilitary, the military and the government itself. 2015 Lianga Massacre On September 1, 2015, executive director of ALCADEV Inc was killed right inside the school premises while two other Lumad leaders, Dionel Campos and Datu Bello Sinzo were killed in front of the community by the AFP-backed paramilitary group Magahat- Bagani.http://www.karapatan.org/A+year+after+the+Lianga+massacre National Literacy Awards These Lumad schools in Lianga have been awarded the Most Outstanding Literacy Program of Caraga region and in the Philippines for several years. This award is given by the Department of Education - Literacy Coordinating Council. Controversy There are allegations that both schools are not recognized by the Department of Education thus their curriculum are not accredited. In effect, students who would like to transfer to other DepEd recognized school is a big challenge continuing the year level of the student. If student would like to move to high school or college is not possible.

According to the , it has a population of people. Madrid was named after the capital city of Spain, Madrid. It has 14 barangays and two comprising the Poblacion: Linibunan and Quirino. History The early beginning of the history of Madrid is described to be a typical one of a community development on the edge of a river, this river is presently called Carac-an and said to be once abundant of fish, shrimps, and other creatures, which served as are reliable source of food for the early inhabitants. The river runs in the Southern boundary of the municipality and it is now the main source of irrigation water supplying all irrigable lands of Madrid and the neighboring municipality of Cantilan. The original name of Madrid was ‚ÄúLinibunan‚Äù a Visayan term describing a place covered by soil deposits which has been transported by force of nature. Linibunan came to be settled with more people when the Carac-an River gradually changed its course. The growing community of Linibunan had been the object concern of the Municipality of Cantilan being parts of the territorial jurisdiction. Having recognized Linibunan to attain the qualification of a barrio, the Municipality Government of Cantilan, granted its creation as a barrio in the year 1911. Religion, particularly Roman Catholic, had been the predominated the spiritual life of the people from the beginning and to the presents. The Catholic faith had been nurtured through the years under the administration of the missionary center, which was established in the year 1951. There were no recorded obstacles in the propagation and preservation of the Catholic faith for the fact that most Visayans composing the majority of the inhabitants were Catholic. On June 13, 1913, the missionary authorities in Cantilan created the parish in Linibunan and assigned a parish priest named Fr. Garcia. Father Garcia contributed significantly to the historical making of the Municipality of Madrid, because he was responsible for changing the name Linibunan to Madrid, after the capital city of Spain. From then on, church documents bore the name Madrid Parish and gradually the name Linibunan became extinct. The name Madrid was officially recognized as the name of a new Municipality of Cantilan as embodied in Executive Order No. 561, dated February 2, 1953. The Municipality of Madrid was once a part of Cantilan town. It was only declared Municipality on February 2, 1953. Madrid is blessed to have the Carac-an River. This River serves as the main source of sand and gravel to the entire CarCanMadCarLan region, as well as its watershed. Carac-an River will soon be a major source of power via the proposed construction of a mini hydropower plant. It is also a popular site for camping, and the provincial jamboree is often held here. One of the longest bridges in Mindanao is also located here. Christianity first came into this part of Mindanao when in 1598, a Portuguese ship under Captain Francisco de Castro accidentally drifted into the east coast of Mindanao, part of the third district known as the District of Caraga which covered the present provinces of Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte, Agusan Provinces and a part of Davao. On board the ship were two Jesuit missionaries, Fr. Valerio Ledesma, S.J., and Manuel Marino, a lay brother, who preached the gospel and baptized the inhabitants. But, it was only in 1596 that the first batch of Jesuit missionaries stationed themselves permanently in Butuan, at the town of Buenavista, and from there, they established mission posts in nearby areas. They were followed by the Recollects and then by the Benedictines. The first center of Christianity in this part of Mindanao was Tandag, which was established in 1622; Siargao in 1623; Bislig in 1624; Surigao in 1754 and in Cantilan in 1851. When Cantilan was established as the first center of missionary activity in 1851, Madrid was only a remote small sitio of Cantilan with few scattered houses. The small group of inhabitants in the area kept on clearing the land and planted it with various crops, predominantly rice. As a result of their hard and painstaking labor, the land became livable. The fertility of the soil and the proximity of the river began to attract people from the nearby places. Years after, they organized themselves and declared independence from the municipality of Cantilan. Notable pioneers in the region were Rufino Urbiztondo, Cosme Frias, Andres Roy, Jorge Arpilleda, Antonio Malayao, Antonio Taguines, Geronimo Rubi, Isidro Uriarte, Enrique Guillen, Pedro Uriarte, Tomas Frias, Andres Arnan, Mariano Cuartero, and others. The settlement continued to attract people; his constant coming of immigrants and intermarriages among inhabitants increased considerably the population until finally, the local leaders found it for to convert the sitio into a barrio. Under the leadership of Rufino Urbiztondo, Linibunan, as the place was known, became a barrio of Cantilan with him as its first Teniente del Barrio. Linibunan means \\"water-covered lowland\\". Digging around the place will attest to the fact that the topsoil in the area was deposited by floodwaters during the rainy season. The early inhabitants of the place were religious people. Most of them were Christian and the missionaries based in Cantilan who visited the barrio once in a while to attend to their religious needs. In 1901, the people thought of Christianizing the name of their barrio. Fr. Paulino Garcia who was then the parish priest of Cantilan and a Spaniard by nationality, suggested that the barrio be named Madrid reminiscing of the Spanish capital. The people readily accepted the suggestion and since then, Linibunan was changed to Madrid. For a decade, progress seemed slow, but then immigrants from other neighboring islands came, especially from Bohol, seeking good fortune in the reputed Land of Promise. A handful of Chinese came and engaged in business and trade with the natives. Due to its favorable geographical location, Madrid became the center of trade and commerce in the area. With the rapid growth of commerce and trade, population also increased. Business enterprises boomed and people started making permanent residences in the town. Then the local leaders became aware that Madrid can now qualify into a municipality. Headed by then Teniente del Barrio Sotero Irrizari, the Barrio Council and other Civic Leaders passed a resolution asking the President of the Philippines to elevate Madrid into a municipality. With the help of the Provincial Board, the cherished dream of the people of Madrid become a reality when President Elpedio Quirino issued Executive Order No. 561 making Madrid as one of the municipalities of Surigao del Sur on February 2, 1953. The municipality was inaugurated on July 4, 1953 amidst great splendor. It maybe well to mention that when Madrid became a municipality on February 2, 1953 by virtue of Executive Order 561, there was some kind of controversy as to who will be the first mayor. However, a long and protracted legal battle, the courts settled the controversy and proclaimed Guillermo Arpilleda as the first mayor of Madrid. Geography The municipality of Madrid lies in the northern part of the province, in the cluster known as CarCanMadCarLan area. It is bounded in the east by the Pacific Ocean, the Diwata Mountain in the west, the municipality of Cantilan in the north and Lanuza in the South. It is about from the capital town of Tandag, the seat of the provincial government of Surigao del Sur, and from the city of Surigao. Madrid is a narrow land along the coast of Surigao del Sur with an area of , representing 3.17 per cent of the province total land area of 445,216 hectares. =Soil type= Madrid has four kinds of soil type.

Demography  =Population trend= The alluring Town of Madrid was once a barrio of Cantilan. It was created into a municipality on February 2, 1953 by virtue of the Executive Order No. 561. As early as the 1950s settlements was so vibrant for such reason as it was separated from Cantilan. Data shows that upon the conduct of 1960 census, the town posted 8198 people. The population grew at the average growth rate of 3.038 percent, and the 1970 census recorded a total of 11,059 people. A sudden drop in population was experienced, with the 1975 census counting 10,627 people, the lowest among the recorded censuses. The decrease in population was attributed to an insurgency in the hinterland barangays of Madrid. Peace and order was slightly stabilized in the 1980s, resulting in an increase in population at 3.329 percent growth rate. The 1980s were a highly productive decade wherein agricultural activities, and therefore the population, increase. As younger generations leave in search of better academic pursuits, the average growth rate has leveled at 0.023 percent, and population growth models predict an average of 15 people added annually to the total municipal population. =Age and sex structure= More than 53 percent of the total municipal population falls within age-bracket of 15 to 64 years old and more than 40 percent of the total population is between 1 and 14 years old, with only about 5 percent of the population over 65 years of age. According to the 1995 census, there were 97 males for every 100 females. =Marital status= More than 72 percent of the total municipal population belongs to the age bracket of more than 10 years old or it can be expressed numerically as 9,456 people. More than 53 percent of the household population ages more than 10 years old are legally married. It can be noted that there were more female population who are legally married than the male population by 51 percent. Married population is concentrated between the age-bracket of 25 to 34 years old and this suggest for a higher fertility and an expected population growth. On the other hand, single individuals comprised 41 percent of the total population. For 3880 single individuals, males dominated this status than the females. Single population group concentrated between the age- bracket of 10 to 19 years old and slowly declining towards 20 years and more. More than 6 percent of the remaining population ages more than 10 years old belonged to widow, separated/divorced, common law/live-in and others. =Language= There are four major dialects been spoken in the town.

More than 92 percent of the household populations who are in the labor force are employed and roughly 8 percent are considered as unemployed. The remaining 36 percent of the total household population considered as productive individuals are not in the labor force. Tourism Madrid is not actually identified as a major tourist destination of the Province of Surigao del Sur due to the lack of existing attractions, facilities and amenities. Tourism related activities have never been developed nor given as top priority project because of strong competition from the neighboring towns. Despite of the limited contribution of tourism industry to the local economy, the town possesses different scenic spots awaiting for development, such as the following: * Bayogo Cave; * Panlangagan Cave; * Panlangagan Heights and NIA Dam; * Wild and exotic beach facing the magnificent Pacific Ocean at Barangay Daan Union; * Man- made attraction, the Carac-an bridge (the second longest bridge in Mindanao at 510 meters long) that serves as a landmark prior to entering the municipality; * The Bayogo Irrigation Dam, that serves as the life-blood for agriculture; * The ancestral homes and ruins of antique houses which are of great historical significance at Daan Union; * The Carac-an River, one of the cleanest river in Mindanao; * Daan Union Fish Cage and Pen; * Lib-og Beach Resort at Daan Union. All of these mentioned attractions do not have acceptable facilities and utilities except for some native cottages available at the beaches. Most of the identified tourist spots do not have accessibility. Transportation and mobility is one of the major problems that prevents visits from local and foreign visitors. Education There are 2 levels of education present in Madrid namely, elementary and secondary educational level only. Higher education or college school can be availed in Cantilan but most of the local students prefer to study in Cebu or neighboring provinces. There are 12 complete elementary schools and 1 primary school in Madrid located in every barangay of the town. Each school varies from one to another in terms of facilities and area of school site. Patong-Patong Elementary School has the largest area of more than 1.7 hectares while Magsaysay Elementary School has less than a half-hectare in area.

Antique gold discoveries In 1981, Edilberto \\"Berto\\" Morales, a farmer employed as a bulldozer operator in an irrigation project accidentally unearthed a hoard of authentic gold artifacts and jewelries weighing up to 30 kg in Barangay Magroyong which includes masks, figurines, bowls, daggers, trinkets, belts, and all sorts of body ornaments. Through a support of several historical accounts, archaeologists and historians believed that the gold items were associated between 10th to 13th century used by pre-colonial Filipinos, years before Spaniards came to the country. Some of the golden artifacts, jewelries and ornaments, dubbed as the \\"Surigao Treasures\\", were then sold to and currently exhibited at the Ayala Museum in the city of Makati, Philippines and some pieces at the Central Bank of the Philippines. Morales' discoveries were then considered one of the first proofs that gold was an important link between the early people of pre-colonial Philippines and the neighboring Southeast Asian countries.

According to the , it has a population of people. Geography Tago is located in the central part of Surigao del Sur facing the Pacific Ocean. It lies between 126 degrees 12 minutes longitude and 9 degrees minutes north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Capital Town of Tandag, on the north-west by Municipality of Lanuza, on the west by Municipality of San Miguel, on the southeast by the Municipality of Bayabas and on the south by the Municipalities of Cagwait and Marihatag. =Land area= Tago sits on a 343.52 km¬≤ of land which is about 7.55% of the total area of Surigao del Sur. In terms of area, Barangay Cabangahan is the largest with 20% of Tago‚Äôs land area while Barangay Purisima is the smallest with 1.51%. =Soil= Tago‚Äôs soil types vary; along the shoreline is sandy. Barangays Victoria and Dayoan have Bantug clay; Barangays Gamut, Kinabigtasan, Sumo-Sumo, Adlay and Anahao Daan have Butuan clay; while Bajao, Alba, Cayale, Bangsud and Anahao Bag-o have silt loam. Matho clay can be found in most of the mountain ranges from the seashore to the boundaries of Tandag-Tago and Tago-San Miguel. =Slope= Roughly 50% of Tago‚Äôs land area is relatively flat terrain (0-3%) while roughly 30%, mostly in the north-western portion, are steep mountains. =Climate= Generally, Tago falls under the normal climate with rainy season occurring from November to March and dry season from April to October. The hottest months are July and August. The planting season usually takes place in November to late January. Barangays Tago is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. History The Municipality of Tago was born thrice because of the precariousness of political times back then. It saw the light of day for the first time in 1865 under the Maura Law of the Spanish Regime that lasted for three years. Tago must have reverted to its barrio status because records had it that for the second time, it regained its municipal status on 23 August 1883, just after it transferred from the so-called Daan Lungsod (Old Town), which was perennially flooded, to the place called Laguna. When the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896, Tago was again reverted to its barrio status. About the middle of the First World War, the people of Tago grew politically minded and in the summer of 1916, important leaders of then Barrio of Tago like Catalino Pareja, Calixtro Espinoza, Simon Luna, Miguel Montero, Juan L. Garcia, Feleciano Arquiza, Juan Pimentel, Lorenzo Elizalde, Canuto Consuegra, Lino Montero, Isidro Garcia, Pastor Cabrera, Bernardo Falcon, Felipe Lozada and Felix Rodrigues were determined to wrestle Tago‚Äôs political independence away from the mother Municipality of Tandag. This breed of local leaders then submitted a duly signed petition to the Municipal Council of Tandag. But wanting the petition to gain more support, Catalino Pareja, along with councilors Lino Montero, Isidro Garcia and Zacarias Espinoza, sent the resolution directly to the Provincial Board of Surigao which in turn endorsed it to the Governor General in Manila. The crude transportation system during that time made the Provincial Governor Ricardo Gonzales incur delays in sending the petition to Governor General Francis Burton Harrison. But faced with numerous pressing matters to attend to, Harrison issued Executive Order No. 41 only on 6 November 1918, thus converting Tago, for the third time, from being a barrio to a newborn town. Appointed Municipal President effective 1 January 1919 was then Councilor Catalino Pareja with Calixtro Espinoza as Vice Municipal President while Messrs. Feleciano Arquiza, Juan L. Garcia, Lorenzo Elizalde and Canuto Consuegra were appointed as Municipal Councilors. On the same year, the first election was conducted and Catalino Pareja and Lino Montero were elected as Municipal President and Vice Municipal President respectively. Reverend Father Nose Croonin was Tago‚Äôs Parish Priest at that time. During much of World War II Tago remained free from Japanese occupation. In late April 1944 the Japanese occupied Tago.

MacDonald.Books Today New York Times 21 May 1964: 32. Commissioned in 1964 by Fawcett Publications editor Knox Burger, the book establishes for the series an investigative protagonist in a residential Florida base. All titles in the 21-volume series include a color, a mnemonic device which was suggested by his publisher so that when harried travelers in airports looked to buy a book, they could at once see those MacDonald titles they had not yet read. (MacDonald also included color in a further two unrelated novels: A Flash of Green and The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything.) Concept and creation MacDonald was also quoted stating that he considered all the novels in the McGee series as one long story in many installments on the life and times of Travis McGee. As such, The Deep Blue Good-by is a good starting point for new readers interested in the series. While each of the 21 novels adds more information on the history, background and psyche of McGee, one of the more interesting aspects of the series is seeing him mature, evolve and age through the decades. At the same time, we see the American culture change, from the Kennedy years in The Deep Blue Good-bye through the upheaval of hippie counterculture and the sexual revolution of the late 60s and 70s until the last book in the series at the end of the Reagan years in the mid-80s. As a chronicler of the cultural zeitgeist, MacDonald has been compared favorably with Charles Dickens. Reading the McGee novels in sequence therefore gives the reader a fascinating experience of seeing McGee change through the decades as American culture also changes. When MacDonald created the character, he was to be called Dallas McGee, after the city, but after the Kennedy assassination he decided that name had too many negative connotations. He was searching for a first name for McGee when a friend suggested that he look at the names of the many Air Force bases in California. MacDonald's attention was caught by Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, and so he named his character Travis.Cassuto, Leonard. Hard-boiled sentimentality: the secret history of American crime stories (Columbia University Press, 2009), p.170; MacDonald, John D. \\"How to Live With a Hero\\", The Writer (Combat Publishing, Waukesha, WI), 7/2008, pp.22-23. McGee first appeared in the 1964 novel The Deep Blue Good-by and was last seen in The Lonely Silver Rain in 1985. In 1980, the McGee novel The Green Ripper won the National Book Award. The McGee novels feature an ever-changing array of female companions, some particularly nasty villains, exotic locales in Florida, Mexico, and the Caribbean, and appearances by a sidekick known only as \\"Meyer,\\" a Ph.D. economist of international renown. Travis McGee profile As Sherlock Holmes had his well-known address on Baker Street, McGee had his trademark lodgings on his 52-foot (16 m) houseboat, the Busted Flush, named for the poker hand that started the run of luck in which he won her. She is docked at Slip F-18, Bahia Mar marina, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. McGee also owns a custom vintage Rolls- Royce that had been converted into a pickup truck long before he bought it, and painted \\"a horrid electric blue\\" by the same hand that did the conversion. McGee named it Miss Agnes, after one of his elementary school teachers whose hair was the same shade. McGee's business card reads \\"Salvage Consultant\\", and most business comes by word of mouth. His clients are usually people who have been deprived of something important and/or valuable (typically by unscrupulous or illegal means) and have no way to regain it lawfully. McGee's usual fee is half the value of the item (if recovered). McGee works when he has to, almost always only taking jobs when his supply of money (kept in an ingenious \\"hidey-hole\\" aboard the Flush) is low. In one tale, however, McGee avenges the murder of a long-time friend. In another, he is asked by the daughter of a friend to find out why her husband is trying to kill her. While he can be mercenary at times, he is not a mercenary. Physically, McGee is a tall, tanned, sandy-haired man with pale grey eyes. Several books hint (or explicitly state) that he is a U.S. Army The Lonely Silver Rain, p. 224. veteran of the Korean War. However, later books are less precise about exactly when he served. In The Green Ripper, one of the later novels, there are implications that his military service was during the Vietnam War rather than Korea. In The Lonely Silver Rain he visits a bank safe-deposit box in which he keeps a few precious keepsakes including photos of his father, mother, and brother, \\"all long dead,\\" and he mentions that the box also contains his Silver Star, Purple Heart, and honorable discharge certificate, all awarded by the U.S. Army to \\"Sergeant McGee\\". He also has a daughter named Jean, unknown to him until she reveals herself in \\"The Lonely Silver Rain\\" as the result of a long-ago love affair. He was a stand-out college football player (at tight end) but says in A Deadly Shade of Gold that he never played professional football due to a knee injury. However, in The Turquoise Lament he admits to a sports-trivia fan that he played professional football for a couple of seasons before his knees were wrecked in a tackle by an opponent from the Detroit Lions. Psychologically he's an introspective and mysterious person. Despite his age (unknown), he retains the quickness and agility of a professional athlete. He stands 6'4\\" (1.95 m) tall and, although deceptively unimposing at his \\"fighting weight\\" of 205 lbs. (93 kg), he is much stronger than he looks, with thick wrists and long arms; occasionally, a more perspicacious adversary notes these features when deciding whether to tangle with him. McGee purposely cultivates an image of being uncoordinated, shambling, and clumsy, but has superb reflexes and muscle memory. He has a 33-inch waist, wears a size 46 long jacket, and a shirt with a 17¬Ω\\" neck and 34\\" arms. McGee often discusses his fitness regimen, usually in terms of regaining his fitness after a lazy period: swimming and sprinting are frequently mentioned. At one time he was a pipe smoker, but eventually gave it up in order to maintain his physical fitness. As a martial art strategy, he often covers his face and blocks punches with his arms and elbows to lull and tire his opponent while studying that opponent's fighting style. In the final novel, McGee is described as practicing the Chinese art of T'ai chi ch'uan. However, unlike other fictional detectives such as Raymond Chandler's jaded and world-weary Philip Marlowe, McGee clings to what is important to him: his senses of honor, obligation, and outrage. In a classic commentary in Bright Orange for the Shroud, McGee muses, > Now, of course, having failed in every attempt to subdue the Glades by > frontal attack, we are slowly killing it off by tapping the River of Grass. > In the questionable name of progress, the state in its vast wisdom lets > every two-bit developer divert the flow into drag-lined canals that give him > \\"waterfront\\" lots to sell. As far north as Corkscrew Swamp, virgin stands of > ancient bald cypress are dying. All the area north of Copeland had been > logged out, and will never come back. As the glades dry, the big fires come > with increasing frequency. The ecology is changing with egret colonies > dwindling, mullet getting scarce, mangrove dying of new diseases born of > dryness. This was in a paperback originally published in 1965 when the general public was still not conversant with the concept of environmentalism. Plot summary The Deep Blue Good-by introduces readers to McGee, his place of residence, the Busted Flush (a houseboat he won in a poker game), and its mooring place, slip F-18 at the Bahia Mar Marina in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the early chapters we learn that McGee is a bachelor, a man who can be friends with ladies as well as have a passion for them, and a man of principle (although they are somewhat at the mercy of his uncertain emotional condition and his circumstances at the moment; in McGee's own words, \\"Some of them I'll bend way, way, over, but not break.\\"). Another feature of the McGee series is the seemingly unending parade of colorful and invariably evil villains whom McGee must contend with in order to make a recovery for his clients. In this first story the antagonist is Junior Allen, a smiling, seemingly friendly man, large, \\"cat quick\\", powerful, and pathologically evil. The story begins with a fortune smuggled home after World War II by a soldier who was a native of the Florida Keys. This soldier killed another soldier just prior to his discharge, went on the run back to the Keys, and buried his treasure there. He was later captured by the U.S. Army and sent to a military prison, where he met Junior Allen. Allen discovered vague details about the fortune hidden in the Keys and after his release from prison went there to find it. The story depicts the psychotic behavior of Allen as he evolves from thief to serial rapist to murderer. We see McGee's savvy, guile, and physical prowess as he works methodically to locate Allen and eventually make the recovery. As is thematic in many of the McGee books, however, he pays a heavy price for the successful recovery. Throughout the series, in fact, it is debatable as to whether McGee ever makes a recovery in which the gain outweighs the costs. The \\"Deep Blue Good-by\\" occurs when some of the blue gem stones that McGee is trying to recover are spilled on a boat during a scuffle with Junior Allen and fall to the bottom of the ocean. The title phrase is not used in this book, although all of the book phrases are used starting in his third book, \\"A Purple Place for Dying.\\" In the end, Travis McGee recovered five gem stones for about $22,668. McGee took $1,668 for expenses and $1,000 as a recovery fee from Cathy Kerr. Film adaptation When Travis McGee arrived on the big screen in 1970 with Darker Than Amber, starring Rod Taylor, the film received favorable reviews from Roger Ebert and other critics, but the film did not develop into a series. Other actors considered for the role were Jack Lord and Robert Culp. John McDonald's favourites were Steve McQueen or Vic Morrow. The 1983 TV movie Travis McGee: The Empty Copper Sea starred Sam Elliott. It relocated McGee to California, abandoning the Florida locales central to the novel. In 1967, author MacDonald refused permission for a television series about Travis McGee, believing that people would stop reading the novels were Travis McGee regularly on television. A film version of The Deep Blue Good-by, directed by Oliver Stone with Leonardo DiCaprio as Travis McGee, was in development with a tentative release date of 2011 or 2012. In April 2010, it was announced that the film's title was changed to Travis McGee. In April 2011, it was announced that Paul Greengrass was interested in directing the film. As of February 2014, this has not materialized and the film remains listed as in development. On March 4, 2014, James Mangold was attached to direct the film which DiCaprio will produce with Jennifer Davisson-Killoran and Amy Robinson. Dana Stevens and Kario Salem wrote the first draft. On July 15, Christian Bale was attached to play the title role for the film The Deep Blue Good-by with screenplay by Dennis Lehane. On February 25, 2015, it was reported that Rosamund Pike had landed the female lead in the film. On August 24, the production was shelved due to Bale's knee injury.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-scraps- christian-bales-deep-791342 References Category:1964 American novels Category:Travis McGee (novel series) Category:Novels set in Florida Category:American novels adapted into films ","title":"The Deep Blue Good-by"},{"id":"2156559","title":"Ooh Stick You"},{"id":"2156560","text":"MARID was an IETF working group in the applications area tasked to propose standards for email authentication in 2004. The name is an acronym of MTA Authorization Records In DNS.  Background  Lightweight MTA Authentication Protocol (LMAP)Lightweight MTA Authentication Protocol (LMAP) Discussion and Comparison was a generic name for a set of 'designated sender' proposals that were discussed in the ASRG in the Fall of 2003, including: * Designated Mailers Protocol (DMP) * Designated Relays Inquiry Protocol (DRIP) * Flexible Sender Validation (FSV) * MTAMARK * Reverse MX (RMX) * Sender Policy Framework (SPF) These schemes attempt to list the valid IP addresses that can send mail for a domain. The \\"lightweight\\" in LMAP essentially stands for \\"no crypto\\", as opposed to DomainKeys and its successor, DKIM. In March 2004, the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF held a BoF on these proposals. As the result of that meeting, the task force chartered the MARID working groupMARID charter. Microsoft's Caller-ID proposal was a late and highly controversial addition to this mix. It came with the following features: * Use of XML policies with DNS - this was reduced to what is now known as Sender ID * Piggybacking and extension of the existing SPF * Use of RFC 2822 mail header fields as by DomainKeys (All other LMAP drafts used the SMTP envelope.) * Specific questions about patents and licensing  Proceedings  The working group decided to postpone the question of RFC 2821 SMTP identities - i.e. MAIL FROM covered by SPF, or HELO covered by CSV and SPF - in favour of RFC 2822 identities covered by Caller-ID's and later Sender-ID's Purported Responsible Address (PRA). The WG arrived at a point where sender policies could be split into different scopes, like the 2821 MAIL FROM or the 2822 PRA. The MARID syntax also allowed to join different scopes into one policy record, if the sets of permitted IPs are identical, as is often the case. Less than a week after the publication of a first or MAIL FROM draft, the WG was terminated unilaterally by its leadership. MARID existed only seven months, and no RFCs were published. The responsible IETF Area Director agreed to sponsor the publication of some of the unfinished MARID discussions as IETF experiments; these happened in 2005, as both the pre-MARID SPFSender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in E-MAIL, version 1 and Sender IDPurported Responsible Address in E-Mail Messages were approved as experimental RFCs.

A bun can be secured with a hair tie, barrette, bobby pins, one or more hair sticks, a hairnet, or a pen or pencil. Hair may also be wrapped around a piece called a \\"rat\\".

The term odango in Japanese can refer to any variety of bun hairstyle. In China, the hairstyle is called ni√∫ji«éot√≥u (ÁâõËßíÂ§¥). It was a commonly used hairstyle up until the early 20th century, and can still be seen today when traditional attire is used.

Sumo wrestler with topknot Men of the Joseon Era of Korea wore the sangtu as a symbol of marriage. 16th century Japanese men wore the chonmage for samurai warriors and sumo wrestlers. In the west, topknots were frequently worn by \\"barbarian\\" peoples in the eyes of the Romans, such as the Goths, Vandals, and the Lombards. Later, the hairstyle survived in the pagan Scandinavian north (some believe the topknot hairstyle contains elements of Odinic cult worship) and with the eastern nomadic tribes such as the Bulgars, Cumans and Cossacks.

Name and Lineage Nakamura, often represented as \\"Shichinosuke Nakamura\\" in reference to his American film career, is a member of the kabuki guild Nakamura-ya, and currently performs kabuki along with his brother Nakamura Kantar≈ç II. His family can trace their lineage back, within the kabuki world, at least seven generations, to Onoe Kikugor≈ç III and Ichimura Uzaemon XI, who performed in the early 19th century. As is the case with the names of all kabuki actors, \\"Nakamura Shichinosuke\\" is a yag≈ç or stage name. Life and career In September 1986 he made his first appearance on stage at the Kabuki-za, taking the name Nakamura Shichinosuke the following year. Within a few years he was described as \\"one of the 21st Century's most promising young Kabuki Actors\\". He has performed Kabuki in numerous international theaters, often alongside his father and brother, as part of the Heisei Nakamura-za. He also performs annually in Asakusa Kabuki at the Asakusa K≈çkaid≈ç, a production aimed at attracting the younger generation and encouraging in them an interest in kabuki. In 1994, Shichinosuke performed in the modern play \\"Sukapan\\". He has also appeared in such NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) TV drama series as Takeda Shingen (a dramatization of Shingen's life), and Genroku Ryoran. Nakamura graduated from high school in March 2002 and the following year he played the role of Emperor Meiji in Edward Zwick's movie The Last Samurai. The Last Samurai marks his film debut. In 2004 he appeared in the film version of Wataya Risa's novel Insutooru, and in 2005, he played an Edo period recovering drug addict in the absurdly comical film Mayonaka no Yaji-san Kita-san, based on a comic book.

Two commissions coordinate a large portion of its work: Justice and Peace and Faith and Witness. The Commission on Justice and Peace provides a forum for sharing information and concerns among those involved in ecumenical work on peace and social justice in Canada and the world. It facilitates biblical and theological reflection on peace and social justice and cooperation of the churches on related concerns. Some of the key issues with which this commission is concerned include Peace and Disarmament, Faith and the Economy, Poverty in Canada, HIV/AIDS, Undoing Racism, Human Trafficking in Canada, Strengthening Public Health Care in Canada, and Canada's Role in Afghanistan, as well as ongoing discussions on human rights and just peacemaking. The purpose of the Commission on Faith and Witness is to provide a meeting-place and a lively and fertile ground for reflection and work among Christians of different families. Together, the various denominations represented work to reflect theologically on matters of concern in the present day, and on questions of historical interest to the churches. They also periodically publish resources on topics chosen by the churches, such as The Bruised Reed: Christian Reflections on Suffering and Hope (2010), as well as coordinating the churches' participation in interfaith dialogue, with involvement on the Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation and National Muslim Christian Liaison Committee, among other bodies. Each member church provides at least one representative to the Commission. Topics that are explored by this commission include baptism, marriage, euthanasia, and Christian perspectives on suffering and hope. Work done by the Council Through the ecumenical movement, which arose in Canada in the twentieth century, the Canadian Council of Churches seeks unity for the divided church and seeks to remind Christians that they share Christ's mission for reconciliation, peace, dignity and justice for the whole community. Some of the work done by the Council and the Member Churches working together includes: *Bringing member churches into encounter with one another in a forum where all voices hold equal weight. We promote understanding among them and with other Christian churches. *The founding and sponsorship of Project Ploughshares, a leading Canadian peace organization. *Providing a safe place for immigrant churches to learn about Canada and to put down roots. *Undertaking and promoting theological study and reflection among Christian traditions. *Encouraging and hosting churches' participation in dialogue with people of other faiths. *Studying, speaking about and acting on conditions that involve moral and spiritual principles, including current events such as the war on terror and societal issues such as the future of health care. *Sharing information broadly, communicating results of theological and ethical reflections to Canadian Society and governments. *Producing resources, including material for the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity. *Producing a bi-annual newsletter, Emmaus, and a periodic electronic newsletter entitled \\"Together\\" *Providing material to chaplains in Canada's armed forces and prisons, helping them work with stress-related trauma, mixed marriages and questions about life and death. International participation The Canadian Council of Churches is registered with the United Nations and participates in world conferences and commissions on such issues as funding for development, refugee settlement and human rights. The Council is also a participant in the annual World Religious Leaders Summit, in parallel with the G8/G20 political summits each year. In 2010, the Council also provided leadership for this event, when the international summit was hosted by Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba. See also *Canadian Council of Churches v.

It is found where enamel rods, the functional unit of enamel, meet interrod enamel. The crystals of both types of enamel meet at sharp angles and form the appearance of a space called the rod sheath. As a result of this space, the rod sheath consists of more protein (as opposed to minerals) than other areas of enamel. For this reason, the rod sheath is characterized as being hypomineralized in comparison to the rest of the highly mineralized enamel.

He was educated at Broadwater School and then Godalming College. Clarke began his career as a professional cricketer with Surrey in 2000, making his list A debut in 2001 and First Class debut in 2002, and the following year made his One Day International debut for England; later in 2003 he played his first Test match. Between 2003 and 2006 he played two Tests, both against Bangladesh and 20 ODIs. At the end of 2007 Clarke left Surrey to become Derbyshire's club captain after feeling a change was needed, hoping he could impress the England selectors with his leadership. Before the end of the 2008 season he stepped down as captain because the job was negatively affecting his own performance, and after a single year at the club he left to join Warwickshire for the start of the 2009 season, before rejoining Surrey in 2017. Domestic career =Surrey= After some fine performances in Surrey's championship-winning Second XI team in 2001, Clarke quickly established himself in the first team the following season. He made an unbeaten 107 against Cambridge UCCE in his debut first-class innings and also scored 153 not out against Somerset, ending the season 711 runs at an average of over 50. He was awarded the Cricket Writers' Club's Young Cricketer of the Year award and the NBC Denis Compton Award for his achievements in 2002. His domestic form suffered in 2004 as he could manage a first-class batting average of only 31.17 and just nine wickets all season. His one-day performances were even worse, as he passed fifty just once in 11 innings. In a 50 overs a side match played on 29 April Clarke hit 82 runs off only 28 balls. It included 9 Fours and 6 Sixes. It helped Surrey get to 494‚Äì5 against Gloucestershire. In 2006 Clarke was made the club's vice-captain, with the aim of giving him some experience of leadership to prepare him to take over the captaincy from Mark Butcher, Retrieved on 22 April 2012. and later that year he led Surrey in the Twenty20 Cup. Retrieved on 22 April 2012. In May the England Cricket Board named a 25-man development squad for international players and those considered close to playing for England; Clarke was included in the squad for the first time. Retrieved on 22 April 2012. Despite his inclusion he was overlooked by England during the summer while players from outside the squad were drafted in to play for England's struggling ODI side. In the 2007 season, Clarke played only ten first-class matches for Surrey, scoring 301 runs and taking 15 wickets. Retrieved on 2 September 2008. =Derbyshire= In October 2007, it was announced Clarke had signed for second division Derbyshire as captain for the 2008 season, after having attracted offers from a number of clubs. The move came after Clarke turned down a 2-year extension with Surrey with him feeling a change was needed. Clarke said of the move: Retrieved on 2 September 2008. Clarke hoped that the move to Derbyshire would improve his chance of being selected for England. Despite Clarke's high hopes, he experienced a poor run of form in the 2008 season that led to him quitting the captaincy. When he made his decision, he was averaging 21 with the bat and 38 with the ball from eight first-class matches. Retrieved on 2 September 2008. The only first-class half century of his tenure as captain was a score of 81 against Warwickshire in May. Retrieved on 2 September 2008. At one point, his form was so bad that he dropped himself. =Warwickshire= After an unsuccessful year at Derbyshire, Clarke signed a three-year deal with Warwickshire in September 2008. Warwickshire had been interested in Clarke for a long time and Ashley Giles, the club's director of cricket, said: Retrieved on 2 September 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Warwickshire secured promotion to the first division of the County Championship. Retrieved on 22 April 2012. Clarke came into prominence in a game in late April 2009 against Hampshire at Edgbaston. Clarke took 2/63 in the Hampshire first innings, and then went on to score a lusty 112 from 86 balls in a Warwickshire reply of 630/8 declared. Retrieved on 22 April 2012. During a match against Kent in May 2010, Clarke took his first ever five- wicket haul in first-class cricket, taking 6/63. Retrieved on 22 April 2012. Playing in 15 County Championship matches that season, Clarke took 32 wickets at an average of 23.21, Retrieved on 22 April 2012. and managed 673 runs at average of 29.26 with one century. Retrieved on 22 April 2012. In a County Championship match in April 2011 Clarke took the second five-wicket haul of his first-class career, taking 5/10 in the second innings as Warwickshire bowled out Somerset for 50 runs to complete an innings victory. Later that year Warwickshire awarded Clarke his cap. Retrieved on 21 April 2012. During a County Championship fixture against Lancashire in August, Clarke took nine catches, equalling the record held by Wally Hammond for most catches in a match by a non-wicketkeeper. Retrieved on 21 April 2012. Clarke's contract with the club was due to expire at the end of the season, and Sussex took the opportunity to approach Clarke and offer him a contract. Though Warwickshire had offered him a new two-year deal it was expected that he would join Sussex, where he would bat higher up the order in one-day matches, retrieved on 21 April 2011. though he turned down their offer in September. Soon after he struck his only first-class century of the season, managing 126 runs off 101 balls against Nottinghamshire. Retrieved on 21 April 2012.

Retrieved on 22 April 2012. =Return to Surrey= In 2017 Clarke returned to Surrey, as part of an exchange deal that saw Dom Sibley join Warwickshire.https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/20161496/rikki-clarke- returns-where-started-surrey-move In 2018 he contributed to Surrey winning the county championship for the first time since 2002, and was nominated for the PCA player of the year award, claiming 49 wickets and scoring 500 runs. He was named Surrey's player of the year in 2019.https://www.kiaoval.com/squad- players/rikki-clarke/ He has been awarded a benefit season by Surrey in 2021.https://www.kiaoval.com/main-news/clarke-granted-2021-testimonial-year/ International career Some more good performances in the early part of 2003 brought Clarke his England debut, for the One Day International against Pakistan at Old Trafford. Although he took a wicket with his first ball in ODIs (the first Englishman to achieve this feat for three decades) he had a poor match overall, being bowled behind his legs for a duck after playing a totally misjudged sweep and conceding 41 runs from his 7.2 overs. He was retained for the rest of the summer's ODIs despite a total of just three wickets and a high score of only 37. A groin injury to Andrew Flintoff led to Clarke being drafted into the squad for the 2003/04 tour of Bangladesh and on this tour he made his Test debut, at Dhaka. An undistinguished match was followed by a better performance at Chittagong where he made 55 in the first innings and a quickfire 27 from 16 balls in the second helped set up England's match-winning declaration. He also picked up three wickets, returning a notable analysis of 7‚Äì4‚Äì7‚Äì2 in the Bangladeshis' first innings. He played in only the first of the ODIs against Sri Lanka, a disastrous ten-wicket defeat, and was not selected for any other international games on that tour. At the end of that winter, England toured the West Indies, and Clarke was picked for five of the seven ODIs. He failed completely, not reaching double figures in any of his four innings and taking 3‚Äì108 from the 18 overs he was allowed. By the time the tour finally finished in early May, Clarke's international career looked in serious jeopardy, but he was given one more chance by injuries to Flintoff and Marcus Trescothick early in the summer of 2004. Clarke was included for the Leeds ODI against the West Indians, but another failure (conceding 30 runs from four overs) followed, and the selectors had seen enough: Clarke was dropped and has not played for England since. He enjoyed a better 2005, however, and earned a trip to the Academy. However, in 2006 his luck changed. After averaging 64.66 (including a career best 214) he was drafted into England's one-day squad to play Pakistan. Despite a decent 39 in difficult conditions at Lords he failed with the bat only scoring 45 runs in 3 matches. Like in the West Indies he bowled poorly, overall conceding 64 runs of 10.5 overs with only 1 wicket. He was included in the 2006 Champions Trophy but did not play. He also failed to make the England 'A' tour. Thought to be a big talent, Clarke has so far failed to perform to the level expected by his admirers.

The opposite practice is hyperdescent, in which children are assigned to the race that is considered dominant or superior. Parallel practices include patrilineality, matrilineality and cognatic descent, which assign race, ethnicity, or religion according to the father, mother, or some combination, without regard to the race of the other parent. Attempts to limit (or eliminate) mixed-race populations by legal means are defined in anti-miscegenation laws, such as passed by various states in the United States.  History  While customs, practices and systems of belief emphasizing the value of purity of descent are arguably as old as mankind, few societies systematically codified them, or legally enforced their outcome. Practices were enforced in communities. Such was the case in classical Greece ‚Äì which made clear distinctions between Greeks and Barbarians. The Roman Republic had a different pattern. While it was expansionist, and militarily and culturally aggressive, it actively encouraged the Romanisation of client kingdoms, which included intermarriage of Romans with their elite citizens and making this class citizens of Rome as reward and as exemplars. = Hypo/hyperdescent in Colonial-Era North America = The North American practice of applying a rule of hypodescent began during colonial times when indentured servants and transported convicts working at the direction of the colonists and colonial authorities were joined by Africans that from 1619 on were first taken first from Spanish and then more and more from English or British slave ships. But while the freed captives were Christians, these individuals were classified as indentured workers. Virginia formally enacted a 'slave code' in 1705. There is documentary evidence from the 1650s that some Virginia Negroes were serving lifelong terms of indenture. In the 1660s the Assembly stated that \\"any English servant that shall run away in company with any Negroes who are incapable of making satisfaction by addition of time shall serve for the time of the said Negroes absence\\", indicating Negroes could not 'make satisfaction' by serving longer if recaptured. This device gave legal status to the practice of lifetime enslavement of persons of African descent; in subsequent statutes the legislature defined conditions of lifetime servitude. But in 1655 Elizabeth Key Grinstead, a mixed-race woman, fought and won the first freedom suit in Virginia. Her English father had acknowledged her as his daughter, had her baptised as Christian, and, falling ill, established a legal guardian to care for her after his death, arranging a limited-term indenture for her as a girl. But the guardian sold her indenture and left the colony, and the next master did not free her. When he died, his estate claimed her and her son as slave property.Taunya Lovell Banks, \\"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit - Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia\\", 41 Akron Law Review 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 Apr 2009 However, following Key's victory, Virginia established the principle in law in 1662 of partus sequitur ventrem, from Roman law; that is, children born in the colonies would take the social status of their mothers. This meant that all children born to enslaved women would be born into slavery, regardless of their paternity and race. This was in contrast to English common law, by which the status of children of English subjects was determined by the father. As slavery became a racial caste system, persons of only partial African ancestry and majority European ancestry were born into slavery. African descent became associated with slavery. By hypodescent, persons of even partial African ancestry were classified socially below whites. By the late 18th century, there were numerous families of majority-white slaves, such as the mixed-race children born to the slave Sally Hemings and her master Thomas Jefferson. She was three-quarters white and the half-sister of his late wife; their children, born into slavery, were seven-eighths white. Jefferson gave the four surviving children their freedom as adults; three assimilated into white society. The Southern author Mary Chesnut wrote in her famous A Diary from Dixie, of the Civil War-era, about the hypocrisy of a man's recognizing white women's children among the slaves in every household but his own. Fanny Kemble, the British actress who married an American slaveholder, wrote about her observations of slavery as well, including the way white men sexually abused slave women and left their mixed-race children enslaved. Sometimes the white fathers freed the children and/or their mothers, or provided education or apprenticeship, or settled property on them in a significant transfer of social capital. Notable antebellum examples of fathers who provided for their mixed-race children were the fathers of Charles Henry Langston and John Mercer Langston and the father of the Healy family of Georgia. (Each had a common-law marriage with a woman of partial African descent.) Other mixed-race children were left enslaved; some were sold away by their fathers. Research by historians and genealogists has shown that unlike the above examples, most free African Americans listed in the first two US censuses in the Upper South were descended from relationships or marriages in colonial Virginia between white women, indentured servant or free, and African or African-American men, indentured servant, free or slave. Their unions reflected the fluid nature of relationships among the working classes before slave caste was hardened, as well as the small households and farms within which many people worked. The children of white mothers were born free. If they were illegitimate and mixed race, they were apprenticed in order to avoid the community being burdened with upkeep, but such persons gained a step in freedom. By the turn of the nineteenth century, many of these families of free African Americans, along with European-American neighbors, migrated to frontier areas of Virginia, North Carolina, and then further west. Such families sometimes settled in insular groups. Mixed-race people of African-European descent are believed to have been the origin of some isolated settlements, which have long claimed or were said to be of American Indian or Portuguese ancestry.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, accessed 15 Feb 2008 As an example, a 21st-century DNA study of a group of Melungeon families in Tennessee and Kentucky, long rumored to be descendants of Turks or Native Americans, showed they were overwhelmingly of African and European ancestry. = Hypo/hyperdescent in Reconstruction, late 19th century and 20th-century United States = By the late 1870s, conservative white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South, even in areas where there were black majorities, largely by a process of violence and intimidation of black Republicans. The Democrats gradually imposed white supremacy in law and practice. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, the state legislatures passed new constitutions and laws that created barriers to voter registration by such means as the poll tax, literacy tests, record requirements and others. The number of voters on the rolls fell drastically and most blacks and many poor whites were disenfranchised for decades. The whites also passed Jim Crow laws, such as racial segregation of public facilities. African Americans and whites established the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 to fight against legal discrimination and disenfranchisement. Each time they won a court case, for instance, against the use of white primaries, white-dominated legislatures would pass new laws to exclude blacks from the political system. In the 20th century, under influences of eugenics and racial discrimination, states enacted laws classifying persons as black who had any traceable evidence (or perception of any African ancestry). Under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, the 'One-drop' rule defined as black a person with any known African ancestry, regardless of the number of intervening generations. The same Act established a binary classification system for vital records, classifying persons as 'white' or 'black' (Negro at the time). The latter was effectively a 'catch all' term for all people of color. Native Americans were classified as colored, l attitude to all races other than white. In its most extreme form in the United States, hypodescent was the basis of the \\"one drop rule\\", meaning that if an individual had any black ancestry, the person was classified as black. Laws were passed in southern states and others in the early 20th century, long after the end of slavery to define white and black, under associated laws for segregation: Tennessee adopted such a \\"one-drop\\" statute in 1910; Louisiana; Texas; Arkansas in 1911; Mississippi in 1917; North Carolina in 1923; Virginia in 1924; Alabama and Georgia in 1927; and Oklahoma in 1931. During this same period, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Utah retained their old \\"blood fraction\\" statutes de jure, but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one- thirtysecond) to be equivalent to one-drop de facto.Pauli Murray, ed. States' Laws on Race and Color (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459. By 1924 many \\"white\\" people in Virginia would have had some African and/or Native American ancestry, given the mixing over the centuries. At the same time that Virginia was trying to harden racial caste, African Americans were organizing to overturn segregation and regain civil rights, that had been lost to Jim Crow laws and disfranchisement of the majority of the black community.  Anti-miscegenation marriage laws  By the early 1940s, of the thirty U.S. states that had anti- miscegenation laws, seven states (Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia) had adopted the one-drop theory for rules prohibiting interracial marriages. This was part of a continuing social hardening of racial lines after the turn of the century, when southern states imposed legal segregation and disfranchised African Americans. Other states applied the hypodescent rule without carrying it to the \\"one-drop\\" extreme, using instead a blood quantum standard. For example, Utah's anti-miscegenation law prohibited marriage between a white and anyone considered a negro, mulatto, quadroon (one-fourth black), octoroon (one-eighth black), Mongolian, or member of \\"the Malay race\\" (here referring to Filipinos). No restrictions were placed on marriages between people who were not \\"white persons\\". The law was repealed in 1963. = Other examples of application = In the United States, hypodescent has often defined children of mixed-race couples as black when one parents is classified as \\"black\\", or either is thought to have African descent. That practice seems to be diminishing. President of the United States Barack Obama is often referred to as the first Black or African- American President. He has said as a youth that he chose to identify as black and worked in community organizing in a black community. His mother and her parents were of European descent; his father and his family are sub-Saharan African from Kenya. But, in a case exemplifying the complex racial history of the United States, Obama is believed to be descended through his maternal line from John Punch, the first African documented historically as a slave in Virginia.SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, \\"Obama Has Ties to Slavery Not by His Father but His Mother, Research Suggests\\", New York Times, 30 July 2012; accessed 30 June 2017 The genealogical company Ancestry.com sponsored a study of his family history and documented this connection. Punch's descendants increasingly married white and are believed to have been accepted as white by the early 18th century. Since the 1960s particularly and the rise of the Black Power movement, many members of the African-American community have emphasized that mixed-race individuals of African descent should identify as black in order to maximize their political power as a group in the United States. Leaders say they were historically discriminated against as black by whites, so should identify as black to assert their power in number. In the US, people have historically less consistently apply hypodescent in intermarriage between whites and persons of other racial groups, such as Native Americans, and Asians. There was certainly discrimination against persons of mixed European and Native American, and European and Asian ancestry, however. But hypodescent is not practiced only by persons of European ancestry. In Omaha, Nebraska, whites have celebrated Logan Fontenelle, a mixed-race man of the late 19th century who served as interpreter for a major treaty between the Omaha Nation and the United States that ceded most of their land before they moved to a reservation. Whites referred to Fontenell as chief of the Omaha, and he was one of the signatories of the treaty along with Omaha chiefs, perhaps because he spoke English. Whites named various places in the city of Omaha after Fontenelle. But among the Omaha, Fontenelle was considered a \\"white man\\" because his father was white, and he was never recognized as a recognized chief. As the Omaha had a patrilineal kinship society, hereditary chieftainship and descent were passed through the male line. A person whose father was white was not considered Omaha unless he was formally adopted by a male Omaha member. Melvin Randolph Gilmore, \\"The True Logan Fontenelle\\", Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011  Evolution  Richard Dawkins observes in passing that in the United States and Great Britain, societies have developed something like \\"genetic dominance\\" in our use of language to identify children from mixed-race unions. He notes first, that people seem to be eager to embrace racial classification, even when talking about people of obviously mixed parentage; and second, that we tend not to describe people as of mixed race. Mixed-race children of European-African unions tend to be identified as \\"black\\", in what Dawkins calls a \\"cultural or memetic dominant\\". He opines that this may be a cross-cultural practice with a biological basis; that perhaps humans are genetically wired to recognize and differentiate among minor superficial differences. This is in contrast to what humans share in the \\"unusually high level of genetic uniformity in the human species\\" (compared to for example, chimpanzee subspecies). Scholars speculate about the evolutionary purpose of such differentiation served; it may have contributed to group solidarity when social groups were small tribes of hunter gatherers, lived further apart in different regions, and were divided by many cultural factors. He suggests that such differentiation may be an \\"information-rich way to classify people\\".  References in culture  Both African-American and white authors have explored issues related to mixed race and hypodescent in fiction and non-fiction. In the novel Pudd'nhead Wilson, by Mark Twain, the character of the enslaved woman Roxy is described as \\"Negro\\", although she has considerable white ancestry and could pass for white. Her son is born into slavery and is 1/32 part black. He is mistakenly switched in infancy with the white son of the master's household, and each grows up to fulfill his social role. The US late-19th century author Charles Chesnutt, who grew up free in Ohio and was of mixed African-European ancestry, wrote numerous stories set in the post-Civil War South. He explored the issues encountered by persons of mixed race, in some cases relating what became known as the tragic mulatto genre. Passing is a 1929 novel by Nella Larsen, dealing with mixed-race African-American women who choose alternate paths for marriage and identity. In the musical Show Boat (1927), a white man is married to a mixed-race woman passing for white. He is accused by the sheriff of violating the state's anti- miscegenation laws. The white man pricks his wife's finger with a knife, swallows a drop of blood, then tells the sheriff \\"I'm no white man ‚Äì I've got negro blood in me.\\" The sheriff lets him off. Sinclair Lewis's novel Kingsblood Royal uses hypodescent and the \\"one drop\\" principle as principal plot elements. Numerous memoirs have been published by African Americans who explore growing up as mixed race with a white parent, such as The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother by James McBride. Bliss Broyard, in One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life, wrote about her father Anatole Broyard's decision to live and work as a writer, rather than a black writer, largely separating from his mixed-race, Louisiana Creole family. He married a white woman of Swedish descent and their children appear white.

Idelsohn is generally acknowledged as the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of modern Jewish musicology. During his time in Jerusalem, he noted a great diversity of musical traditions among the Jews living in the region. Idelsohn examined these traditional melodies and found recurring motifs and progressions that were not found in any other national music. This suggested a common origin for musical phrases that went back to Israel/Palestine in the first century C.E. He found that these motifs fell into three distinct tonal centers, which corresponded to the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes of the ancient Greeks. Each of these modes elicited a distinct psycho-emotional response. The Dorian Mode was used for texts of an elevated and inspired nature; the Phrygian for sentimental texts, with their very human outbreaks of feeling, both of joy and grief; and the Lydian was used in composing music for the texts of lamenting and confessions of sins. Idelsohn further categorized and defined these motives as ones that either prepared a musical phrase, began it, or concluded it. His works include the monumental Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies (10 volumes, 1914‚Äì1932) and Jewish Music (1929). He is considered to be the author of the lyrics of the famous Jewish folk song \\"Hava Nagila.\\"See Who Wrote Havah Nagilah? at RadioHazak.comJoel Joffe mentioned his grandfather and his grandfather's role in writing Hava Nagila in an appearance on BBC Radio 4 Desert Island Discs on 28 October 2007 He is the maternal grandfather of Joel Goodman Joffe (Baron Joffe).More evidence of the relationship between Idelsohn and Joffe is provided in this family tree  Notes   References  * Works by and about Abraham Zevi Idelsohn in University Library JCS Frankfurt am Main: Digital Collections Judaica * Idelsohn at the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica * On-line access to Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies: English edition, omitting vols 3‚Äì5 * Hebrew edition, vols 1‚Äì5 only External links * Category:1882 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Ventspils Municipality Category:People from Courland Governorate Category:Latvian Jews Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the Ottoman Empire Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:American people of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:Musicologists Category:Hazzans Category:Jewish folklorists Category:20th-century singers Category:20th-century musicologists Category:Jewish musicologists Category:Jewish music Category:Hebrew Union College faculty ","title":"Abraham Zevi Idelsohn"},{"id":"2156632","text":"Saint Patrick's Shrine, now in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin; an inscription on the rear begins \\"Pray for Domnall Ua Lochlainn on whose order this bell was made...\\" Domhnall Ua Lochlainn (old spelling: Domnall Ua Lochlainn) (1048 - 10 February 1121), also known as Domhnall Mac Lochlainn (old spelling: Domnall Mac Lochlainn),Ua Lochlainn and its replacement Mac Lochlainn are surnames, from which the modern Irish surnames McLaughlin, O'Loughlin and MacLoughlin are derived. They should be distinguished from ua Lochlainn and mac Lochlainn, usually meaning grandson and son of Lochlann respectively. claimed to be High King of Ireland. High Kingship after M√°el Sechnaill Outline political map of Ireland in 1014. The meaning, and even the definition, of the High Kingship of Ireland to which Domnall laid claim was far from clear in the period after the death of the last traditional U√≠ N√©ill king of Tara, M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill of Clann Cholm√°in, in 1022. Later, rival kings produced differing definitions. Domnall's legal men, for example, claimed that a High King \\"with opposition\\" was the king of a province who could lead his army throughout Ireland without defeat, and this Domnall could do. The supporters of his southern rival, Muirchertach Ua Briain of Munster, disagreed, and said a High King \\"without opposition\\" should control three great port cities of Ireland: Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, cities over which Muirchertach exercised some control.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, Early Medieval Ireland, pp. 273-277; Griffin, The Mac Lochlainn High-Kingship, pp. 10-11. Regardless of legal frictions, he was the first king to construct something resembling an over-lordship of Ireland after the death of M√°el Sechnaill was Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥ of the U√≠ Cheinnselaig. King of Leinster and the Foreigners in his obituary, Diarmait was more than this, the effective ruler of much of Ireland. His son Murchad ruled Dublin, Toirdelbach Ua Briain in Munster was his client, and Niall mac Eochada of Ulster was his ally.Byrne, pp. 271-272; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, pp. 277-278. Diarmait's career ended with his death in battle, attempting to subjugate the heirs of M√°el Sechnaill, on Tuesday 7 February 1072.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1072. Diarmait's position was quickly taken by his former ally Toirdelbach Ua Briain. Ua Briain installed his son, Muirchertach in Dublin, and campaigned in Ulster. In Leinster and Connacht he pursued a policy of setting rival families against each other. Domnall Ua Lochlainn, on his coming to power in 1084, was left undisturbed by Ua Briain, who fell ill the following year and died in 1086, aged 77. At his death, even the partisan northern annals recognized Toirdelbach Ua Briain as king of Ireland.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, Early Medieval Ireland, pp. 278-279; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1086. Origins Domnall was the son of a certain Ardgar son of Lochlann. Genealogical compilations, such as that surviving in the Rawlinson B.502 manuscript trace Domnall's ancestry back, through the High King Domnall ua N√©ill, and his father the heroic Muirchertach of the Leather Cloaks, to Niall Gl√∫ndub. It appears subtly different in the Book of Leinster. Rather than being the descendants of Lochlann, grandson of Domnall ua N√©ill, the Meic Lochlainn appear to have been descended from another Lochlann, Lochlann mac Ma√≠l Sechna√≠ll, a descendant of Niall Gl√∫ndub's less renowned brother Domnall Dabaill. Nonetheless, the Meic Lochlainn were members of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain branch of the U√≠ N√©ill, and could rightly claim famous ancestors. Under Domnall, the Cen√©l nE√≥gain were again a significant force in Irish politics.Griffin, The Mac Lochlainn High-Kingship, pp. 4-5 & 9-10; Byrne, Irish Kings, p. 284. The proposed descent is no novelty, being that presented by James Henthorn Todd in his 1867 Rolls Series edition of the Cogadh Gaedhel Re Gallaibh, p. cxcviii, note 1. In the years before Domnall, the Cen√©l nE√≥gain had been largely bereft of effective leadership, so much so that Conchobar Ua Briain of Munster, cousin and bitter enemy of Toirdelbach, had been invited to take the kingship of the Tulach √ìc branch of the kindred, and following Conchobar's murder with his wife in 1078, his brother Cenn√©tig was invited to succeed him.Bracken, \\"Toirdelbach\\". Domnall became king of Ailech in 1083 and began his reign in traditional fashion, with an inaugural raid‚Äîcrech r√≠g‚Äîagainst the Conaille Muirthemne (in the region of modern Dundalk, County Louth).Flanagan. The Annals of Ulster state that Domnall \\"carried off a great prey of cattle and gave stipends from that prey to the men of Fernmag [the people and land from whom modern County Fermanagh was named]\\".Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1083. However, Muirchertach Ua Briain the new king of Munster (a matrilineal kinsman of Toirdelbach), moved to oppose the rule of Meic Lochlainn between 1101 and 1119. Death and after Domnall's glowing obituary in the Annals of Ulster reads as follows: > Domnall son of Ardgar son of Lochlann, over-king of Ireland, pre-eminent > among the Irish in form and lineage, in sense and valour, in happiness and > prosperity, in giving valuables and food, died in Daire Coluim Cille in the > thirty-eighth year of his reign, the seventy-third year of his age, on > Wednesday night, the fourth of the Ides [i.e. 10 February 1121] and the > eighteenth of the moon, the feast of Mo-Chuar√≥c the wise.Annals of Ulster, > s.a. 1121.

Origin According to legend, an Indian monk who liked travelling in a wooden cup was believed to have lodged where the Monastery now stands. Attracted by the natural wonders and the serene milieu, he built a chalet there for practicing meditation. Since then, the name of Reverend Pui To () has become widespread. In memory of him, his followers built a pagoda at the place where he formerly resided. At the back of the pagoda was a statue of Reverend Pui To. The time of construction, however, cannot be ascertained. Some say the Pui To Pagoda was built in the Jin Dynasty and redeveloped in the Song Dynasty. Regular maintenance works has kept the historical relic's original appearance intact.

Regnal years considered the date as an ordinal, not a cardinal number. For example, a monarch could have a first year of rule, a second year of rule, a third year of rule, and so on, but not a zeroth year of rule. Applying this ancient epoch system to modern calculations of time, which include zero, is what led to the debate over when the third millennium began. Regnal years are \\"finite era names\\", contrary to \\"infinite era names\\" such as Christian era, Jimmu era, Juche era, and so on. Early use In ancient times, calendars were counted in terms of the number of years of the reign of the current monarch. Reckoning long periods of times required a king list. The oldest such reckoning is preserved in the Sumerian king list. Ancient Egyptian chronology was also dated using regnal years. The Zoroastrian calendar also operated with regnal years following the reform of Ardashir I in 3rd century. The Canon of Kings is a list that dates the reigns of various Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, Egyptian, and Roman monarchs, that was used by ancient astronomers as a way to date astronomical phenomena. The Liberian Catalogue is a similar list of popes of Early Christianity, that was used to date early events in the religion's history. East and Southeast Asian era names Regnal years were generally used for year marking in East Asia before the advent of era names. In China, the first continuous use of era names was in 140 BC, during the rule of the Emperor Wu of Han. Prior to that, years were usually marked as regnal years of the monarch. Since 140 BC, era names served as titles for the purpose of numbering and identifying years. Era names were used for over two millennia by Chinese emperors and are still used in Japan. The Lanfang Republic era, Republic of Formosa era and Republic of China calendar are systems adapted from the traditional era name system, but they are not effectively era names. The Confucius era and Juche era are based on the year of birth of the thinker or eternal president. The Huangdi era, Dangun era and k≈çki were counted in terms of the number of years of the reign of the first monarch. As a result of Chinese cultural influence, other polities in the Sinosphere‚ÄîKorea, Vietnam and Japan‚Äîalso adopted the concept of era name as a result of Chinese cultural influence. Abolished era names may be reused, for example as a means of claiming or denying political legitimacy. An example of this is, that when the Yongle emperor usurped the throne from his nephew he dated the year of his accession as \\"Ê¥™Ê≠¶‰∏âÂçÅ‰∫îÂπ¥\\", the 35th year of his father, the Hongwu Emperor's reign, i.e. 1402. Hongwu had in fact died in 1398, and the short reign of the Jianwen Emperor, who ruled between 1398 and 1402 was written out of the official record. However, they would sometimes still be used. ÊôØÂàùÂõõÂπ¥ (240) was used on Japanese bronze mirrors.ÁéãÂãáËëó Âª£Âæ∑ÂõõÂπ¥ (766) and Âª∫‰∏≠ÂÖ´Âπ¥ (787) were used in a Western Regions tomb and a document.ÈïøÊ≤≥ËêΩÊó•ÂúÜ‚Äî‚ÄîËØ¶ËÆÆÂÆâÂè≤‰πã‰π±[‰∏≠](2) Kuchlug did not change the era name.

The short lived Daxi kingdom, post Zhang Xianzhong, used the Ganzhi calendar without era names.

Until 1367 AD several were used during each emperor's reign. From 1368 AD until 1912 AD only one era name was used by each emperor, who was posthumously known by his era name, which meant that the era name became equivalent to a regnal year. The tradition of Chinese era names survives in the Republic of China's Minguo calendar, with Minguo, the Chinese for Republic, taking the place of the era name. =Japanese= The official Japanese system or numbers years from the accession of the current emperor, regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year. The system was in use sporadically from 645 and continuously from 701. Until 1867 several era names were used during each emperor's reign. From 1868 only one has been used by each emperor. Since 1868 each emperor has been known posthumously by his era name. The current emperor, Naruhito succeeded to the throne on 1 May 2019, after his father Akihito abdicated the throne, citing age and poor health. The name of his era is Reiwa, which was formally announced by the Government of Japan a month before Naruhito succeeded the throne, on 1 April 2019. Therefore, 1 May 2019 is considered the beginning of the Reiwa 1. The former emperor, Akihito, succeeded the throne on 7 January 1989 on the death of his father Emperor Sh≈çwa, with the name Heisei decreed as the name of his regnal era by the Cabinet. Thus the year 1989 corresponds to . =Korean= The use of era names was common throughout the various historical states that occupied the Korean peninsula. Korean endemic eras were used from 391 to 1274 and from 1894 to 1910. During the later years of the Joseon Dynasty, years were also numbered from the founding of that dynasty in 1393. From 1952 until 1961, years were numbered in Dangi in South Korea, counting from the legendary founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC. During the Joseon Dynasty, Korea used Chinese era names as a demonstration of its respect and loyalty to Ming and Qing dynasty of China. Even after the Ming Dynasty was replaced by Qing, Koreans continued to use the Ming era names, using the era name of the last Ming emperor, the Chongzhen Emperor, after his death in 1644, and continued to do so for nearly 200 years. However, this was done mostly privately, because of the pressure exerted by the Qing government. The tradition of Korean era names survives in the North Korean Juche calendar, with Juche year 1 being 1912 the year of the birth of Kim Il-sung. Commonwealth realms Regnal years continues to see limited use in the Commonwealth realms, a group of sixteen sovereign states that share the same monarch. The present conventions for regnal years in the Commonwealth realms originates with the Kingdom of England, which used regnal years to date its public documents. The start of a new regnal era in the English regnal dating system originally began on the date of the monarch's coronation. However, the system was changed in 1307 to begin on the date the monarch succeeds the throne, beginning with the ascension of Edward II. The regnal years used throughout the Commonwealth realms are identical to one another, as they share the same line of succession. The present monarch, Elizabeth II, became the sovereign on 6 February 1952, after the death of her father George VI. Thus, 6 February 1952 is considered the beginning of the year 1 Eliz. 2; with the last day of each Eliz. 2 regnal year being 5 February. =Canada= The regnal dating system is used in the numbering system for all Acts of the Parliament of Canada. All Acts are given an individual chapter number, assigned by its numeric order of when it received royal assent, along with the regnal year, and the name of the reigning Monarch of Canada. The use of regnal years in legal citations is acceptable in Canadian legal practices, although usage of the Gregorian calendar is more common. The use of the regnal year was used throughout the legislative sessional volumes of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, until it was replaced by the calendar year in 1949. However, the regnal year continues to be used on the title pages of the legislature's sessional volumes. =United Kingdom= The use of regnal years in the United Kingdom originated in England, a country of the United Kingdom. The regnal dating system was used to date documents of parliamentary sessions until 1963, when it began to date its documents using the Gregorian calendar. The change to the Gregorian calendar was legislated under the Acts of Parliament Numbering and Citation Act 1962. Similar practices While not strictly a regnal year, time in the United States of America can be derived from the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776). For example, the U.S. Constitution is dated as signed in \\"the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth,\\" and Presidential proclamations will often be ended \\"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this [ordinal] day of [month], in the year of our Lord [year], and of the Independence of the United States of America the [year].\\" is the year of the Independence of the United States of America on and after July 4 of that year. Time is also sometimes reckoned in terms (and sessions, if necessary) of Congress; e.g. House of Representatives Bill 2 of the 112th Congress is dated \\"112th CONGRESS, 1st Session\\".112 H.R. 2  References  Category:Calendar eras Category:History of East Asia Category:Monarchy ","title":"Regnal year"},{"id":"2156652","text":"Francis de Laporte de Castelnau Fran√ßois Louis Nompar de Caumont La Force, comte de Castelnau (25 December 1810Some sources give his year of birth as 1812. ‚Äì 4 February 1880) was a French naturalist, known also as Fran√ßois Laporte or Francis de Castelnau. , and zoological names other than insects.

From 1837 to 1841 he led a scientific expedition to Canada, where he studied the fauna of the Canadian lakes and the river systems of Upper and Lower Canada (roughly corresponding to the modern provinces of Ontario and Quebec) and of the United States.

Having helped found Existentialism, he uses it and a high-level of theology citing the scriptures of the Christian Bible. Many of the chapters take a mention of love from the New Testament and center reflections about the transfer of individuals from secular modes (the stages of the aesthetic and ethical) to genuine religious experience and existence. Since human experience is a key to understanding Kierkegaard, the actual relationships and experiences of disciples and of Christ are characterized here as tangible models for behavior. Kierkegaard as a Christian ethicist (represented by this work) is likely to be considered distinct from many ways in which the religion's mainstream seems to function from the viewpoint of an outside observer. This is not only a function of Christian existentialism but also of his time period and political events occurring in his native Denmark. Themes *Part One ‚Äî Topics include: Love's Hidden Life and Its Recognisability by its Fruits, You Shall Love, You Shall Love Your Neighbor, Love is the Fulfilling of the Law, Love is a Matter of Conscience, Our Duty to Love Those We See, and Our Duty to be in the Debt of Love to Each Other *Part Two ‚Äî Topics include: Love Builds up, Love Believes all Things and Yet is Never Deceived, Love Hopes all Things and Yet is Never Put to Shame, Love Seeks Not its Own, Love Hides The Multiplicity of Sins, Love Abides, Mercifulness, a Work of Love, Even if it Can Give Nothing and Is Capable of Doing Nothing, The Victory of Reconciliation in Love Which Wins the Vanquished, The work of Love in Remembering One Dead, and The Work of Love in Praising Love Style The Works as Kierkegaard himself states are Christian reflections and not discourses.

Published in 2001, it is a pastiche of the science fiction story Flowers for Algernon. \\"Flowers for Rhino\\" appeared in Spider-Man's Tangled Web #5‚Äì6. Plot summary Rhino, a brutish and dimwitted enemy of Spider-Man, suffers a mid-life crisis after he attempts to rescue Stella, the beautiful daughter of a mob boss, who coldly informs him after he is hired as a full- time bodyguard on the grounds that he is too stupid to be a serious romantic or business threat. Recalling a recent meeting with the doctors who created his latest suit, he undergoes a brain operation that turns him into a super genius. With his new intellect, he quickly demonstrates a change in his usual methods, allowing him to defeat Spider-Man, subsequently running away with Stella to start his own crime organization. With his new intellect, he writes a novel, gets a restraining order that prevents Spider-Man from attacking him, sets up a crime syndicate (with the aid of such other criminals as the Mad Thinker, after breaking them out of prison), and even rewrites Hamlet. Unfortunately, it has the side effect of making the subject so intelligent that he is no longer able to fully enjoy life, with Rhino driving Stella away because he finds her too dimwitted to attract his attention. Finally reaching a point where he finds no real meaning in life, Rhino hands Spider-Man, having deduced his identity via an equation he developed that allows him to calculate the secret identities of superheroes, information with which he can bring down Rhino's crime empire. He nearly commits suicide, but at the last minute he comes up with a means of reversing the original operation and restoring his original intellect, even requesting that he be made \\"a bit stupider than before\\". He is soon restored to his former stupid but happy self, delightedly crashing through walls. Reception Randy Lander from the fourthrail.com stated the mix of the classic Flowers for Algernon was \\"funny and clever\\". Fegredo's artwork was praised although he said Buccellato's heavy colouring detracted from the story.

Background  With an area of almost 150 square kilometres, Venray, a municipality in the north of Limburg, is one of the largest municipalities in the Netherlands. More than half of the land used to be part of the Peel, an area of vital importance for the local farmers. The presence of wide areas of moorland led to the development of sheep farming and related cottage industries, such as the production of yarn, cloth and hats. Sheep produced an average of 2,5 kilograms of wool each per annum, and were therefore a welcome source of secondary income, quite apart from the droppings that they left on the land. At that time sheep were not reared for their meat. However, the French soldiers who were stationed in Venray from 1794 to 1814 were enthusiastic mutton eaters, and this gave the farmers cause to take another look at the economic value of their animals.  Foundation of the Venray sheep companies  Around 1809 some of the sheep farmers had the idea of driving their sheep to Paris, at that time the capital city of the empire to which they belonged, and offering them for sale. When it became known that this trade was profitable, others soon followed in the pioneers' footsteps. Five farmers pooled their interests and founded a partnership, \\"De Grote Compagnie\\" (The big company), which set up an organized trade route between Venray and Paris, with fixed staging posts along the way. The drive on foot to the markets of Paris took two weeks on average, and ran south of the Peel to Antwerp, and then through the lush pastures along the Schelde to northern France. The herds were collected together in the border village of Warcoing before undertaking the last stage of their journey to Paris.  Expansion of the Venray sheep companies  Initially the partners only drove their own sheep, but within a few years there was a network of buyers in The Netherlands, and Venray became the focus of a trade which saw tens of thousands of sheep being sent to France each year, not only by \\"De Grote Compagnie\\", but also by five smaller enterprises. Under the Raets, Poels, Camps, Trynes and Vorstermans families the business flourished to such a degree that in 1845 a second outlet market, London, was opened up, to which the sheep were transported from ports such as Harlingen, Medemblik, Rotterdam, and Vlissingen. Dutch sheep farmers were meanwhile unable to cope with the demand, so that ever increasing numbers of German sheep were being bought, and when even this source proved inadequate, representatives of the company travelled to the Ukraine, Denmark and Iceland in circa 1875, and in 1891 a trading office was opened in Buenos Aires, which arranged for the transport of not just live sheep, but also deep-frozen meat to Europe. At the beginning of the 20th century, the meat trade in the slaughterhouses of Paris, London and Antwerp was dominated by Venray businesses, and until the outbreak of World War II they were the most important producers of bacon and tinned ham in Poland, Hungary, and Canada. Although the smaller sheep companies folded one by one after 1900, \\"De Grote Compagnie\\" remained in existence until 1951, when representatives of the eleven participating families from a number of different countries held their final annual gathering in the high-class Swan Hotel in Venray, at the card table of which, 150 years earlier, their joint company had been founded. In the intervening time this initiative had given rise to a host of independent companies. At this gathering the final collective bank balance, a sum of 5,000 guilders, was presented to the parochial church of Venray to finance a new choir stall, which since then serves as a reminder of a unique example of Limburg enterprise.

WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947 and has grown in 2018 to 113 national medical associationshttps://www.wma.net/news-post/wma-general-assembly-6 and more than 10 million physicians. History The WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des M√©decins\\", which had suspended its activities because of World War II. In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva- based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named \\"World Medical Assembly.\\" Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, and worked on a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates, which was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the \\"Declaration of Geneva.\\" Also in the same II General Assembly a report on \\"War Crimes and Medicine\\" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. Governance =General Assembly= The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). =Council= The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially. Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. Secretariat The WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva. Official languages English, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation.  Membership  Map showing the 112 WMA Constituent Members The WMA have the following status of membership: * Constituent Membership: Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations). Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions. * Associate Membership: Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. See more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership): Projects The WMA is active in several areas of action,https://www.wma.net/what-we-do/ but mainly in: * Advocacy * Ethics * Health Systems * Human Rights * Public Health In what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. A wide range of subjects are covered like the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution. WMA also works on: * Medical education * Human resources planning for health care services * Patient safety * Leadership and career development * Advocacy for physicians' and patients' rights * Occupational health and safety * Democracy building for new medical associations * Public health policy * Projects such as tobacco control and immunization The WMA also works on Education Programs such as the prison- medicine course, the MDR-TB and the TB refresher course, the ethics course and the course on microbial resistance (together with the George Mason University and the International Society for Microbial Resistance). Publications All WMA policy documents and publications (some in various languages) are available for free download on their website. These include: * The World Medical Journal * The WMA Medical Ethics Manual * The World Medical and Health Policy Journal * Caring Physicians of the World Controversies During the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was \\"copied word for word\\" from Simpson's speech. \\"Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors\\", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful. On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards. In an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism. A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he \\"acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson\\", and most delegates \\"accepted his apology\\" for the mistake.

Woods, Garter Principal King of Arms 1869‚Äì1904 Sir Albert William Woods (16 April 18167 January 1904) was an English officer of arms, who served as Garter Principal King of Arms from 1869 to 1904. The Woods family has a strong tradition of service at the College of Arms. Albert Woods was the son of Sir William Woods, Garter King of Arms from 1838 until his death in 1842. Likewise, the grandson of Albert Woods was Sir Gerald Woods Wollaston, who also rose to the rank of Garter King of Arms and served there from 1930 until 1944. Heraldic career Woods' first heraldic appointment came in 1837 when he served as Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary at the coronation of Queen Victoria. In 1838 Woods became a member of the chapter of the College of Arms when he was appointed Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. After a short appointment as Norfolk Herald of Arms Extraordinary, Woods was promoted to the office of Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary in 1841. He held this position until 1869, when he was appointed Garter Principal King of Arms, a position he held until his death 35 years later. From 1866, Woods was registrar of the College of Arms. At his appointment as Garter Principal King of Arms, he was also named the King of Arms of the Order of St Michael and St George. In 1878, he was made registrar of the Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire. He officiated at the coronations both of Queen Victoria and of Edward VII. Woods's eye for heraldic design has been deprecated by some heraldists. In his Complete Guide to Heraldry, Arthur Fox-Davies refers to his designs as \\"wretched\\", \\"unsuitable\\" and \\"abortions\\". He is particularly critical of the crests granted by Woods, which frequently incorporated tree trunks, either in front of the crest or underneath it, a practice Davies considered unheraldic. \\"Garter's Ordinaries\\" Woods was responsible for the compilation of the important unpublished ordinary of arms (a systematic register of coats of arms) known as \\"Garter's Ordinaries\\". He began work on it in 1842 and continued until his death in 1904. By that date the ordinary comprised two series, one of five and the other of six volumes, plus indexes. Following his death it was donated to the College of Arms by his grandson, Gerald Woods Wollaston: since then, subsequent Garter Kings of Arms have added to it and kept it up to date by including within it new grants of arms. It remains in use: Sir Anthony Wagner has described it as \\"an indispensable tool at the College\\".

Robert Wodrow was born at Glasgow, where his father, James Wodrow, was a professor of divinity. Robert was educated at the university and was librarian from 1697 to 1701. From 1703 till his death, he was parish minister at Eastwood, near Glasgow. He had sixteen children, his son Patrick being the \\"auld Wodrow\\" of Burns's poem Twa Herds. Biography Robert Wodrow was the youngest son of James Wodrow, Professor of Divinity, at the University of Glasgow. He was born in the Trongate there, April (or September) 1679. At the very hour of his birth, soldiers under warrant of the Privy Council, were searching the house to seize his father, but the latter, having exchanged clothes with the physician's man- servant, succeeded in escaping. Wodrow entered the University of Glasgow in 1691, and graduated with an M.A. on 18 January 1697. He served as chaplain in the house of his kinsman, Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, and for several years he was librarian to the University of Glasgow. On 6 January 1703, he was licensed by the Presbytery of Paisley, and ordained to Eastwood on 28 October of that year. In 1707 he was one of a Committee of Presbyterians appointed to consult and act with the Commission in Edinburgh as to the best means of averting the evils with which the Union of the Kingdoms seemed to threaten the church and people of Scotland. On the accession of George I. in 1714, he was principal correspondent and adviser of the five ministers sent by the Assembly to London to plead the rights of the Church, and particularly to petition for the abolition of patronage. He assisted Principal Hadow in drawing up the Act of Assembly (1731) for the filling up of vacant parishes, the passing of which in the following year gave rise to the Associate Presbytery. He declined calls to Glasgow in 1712, to Stirling in 1717, and again in 1726. He died on 21 March 1734. An enthusiastic collector of information on the history and personal ministry of the Church, he left behind him a vast accumulation of interesting and illuminative MSS. many of which were printed by the Wodrow Society (1841‚Äì50), the Maitland and other Clubs. The Wodrow MSS. are preserved in the Advocates Library, and the Library of the University of Glasgow Family He married November 1708, Margaret (died 27 January 1758), widow of Ebenezer Veitch, minister of Ayr, and daughter of Patrick Warner of Ardeer, minister of Irvine, and had issue: *Janet, born 1710, buried 5 April 1773 [\\"Her days and nights were devoted to the poor, to whom she gave her personal but unostentatious attendance\\"]; *Robert, his successor in Eastwood *Patrick, minister of Tarbolton; *James, minister of Stevenston; *Alexander, settled in America, had an estate there, and died about the end of the first American War; *Mary, died unmarried; *Margaret (married Matthew Biggar, minister of Kirkoswald); *Marion, died unmarried; *Martha *six others died early. Works Wodrow's major work, The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution, was published in two volumes in 1721‚Äì1722 (new ed. with a life of Wodrow by Robert Burns, DD, 1807‚Äì1808). This recorded and denounced the persecution of the Covenanters after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, including what he called \\"The Killing Times\\" . He was one of the first historians to use \\"publick records, original papers, and manuscripts of that time\\" and included many first hand accounts of this period in the history of the Church of Scotland, producing a martyrology that the church would turn to again at times of suffering. The work was approved by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and dedicated to George I, who recognised its semi-official character by, on 26 April 1725, authorising the payment out of the exchequer of 100 guineas to Wodrow. As an apprentice, the soon-to-be prominent London bookseller Andrew Millar sent Wodrow book price-lists. As a friend of Millar's father, Wodrow may have helped to apprentice Millar to James McEuen, who was also his friend. Wodrow also wrote a Life (1828) of his father. He left two other works in manuscript: Memoirs of Reformers and Ministers of the Church of Scotland, and Analecta: or Materials for a History of Remarkable Providences, mostly relating to Scotch Ministers and Christians. Of the former, two volumes were published by the Maitland Club in 1834‚Äì1845 and one volume by the New Spalding Club in 1890; the latter was published in four volumes by the Maitland Club in 1842‚Äì1843. Wodrow left a great mass of correspondence, three volumes of which, edited by Thomas McCrie, appeared in 1842‚Äì1843. The Wodrow Society, founded in Edinburgh to perpetuate his memory, was in existence from 1841 to 1847, several works being published under its auspices.

Her most notable positions were Vice President for Action of The National Organization of Women (NOW) starting in 1990 and Director for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.  Education and Early Activism  Dempsey earned her B.A in Sociology from the College of New Rochelle in 1967, which was a private, all women's Catholic college. It is known as the first Catholic women's college in New York State when it was founded in 1904. In the Fall of 2016, the College of New Rochelle admitted men for the first time. Later she earned her Juris Doctor from Rutgers University Law School. As a young student, she began her activist career speaking out during the civil rights movement in the 1960s and participating in anti-war protests. Career Highlights * Founded \\"New Jersey Women Take Back the Night,\\" with the goal to generate public awareness and lobby legislators for the fight against violence against women * Chartered the New Jersey Chapter of NOW as President *Formed a battered women's shelter in New Jersey called Womanspace *Chaired a statewide coalition to pass lesbian and gay rights legislation in New Jersey *Served National Board member of the LAMBDA Legal Defense and Education Fund *Founded feminist law firm McGahen, Dempsey and Case *Served as a trustee on the New Jersey Bar Association for four years for the women's rights section *Served as DC Director for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy  Professional life  Dempsey studied law and worked in the criminal justice system. She practiced law for 12 years in New Jersey, where she founded the feminist law firm McGahen, Dempsey and Case. She became interested in the women's movement in the 1960s because it affected her and every other woman. She came across NOW in 1970 and has played an active role in the organization since. She played a vital role in the chartering of the New Jersey Chapter of NOW in 1973 where she served as their first president. She says, \\"[NOW] came along at a time in my life when I had little children, and I needed to connect with some meaningful movement.\\" = Work with NOW = NOW was founded in June 1966. It started as 28 women who attended the Third National Conference of Commissions on the Status of Women in DC. Today, NOW is the largest women's rights organization in the U.S. NOW has worked toward women's equality and dignity. To do so, they have gone up against issues such as discrimination in education, credit, and employment. NOW also works to help the reputation of women who choose to stay at home, and have helped to elevate their voices. NOW has also fought for the rights of women in marriage and divorce. Dempsey was Vice President of the organization during a tumultuous time for women's rights, and was at the forefront of many key feminists movements. During her time with NOW, she travelled around the country on a speaking tour to talk about feminist issues. Some colleges on this tour included Penn State, Franklin and Marshall College, the University of Pennsylvania, Haverford College, and Carnegie Mellon University. A main topic during this tour was the wage gap for women. At this time women were making 58% of what men made, so it was at the forefront of NOW's work. Dempsey was also Vice President of NOW when Justice Clarence Thomas was nominated as a Supreme Court Justice. She was quoted saying that Thomas' hearing was a \\"collective click\\" for women all over the nation. Dempsey helped plan the \\"We Won't Go Back!\\" March for Women's Lives in Washington DC that took place on April 5, 1992. This march was sponsored by NOW, and advocated for abortion rights in America. This walk had over half a million attendees, and was organized to impress lawmakers and the public during a time when the Supreme Court was hearing a case that had the ability to severely limit women's rights. The New York Times wrote an article that day outlining the dangers of the Supreme Court Case. > On April 22, the High Court will hear arguments on a Pennsylvania law that > seeks to limit access to abortion through a variety of regulations, > including a 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that women seeking > abortions notify their husbands. Many people on both sides see that case as > a potential vehicle for overturning Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, some states have > adopted even stricter limits. The Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Robert P. Casey was a landmark case that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade to secure abortion rights to women. This case sparked the March on Washington, and attracted many women, including celebrities and students from around the nation. A similar march took place in Los Angeles a week later. = Domestic Violence = In 1991, there were roughly 1 million incidents reported of domestic violence towards women, and another 3 million incidents were predicted as unreported. Domestic violence had become so common in society at the time that it had been named the top health risk against women. She was a founding member of \\"New Jersey Women Take Back the Night,\\" an organization that helped to generate public awareness for violence against women. This group also lobbied legislators to gain support for the movement to stop violence against women, and create laws to protect women. This was the start to the idea of the Violence Against Women Act. She has also supported women who have faced domestic violence through her work to create a battered women's shelter in New Jersey called Womanspace. = Gay Rights = Being an openly gay women, she also advocated for gay rights. During this time, gay couples were not able to have the same rights and privileges as heterosexual married couples. This meant they were barred from the hospital rooms where their partners were being treated, or they were thrown out of their houses after their partners' death. They did not have the same protections as their heterosexual counterparts. Dempsey was a lawyer in many cases revolving around these issues, and fought for equal rights for gay people. She also chaired a coalition to pass lesbian and gay rights legislation in New Jersey. = Mitsubishi Law Suit = Dempsey traveled to Tokyo in 1996 to raise awareness about a sexual harassment issue between Mitsubishi and hundreds of women that were employed by them. Dempsey was doing a lot of talking during her trip with many officials from Tokyo including Mitsubishi Motors representatives. With her help and others, the EEOC, sued Mitsubishi which eventually agreed to pay $34 million in a settlement.  Personal life  Dempsey was born in Connecticut in 1946, and earned her bachelor's degree in New York before moving to New Jersey for law school. She did most of her activist work out of New Jersey, and raised her two children there as well who were born in 1971 and 1972. She gained national media attention after gaining full custody of her two children even though she was openly gay in 1979. This made it easier for future homosexual couples looking to gain legal custody of their children. She and her long-time partner, Kim Costanza, owned a gay restaurant, bar and guest house in Pass-A-Grille, Florida that has since been closed.

The source of the radiation may be the sun, or artificial UV sources such as tanning lamps. Tan lines are usually an inadvertent result of a work environment or of recreational activities, but are sometimes intentional. Many people regard visible tan lines as un-aesthetic, and seek to avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Occupation-related tan lines =Farmer's tan= A farmer's tan A \\"farmer's tan\\" (also called \\"golfer's tan\\" or \\"tennis tan\\") refers to the typical tan lines developed by regular outdoor activity when wearing a short sleeve shirt. The farmer's tan usually starts with a suntan covering the exposed parts of the arms and neck. It is distinct in that the shoulders, chest, and back remain unaffected by the sun. Tennis and golf additionally cause recognizable tans on the middle section of the legs, due to the wearing of shorts and socks for prolonged hours in the sun. The \\"Texas tan\\" is similar, with the exception that the shoulders are also affected by the sun, caused by working outdoors while wearing a sleeveless shirt. Some of the common tan lines associated with a farmer's tan include: * elbows (from a short-sleeve shirt) * neck (from shirt collar) * thighs (if shorts are worn) * ankles (from socks, only if exposed) * forehead (if a hat is worn) * wrist (if a watch is worn) * eyes (if sunglasses are worn) =Driver's tan= A \\"driver's tan\\" (or similar terms such as \\"trucker's tan\\" or \\"taxi driver's arm\\") is a tanning pattern where one arm from the sleeve downward is tanned significantly more than the other arm, due to extensive driving of a motor vehicle with the window down. =Sandal tan= A \\"sandal tan\\" is a set of distinctive tan lines on the feet, resulting from the straps of sandals worn throughout the summer by such different professions as lifeguards and monks. Recreation-related tan lines =Bikini tan= Tan lines created by a bikini Wearing a bikini in the sun results in the uncovered skin becoming suntanned and creates a \\"bikini tan\\". These tan lines separate pale breasts, crotch, and buttocks from otherwise tanned skin. \\"Racing stripes\\" may refer to the portion of a bikini tan line exposed when wearing one-piece swimwear. =Biker's tan= A \\"biker's tan\\" is a tan line three- quarters up each leg, where lycra bike shorts would normally begin to cover. Depending on the activity, the inner side of the arms may be paler than the outer side. Unless the biker uses cycling gloves made to allow tanning, the area on the back of each hand will usually not be tanned. =Goggle tan= Raccoon-like tan lines can emerge around the eyes after wearing goggles, common among industrial workers (wearing safety glasses), skiers, snowboarders, and swimmers. =Other recreation-related tan lines= * \\"Golfer tan\\" ‚Äî a tan on the back of a shaved or bald head that forms when a baseball cap is worn. There is a semicircle shaped tan that forms from the strap which adjusts the hat's size. * \\"Soccer tan\\" ‚Äî a stripe of tan from the lower thighs to the bottom of the knees common to soccer players; the upper thighs and lower legs are covered by shorts and shin guards/socks. * \\"Football tan\\" ‚Äî a stripe of tan from below the knees to just above the ankle; the thighs, knees and ankles are covered by uniform pants and ankle socks. Often the arms are tanned similarly to a farmer's tan, but the face is untanned due to wearing a helmet. This tanning effect can be particularly pronounced since many football teams run two-a-day practices during the summer. * \\"Tiger tan\\" ‚Äî two tan stripes on the arm of a lacrosse player, resulting from the gaps between gloves, elbow pads, and shoulder pads. Intentional tan lines Sunscreen on back under normal and UV light One of the common uses for tanning beds is the option of tanning completely nude to reduce the appearance of tan lines. In contrast, some people prefer to have tan lines, and will wear undergarments or swimwear with the deliberate purpose of creating a sharply defined tan line. Additionally, \\"tanning stickers\\" can be purchased that attach to the skin while tanning. Common designs are a heart, Playboy bunny, and dolphins; but many different designs exist. These are typically sold on a roll of 500 to 1000 as single-use, disposable stickers. People can place the sticker on the same area each time they tan (indoors or outdoors) and this will leave the covered area pale, while the rest of their skin tans normally. This allows individuals to see their tanning progress, and allows others to see as well if the \\"tan tattoo\\" is in an exposed area. It is also possible to use sunscreen to create intentional tan lines that form patterns or words, to make a statement or simply create a design. Avoiding tan lines Woman sunbathing wearing minimal clothing The wearing of clothes while tanning results in creation of tan lines, which many people regard as un-aesthetic. Many people want to avoid tan lines on those parts of the body which will be visible when they are fully clothed. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to maximize their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to dispense with clothing; and to maximize coverage, they need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan in the privacy of their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong. A 1969 innovation is tan-through swimwear, which uses fabric perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which transmit enough sunlight to approach an all-over tan, especially if the fabric is stretched taut. Tan-through swimwear typically allows more than one-third of UV rays to pass through (equivalent to SPF 3 or less), and an application of sunscreen even to the covered area is recommended.

The route begins at a T intersection with Aulac Road at Aulac and ends at the western abutment of the Confederation Bridge at Cape Jourimain. It functions as a secondary leg of the Trans-Canada Highway to connect Prince Edward Island with the mainline Trans-Canada Highway Route 2 in Aulac. Route 16 is the last section of the Trans-Canada in New Brunswick that is not 4-lanes with no plans in the near future to be 4 lanes. The highway number \\"16\\" is also the number given to the branch of the Trans-Canada, the Yellowhead Highway in Western Canada. However, the numeric designation is strictly coincidental, and Route 16 is not part of that route. Route description NB Route 16Route 16 begins in Aulac at a T intersection with the Aulac Road; this road having been the original alignment of Route 2 until a 4-lane alignment opened in the early 1990s. Approximately east of Aulac Road, Route 16 interchanges with Route 2 in a cloverleaf interchange, one of only three grade-separated interchanges on the entire route. Route 16 continues east from Aulac as an uncontrolled access 2-lane highway passing through the following communities in rural Westmorland County while paralleling the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia inter-provincial border: Point de Bute, Upper Point de Bute, Jolicure, Halls Hill, and Baie Verte Road. Moose warning sign The first major intersection on Route 16 east of Aulac is a T intersection with Main Street just west of the community of Baie Verte. Main Street is a former alignment of Route 16 and connects with Route 970 in the community of Baie Verte; this alignment was bypassed during a realignment of Route 16 around Baie Verte and Port Elgin in the 1960s. Route 16 continues east on this bypass alignment through Coburg before entering Port Elgin where it interchanges directly with Route 970 and the eastern terminus of Route 15 in a roundabout interchange called the Port Elgin Rotary. The 1960s bypass reconnects with the original alignment of Route 16 at a T intersection with East Main Street on the east side of Port Elgin. Route 16 continues east from Port Elgin as an uncontrolled access 2-lane highway passing through the following communities on the Cape Tormentine peninsula: Timber River (where it intersects Route 960), Hardy, Melrose, and Malden. At Malden the highway intersects with Immigrant Road in a T intersection. Immigrant Road serves Bayfield and Cape Tormentine and is the original alignment of Route 16 from Malden to Cape Tormentine before the Confederation Bridge opened on May 31, 1997. From Malden to the eastern terminus at the abutment of the Confederation Bridge in Cape Jourimain, Route 16 is a controlled access 2-lane highway running on a alignment that opened in 1997. It intersects Route 955 in a grade-separated diamond interchange approximately west of Bayfield. The final interchange on Route 16 is also grade separated and provides access to the Cape Jourimain Nature Centre approximately west of the Confederation Bridge. Traffic leaves Route 16 when entering the Confederation Bridge to cross the Northumberland Strait to Prince Edward Island before continuing on Trans-Canada Highway Route 1. Port Elgin is the only major community along the route. History This highway has been part of the New Brunswick highway network since the Canadian National Railways ferry service from Cape Tormentine NB to Borden PEI began accepting automobiles in the 1920s. The original section from Aulac to Baie Verte was known as the Baie Verte Road, the section through Baie Verte and Port Elgin was known as Main Street, the section from Port Elgin to Bayfield was known as the Immigrant Road, and the section from Bayfield to Cape Tormentine (now part of Route 955) was known as the Bayfield Road. The Trans- Canada Highway and Route 16 designation was applied in the 1960s after the Bayfield and Baie Verte/Port Elgin realignments. There have been three major realignments to the route: * A bypass of Baie Verte and Port Elgin along with the Port Elgin Rotary, constructed in the 1960s as part of the Trans Canada Highway upgrades. * A bypass of Bayfield between Malden and Cape Tormentine constructed in the 1960s as part of the Trans Canada Highway upgrades. * A realignment between Malden and Cape Jourimain constructed in 1997 as part of the Confederation Bridge project. This saw the eastern terminus of the highway shifted from the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in Cape Tormentine to the present eastern terminus at the bridge abutment in Cape Jourimain. This section was partially completed in the 1960s as part of a proposal at the time to construct a bridge-tunnel-causeway between Cape Jourimain and Borden. However, the project was cancelled in the late 1960s. The road bed and rail track bed from Malden to the water's edge in Cape Jourimain, and overpass at route 955 were constructed and lay abandoned from the late 1960s to the mid 1990s when the road section was subsequently completed for the Confederation Bridge project. The partially-completed rail bed dating from the 1960s still exists and is now used for recreational trails at the Cape Jourimain Nature Centre.

Biography Betje Bekker was born into a wealthy Calvinist family at Vlissingen. On 18 November 1759, at the age of 21, she married the 52-year-old clergyman Adriaan Wolff. In 1763 she published her first collection Bespiegelingen over het genoegen ('Reflections on Pleasure'). After her husband's death in 1777, she lived for a time with Aagje Deken in France. From then on the two women published their work together; it is somewhat difficult to determine the exact qualities contributed by each. They specialized in epistolary novels in the mold of Samuel Richardson. Because of their patriotic sympathies they moved to Tr√©voux in Burgundy in 1788. In 1789 they published Wandelingen door Bourgogne. She was exposed to some of the dangers of the French Revolution, and, it is said, escaped the guillotine only by her great presence of mind.

The 2.8766-day period planet orbits the yellow subgiant star HD 149026 at a distance of 0.042 AU and is notable first as a transiting planet, and second for a small measured radius (relative to mass and incoming heat) that suggests an exceptionally large planetary core. Name Following its discovery in 2005 the planet was designated HD 149026 b. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Smertrios for this planet.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The winning name was submitted by the Club d'Astronomie de Toussaint of France. Smertrios was a Gallic deity of war.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names Discovery The planet was discovered by the N2K Consortium in 2005, which searches stars for closely orbiting giant planets similar to 51 Pegasi b using the highly successful radial velocity method. The spectrum of the star was studied from the Keck and Subaru Telescopes. After the planet was first detected from the Doppler effect it caused in the light of the host star, it was studied for transits at the Fairborn Observatory. A tiny decrease of light (0.003 magnitudes) was detected every time the planet was transiting the star, thus confirming its existence. Although the change of brightness caused by the transiting planet is tiny, it is detectable by amateur astronomers, providing an opportunity for amateurs to make important astronomical contributions. Indeed, one amateur astronomer, Ron Bissinger, actually detected a partial transit a day before the discovery was published. Orbit The planet's orbit is probably circular (within one standard deviation of error). Careful radial velocity measurements have made it possible to detect the Rossiter‚ÄìMcLaughlin effect, the shifting in photospheric spectral lines caused by the planet occulting a part of the rotating stellar surface. This effect allows the measurement of the angle between the planet's orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the star. In the case of HD 149026 b, the alignment was measured to be +11¬∞. This in turn suggests that the formation of the planet was peaceful and probably involved interactions with the protoplanetary disc. A much larger angle would have suggested a violent interplay with other protoplanets. The study in 2012, has refined spin-orbit angle to 12¬∞. Physical characteristics Size comparison of HD 149026 b with Jupiter and Neptune. The planet orbits the star in a so- called \\"torch orbit\\". One revolution around the star takes only a little less than three Earth days to complete. The planet is less massive than Jupiter (0.36 times Jupiter's mass, or 114 times Earth's mass) but more massive than Saturn. The temperature of the planet was initially estimated on the basis of 0.3 Bond albedo to be about 1540 K, above the predicted temperature of HD 209458 b (1400K), which had inaugurated the category of Chthonian \\"hell planet\\".Hell planet gets solar hammering Its day-side brightness temperature was subsequently directly measured as 2,300 ¬± 200 K by comparing the combined emissions of star and planet at 8 Œºm wavelength before and during a transit event. This is around the boiling point of silicon and well above the melting point of iron. This planet's albedo has not been measured directly. The initial estimate of 0.3 had come from averaging Sudarsky's theoretical classes IV and V. The planet's extremely high temperature has forced astronomers to abandon that estimate; now, they predict that the planet must absorb essentially all of the starlight that falls on it ‚Äî that is, effectively zero albedo like HD 209458 b.Spaceflight Now  Breaking News  Exotic extrasolar planet is the hottest yet discovered Much of the absorption takes place at the top of its atmosphere. Between that and the hot, high-pressure gas surrounding the core, a stratosphere of cooler gas was once predicted but has not been observed. The atmosphere is likely high in carbon monoxide and dioxide. The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot clouds are usually thought to be vanadium and titanium oxides (\\"pM planets\\"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out as yet. The planet-star radius ratio is 0.05158 +/- 0.00077. Currently what limits more precision on HD 149026 b's radius \\"is the uncertainty in the stellar radius\\", and measurement of the stellar radius is distorted by pollution on the star's surface. Even allowing for uncertainty the radius of HD 149026 b is only about three quarters that of Jupiter (or 83% that of Saturn). HD 149026 b was the first of its kind:Since then, there is now KOI-196 b, a slightly larger \\"non-inflated hot Jupiter. HD 149026 b's low volume means that the planet is too dense for a Saturn-like gas giant of its mass and temperature. It may have an exceptionally large core composed of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium: the initial theoretical models gave the core a mass of 70 times Earth's mass; further refinements suggest 80-110 Earth masses. As a result, the planet has been described as a \\"super-Neptune\\", in analogy to the core-dominated outer ice giants of our solar system, though whether the core of HD 149026 b is mainly icy or rocky is not currently known. Robert Naeye in Sky & Telescope claimed \\"it contains as much or more heavy elements (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) than all the planets and asteroids in our solar system combined\\".One Big Ball of Rock Robert Naeye, Sky & Telescope, last accessed October 13, 2007 In addition to uncertainties of radius, its tidal heating over its history needs be taken into account; if its current orbit is circular and if that had evolved from a more eccentric one, the extra heat increases its expected radius per its model and thereby its core radius. Naeye further speculated that the gravity could be as high as ten g (ten times gravity on Earth's surface) on the surface of the core. Theoretical consequences The discovery was advocated as a piece of evidence for the popular solar nebula accretion model, where planets are formed from the accretion of smaller objects. In this model, giant planet embryos grow large enough to acquire large envelopes of hydrogen and helium. However, opponents of this model emphasize that only one example of such a dense planet is not proof. In fact, such a huge core is difficult to explain even by the core accretion model. One possibility is that because the planet orbits so close to its star, it is ‚Äî unlike Jupiter ‚Äî ineffective in cleansing the planetary system of rocky bodies. Instead, a heavy rain of heavier elements on the planet may have helped create the large core.

His most notable work focuses on scenes of Native American life, particularly of the Pueblo Indians. Life and career Ufer was born in Germany and moved with his family to Louisville, Kentucky in 1880 where Ufer grew up. After an apprenticeship as a lithographer, he went to Europe where he was a traveling journeyman. Like many of his fellow artists with ties to Indianapolis's German-American community, he went to Germany to study; he trained in Hamburg and Dresden.Eldredge, Charles, et al. (1986). Art in New Mexico 1900-1945: Paths to Taos and Santa Fe. Washington, DC: National Museum of American Art with Abbeville Press. p. 208. When he returned to America, he worked as a printer in Chicago and taught school, and later took classes in fine arts. After a brief time in Chicago, he returned to Munich in 1911 for further study as an artist. Upon his return to the US, he traveled to Taos in 1914. There he became one of the \\"Taos Ten\\", and associated with the Taos Society of Artists. In 1917 Ufer served as president of Chicago's Palette and Chisel, Academy of Fine Arts. In addition to his art, Ufer is known for his social activism. He helped victims of the 1918 flu epidemic being treated in the local schoolhouse and collected money for miners on strike in Madrid, New Mexico. He was also a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and follower of Leon Trotsky. Ufer died from appendicitis. At his request, he was cremated and his ashes were spread in an arroyo (creek) near Mabel Dodge Luhan's house in Taos. Artwork In the 1920s, Ufer's work garnered critical and commercial success. He showed at the Carnegie International, and became an Academician of the National Academy of Design.

ACICS was established in 1912. It accredited 245 institutions of higher education offering undergraduate and graduate diplomas and degrees in both traditional formats and through distance education. ACICS is incorporated in Virginia and operates from offices in Washington, D.C. Concerns about the quality of its accreditation led the U.S. Department of Education to withdraw the accreditor's recognition in 2016. A subsequent lawsuit and review led the next Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, to retain the institution's recognition (although the Council for Higher Education Accreditation withdrew the organization's membership). History ACICS was established upon the request of Benjamin Franklin Williams, President of Capital City Commercial College of Des Moines, Iowa. Upon the meeting of 22 school administrators, who met in Chicago, Illinois, on December 12, 1912, the original alliance formed the basis of National Association of Accredited Commercial Schools (NAACS), which was later renamed ACICS. =Accreditation= The scope of ACICS' recognition by the Department of Education and CHEA is defined as accreditation of private post-secondary educational institutions, both for- profit and non-profit, offering nondegree programs or associate degrees, bachelor's degrees and master's degrees in programs \\"designed to train and educate persons for professional, technical, or occupational careers.\\" As an accreditor for many for-profit colleges, ACICS provided information during U.S. Congressional investigations of for-profit education in 2010. ACICS reported that the institutions it accredits are required to demonstrate a student retention rate of at least 75 percent. Retention rates are calculated within a single academic year. In 2015, ACICS fell under significant scrutiny after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit institution that was accredited by ACICS until its sudden demise. A subcommittee of the United States Senate requested information from ACICS in November 2015. Five months later, twelve state attorneys general requested that the U.S. Department of Education withdraw recognition from ACICS as a federally-recognized accreditor. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau petitioned a federal court to order ACICS to make available information about \\"its decision to approve several controversial for-profit college chains\\", and the president of the organization, Al Gray, resigned. Scrutiny continued in 2016 and intensified after another large chain of for-profit institutions accredited by ACICS, ITT Technical Institute, came under fire by state and federal agencies; the chain closed in 2016 and filed for bankruptcy. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of ACICS, released a report critical of the accreditor in June. Several days later, the U.S. Department of Education formally recommended that the accreditor's recognition be withdrawn. In September 2016, the chief of staff to the U.S. education secretary wrote in a letter to ACICS: \\"I am terminating the department's recognition of ACICS as a national recognized accrediting agency. ... ACICS's track record does not inspire confidence that it can address all of the problems effectively.\\" The company immediately announced that it would appeal the decision within the 30 days allowed for appeal, to Education Secretary John King Jr. ACICS unsuccessfully appealed the decision and subsequently sued the Department of Education. Although Secretary of Education King finalized the process of revoking the U.S. Department of Education's recognition of ACICS as an accreditor in December 2016, ACICS's lawsuit resulted in a judge ordering Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to review the decision in March 2018 as King did not take into account all of the evidence; DeVos subsequently restored the accreditor's recognition by the Department of Education. Although the Department of Education continued to recognize the accreditor, many institutions left the organization while its status was in question. At the same time, many institutions formerly accredited by ACICS closed. This loss in membership, combined with the legal costs associated with the lawsuits and legal proceedings, placed the organization into financial difficulties including a $2.1 million deficit in 2019. Although the Department of Education restored its recognition of ACICS following its lawsuit, CHEA did not and ACICS withdrew its application to CHEA in early 2020. Whether ACICS deserves to be accredited has again been called into question by an investigation by USA Today that found that ACICS had accredited a school, Reagan National University, that appears to be a sham. According to this report, Reagan National University has no campus, faculty, current students, or alumni.

Why not Sneeze, Rose S√©lavy? is a 1921 \\"readymade\\" sculpture by Marcel Duchamp.

Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a cohabitation law of Florida, part of the state's anti-miscegenation laws, was unconstitutional.. The law prohibited habitual cohabitation by two unmarried people of opposite sex, if one was black and the other was white. The decision overturned Pace v. Alabama (1883),. which had declared such statutes constitutional. It did not overturn the related Florida statute that prohibited interracial marriage between whites and blacks. Such laws were declared unconstitutional in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia.. Facts In 1962, Dewey McLaughlin, a Miami Beach hotel porter originally from Honduras, and Connie Hoffman, a Caucasian waitress, were an unmarried couple living together in a Miami Beach apartment located at 732 2nd Street. Their landlady, Dora Goodnick, had rented the apartment only to Hoffman, and, when she found out about McLaughlin, she did not want the interracial unmarried couple living in the apartment. In an effort to get them out, Goodnick complained to the Miami Beach police that Hoffman's son was wandering the streets after midnight. Police investigated the matter, and, after the couple admitted that they were unmarried and lived together, they were charged in Florida state court with the crime of a black man and a white woman habitually living in and occupying in the nighttime the same room. A jury trial resulted in a verdict of guilt, a sentence of thirty days in the county jail, and a fine of $150 for each defendant. Section 798.05 of Florida statutes read: \\"Any negro man and white woman, or any white man and negro woman, who are not married to each other, who shall habitually live in and occupy in the nighttime the same room shall each be punished by imprisonment not exceeding twelve months, or by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars.\\" This law was a part of the adultery and fornication laws of Florida. While all the other sections of this chapter required proof that sexual intercourse took place, Section 798.05 required only cohabitation. The law specifically prohibited a couple in which one is white and the other is black. It did not apply to any other racial groups or combinations. It was part of Florida's anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting marriage, cohabitation, and extramarital sex between whites and blacks, and addressed only relationships between whites and non-whites. Similar anti-miscegenation laws were enforced in many states into the 1960s, and by all Southern states until 1967, when all remaining state bans on interracial marriage between whites and non-whites were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia. Result Justice White in his majority opinion held that the law, as it made a special case for couples of these two specific races, bore a \\"heavier burden of justification\\". Florida had not demonstrated any reason that made such a race- specific prohibition necessary. Justice Harlan, in his concurrence, emphasized the \\"heavier burden\\" requirement that White described and wrote that the law should pass a \\"necessity test\\", which is very stringent and applied to free speech cases. Justices Stewart and Douglas joined in an even stronger concurrence and denied even the possibility of an \\"overriding statutory purpose\\" that would justify such a law. Stewart wrote, \\"We deal here with a criminal law which imposes criminal punishment. And I think it is simply not possible for a state law to be valid under our Constitution which makes the criminality of an act depend upon the race of the actor. Discrimination of that kind is invidious per se.\\" Though the state claimed that Section 798.05 (prohibiting cohabitation) was ancillary to Section 741.11 (prohibiting intermarriage), the Court did not consider the latter statute, and it remained in force until Loving v. Virginia (1967). See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 379 * Pace v. Alabama * Perez v. Sharp * Loving v.

He was influenced by G.E. Moore, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Sigmund Freud, and in turn explained and extended their work. Wisdom was educated at Aldeburgh Lodge School, Suffolk, and Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first-class BA degree in Moral Sciences in 1924. He is not to be confused with the philosopher John Oulton Wisdom (1908‚Äì1993), his cousin, who shared his interest in psychoanalysis. Philosophical work Before the posthumous publication of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations in 1953, Wisdom's writing was one of the few published sources of information about Wittgenstein's later philosophy.See the review \\"Can You Play Chess without the Queen by John Holloway\\", Hudson Review, vol. 6, no. 4 (winter), 1954. His article \\"Philosophical Perplexity\\" has been described as ‚Äòsomething of a landmark in the history of philosophy‚Äô being ‚Äòthe first which throughout embodied the new philosophical outlook‚Äô.Urmson, J. O. (1960). Philosophical Analysis. Oxford. p. 173. According to David Pole \\"in some directions at least Wisdom carries Wittgenstein's work further than he himself did, and faces its consequences more explicitly.\\"Pole, David (1958). The Later Philosophy of Wittgenstein. London: Athlone Press. p. 103. Wisdom was for most of his career at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University. Near the end of his career he was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oregon. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1950 to 1951. His famous \\"Parable of the Invisible Gardener\\" is a dialectic on the existence or absence of God. The first recorded use of the term \\"analytic philosophers\\" occurred in Wisdom's 1931 work, \\"Interpretation and Analysis in Relation to Bentham's Theory of Definition\\", which expounded on Bentham's concept of \\"paraphrasis\\": \\"that sort of exposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, having for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not for its subject any other than a fictitious entity\\". At first Wisdom referred to \\"logic- analytic philosophers\\", then to \\"analytic philosophers\\". According to Michael Beaney, \\"the explicit articulation of the idea of paraphrasis in the work of both Wisdom in Cambridge and Ryle in Oxford represents a definite stage in the construction of analytic philosophy as a tradition\\".

He is best known as having taught the young Albrecht D√ºrer. The importance of Wolgemut as an artist rests not only on his own individual works, but also on the fact that he was the head of a large workshop, in which many different branches of the fine arts were carried on by a great number of pupil-assistants, including Albrecht D√ºrer, who completed an apprenticeship with him between 1486 and 1489. In his atelier large altar-pieces and other sacred paintings were executed, and also elaborate carved painted wood retables, consisting of crowded subjects in high relief, richly decorated with gold and colour. Wolgemut was a leader among the artists reviving the standards of German woodcut at this time. The production of woodcuts was a large part of the work of the workshop, the blocks being cut from Wolgemut's designs. They were mostly made to supply the many publishers in Nuremberg with book illustrations, with the most attractive also being sold separately. Wolgemut's woodcuts followed the advances in engraving, depicting volume and shading to a much greater extent than before. Many are remarkable for their vigour and clever adaptation to the special necessities of the technique of woodcut. Nonetheless, they were very often hand-coloured before or after sale. His pupil D√ºrer was to build on and to so surpass his achievement that it is often overlooked. Wolgemut's paintings show Flemish influence, and he may have traveled within Flanders (modern Belgium and surrounding areas). Biography Portrait of Ursula Tucher, 1478 Wolgemut trained with his father Valentin Wolgemut (who died in 1469 or 1470) and is thought to have been an assistant to Hans Pleydenwurff in Nuremberg. He worked with Gabriel Malesskircher in Munich early in 1471, leaving the city after unsuccessfully suing Malesskircher's daughter for breach of contract, claiming she had broken off their engagement. He then returned to his late father's workshop in Nuremberg, which his mother had maintained since Valentin's death. In 1472 he married Pleydenwurff's widow and took over his workshop; her son Wilhelm Pleydenwurff worked as an assistant, and from 1491 a partner, to Wolgemut. Some consider Wilhelm a finer artist than Wolgemut, however he died in January 1494, when he was probably still in his thirties. Wilhelm's oeuvre remains unclear, though works in various media have been attributed to him. Woodcuts Danse Macabre, 1493 Two large and copiously illustrated books have woodcuts supplied by Wolgemut and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff; both were printed and published by Germany's largest publisher, the Nuremberger Anton Koberger, who was also D√ºrer's godfather. The first is the Schatzbehalter der wahren Reichthumer des Heils (1491); the other is the Historia mundi, by Schedel (1493), usually known as the Nuremberg Chronicle, which is highly valued, not for the text, but for its remarkable collection of 1,809 spirited illustrations. Wolgemut and Wilhelm Pleydenwurff were first commissioned to provide the illustrations in 1487 and 1488, and a further contract of 29 December 1491 commissioned manuscript layouts of the text and illustrations. A further contact of 1492 stipulated that Koberger should provide a locked room for the blocks to be kept safely. A drawing by Wolgemut for the elaborate frontispiece, dated 1490, is in the British Museum. As with other books of the period, many of the woodcuts, showing towns, battles or kings were used more than once in the book, with the text labels merely changed. The book is large, with a double-page woodcut measuring about 342x500mm. Paintings The earliest known work by Wolgemut is a retable consisting of four panels, dated 1465, now in the Munich gallery, a decorative work of much beauty. In 1479 he painted the retable of the high altar in the church of St Mary at Zwickau, which still exists, receiving for it the large sum of 1400 gulden. One of his finest and largest works is the great retable painted for the church of the Augustinian friars at Nuremberg, now moved into the museum; it consists of a great many panels, with figures of locally venerated saints. In 1501 Wolgemut was employed to decorate the town hall at Goslar with a large series of paintings; some on the ceiling are on panel, and others on the walls are painted thinly in tempera on canvas. As a portrait-painter he enjoyed much repute, and some of his works of this class are very admirable for their realistic vigour and minute finish. Outside Germany Wolgemut's paintings are scarce: the Royal Institution at Liverpool possesses two good examples--Pilate washing his Hands, and The Deposition from the Cross, parts probably of a large altar-piece. During the last ten years of his life Wohlgemut appears to have produced little by his own hand. One of his latest paintings is the retable at Schwabach, executed in 1508, the contract for which still exists. He died at Nuremberg in 1519.

Colegio Cesar Chavez evolved from various other collegial institutions that had existed in Mount Angel, Oregon for nearly a century. In 1888, the Catholic Order of the Benedictine Sisters founded Mt. Angel Academy. The Academy was originally a female charter academy but later evolved into a normal school in 1897 to train women for careers in education. In 1947, Mt. Angel Normal School was renamed Mt. Angel Women's College and, with accreditation from the Northwest Accrediting Association, it granted a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education. In 1957, Mt. Angel Women's College became coeducational and was renamed Mt. Angel College. By 1966 Mt. Angel College was facing financial problems for which it received two federal loans which it used to expand the campus. Within the next seven years, Mt. Angel College found itself burdened by a one million dollar debt and low student enrollment. In 1977, Ernesto Lopez became Dean of Students of Mt. Angel College and Sonny Montes became Director of Ethnic Affairs and minority recruiter. By 1972, Mt. Angel College had a student body of only 250, only 37 of whom were of Mexican American descent. Road sign to Colegio Cesar Chavez. Citing the Mt. Angel College's financial instability and low enrollment, the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges withdrew the college's accreditation. In light of such bleak signs, most students and staff left the college. Sonny Montes, Ernesto Lopez, and four others decided to attempt to salvage the college by redirecting its focus. On December 12, 1973, Mt. Angel College was renamed Colegio Cesar Chavez. In 1975, Colegio was granted accreditation candidacy from the same association that had withdrawn Mt. Angel College's accreditation. Colegio aimed to create a four-year college completely under the control of a staff chiefly of Mexican American, or Chicano, descent. Colegio was also structured on an experimental educational model known as a \\"college without walls\\" program. Previous to settling on the name \\"Colegio Cesar Chavez\\", staff had considered three other names for the college: \\"Colegio Che Guevara\\", \\"Colegio Ho Chi Minh\\", and \\"Colegio Virgen de Guadalupe\\". C√©sar Ch√°vez's name was chosen because he was one of the key figures in the Chicano movement, often organizing boycotts and protests for farm workers in California and eventually throughout the entire Pacific Northwest. The majority of Mexican Americans in the Pacific Northwest had migrated to the region during the World War II era in search of work as farm laborers. > The students were able to get Cesar Chavez's help in renegotiating the debt > with HUD.

Page 273. College without walls program Jose Romero, co-founder of Colegio Cesar Chavez. Colegio Cesar Chavez operated under the \\"El Colegio Sin Paredes\\" (\\"The College Without Walls\\") model. This model granted students the ability to actively engage with their community, to maintain control of their own education, and to combine their classroom studies with experience outside of the classroom. The College Without Walls Program had been established by the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities. This format allowed for the inclusion of a wide range of age groups, encouraged the participation and collaboration of students, staff, and administrators in creating and implementing the curriculum. Alternative means of evaluation was also encouraged. In this program, instructors were redefined as facilitators in the learning process. Additionally, Colegio staff, administration, and students relations were structured in accordance to a framework that Colegio termed \\"La Familia,\\" meaning \\"The Family\\". To that end, the \\"family\\" members were encouraged to participate in the decisions affecting the college. Such a framework inevitably required for students to be self-motivated and to initiate and pursue an independent course of education. Colegio students pose in front of a mural they painted in the main campus building. Colegio's core educational foundation consisted of work in four areas: Social Science (Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology); the Humanities (Literature, History, Arts, Philosophy, Language); Natural Sciences and Mathematics; oral and written bilingual Communications. Each student was required to complete fifteen credit hours in each area, totaling 60 credit hours. Credit transfers from parallel areas was allowed. Students could also receive credit for prior learning. Leadership Irma Gonzalez, last Colegio president, in her office in 1981. From its inception, the leadership of Colegio Cesar Chavez was in a constant state of flux. In its brief ten years, Colegio was served by four administrations. Each administration faced substantial institutional crises. In 1973, Ernesto Lopez, former Academic Dean and Acting President of Mt. Angel College, became Colegio's first President. Lopez retained this position for only one year. After the departure of Lopez, the position of administrative head was altered into a co-directorship. Sonny Montes was named Director of Administration. Jose Romero was named Director of Academics. The split into two co-directors was made in an attempt to relieve the overwhelming duties that Lopez had faced. Sonny Montes did not possess an advanced degree, as had Lopez, and he had far less experience working in higher education than had Lopez. Montez' organizing abilities and many contacts within the Chicano Movement were compensations. It was during the joint Montes-Romero administration that Colegio Cesar Chavez received accreditation candidacy on June 18, 1975, from the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Sonny Montes retired as Colegio administrator in October 1977, citing personal and economic concerns. He was extended an invitation to serve on Colegio's board, which he accepted. Colegio graduating class, 1977. Salvador Ramirez followed Sonny Montes, becoming Colegio's top administrator in 1977. Ramirez, who held a master's degree in history, had served Colegio as history teacher since mid-1976. His previous work experience included employment with University of Colorado at Boulder and Washington State University. During Ramirez' tenure, Colegio finalized its negotiations with HUD. Ramirez resigned from his position at Colegio in 1979. Irma Flores Gonzales , previously a member of both Colegio's board and staff, became president of Colegio in 1979. Gonzales held a B.A. in education and a M.A. in psychology. It was during Gonzales' time as president that Colegio faced its greatest challenges: difficulty in developing and maintaining a financial base; preparing Colegio for accreditation by June 1981; and expanding college enrollment. During Gonzales' time as president, Colegio staff succumbed to infighting. By this point, many activists within the Chicano Movement had become disillusioned with Colegio. Gonzales was Colegio's last president. Facilities College Without Walls mural by Daniel Desiga. > One of the larger paintings at the colegio depicts a seemingly endless > abundantly fertile field.

The Oregonian > (\\"Northwest\\" magazine insert). October 25, 1987. Colegio Cesar Chavez's main campus building was the two-story administrative building called Huelga Hall. (\\"Huelga\\" [pronounced welga] is Spanish for \\"strike\\".) When it was a part of Mount Angel College, Huelga Hall was known as Marmion Hall and was used as the campus dormitory for women. Huelga Hall was the hub of campus activity and was where most classes were held. The walls of Huelga Hall were covered with large Mexican-themed murals, some in the style of Diego Rivera, others being transcriptions of ancient Aztec artwork. In the main reception room there was a mural of Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara near the fireplace. To the north of Huelga Hall stood two buildings that served as dormitories for Colegio students. Colegio also owned two homes. Directly behind Huelga Hall was the Art Building. The Art Building was a two- story farm house in the Victorian style. It had been built in the mid-1900s by the Bernt family of Mt. Angel. When Mount Angel College took possession of the Bernt house, it was renamed Studio San Benito. Under Colegio's ownership, the house was referred to as the Art Building. The Art Building lay vacant and unused for most of Colegio's existence until when in 1980 it was occupied by the family of Arthur Omar Olivo. Mr. Olivo was the grounds keeper and facilities maintenance manager of Colegio C√©sar Ch√°vez. After a falling out with Colegio president Irma Gonzales, the Olivo family vacated the Art Building in 1982 shortly before Colegio's closure.OSU Libraries University Archives, 2006 Accessions Accessed October 9, 2006 Beside the Art House stood another two-story house that was referred to as the Pottery Building. Both the Pottery Building and the Art Building were demolished in the mid-1980s. On the other side of Main Street, across from Huelga Hall, Colegio maintained Guadalupe Hall, a building named in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Legacy Multicultural Archives at Oregon State University aims to preserve the histories of Oregon's African American, Asian American, Latino/a, and Native American communities. It maintains and displays the Colegio Cesar Chavez Collection. After the closure of Colegio Cesar Chavez, the facilities and grounds were left unused and abandoned for several years. Eventually, a private benefactor purchased the former Colegio grounds and facilities and donated it back to its pre-Colegio owners, the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel. Today, the former Colegio grounds and facilities are used as St. Joseph Shelter. Shortly after reclaiming ownership of the former Colegio building, the Benedictine Sisters had all but one Colegio-era mural painted over. The one remaining mural is titled \\"College Without Walls\\" and was created by Daniel Desiga. The mural depicts an arch entry overlooking a vast strawberry field. The arch has been interpreted as representing the college without walls program of Colegio, and the vast strawberry field in the background is likely a reference to the field workers and the fact that many Colegio teachers and students had either worked in the fields or were from families who had survived by means of field work. In his book Colegio Cesar Chavez, 1973‚Äì1983: A Chicano Struggle for Educational Self-Determination, to date the only full- length book about Colegio, author Carlos Maldonado writes that Colegio was often referred to as \\"the longest running death in history\\", and that study of Colegio Cesar Chavez will \\"help promoters of new ethnic institutions to raise questions of feasibility, anticipate problems, and provide direction in the establishment of new and more sophisticated institutions.\\" Colegio Cesar Chavez: A Chicano Struggle for Educational Self-Determination () Maldonado claims that Colegio's staff was small and relatively inexperienced and therefore unprepared for the challenges of starting a new college. Eventually the staff succumbed to infighting. Maldonado also claims that it was difficult to foster an on-campus sense of community among staff and students because Colegio was a college-without-walls program. The author notes that Colegio was founded during a time of downturn in activism in the Chicano Movement. Colegio was founded during a period of growing political conservatism marked by less federal support for cultural programs. Colegio was founded in a small rural town whose population largely disliked Colegio's predecessor of Mount Angel College and therefore saw Colegio as an extension of Mount Angel College. The surrounding community was relatively prejudiced against Mexican Americans. Lastly, Colegio was named in honor of a man many local farm owners found controversial. OSU Multicultural Archives displays an advertisement for Colegio Cesar Chavez, as well as a student handbook. On its website the Oregon Historical Society writes, \\"Structured as a 'college-without-walls,' more than 100 students took classes in Chicano Studies, early childhood development, and adult education. Significant financial and administrative problems caused Colegio to close in 1983. Its history represents the success of a grassroots movement.\\" Oregon Historical Society Retrieved March 10, 2007 Cesar Chavez's United Farmworkers union is not present in the state of Oregon.

The collection consists of documents and photographs pertaining to the life and work of Arthur Omar Olivo. Mr. Olivo had been born in a migrant camp in Texas to parents from Mexico. Later, the family would move to San Jose, California where Mr. Olivo would work for an organization called Center for Employment Training, a job training program whose students are mostly Latino and which was funded in part by the Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers union. It was during this period, in the 1960s and 1970s, that Mr. Olivo came to be friends with Cesar Chavez. In the late 1970s, Mr. Olivo moved his family to the state of Oregon in order to found an Oregon branch of Center for Employment Training. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Olivo was involved with Colegio Cesar Chavez as both a student and as facilities manager, and he and his family also lived on the college grounds in Mount Angel, Oregon.

Family Greene was born in Yokohama, Japan to missionary parents Mary Jane Forbes and the Rev. Daniel Crosby Greene. He was also the brother of diplomat Roger Sherman Greene II, the nephew of famed historian Evarts Boutell Greene, and his grandmother was the sister of former US Senator, US Secretary of State, and US Attorney General William William Maxwell Evarts. The great-nephew of US Senator George Frisbie Hoar, US Senator and Connecticut Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin, US Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, as well as the nephew of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Washington Territory, Justice Roger Sherman Greene. Early years Greene graduated from Harvard College by 1897 and became secretary to Harvard University's president and the Harvard Corporation from 1901-1910. This gave him contacts with Wall Street which made him general manager of the Rockefeller Institute from 1910-1912. Later, Greene became an assistant to John D. Rockefeller in philanthropic work for two years, then trustee to the Rockefeller Institute, to the Rockefeller Foundation, and finally to the Rockefeller General Education Board until 1939. For fifteen years (1917-1932) he worked for the Boston investment banking firm of Lee, Higginson & Co; most of those years serving as its chief executive officer, as well as with its London branch. He was executive secretary of the American section of the Allied Maritime Transport Council stationed in London, England 1918. He lived in Toynbee Hall, the world's first settlement house. This brought him in contact with the Round Table Group in England, a contact which was strengthened in 1919 when he became secretary to the Reparations Commission at the Paris Peace Conference. Accordingly, on his return to the United States he was one of the early figures in the establishment of the Council on Foreign Relations which served as the New York branch of the Lionel Curtis Institute of International Affairs. As an investment banker, Greene is mainly remembered for his sales of millions of dollars of the fraudulent securities of the Swedish match king, Ivar Kreuger. That Greene offered these to the American investing public in good faith is evident from the fact that he put a substantial part of his own fortune in the same investments. As a consequence, Kreuger's suicide in Paris in April 1932 left Greene with little money and no job. He wrote to Lionel Curtis asking for help and was given, for two years, a professorship in international relations at Aberystwyth, Wales. The Round Table Group controlled the professorship from its founding by David Davies 1919, though Davies had broken with the Round Table because of its subversion of the League of Nations and European collective security. On his return to America in 1934, Greene also returned to his secretaryship of the Harvard Corporation and became, for the remainder of his life, a trustee and officer of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Gardner Museum in Fenway Court, the New England Conservatory of Music, the American Academy in Rome, the Brookings Institution, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the General Education Board (only until 1939). He was also the director of the Harvard University's year-long 1936 wikt:Tercentenary Celebration. Greene is of much greater significance in indicating the real influences within the Institute of Pacific Relations than any Communists or fellow travelers. He wrote the constitution for the IPR in 1916. For years he was the chief conduit for Wall Street funds and influence into the organization. Additionally, Greene was treasurer of the American Council for three years and chairman for three more, as well as chairman of the International Council for four years. Round table He became involved with the Round Table Groups, which were semi-secret discussion and lobbying groups organized by Lionel Curtis, Philip Henry Kerr (Lord Lothian), and (Sir) William S. Marris in 1908-1911. This was done on behalf of Lord Milner, the dominant Trustee of the Rhodes Trust in the two decades 1905-1925. The original purpose of these groups was to seek to federate the English-speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902) and William T. Stead (1849-1912), and the money for the organizational work came originally from the Rhodes Trust. By 1915 Round Table groups existed in seven countries, including England, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and a rather loosely organized group in the United States (George Louis Beer, Walter Lippmann, Frank Aydelotte, Whitney Shepardson, Thomas W. Lamont, Erwin D. Canham of the Christian Science Monitor, and others). The attitudes of the various groups were coordinated by frequent visits and discussions and by a well-informed and totally anonymous quarterly magazine, The Round Table Journal, whose first issue, largely written by Philip Kerr, appeared in November 1910. The leaders of this group were: Milner, until his death in 1925, followed by Curtis (1872-1955), Robert H, (Lord) Brand (brother -in-law of Lady Astor) until his death in 1963, and now Adam D. Marris, son of Sir William and Brand's successor as managing director of Lazard Fr√®res bank. The original intention had been to have collegial leadership, but Milner was too secretive and headstrong to share the role. He did so only in the period 1913-1919 when he held regular meetings with some of his closest friends to coordinate their activities as a pressure group in the struggle with Wilhelmine Germany. This they called their \\"Ginger Group.\\" After Milner's death in 1925, the leadership was largely shared by the survivors of Milner's \\"Kindergarten,\\" that is, the group of young Oxford men whom he used as civil servants in his reconstruction of South Africa in 1901-1910. Brand was the last survivor of the \\"Kindergarten\\"; since his death, the greatly reduced activities of the organization have been exercised largely through the Editorial Committee of The Round Table magazine under Adam Marris. Money for the widely ramified activities of this organization came originally from the associates and followers of Cecil Rhodes, chiefly from the Rhodes Trust itself, and from wealthy associates such as the Beit brothers, from Sir Abe Bailey, and (after 1915) from the Astor family. Since 1925 there have been substantial contributions from wealthy individuals and from foundations and firms associated with the international banking fraternity, especially the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and other organizations associated with J. P. Morgan, the Rockefeller and Whitney families, and the associates of Lazard Fr√®res and of Morgan, Grenfell & Company. Summary of positions Jerome Davis Greene was a partner in Lee, Higginson & Co., Secretary to the Corporation, Harvard University, 1905-1910 & 1934-1943; Joint Secretary of the Reparations Committee at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919; Secretary and Trustee, the Rockefeller Foundation, 1913-17 & 1928-1939; Chairman, Council Institute of Pacific Relations, (1929‚Äì32); a Trustee, the Brookings Institution of Washington D.C., 1928-1945.

The film follows Mansoor and Sarmad (played by Shaan and Khan), two singers whose lives change after the events of 9/11 attacks in America and misinterpreted teachings of Jihad. Khuda Kay Liye was released on 20 July 2007 in Pakistan and on 4 April 2008 in India, as well as the screenings at various international film festivals. The film subsequently won a number of awards for its acting, notably three Lux Style Awards, one Silver Pyramid Award at Cairo International Film Festival, one Roberto Rossellini Award, Italy and one Fukuoka Audience Award at Fukuoka International Film Festival, Japan. The release of the film was historic for two reasons: it was the first Pakistani film to be released in India in almost half a century, and secondly it was the first ever Pakistani film to be included in the official selection of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI). Plot Brothers Mansoor and Sarmad are two successful singers from Lahore. Sarmad eventually is influenced by an Islamic activist Maulana Tahiri, as he begins to practice a more conservative Islamic way of living and gives up his music career as it is considered \\"haram\\" by the Islamic activist. Maryam (Mary), a westernised British Pakistani girl, falls in love with Dave from the British community. However this displeases her father, who is hypocritical, despite himself being in a live-in relationship with a British woman. Meanwhile, Mary's father plans to take her for a trip to Pakistan to meet Sarmad and Mansoor. During the visit, she is deceived by her father and taken across the border to Afghanistan under the guise of attending a relative's wedding. In Afghanistan, she is forcefully married off to her cousin Sarmad and abandoned in their household. In an escape attempt, Mary tries to run from the village but gets caught by Sarmad. He eventually consummates their marriage by force as a sort of punishment so that Mary would not escape again. Mansoor goes to a musical school in Chicago, where he meets fellow music student Janie. They fall in love with each other and Janie stops drinking alcohol for him. They eventually marry. However, shortly after the events of 9/11, Mansoor gets arrested by the FBI due to his Islamic background and is detained and tortured for a year in Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Mary is rescued by Sarmad's father under the protection of the British government. A devastated Mary takes her father and cousin to court in Pakistan for justice. Wali (Naseeruddin Shah), a Maulana, then explains to the court how Islam is being misused in the name of war and hatred, bringing the religion forward in a believable and peaceful manner. Traumatised by all the suffering he has seen and caused, Sarmad withdraws the case. He also realizes the damage that he was made to inflict in the name of religion. Mary is now free and returns to the village where she was kept prisoner so she can educate the girls there. Meanwhile, Mansoor is still in FBI custody after a year of torment; the last torture session having inflicted permanent brain damage. After a failed rehab attempt, he is deported and reunited with his family in Pakistan where he begins to recover.

On his second visit he found the stones gone, and on his fourth visit, in 1903, he searched for the stones in the surrounding area, collected nine he was fairly sure were the originals, and placed them in a new location but in the original plan. His drawing of the time shows a feature of circa 4 m in diameter.

Eilean a' Chleirich is owned and managed as a nature reserve by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It is a SSSI and a Special Protection Area. Non-avian fauna includes pygmy shrews, otters and grey seals. Priest Island supports heath communities and a small amount of woodland. Enrichment from salt spray and bird guano enables more species-rich maritime heath and cliff communities to exist around the coast. The island has one of the largest storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) colonies in the UK, together with other breeding seabirds. In the summer of 1960, a group from an English school studied some of the bird life of the island. Pupils and teachers from Whitgift School in South Croydon spent 2 weeks on the island with official permission to study and ring some of the birds, such as storm petrels at night time (netting and ringing) and shags on the cliffs in daytime. They took a month's supplies with them, including food, tents and equipment totalling quarter of a ton on a trek cart pulled over from Garve Station.

The term was coined by Edward Angle, the \\"father of modern orthodontics\\", as a derivative of occlusion. This refers to the manner in which opposing teeth meet (mal- + occlusion = \\"incorrect occlusion\\"). The malocclusion classification is based on the relationship of the Mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar and the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar. If this molar relationship exists, then the teeth can align into normal occlusion. According to Angle, malocclusion is any deviation of the occlusion from the ideal. However the assessment for malocclusion should also take into account aesthetics and the impact on functionality. If these are aspects are acceptable to the patient despite meeting the formal definition of malocclusion, then treatment may not be necessary.  Causes  The aetiology of malocclusion is somewhat contentious, however, simply put it is multifactorial, with influences being both genetic and environmental. Physical anthropologist Janet Monge suggests malocclusion is a relatively recent phenomenon, and never appears in ancient skeletal remains. There are 3 generally accepted causative factors of malocclusion: * Skeletal factors ‚Äì the size, shape and relative positions of the upper and lower jaws. Variations can be caused by environmental or behavioral factors such as masticatory muscles, nocturnal mouth breathing, and cleft lip and palate * Muscle factors ‚Äì the form and function of the muscles that surround the teeth. This could be impacted by habits such as digit sucking, nail biting, pacifier and tongue thrusting * Dental factors ‚Äì size of the teeth in relation to the jaw, early loss of teeth could result in spacing or mesial migration causing crowding, abnormal eruption path or timings, extra teeth (supernumeraries), too few teeth (hypodontia) There is not one cause of malocclusion, and when planning orthodontic treatment it is often helpful to consider the above factors and the impact they have played on malocclusion. These can also be influenced by oral habits and pressure resulting in malocclusion. = Behavioral and dental factors = In the active skeletal growth, mouthbreathing, finger sucking, thumb sucking, pacifier sucking, onychophagia (nail biting), dermatophagia, pen biting, pencil biting, abnormal posture, deglutition disorders and other habits greatly influence the development of the face and dental arches. Pacifier sucking habits are also correlated with otitis media. Dental caries, periapical inflammation and tooth loss in the deciduous teeth can alter the correct permanent teeth eruptions. = Primary vs. secondary dentition = Malocclusion can occur in primary and secondary dentition. In primary dentition malocclusion is caused by: *Underdevelopment of the dentoalvelor tissue. *Over development of bones around the mouth. *Cleft lip and palate. *Overcrowding of teeth. *Abnormal development and growth of teeth. In secondary dentition malocclusion is caused by: *Periodontal disease. *Overeruption of teeth. *Premature and congenital loss of missing teeth. Signs and symptoms Malocclusion is a common finding, although it is not usually serious enough to require treatment. Those who have more severe malocclusions, which present as a part of craniofacial anomalies, may require orthodontic and sometimes surgical treatment (orthognathic surgery) to correct the problem. The ultimate goal of orthodontic treatment is to achieve a stable, functional and aesthetic alignment of teeth which serves to better the patients dental and total health. The symptoms which arise as a result of malocclusion derive from a deficiency in one or more of these categories. The symptoms are as follows: * Tooth decay (caries): misaligned teeth will make it more difficult to maintain oral hygiene. Children with poor oral hygiene and diet will be at an increased risk. * Periodontal disease: irregular teeth would hinder the ability to clean teeth meaning poor plaque control. Additionally, if teeth are crowded, some may be more buccally or lingually placed, there will be reduced bone and periodontal support. Furthermore, in Class III malocclusions, mandibular anterior teeth are pushed labially which contributes to gingival recession and weakens periodontal support. * Trauma to anterior teeth: Those with an increased overjet are at an increased risk of trauma. A systematic review found that an overjet of greater than 3mm will double the risk of trauma. * Masticatory function: people with anterior open bites, large increased & reverse overjet and hypodontia will find it more difficult to chew food. * Speech impairment: a lisp is when the incisors cannot make contact, orthodontics can treat this. However, other forms of misaligned teeth will have little impact on speech and orthodontic treatment has little effect on fixing any problems. * Tooth impaction: these can cause resorption of adjacent teeth and other pathologies for example a dentigerous cyst formation. * Psychosocial wellbeing: malocclusions of teeth with perceived poor aesthetics can have a significant effect on self-esteem. This is subjective in nature and will vary widely, being subject cultural and racial influences. Malocclusions may be coupled with skeletal disharmony of the face, where the relations between the upper and lower jaws are not appropriate. Such skeletal disharmonies often distort sufferer's face shape, severely affect aesthetics of the face, and may be coupled with mastication or speech problems. Most skeletal malocclusions can only be treated by orthognathic surgery. Classification Depending on the sagittal relations of teeth and jaws, malocclusions can be divided mainly into three types according to Angle's classification system published 1899. However, there are also other conditions, e.g. crowding of teeth, not directly fitting into this classification. Many authors have tried to modify or replace Angle's classification. This has resulted in many subtypes and new systems (see section below: Review of Angle's system of classes). A deep bite (also known as a Type II Malocclusion) is a condition in which the upper teeth overlap the lower teeth, which can result in hard and soft tissue trauma, in addition to an effect on appearance. It has been found to occur in 15-20% of the US population. An open bite is a condition characterised by a complete lack of overlap and occlusion between the upper and lower incisors. In children, open bite can be caused by prolonged thumb sucking. Patients often present with impaired speech and mastication. = Overbites = This is a vertical measurement of the degree of overlap between the maxillary incisors and the mandibular incisors. There are three features that are analysed in the classification of an overbite: * Degree of overlap: edge to edge, reduced, average, increased * Complete or incomplete: whether there is contact between the lower teeth the opposing teeth/tissue (hard palate or gingivae) or not. * Whether contact is traumatic or atraumatic An average overbite is when the upper anterior teeth cover a third of the lower teeth. Covering less than this is described as ‚Äòreduced‚Äô and more than this is an ‚Äòincreased‚Äô overbite. No overlap or contact is considered an ‚Äòanterior open bite‚Äô. =Angle's classification method= labially erupted canines Class II molar relationship Edward Angle, who is considered the father of modern orthodontics, was the first to classify malocclusion. He based his classifications on the relative position of the maxillary first molar. According to Angle, the mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar should align with the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar. The teeth should all fit on a line of occlusion which, in the upper arch, is a smooth curve through the central fossae of the posterior teeth and cingulum of the canines and incisors, and in the lower arch, is a smooth curve through the buccal cusps of the posterior teeth and incisal edges of the anterior teeth. Any variations from this resulted in malocclusion types. It is also possible to have different classes of malocclusion on left and right sides. *Class I: Neutrocclusion Here the molar relationship of the occlusion is normal but the incorrect line of occlusion or as described for the maxillary first molar, but the other teeth have problems like spacing, crowding, over or under eruption, etc. *Class II: Distocclusion (retrognathism, overjet, overbite) In this situation, the mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar is not aligned with the mesiobuccal groove of the lower first molar. Instead it is anterior to it. Usually the mesiobuccal cusp rests in between the first mandibular molars and second premolars. There are two subtypes: **Class II Division 1: The molar relationships are like that of Class II and the anterior teeth are protruded. **Class II Division 2: The molar relationships are Class II but the central are retroclined and the lateral teeth are seen overlapping the centrals. *Class III: Mesiocclusion (prognathism, Anterior crossbite, negative overjet, underbite) In this case the upper molars are placed not in the mesiobuccal groove but posteriorly to it. The mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar lies posteriorly to the mesiobuccal groove of the mandibular first molar. Usually seen as when the lower front teeth are more prominent than the upper front teeth. In this case the patient very often has a large mandible or a short maxillary bone. = Review of Angle's system of classes and alternative systems = A major disadvantage of classifying malocclusions according to Angle's system is that it only takes into consideration the two- dimensional viewing along a spatial axis in the sagittal plane in the terminal occlusion, even though occlusion problems are, in principle, three- dimensional. Deviations in other spatial axes, asymmetric deviations, functional faults and other therapy-related features are not recognised. Another shortcoming is the lack of a theoretical basis of this purely descriptive classification system. Among the much discussed weaknesses of the system is the fact that it only considers the static occlusion, that it does not take into account the development and causes (aetiology) of occlusion problems and it disregards the proportions (or relationships in general) of teeth and face.Sunil Kumar (Ed.): Orthodontics. New Delhi 2008, 624 p., , p. 127 Thus, numerous attempts have been made to modify the Angle system or to replace it completely with a more efficient one,Sunil Kumar (Ed.): Orthodontics. New Delhi 2008, p. 123. A list of 18 approaches to modify or replace Angle's system is given here with further references at the end of the book. but Angle's classification continues to prevail mainly because of its simplicity and clarity. Well-known modifications to Angle's classification date back to Martin Dewey (1915) and Benno Lischer (1912, 1933). Alternative systems have been suggested by, among others, Simon (1930, the first three- dimensional classification system), Jacob A. Salzmann (1950, with a classification system based on skeletal structures) and James L. Ackerman and William R. Proffit (1969).Gurkeerat Singh: Textbook of Orthodontics, p. 163-170, with further references on p. 174. =Incisor classification= Besides the molar relationship, the British Standards Institute Classification also classifies malocclusion into incisor relationship and canine relationship. Class I: The lower incisor edges occlude with or lie immediately below the cingulum plateau of the upper central incisors Class II: The lower incisor edges lie posterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors Division 1 ‚Äì the upper central incisors are proclined or of average inclination and there is an increase in overjet Division 2 ‚Äì The upper central incisors are retroclined. The overjet is usually minimal or may be increased. Class III: The lower incisor edges lie anterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors. The overjet is reduced or reversed. =Canine relationship= Class I: Mesial slope of upper canine coincides with distal slope of lower canine Class II: Mesial slope of upper canine is ahead of distal slope of lower canine Class III: Mesial slope of upper canine is behind to distal slope of lower canine Crowding of teeth Crowding is defined by the amount of space that would be required for the teeth to be in correct alignment. It is obtained in two ways. 1) by measuring the amount of space required and reducing this from calculating the space available via the width of the teeth. Or 2) by measuring the degree of overlap of the teeth. The following criteria is used: 0-4mm = Mild crowding 4-8mm = Moderate crowding >8mm = Severe crowding = Causes = Extra teeth, lost teeth, impacted teeth, or abnormally shaped teeth have been cited as causes of crowding. Ill-fitting dental fillings, crowns, appliances, retainers, or braces as well as misalignment of jaw fractures after a severe injury are also known to cause crowding. Tumors of the mouth and jaw, thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond age three, and prolonged use of a bottle have also been identified. Lack of masticatory stress during development can cause tooth overcrowding. Children who chewed a hard resinous gum for two hours a day, showed increased facial growth. Experiments in animals have shown similar results. In an experiment on two groups of rock hyraxes fed hardened or softened versions of the same foods, the animals fed softer food had significantly narrower and shorter faces and thinner and shorter mandibles than animals fed hard food. A 2016 review found that breastfeeding lowers the incidence of malocclusions developing later on in developing infants. Victora CG, Bahl R, Barros AJ, Fran√ßa GV, Horton S, Krasevec J, Murch S, Sankar MJ, Walker N, Rollins NC (January 2016). \\"Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect\\". Lancet. 387 (10017): 475‚Äì90. doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(15)01024-7. . During the transition to agriculture, the shape of the human mandible went through a series of changes. The mandible underwent a complex shape changes not matched by the teeth, leading to incongruity between the dental and mandibular form. These changes in human skulls may have been \\"driven by the decreasing bite forces required to chew the processed foods eaten once humans switched to growing different types of cereals, milking and herding animals about 10,000 years ago.\\" Treatment Malocclusion is often treated with orthodontics, such as tooth extraction, clear aligners, or dental braces, followed by growth modification in children or jaw surgery (orthognathic surgery) in adults. Surgical intervention is used only in rare occasions. This may include surgical reshaping to lengthen or shorten the jaw. Wires, plates, or screws may be used to secure the jaw bone, in a manner like the surgical stabilization of jaw fractures. Very few people have \\"perfect\\" alignment of their teeth with most problems being minor that do not require treatment. = Crowding = Crowding of the teeth is treated with orthodontics, often with tooth extraction, clear aligners, or dental braces, followed by growth modification in children or jaw surgery (orthognathic surgery) in adults. Surgery may be required on rare occasions. This may include surgical reshaping to lengthen or shorten the jaw (orthognathic surgery). Wires, plates, or screws may be used to secure the jaw bone, in a manner similar to the surgical stabilization of jaw fractures. Very few people have \\"perfect\\" alignment of their teeth. However, most problems are very minor and do not require treatment. = Class I = While treatment is not crucial in class I malocclusions, in severe cases of crowding can be an indication for intervention. Studies indicate that tooth extraction can have benefits to correcting malocclusion in individuals. Further research is needed as reoccurring crowding has been examined in other clinical trials. = Class II = A few treatment options for class II malocclusions include: # Functional appliance which maintains the mandible in a postured position to influence both the orofacial musculature and dentoalveolar development prior to fixed appliance therapy. This is ideally done through pubertal growth in pre- adolescent children and the fixed appliance during permanent dentition . Different types of removable appliances include Activator, Bionatar, Medium opening activator, Herbst, Frankel and twin block appliance with the twin block being the most widely used one. # Growth modification through headgear to redirect maxillary growth # Orthodontic camouflage so that jaw discrepancy no longer apparent # Orthonagthic surgery ‚Äì sagittal split osteotomy mandibular advancement carried out when growth is complete where skeletal discrepancy is severe in anterior-posterior relationship or in vertical direction. Fixed appliance is required before, during and after surgery. # Upper Removable Appliance ‚Äì limited role in contemporary treatment of increased overjets. Mostly used for very mild Class II, overjet due to incisor proclination, favourable overbite.  Class II Division 1  Low- to moderate- quality evidence suggests that providing early orthodontic treatment for children with prominent upper front teeth (class II division 1) is more effective for reducing the incidence of incisal trauma than providing one course of orthodontic treatment in adolescence. There do not appear to be any other advantages of providing early treatment when compared to late treatment. Low-quality evidence suggests that, compared to no treatment, late treatment in adolescence with functional appliances is effective for reducing the prominence of upper front teeth.  Class II Division 2  Treatment can be undertaken using orthodontic treatments using dental braces. While treatment is carried out, there is no evidence from clinical trials to recommend or discourage any type of orthodontic treatment in children. A 2018 Cochrane systematic review anticipated that the evidence base supporting treatment approaches is not likely to improve occlusion due to the low prevalence of the condition and the ethical difficulties in recruiting people to participate in a randomized controlled trials for treating this condition. = Class III = The British Standard Institute (BSI) classify class III incisor relationship as the lower incisor edge lies anterior to the cingulum plateau of the upper incisors, with reduced or reversed over jet. The skeletal facial deformity is characterized by mandibular prognathism, maxillary retrognathism or a combination of the two. This effects 3-8% of UK population with a higher incidence seen in Asia. One of the main reasons for correcting Class III malocclusion is aesthetics and function. This can have a psychological impact on the person with malocclusion resulting in speech and mastication problems as well. In mild class III cases, the patient is quite accepting of the aesthetics and the situation is monitored to observe the progression of skeletal growth. Maxillary and mandibular skeletal changes during prepubertal, pubertal and post pubertal stages show that class III malocclusion is established before the prepubertal stage. One treatment option is the use of growth modification appliances such as the Chin Cap which has greatly improved the skeletal framework in the initial stages. However, majority of cases are shown to relapse into inherited class III malocclusion during the pubertal growth stage and when the appliance is removed after treatment. Another approach is to carry out orthognathic surgery, such as a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) which is indicated by horizontal mandibular excess. This involves surgically cutting through the mandible and moving the fragment forward or backwards for desired function and is supplemented with pre and post surgical orthodontics to ensure correct tooth relationship. Although the most common surgery of the mandible, it comes with several complications including: bleeding from inferior alveolar artery, unfavorable splits, condylar resorption, avascular necrosis and worsening of temporomandibular joint. Orthodontic camouflage can also be used in patients with mild skeletal discrepancies. This is a less invasive approach that uses orthodontic brackets to correct malocclusion and try to hide the skeletal discrepancy. Due to limitations of orthodontics, this option is more viable for patients who are not as concerned about the aesthetics of their facial appearance and are happy to address the malocclusion only, as well as avoiding the risks which come with orthognathic surgery. = Deep bite = The most common corrective treatments available are fixed or removal appliances (such as dental braces), which may or may not require surgical intervention. At this time there is no robust evidence that treatment will be successful. = Open Bite = An open bite malocclusion is when the upper teeth don't overlap the lower teeth. When this malocclusion occurs at the front teeth it is known as anterior open bite. An open bite is difficult to treat due to multifactorial causes, with relapse being a major concern. This is particularly so for an anterior open bite. Therefore, it is important to carry out a thorough initial assessment in order to obtain a diagnosis to tailor a suitable treatment plan. It is important to take into consideration any habitual risk factors, as this is crucial for a successful outcome without relapse. Treatment approach includes behavior changes, appliances and surgery. Treatment for adults include a combination of extractions, fixed appliances, intermaxillary elastics and orthognathic surgery. For children, orthodontics is usually used to compensate for continued growth. With children with mixed dentition, the malocclusion may resolve on its own as the permanent teeth erupt. Furthermore, should the malocclusion be caused by childhood habits such as digit, thumb or pacifier sucking, it may result in resolution as the habit is stopped. Habit deterrent appliances may be used to help in breaking digit and thumb sucking habits. Other treatment options for patients who are still growing include functional appliances and headgear appliances.  Tooth size discrepancy  Identifying the presence of tooth size discrepancies between the maxillary and mandibular arches is an important component of correct orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. To establish appropriate alignment and occlusion, the size of upper and lower front teeth, or upper and lower teeth in general, needs to be proportional. Inter-arch tooth size discrepancy (ITSD) is defined as a disproportion in the mesio-distal dimensions of teeth of opposing dental arches. The prevalence is clinically significant among orthodontic patients and has been reported to range from 17% to 30%. Identifying inter-arch tooth size discrepancy (ITSD) before treatment begins allows the practitioner to develop the treatment plan in a way that will take ITSD into account. ITSD corrective treatment may entail demanding reduction (interproximal wear), increase (crowns and resins), or elimination (extractions) of dental mass prior to treatment finalization. Several methods have been used to determine ITSD. Of these methods the one most commonly used is the Bolton analysis. Bolton developed a method to calculate the ratio between the mesiodistal width of maxillary and mandibular teeth and stated that a correct and harmonious occlusion is possible only with adequate proportionality of tooth sizes. Bolton's formula concludes that if in the anterior portion the ratio is less than 77.2% the lower teeth are too narrow, the upper teeth are too wide or there is a combination of both. If the ratio is higher than 77.2% either the lower teeth are too wide, the upper teeth are too narrow or there is a combination of both. Other conditions Open bite treatment after eight months of braces. Other kinds of malocclusions can be due to or horizontal, vertical, or transverse skeletal discrepancies, including skeletal asymmetries. Increased vertical growth causes a long facial profile and commonly leads to an open bite malocclusion, while decreased vertical facial growth causes a short facial profile and is commonly associated with a deep bite malocclusion. However, there are many other more common causes for open bites (such as tongue thrusting and thumb sucking) and likewise for deep bites. The upper or lower jaw can be overgrown (macrognathia) or undergrown (micrognathia). It has been reported that patients with micrognathia are also affected by retrognathia (abnormal posterior positioning of the mandible or maxilla relative to the facial structure). These patients are majorly predisposed to a class II malocclusion. Mandibular macrognathia results in prognathism and predisposes patients to a class III malocclusion. Most malocclusion studies to date have focused on Class III malocclusions. Genetic studies for Class II and Class I malocclusion are more rare. An example of hereditary mandibular prognathism can be seen amongst the Hapsburg Royal family where one third of the affected individuals with severe class III malocclusion had one parent with a similar phenotype The frequent presentation of dental malocclusions in patients with craniofacial birth defects also supports a strong genetic aetiology. About 150 genes are associated with craniofacial conditions presenting with malocclusions. Micrognathia is a commonly recurring craniofacial birth defect appearing among multiple syndromes. For patients with severe malocclusions, corrective jaw surgery or orthognathic surgery may be carried out as a part of overall treatment, which can be seen in about 5% of the general population.

Omar Saidou Tall (Umar ibn Sa'id al-Futi Tal, ), (c. 1794-1864 CE), born in Futa Tooro, Senegambia, was a West African political leader, Islamic scholar, Tijani Sufi and Toucouleur military commander who founded a brief empire encompassing much of what is now Guinea, Senegal, and Mali.Lapidus, Ira M. (2014) A History of Islamic Societies. 3rd edition, New York: Cambridge University Press, pages 472-473. Name Omar Tall's name is spelled variously: in particular, his first name is commonly transliterated in French as Omar, although some sources prefer Umar; the patronymic, ibn Sa'id, is often omitted; and the final element of his name, Tall (), is spelt variously as Tall, Taal or Tal. The honorific El Hadj (also al-Hajj or el- Hadj), reserved for a Muslim who has successfully made the Hajj to Mecca, precedes Omar Tall's name in many texts, especially those in Arabic. Later he also took on the honorifics Amir al-Mu'minin, Khalifa, Qutb (pole of the universe), vizier of the Mahdi, Khalifat Khatim al-Awliya (successor of the seal of saints), and Almami (Imam). Early life Omar Tall was born about 1794 in Halwar in the Imamate of Futa Toro (present-day Senegal); he was the tenth of twelve children. His father was Saidou Tall, from the Torodbe tribe, and his mother was Sokhna Adama Thiam. Omar Tall attended a madrassa before embarking on the Hajj in 1828, returning in 1830 as a marabout with the title El Hadj and was initiated into the Tijaniyya, and then assumed the khalifa of the Tijaniyya sufi brotherhood in the Sudan. El-Hadj took the Tijani honorific Khalifat Khatim al-Awliya. This authority would become the basis of his personal authority necessary to lead Africans. When returning from the Hajj he camped near Damascus there he met Ibrahim Pasha, Omar Tall befriended the Pasha healed his son from a deadly fever, Omar Tall was highly inspired by the trends set by the Pasha. Settling in Sokoto from 1831-1837, he took several wives, one of whom was a daughter of the Fula Caliph of the Sokoto Caliphate, Muhammed Bello. In 1836, Omar Tall moved to the Imamate of Futa Jallon and then to Dinguiraye in 1840, in present-day Guinea, where he began preparations for his jihad. There he organized his followers into a professional army of around 50,000 strong, equipped with French weapons and western advisors. In 1852 he proclaimed a jihad against pagans, lapsed Muslims, European intruders, and the backsliding rulers of Futa Toro and Futa Jallon. Omar Tall claimed a transcendental personal authority. He denied the important of adherence to a Madhhab and favoured Ijtihad or personal religious judgment. He taught that a believer should follow the guidance of a Sufi Shaykh who has immediate personal knowledge of the divine truth. Even though Omar Tall never took the title of either Mujaddid or Mahdi, he was regarded as such by his followers. He became the torodbe ideal of religious revival and conquest of pagans. Initial conquests Omar Tall appealed to the populace of Futa Toro on the basis of local grievances against the military elites. His community also appealed to rootless individuals of mixed ethnic background who found new social identity and opportunities for conquest under the aegis of Islam. His Jihad began with the conquest of Futa Toro and by 1862 his empire included Timbuktu, Masina, Hamdallahi, and Segu. In 1848, Omar Tall's Toucouleur army, equipped with French weapons, invaded several neighboring, pagan, Malink√© regions and met with immediate success. Omar Tall pressed on into what is today the region of Kayes in Mali, conquering a number of cities and building a tata (fortification) near the city of Kayes that is today a popular tourist destination. In April 1857, Omar Tall declared war on the Khasso kingdom. He came into conflict with the French who were attempting to establish their commercial supremacy along the Senegal river. Omar Tall besieged the French colonial army at Medina Fort. The siege failed on July 18 of the same year when Louis Faidherbe, French governor of Senegal, arrived with relief forces. In 1860 Omar Tall made a treaty with the French that recognized his, and his followers', sphere of influence in Futa Toro and assigned them the Bambara states of Kaarta and Segu. Bambara and Masina After his failure to defeat the French, Omar Tall launched a series of assaults on the Bambara kingdoms of Kaarta and S√©gou (Segu). The Kaarta capital of Nioro du Sahel fell quickly to Omar Tall's mujahideen, followed by S√©gou on 10 March 1861., a reprint of the 1931 edition, being a translation of the author's Les noirs de L'Afrique, published in 1921; Civilizations n√©gro africaines, published in 1925; and part of Les n√®gres published in 1927. When Segu fell, their king, Ali Diara (Bina Ali), fled to Hamdullahi taking with him the traditional idols of the royal family. While Omar Tall's wars thus far had been against the animist Bambara or the Christian French, he now turned his attention to the smaller Islamic states of the region. Installing his son Ahmadu Tall as imam of Segu, Omar Tall marched down the Niger, on the Massina Empire imamate of Hamdullahi. More than 70,000 died in the three battles that followed. The most decisive was at Cayawel, where Amadu III, the Masina king, was wounded. Djenn√© fell quickly followed by the final fall and destruction of Hamdullahi in May 1862. Death and legacy In 1862, in the quest for new territory, Omar Tall and his followers invaded the Massina Empire (Masina), whose capital was at Hamdullahi. Ahmad al-Bakkai al-Kunti, of the Qadari Sufi order, led a coalition of local states to resist this invasion which Ahmad denounced as an illegitimate war of Muslims on Muslims. The coalition included, inter alia, Masina and Timbuktu. Omar Tall captured Hamdullahi on 15 May 1862. Now controlling the entire Middle Niger, Omar Tall moved against Timbuktu, only to be repulsed in 1863 by a combined force of Tuaregs, Moors, and Fulas.; During 1863, the coalition inflicted several defeats on Omar Tall's army, ending up killing Tall's generals Alpha Umar (Alfa 'Umar), Thierno Bayla and Alfa 'Uthman. notes and translation by Gaden, Henri; url access restricted to University of Michigan libraries. Meanwhile, a rebellion broke out in the Masina lands led by Ba Lobbo, cousin of executed Masina monarch Amadu III. In suppressing the revolt, In the Spring of 1863, Omar Tall reoccupied the city of Hamdullahi, and in June Balobo's combined force of Fulas and Kountas besieged Omar Tall's army there. Balobo's followers captured Hamdallahi in February 1864. Omar Tall fled and managed to make it to a cave in Degembere (in the Bandiagara Escarpment) where he died on 14 February 1864.There is some dispute about where exactly the cave in question is located. Omar Tall's nephew Tidiani Tall succeeded him as the Toucouleur emperor, though his son Ahmadu Tall, operating out of S√©gou, did much of the work in keeping the empire intact. Nonetheless, the French continued to advance, finally entering S√©gou itself in 1890. Omar Tall's jihad state was completely absorbed into the growing French West African empire. Omar Tall remains a prominent figure in Senegal, Guinea, and Mali, though his legacy varies by country. Where many Senegalese tend to remember him as a hero of anti-French resistance, Malian sources tend to describe him as an invader who prepared the way for the French by weakening West Africa. Omar Tall also figures prominently in Maryse Cond√©'s historical novel Segu. He remains to this day an influential figure in the Tijaniyya and other reformist movements, which stressed the importance of Muslim orthopraxy. Omar Tall's state forbade dancing, the use of tobacco, alcohol, charms, pagan ceremonies, and the worship of idols. Many un-Islamic practices were banned. These laws were also very strictly enforced, especially the ban on alcohol. Omar Tall abolished uncanonical taxes and replaced them with zakat, land taxes, and jizya. Polygamists were restricted to only four wives. Omar Tall, however, was uninterested in the logistical aspects of inculcating Islam such as building courts, madrassahs, and mosques. The primary function of Omar Tall's state was predatory warfare, slaving, the accumulation of booty, and the reform of morals. In the Senegambia, his emphasis during the ‚Äújihadic period‚Äù is remembered as \\"not resistance to the Europeans but the ‚Äúdestruction of paganism‚Äù in the Western Sudan.\\"The Standarde (Gambia), Al-hajj Umar Fouti Tall c.1797 ‚Äì 1864 The Tijaniyya jihadist (JUNE 19, 2020) (retrieved 23 August 2020) In November 2019, the French government returned the sword of Omar Tall to the Senegalese people.

Biography Agatha Deken was born in 1741. In 1745, after her parents died, she went to live in the 'Oranje Appel' orphanage in Amsterdam, where she remained until 1767. After leaving the orphanage she served in several families and later started a business in coffee and tea. In 1769 she joined the Baptist community in Amsterdam. At the age of 29 she moved in with her friend Maria Bosch as a nurse. Maria Bosch died in 1773. In 1775, Deken published the collection of poems Stichtelijke gedichten, which she had written together with Maria Bosch. 1776 saw the beginning of a correspondence between Aagje Deken and Betje Wolff, who had already published several works by that time. In October of that year they met for the first time. After the death of Betje's husband, the two women lived together. In September 1777 they published their first joint work: Brieven ('Letters'). In 1781 Deken inherited a sum of 13,000 guilders, and they went to live in a mansion in Beverwijk. They published the successful novel Sara Burgerhart and Historie van den heer Willem Leevend. Not quite at ease with the political situation in the Netherlands, when the Patriot faction lost power, they moved to Tr√´oux in Burgundy in 1788. In 1789 Wandelingen door Bourgogne ('Walks in Burgundy') appeared. In financial straits, they returned to the Netherlands in 1797 and lived in The Hague. Aagje Deken died on 14 November 1804, nine days after Betje Wolff. Both were buried in Scheveningen. References =Sources= * J.

The Luni River begins near Ajmer in the Pushkar valley of the western Aravalli Range at an elevation of about 550m. At this point, the river is also known as the Sagarmati. The river then flows in the southwest direction through the hills and plains of the Marwar region in Rajasthan. The river flows south-west and enters the Thar Desert before dissipating into the Rann of Kutch, traversing a total of 495 km. In spite of the high salinity, it is a major river in the region and serves as a primary source of irrigation. The Luni is not saline until it reaches Balotra, where high salt content in the soil impacts the river. The Luni may have been the southern portion of the historic Ghaggar-Hakra river channel. Tributaries The Jawai, Sukri, Guhiya, Bandi and Jojari rivers are the main tributaries of Luni river.The Jojari is the only tributary that merges to the right-bank of the river while other 10 tributaries reach its left bank.All the tributaries except Jojari originates from the Aravalli hill. Dams and irrigation The dams in Luni river are: *Dantiwada dam *Sipu dam *Jaswant Sagar Dam - built in 1892 by Maharaja Jaswant Singh.It is one of the largest artificial lakes in India. The two major irrigation projects on Luni river are Sardar Samand and Jawai dam. Flash Floods Flash floods have occurred in the Luni river as the river flows on a shallow bed and the riverbank soil is easily flattened by the rain water. The worst flood was happened in 2006, when the desert region received heavy rain.The water levels rose to 15‚Äì25 feet submerging the surrounding regionriver.The 2006 flash floods in caused water levels to rise to as high as 15‚Äì25 feet submerging many parts along the river in the Barmer district.A large number of humans and animals died in the flood. In 2010, another flood occurred but the casualties were less.

Known for Shakespearean roles, Todd soon gained work at Detroit radio station WXYZ, as part of director James Jewell's repertory company, with roles on the various series produced by the station. His most famous work was on The Lone Ranger. He played a local sheriff in some of the show's earliest episodes, but on the twelfth broadcast, which aired February 25, 1933, Todd first played his most famous role, the masked man's Native American companion Tonto.Lone Ranger Fan Club - Tonto Todd was a bald and stocky man of Irish descent, though he occasionally donned a wig for publicity photos. He was usually replaced by a Native American performer for public appearances. With the exception of a brief period where he was replaced by a real Native American, Todd played Tonto for almost the entire radio run, and was the only original cast member heard on the final broadcast, on September 3, 1954. Station owner George Trendle wanted to replace Todd in the role of Tonto because he was \\"too old\\". Todd's replacement, a college educated Native American, refused to perform the \\"me do\\" and \\"him go\\" type lines as written and Todd was given back the role of Tonto. Trendle had a reputation for keeping his performers working for low pay even when the show was a big money maker. This episode may have been another of Trendle's maneuvers to demonstrate that the actors could be replaced. Other radio roles for Todd included recurring but less significant parts on The Green Hornet as Dan Reid, the title character's father and the now elderly version of the Lone Ranger's nephew, and on Challenge of the Yukon, as Inspector Conrad, Sgt. Preston's superior in the North-West Mounted Police.

He is well known for producing apparel, fragrance, accessories and home fashions for women and men. He was born in Shanghai and raised in Hong Kong. Sung is the brother of late Hong Kong actress Lydia Shum. He is also a founder of Club Monaco, a mid-priced, high-end casual clothing retailer. Early life Sung aspired to become a fine artist contrary to his parents' wishes that he pursue a traditional profession. In time, his father compromised and agreed to send him to Paris where he studied couture at the notable Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. After graduating with first-place honours, Sung moved to New York City to study at the Parsons School of Design. Upon completion, he began the task of honing his talent while working as an assistant designer for a Seventh Avenue dress manufacturer. Career In 1972, Alfred Sung moved to Canada. His next step was designing for a sportswear manufacturer in Toronto's garment district. After using his fashion illustration skills to supplement his income, Sung opened a tiny shop called Moon initially located on Carlton St. just east of Sherbourne in Toronto's Cabbagetown area around 1977. His loose fitting and comfortable desert colour designs were a major contrast to the black leather and skinny jeans of the prevailing Punk scene. In 1980, Sung joined forces with Saul and Joseph Mimran to create Monaco Group Inc., the corporate entity that would develop the Alfred Sung brand and the ready-to-wear collection directed to working women. Within months, the Alfred Sung brand appeared in major department and specialty stores across Canada. In 1981, the Alfred Sung label was launched in the United States through Saks Fifth Avenue, later appearing in Macy's, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. That same year, Sung opened his first freestanding store in Toronto's Hazelton Lanes. In 1983, Canada's national news magazine, MacLean's, proclaimed Alfred Sung as Canada's \\"King of Fashion.\\" In 1986, with the launch of Parfums Alfred Sung, the Sung trademark its profile by becoming a fragrance brand. Sung by Alfred Sung, the first ladies' perfume launched in 1986, was followed by Shi Alfred Sung in 2001 and Alfred Sung Paradise in 2003. In 2005 a new signature fragrance, Jewel Alfred Sung was launched. In 1991, Sung opened a new set of free-standing stores across Canada which housed his premium denim collection for men and women, titled \\"Alfred.\\" During the same year, Monaco Group Inc changed its name to Mimran Group Inc. Following the success of his ready-to- wear lines, Sung developed a bridal collection sold at specialty boutiques across North America and increased the licensing of his name in several categories, including men's suiting and fragrances, eyewear, watches, furs, luggage and leather goods. Alfred Sung and the Mimrans have embarked on an aggressive fashion licensing campaign unprecedented in the Canadian fashion industry. The Alfred Sung licensed product lines include fragrance, eyewear, sunglasses, watches, bridal, jewellery and fashion accessories, men's clothing and accessories, among others. In 2005 the Alfred Sung Home collection was launched exclusively through Zellers-HBC in Canada, and includes furniture, bedding, bath, home decor, tabletop and kitchen products. This followed by the PURE ALFRED SUNG launch in 2008 also at Zellers-HBC, which included women's ready-to-wear and accessories.  Club Monaco  In 1985, Canadian Joe Mimran, Saul Mimran and Alfred Sung opened the first store in Toronto on Queen Street West. This store, which exists today, originally included a cafe below the sales floor. The first US store opened in Santa Monica in 1989. Until 1999, Club Monaco was a Canadian company and was based at Bloor Street West and Avenue Road in Toronto. It is now owned and operated by Polo Ralph Lauren, which acquired Club Monaco in 1999. Polo has allowed Club Monaco to exist as an independent entity within the group and has downplayed its ownership of the brand. Luxottica began distributing Club Monaco prescription frames and sunglasses in its retail outlets in 2007.

In total he played 60 matches in his Test career, captaining Zimbabwe on 21 occasions. He also played 188 One Day Internationals, being captain in 86 of them. He retired from cricket in 2003. Domestic career Born in Salisbury (now Harare), Campbell started his cricketing career as early as in school times in Eaglesvale High School, and was selected for the national side while he was still at the school. He scored his maiden first-class century by becoming the youngest Zimbabwean to do so. International career =Early career= A left-handed batsman, Campbell batted in the middle order in Test cricket but usually opened in One Day International cricket. After becoming the youngest ever Zimbabwean to make a first-class century he was selected for the 1992 World Cup in Australia, aged 19. He struggled throughout but in the coming years managed to cement his spot in the national side. On the 1993‚Äì94 Pakistan tour he scored 3 half centuries against the likes of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. In October 1994 he fell painfully short of his maiden Test century when he was dismissed by Sri Lankan paceman Ravindra Pushpakumara for 99. This remained his highest Test score for five years until he brought up 3 figures against India at Nagpur in 2000‚Äì01. He scored one more Test century in his career, an innings of 103 the following season against the West Indies. He was more successful in the ODI arena, making over 5000 runs and maintaining an average of over 30. His most prolific year was in 2000 when he made 960 runs at 38.40. Of his 7 hundreds, 2 of them were made against Australia. =Captaincy= Campbell took over the captaincy of Zimbabwe in 1996. He led them to a series victory in Pakistan in 1998‚Äì99, and also led the team to the Super Six stage of the 1999 World Cup. After 3 years in charge he stood down from the captaincy for what he stated as 'personal reasons'. In the 1998 inaugural ICC Knockout Trophy (now renamed as ICC Champions Trophy), Campbell became the first batsman to score a century. =Post captaincy= After not being selected for the 2003 World Cup, Campbell announced his retirement from international cricket only to reconsider when he was chosen to replace an injured Mark Vermeulen. Zimbabwe's final match of the World Cup turned out to be the final match of Campbell's career as he was never selected again for his country. In July 2009, Campbell was re-inducted into Zimbabwe cricket after being selected chairman of their Cricket Committee, a major step in the revival of the sport in the nation. He is also the chief selector of the Zimbabwean national cricket team. After cricket Campbell worked as a selector in the cricket administration of Zimbabwe, where he resigned from the position in October 2011. He also resigned as chair of the cricket committee in 2012. In 2015, he was appointed as the managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket, by replacing Wilfred Mukondiwa. However, in July of the same year, Zimbabwean allrounder Prosper Utseya criticized Campbell's actions as the chairman, alleging that he was a victim of racism because of these actions. Due to these incidents, Campbell resigned from the chairman role as Zimbabwe Cricket's director of international cricket and commercial affairs on 22 October 2015.

Their music blends folk, swamp pop, New Orleans rhythm and blues, Louisiana blues, country, cajun/zydeco, funk, soul and gospel with harmonic vocals. Their sound is notable for the band's substitution of a tambourine player for a drummer.[ Subdudes] at Allmusic.com The subdudes formed in 1987 through a music venue in New Orleans called Tipitina's.from an interview with Tommy Malone on episode 196 of the Americana Music Show, published June 16, 2014 History The Subdudes often credit their songwriting to the group as a whole, although the primary songwriters are Tommy Malone (brother of The Radiators guitarist Dave Malone) and John Magnie, both former members of Little Queenie and the Percolators. Current members of the band are Malone, vocals, acoustic, electric and slide guitars; Magnie, vocals, accordion, keyboards; Steve Amed√©e, tambourine, drums, other percussions, and vocals; Tim Cook, percussion, bass and vocals; and Jimmy Messa, bass and guitar. They are an Americana band with a rock-based sound that also shows soul, gospel, blues, cajun/zydeco, country, and other American roots music influences. Their former bass player was Johnny Ray Allen, who had not been with the band since their 1996 farewell tour (documented the next year on the Live at Last CD) until a brief reunion in 2014. Willie Williams also contributed to three albums: Annunciation, Primitive Streak and Live at Last as a second guitarist. Annunciation (1994) was produced by legendary record producer Glyn Johns, who also produced The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks, and Crosby, Stills and Nash among others. After regrouping in 2002 (first as The Dudes but then re-adopting the name 'subdudes' in March 2003), Bob Dylan's guitarist Freddy Koella helped produce Miracle Mule. The album Behind the Levee (2006) was produced by bluesman Keb' Mo' and yielded a minor hit, \\"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\\" (better known by its refrain, \\"Love is a Beautiful Thing\\"). Released in late 2007, the album Street Symphony was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee at Blackbird Studios in March 2007 and was produced by George Massenburg, who has worked with Little Feat. Released in late 2008, Live at the Ram's Head is available on CD or as a two DVD set, with one disc being the live show from \\"The Ram's Head\\" in Annapolis, Maryland, and the second DVD being Unplugged at Pleasant Plains, with interviews and live studio footage from the recording of Street Symphony in Nashville. Most recently (2009), the band's self-produced Flower Petals was recorded in Magnie's basement studio then mixed in Miami, Florida by The Albert Brothers and Steve Alaimo. The album was a departure for the band, being much more country-oriented than previous releases. at subdudes.com The cover art was by William Matthews, a Denver, Colorado artist well known for his Old West-style paintings. Flower Petals was originally slated to be recorded as the follow-up to Miracle Mule in 2004 but was nixed by the band's record company at the time, Back Porch Records. Five years later, the band members financed the recording themselves then shopped around the completed tapes. The Subdudes' stature as New Orleans musicians was reflected by their inclusion individually and as a group in the HBO series Treme.

From Heidelberg, Universit√§tsbiblothek, Cpg 365, folios 1v and 2r. Wolfdietrich is the eponymous protagonist of the Middle High German heroic epic Wolfdietrich. First written down in strophic form in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it survives in four main versions, widely differing in scope and content, and largely independent of each other. Wolfdietrich is closely associated with another heroic epic poem of the same period, Ortnit. The two stories have distinct (if disputed) origins but they were combined at an early stage, possibly by a single author, and appear together in most sources. In the earliest surviving version of the first story, Ortnit is killed by two dragons sent by his father-in-law after he abducts and marries his daughter; in the second, Wolfdietrich, deprived of his inheritance by two brothers and an evil counsellor, sets out to seek Ortnit's help but, finding he has been killed, avenges him by killing the dragons, he then defeats his brothers and the counsellor, and marries Ortnit's widow. While the earliest version is similar to other heroic epics such as the Nibelungenlied, the tale gradually accretes more episodes, becoming a popular adventure story. With their motifs of the bride-quest, inheritance regained, faithful and faithless vassals, dragon-killing, magic suits of armour, and encounters with dwarves, witches and giants, this pair of stories remained continuously popular, repeatedly re-cast, copied and, later, printed until the early 17th century. This makes it one of the most long-lived and popular German narratives of the medieval and early modern period. Though Wolfdietrich and Ortnit do not seem originally to have been among the legends surrounding Theodoric the Great, the Dietrich of Bern cycle, Wolfdietrich became identified as the grandfather of Dietrich and material from the two stories found its way into a number of Dietrich tales, including the Old Norse Thidreksaga. Versions The start of Wolfdietrich A, folio 220v of the Ambraser Heldenbuch The story survives in four versions. Three of these (A,B,C) are largely independent of each other, and each gives Wolfdietrich a different birthplace. The fourth, D, is a compilation of material from versions B and C. Wolfdietrich A (\\"Wolfdietrich of Constantinople\\") is the oldest version, written around 1230, though only surviving in a much later manuscript, the Ambraser Heldenbuch (MS A). The first 505 strophes (A1) are probably written by the same author as the version of Ortnit which precedes it in the manuscript, but the remaining 101 strophes (A2) show a more condensed narration by a continuator using material from the tradition of Wolfdietrich B. The end of the story is missing in the Ambraser Heldenbuch (it ends as Wolfdieterich's sword breaks in his fight against the dragon), but can be reconstructed from the Dresden Heldenbuch of 1472, which draws on the same source as MS A. Wolfdietrich B (\\"Wolfdietrich of Saloniki\\") greatly expands the story of Wolfdietrich's youth. Wolfdietrich C (\\"Wolfdietrich of Athens\\") survives only in five widely spread fragments, one of which is now missing. Wolfdietrich D is the most extensive version (hence \\"The Large Wolfdietrich\\") and combines material from versions B and C as well as a further, unknown version related to B. With 10 manuscripts and six printed editions it is \\"one of the great literary successes of the late Middle Ages\\". The story =Ortnit A= King Ortnit of Lambarten (Lombardy) abducts Liebgarte, the daughter of King Machorel. Under the guise of an attempt at reconciliation, Machorel sends Ortnit two dragon eggs, and the dragons terrorise the kingdom after they hatch. After a year Ortnit sets out to defeat the dragons, but is caught asleep and killed by them. His widow is forced into seclusion, to await the birth of Ortnit's avenger. =Wolfdietrich A= Wolfdietrich is born as third son to Hugdietrich, King of Greece. The king's evil counsellor Sabene persuades him that the child is the spawn of the devil, and Duke Berchtung of Meran is ordered to kill him. But Berchtung saves the child and brings about the banishment of Sabene. After Hugdietrich's death, Sabene returns to Constantinople and persuades the two elder brothers to banish the queen and deprive Wolfdietrich, now living in Berchtung's castle Lilienport, of his inheritance. Wolfdietrich leads a military campaign against his brothers but it fails and he is besieged in Lilienport. After four years he breaks out and makes his way to seek help from King Ortnit. He eventually makes his way to Garte, where he finds Ortnit's widow lamenting her husband's death. He defeats the dragons, marries Liebgart, and becomes King of Lambarten. Disguised as a pilgrim, Wolfdietrich reconnoitres Constantinople, where Berchtung's sons are being held captive by his brothers. After recovering his wife, who had been abducted in the meantime, he sails to Greece, where after a successful siege of his brothers he has Sabene executed and rewards his faithful vassals. He then returns to Lambarten. Origins Various theories have attempted to connect Wolfdietrich (and his father Hugdietrich) with historical persons from the Germanic Migration Period: *The Ostrogothic theory equates Wolfdietrich with Dietrich von Bern. This is supported by the name Dietrich (Wolfdietrich is a nickname for the child baptized Dietrich), by the Italian and Near East geography, and by the exile and reconquest story. However, given the prominence of the other Dietrich stories, this seems unlikely. *The Frankish theories identify Wolfdetrich with various Merovingian rulers, Theudebert, Theuderich or Gundoald. Support for this lies in the motif of the conflict between the brothers over the inheritance, and the name Hugdietrich is Frankish. The closest parallels are with Chlodwig I (=Hugdietrich) and his son Theuderich (=Wolfdietrich): the accusation of bastardy, fraternal conflict and a mixed marriage. However, there is no consensus on these theories, and it can be argued that the many anti-historical elements essential to the story (rescue by wolves, magic armour, giants, dragons) suggest it combines a variety of legendary and fantastic sources divorced from any specific historical personalities. In this view Wolfdietrich is essentially a montage, which draws on not only the heroic epic, but also the chanson de geste, crusade literature, the bride-quest story, and other sources, with what Miklautsch calls a \\"hybrid hero\\". Form and structure Wolfdietrich and Ortnit are written in a strophic form called the Hildebrandston (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the Nibelungenlied and Kudrun). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three feet with a feminine ending, a caesura, then three feet with a rhymed masculine ending. The strophes are marked in the manuscripts by a Lombardic capital. In the printed Heldenb√ºcher, the Hildebrandston is transformed into the Heunenweise, an eight-line strophe: the long-line is split at the caesura and unrhymed line-endings are given rhymes, with the resulting rhyme scheme ABABCDCD. This necessarily involved considerable rewriting of the text: Manuscripts and printed books The four versions of Wolfdietrich survive in 11 complete manuscripts and several fragments of a twelfth. In many cases Wolfdietrich (and Ortnit) form part of a larger collection under the title of Heldenbuch (\\"Book of Heroes\\"). =Wolfdietrich A= * MS A, the Ambraser Heldenbuch (Vienna, Austrian National Library, Cod. Ser. nova 2663), written 1507‚Äì1516 by Hans Ried‚Äîcontains Ortnit and 606 strophes of Wolfdietrich * MS k, the Dresden Heldenbuch (Dresden, State Library, Mscr.

The caption reads, \\"Here Wolfdieterich fought with the citizens before the city of Constantinople; the city was given back to him.\\" In 1479 Johann Pr√ºss printed a Heldenbuch which included Ornit, Wolfdietrich and three other works, with 230 woodcuts. The text came primarily from the source used in the Heldenbuch of Diebolt von Hanow (MS c). It was subsequently reprinted, with variations and different woodcuts, by others in 1491, 1509, 1545, 1560 and 1590. The Strassburg Heldenbuch was used as the source for a dramatic trilogy by Jakob Ayrer published in 1618: *Vom HuegDieterichen / und seinem Sohn WolffDieterichen / K√∂nig in Griechenland *Vom dem Keiser Ottnit *Von WolffDieterichen / dem K√∂nig aus Griechenland Editions * (Wolfdietrich A, B and C)  (The Strassburg Heldenbuch of 1479) * (Includes editions of all four versions of the poem, with detailed introductions.) * (MS y, Lienhart Scheubels Heldenbuch‚Äîthe text of Wolfdietrich starts on p. 58.)

Since 1976, Allen has issued 12 albums and charted 14 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. She recorded the 1983 crossover hit \\"Baby I Lied\\", which reached No. 4 on the country chart and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100. Allen has also written No. 1 singles for herself, Janie Fricke, and John Conlee; Top 5 hits for Patty Loveless and Tanya Tucker; and a Top 10 hit for The Whites. Early life and rise to fame Allen was born Deborah Lynn Thurmond in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. She was a beauty queen when she was a teenager. Musically, she was influenced by Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Ray Charles, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the current music which was being played in Memphis on WHBQ and WDIA, as well as country musicians such as Brenda Lee, Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash. At 19, Allen moved to Nashville to begin pursuing her career in music. She worked a short stint as a waitress at the local Music Row IHOP restaurant. While there one day, Deborah met Roy Orbison and songwriter Joe Melson. Two weeks later, Orbison and Melson, who admired her spunk, decided to hire Allen to sing background on a couple of Orbison tracks. Allen also auditioned for and landed a job at the Opryland USA theme park. She was soon chosen by Opryland as a featured soloist and dancer for a state department exchange tour of Russia starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.Betts, Stephen L., AOL Music; Deborah Allen interview, Nov. 2011 Upon her return from Russia, Allen gravitated to the Nashville offices of Waylon Jennings, the Tompall & the Glaser Brothers and John Hartford where her close friend, Marie Barrett, worked as a secretary. There she met her soon-to- be songwriting mentor, poet, playwright, artist and songwriter Shel Silverstein. After watching her perform during a happy hour show at the Spence Manor on Nashville's Music Row, Silverstein advised Allen to pursue songwriting as an extension of her creativity and career path. Allen also began to pursue a singing career in her own right when she was chosen to be a regular on Jim Stafford's ABC summer replacement series. She went on to serve as an opening act for many of Stafford's personal appearances. Jim and producer Phil Gernhard brought Allen back to Nashville to record a CB radio novelty record called \\"Do You Copy\\". It was recorded live and was released as a single on Warner Bros. Records. Although she appreciated the opportunity to record with Stafford and Gernhard, Allen was disheartened that after waiting patiently for two years to record her first record, it was a novelty tune. She decided to move back to Nashville to follow her true musical direction. In 1979, while singing at a private party, she was discovered by producer Bud Logan, who invited her to sing on five unfinished duet tracks by the late Jim Reeves. Three of these songs were \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over,\\" \\"Oh, How I Miss You Tonight\\" and \\"Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me.\\" All three duets were released as singles, and made the Top 10 on the country charts for Reeves' longtime label, RCA Records. She was billed as \\"The Mystery Singer\\" on the first release, an innovative promotion by label head, Joe Galante. Career peak: 1980s In 1980, Allen signed with Capitol Records. Her debut album for the label was 1980's Trouble in Paradise. The album produced her initial solo hit \\"Nobody's Fool\\" peaking at No. 24 on Billboard country chart. Subsequent chart singles included (although none never made it on to an album) \\"You (Make Me Wonder Why),\\" \\"You Look Like the One I Love\\" (a song she had co-written) and \\"After Tonight,\\" co-written by Troy Seals, each peaking at #20, #33 and #82 on Billboard Country Chart. At the same time, Allen had written a song called \\"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\\" with Bruce Channel and Kieran Kane. Although she pleaded with her record label, Capitol, to let her record it and release it as a single, they refused. With the encouragement of music publisher Don Gant, Janie Fricke's producer, Jim Ed Norman, heard \\"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\\" and recorded it with Fricke. The single became Deborah's first No. 1 single on the Billboard charts as a songwriter. By 1982, she had begun collaborating with Rafe Van Hoy for songwriting. The couple married that year. In 1983, Deborah moved to RCA Records, where she achieved her greatest success, releasing the album Cheat the Night. The first single from the album, \\"Baby I Lied\\", became Allen's signature song and only crossover hit. The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard country chart and crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 26 in January 1984. The song also climbed into the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary chart. Allen followed the crossover hit with the country single \\"I've Been Wrong Before\\", which went to No. 1 on the Cashbox country chart and #2 on Billboard Country Chart in the spring of 1984. It also earned her nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Country Song and Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Later that year, \\"I Hurt For You\\", also from Allen's breakthrough album, became a Top 10 country hit. In 1984, she recorded Let Me Be the First, the first album to be digitally recorded in, and released from, Nashville. In 1984, Allen made the charts once again with \\"Heartache and a Half\\" (written by Allen with her then- husband, Rafe Van Hoy and Muscle Shoals songwriter Eddie Struzick). In 1987, Allen released a single called \\"Telepathy\\" written by Prince, under the alias \\"Joey Coco\\". An album of the same name was also issued and was considered more pop oriented. In 1987, Allen released her last single for RCA, \\"You're the Kind of Trouble\\". 1990s‚Äìpresent After the No. 1 co-written hit, \\"Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby\\" and the Tanya Tucker hit \\"Can I See You Tonight\\", Allen won another No. 1 for Janie Frickie, \\"Let's Stop Talking About It\\", as well as the No. 1 John Conlee release, \\"I'm Only in It for the Love\\", which she co- wrote with Kix Brooks and Van Hoy. During this time, Allen recorded the album Delta Dreamland which she co-produced and financed on her own. She then signed a contract with Giant Records to release the album under their label in 1993. The first single released was \\"Rock Me (In the Cradle of Love)\\", which charted at No. 29 on the Billboard country chart. The video of \\"Rock Me\\" was filmed on Allen's own 16mm Ariflex SR film camera and edited on her own Sony editing machine. Allen won the Music City Summit Award for her co-producing and co- directing. Allen also had one other charting single from the Delta Dreamland album with, \\"If You're Not Gonna Love Me\\". Allen's 1994 album, All That I Am, which was co-produced by Allen and label head James Stroud, was also well received with her single release \\"Break These Chains\\". In addition to Allen's personal albums, she contributed to the soundtrack of the 1993 film The Thing Called Love performing \\"Blame It on Your Heart\\" (also covered by Patty Loveless) and the Don Schlitz ballad \\"Ready and Waiting\\". Allen signed a co- publishing deal and record deal with Curb music publishing and Curb Records. She released one album with Curb Records in 2000, titled The Best Of, that included a new version of her 1983 hit \\"Baby I Lied\\". Five of Allen's songs were recorded by LeAnn Rimes. Two of Allen's songs appeared on the multi- platinum \\"Blue\\" album and three songs on her \\"Sittin' On Top of the World\\" album. Allen's song \\"We Can Get There\\", performed by Mary Griffin, appeared in the film Coyote Ugly\\"\\". Allen\\"s album Hear Me Now was released through Delta Rock Records and GMV Nashville on August 16, 2011. The first single was \\"Anything Other Than Love\\", co-written by Gary Burr. The album also contains Allen's song \\"Amazing Graceland\\", a tribute to Elvis Presley. Allen's publishing companies, Delta Queen Music and Delta Rose Music are currently co- published with partner Delta Rock Music. She is represented by Raymond Hicks of Rolling Thunder Management. In 2013, she released her first Christmas album, Rockin' Little Christmas, through Weblast Records, and played Christmas shows at the Fontanel Mansion in Nashville, that same year. On March 22, 2019, Bill Lee, the Governor of Tennessee, officially designated June 5, 2019 as a Day of Recognition to honor Allen. Personal life In a 2019 interview with Guitar Girl, Allen shared that she was physically abused by her first husband. Allen lives in Franklin, Tennessee. She is married to music producer and promoter Raymond Hicks. Allen is a Christian.

From Heidelberg, Universit√§tsbiblothek, Cpg 365, folios 1v and 2r. Ortnit is the eponymous protagonist of the Middle High German heroic epic Ortnit. First written down in strophic form in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it circulated in a number of distinct versions. In the earliest version, King Ortnit sets out on an expedition to make the daughter of the heathen King Machorel his bride. He is greatly assisted by the cunning of the dwarf Alberich, who can only be seen by the wearer of a magic ring, and by the martial prowess of the Russian king Ilyas, Ortnit's uncle. In the second part of the story, Machorel, enraged by Ortnit's abduction of his daughter, sends him, in a feigned gesture of reconciliation, two dragon eggs. When these hatch, the dragons terrorise the land. After a year's delay, Ortnit sets out to kill the dragons, but falls asleep and is killed by them. In most of the surviving versions, this is followed by the story of Wolfdietrich, who avenges Ortnit's death and marries his widow. Though the two stories have distinct origins, they were possibly combined and integrated at an early stage. The earliest surviving versions, Ortnit A and Wolfdietrich A may be the work of a single author. The bride-quest and dragon motifs come from older oral traditions, but a strong crusading element in the journey to the Levant and defeat of a heathen army reflects the concerns of the 13th century. There is no consensus about the origins of the figure of Ortnit himself. With a dozen manuscripts, six printed editions and a theatrical adaptation, the story remained popular right up until the early 17th century. Versions The story of Ortnit survives in eight narrative versions, grouped in four main traditions: Ortnit A (also Ortnit AW, after the two manuscripts) is the oldest version, written around 1230, containing 597 strophes. A later adaptation in the Dresden Heldenbuch condenses the text to about a third of the length. Ortnit C survives only in two fragments containing around 60 strophes of Ortnit with material close to that of Ortnit A. Ortnit D, written around 1300, combines material from version C and a further, unknown version. Version D survives in four different variants from the 15th and 16th centuries: *a 560 strophes, five manuscripts *e 497 strophes, four manuscripts, including the manuscript version of the Strassburg Heldenbuch *y 443 strophes, one manuscript *z 555 strophes, the six printed editions of the Strassburg Heldenbuch. A verse drama in rhyming couplets by Jakob Ayrer published in 1618, Vom dem keiser Ottnit, was er biss and sein Endt erstritten und ausgericht, auff das Getreulichst der Histori nach is based on Ortnit D. Wolfdietrich B is not accompanied by a separate Ortnit tale. Instead, the stories are integrated: Wolfdietrich meets Ortnit, defeats him in battle and gains his friendship; Ortnit later kills two giants and a dragon but is then killed in his sleep by a second dragon. The story Alberich seduces the Lombard queen. Woodcut from the printed Heldenbuch, c. 1480. =Ortnit A= I. (Strophes 1‚Äì69) In his castle at Garda, King Ortnit of Lambarten (Lombardy) tells his vassals that he means to seek a wife, and one of them, his uncle Ilyas, King of Russia, mentions the beautiful daughter of Machorel of Muntabur (Mount Tabor), a heathen king. In spite of the fact that Machorel kills any suitor for his daughter, intending to marry her himself once his wife is dead, Ortnit sets his heart on her. II. (70‚Äì212) Delayed from setting out by winter weather, he is given a ring by his mother, who tells him it will lead to adventure. Following her instructions, he rides off into the wilderness until he encounters what he takes to be a child, who can only be seen by the one wearing the ring. After they have argued and fought - the child is unexpectedly strong - the child reveals himself to be the dwarf Alberich and Ortnit's natural father (having stepped in when Ortnit's parents were unable to conceive). He gives Ortnit a suit of golden armour with magical properties and vows to accompany him. III. (213‚Äì287) Ortnit and his army set sail from Messina and, after 10 days at sea, arrive off the coast of Tyre, Machorel's capital. Alberich gives Ortnit a magic stone which allows him to speak and understand any language, and this enables him to pose as a merchant to secure permission to dock. Ortnit wants to take the city immediately, riding through the open gates, but Alberich insists this would be dishonourable. Instead, Alberich goes to Muntabur and gives Machorel a formal challenge: to give his daughter to Ortnit or be attacked. Machorel refuses and flies into a range. IV. (288‚Äì346) That night Alberich steals hundreds of small boats from the harbour and the army uses these to land. At dawn, the alarm is given in the city and fierce fighting ensues. Alberich notices that all the city gates are open and the heathens may escape and burn the ships. Leaving Ilyas to continue the main battle, Ortnit gives chase. Returning, successful, he find that Ilyas has lost all his men, and he re-engages to avenge their deaths. With the battle over, Ilyas is shown a cellar where the remaining heathen warriors are hiding and he beheads all of them in revenge, but Ortnit prevents him from killing the woman and children. Attending to the wounded, Ortnit laments the many men he has lost. V. (347‚Äì483) At dawn, they set off for Muntabur. On arrival they pitch their tents outside the castle, but are too close and are shot at from the ramparts. That night, however, Alberich steals into the castle and throws the bows and arrows into the moat. Believing this to be the work of the devil, the heathens pressure the queen to let Ortnit have her daughter. But the king rejects the suggestion angrily. The next day, battle is joined. Distressed at the battle and the danger to her father's life, the princess prays to Apollo and Mohammed. Alberich pretends to be a messenger from (the Christian) God but even so cannot persuade the girl to marry Ortnit, until she challenges him to prove he is stronger than her gods, whereupon he shatters her shrine and throws it into the moat. The princess relents in order to spare her father, and sends her ring to Ortnit. Battle ceases and the heathens withdraw into the castle. Alberich sneaks in and brings out the princess to Ortnit, who rides off with her. As soon as her father discovers she is missing he rides in pursuit of Ortnit with his army. In the ensuing battle, the heathen army is completely destroyed, though Machorel escapes to the safety of the castle. Ortnit sets sail and, after the princess has been baptized, they marry. VI. (484‚Äì526) Machorel is visited by a huntsman, who has stolen two eggs from a dragon's cave and offers to take them to Lombardy to hatch so that they can then devastate Ortnit's land. Machorel agrees and sends the huntsman to Lombardy with gifts. Ortnit and his wife are delighted at these signs of reconciliation. After he has shown these to Ortnit, the huntsman reveals that one gift, an elephant, must be left to grow before being given. Ortnit orders the huntsman to be shown to a suitable cave in the mountains and given provisions. As the dragons grow the provisions start to become inadequate and dragons start to devastate the land in their search for food. After a year, in which knights have failed to defeat the dragons, Ortnit decides that he must take on the task himself. VII. (527‚Äì575) During an emotional parting from his wife, who tries to dissuade him, Ortnit tells her that if he fails to return, the knight who comes back with his armour, his ring and the dragon's tongue, will have avenged his death. Alberich refuses to accompany Ortnit, but warns him not to fall asleep. After a day and night wandering at random without finding the dragon, he sits down to rest but is overcome by sleep. When the dragon approaches, Ortnit's hound attempts to wake him, but without success. The dragon gulps him down whole, and, returning to its lair, feeds him to its young, who suck Ortnit out through his armour. VIII. (576‚Äì597) The hound returns to court, and the queen eventually realises that Ortnit is not following it and must be dead. This is confirmed when a vassal follows the hound to where Ortnit was killed. For two years the queen mourns and, is spite of the urging of the court, refuses to remarry unless it's to the knight who avenges Ortnit. For her refusal she is deprived of her wealth and imprisoned in a tower. The margrave takes pity on her and offers to avenge Ortnit, but only once he has a grown son to be his heir. Meanwhile, he sends food and wine to her in the tower. The story concludes with the remark that we will have to wait a long time for the dragon to be killed, as the killer has not yet been born, he who will later be the grandfather of Dietrich of Verona. =Ortnit D= This version follows that of Ortnit A up to the point where the dragons are terrorising the country, at which point it concludes. It is followed in the manuscript and prints with the story of Hugdietrich's bride quest, which then leads into the story of Wolfdietrich, which, in this version, includes Ortnit's pursuit of the dragon and his death. After telling of Wolfdietrich's youth, the story introduces the emperor Ortnit, who is told by one of his courtiers of Hugdietrich, King of Greece, and his three sons, who do no fealty to Ortnit. Ortnit sends twelve counts to Hugdietrich to demand tribute. Although the sons threaten to resist violently any claim for tribute, Hugdietrich, in order to save lives, pays in gold. However, Wolfdietrich warns that when he is full grown he will challenge Ortnit. After Wolfdietrich has married Sigeminne, he decides to follow up his earlier threat to challenge Ortnit. He defeats Ortnit in battle, the two are then reconciled. When Sigeminne is abducted, Ortnit offers to help and they succeed in rescuing her. Ortnit returns home to find his land being terrorised by two dragons and two giants, Velle and his wife Runze. After killing the giants, he sets out to kill the dragons, but after he has killed the first with the help of an elephant, he mysteriously falls asleep. He wakes up to find himself being carried off by the dragon, and in spite of his attempts to resist he is smashed against a tree and killed. Origins While the earliest manuscripts of Ortnit date from the 14th century, the language of the poem suggests composition around 1230 in an Upper German dialect. The name Machorel and the castle of Muntabur seem to be borrowed from the campaign of 1217 in the Fifth Crusade against Sultan al-Malek al-Adel and his fortress at Mount Tabor. Attempts to derive the story or the figure of Ortnit from Germanic myth or historical personages have not been successful. The many German bride-quest stories, which include Ortnit, K√∂nig Rother, Orendel and Salman und Morolf, have their roots in late Merovingian history: chronicles contain a number of self-contained bride-quest stories, based ultimately on the Frankish King Clovis I's wooing of Clotilde in 472. All involve a hero travelling to a foreign country to win a bride. The name Ortnit is cognate with the name Hertni√∞ shared by five different characters in the √ûi√∞reks saga, one of whom is defeated in a battle against a dragon. This suggests a variety of possibly unconnected Ortnit/Hertni√∞ stories were circulating in Northern Germany. The figure of Ortnit's uncle, Ilias, is thought to be derived from the Russian folk hero Ilya Muromets. Northern Germany is the obvious location for the integration of such a character into an Ortnit story. A parallel with the chanson de geste Huon de Bordeaux has also been noted: in Huon the hero is aided by Auberon, a dwarf with supernatural powers, whose name is cognate with Alberich. Taken together, all these suggest a geographical origin in Northwest Germany, but the story seems to have been constructed from a variety of elements, not simply retelling an \\"Ortnit-saga\\". It is unclear whether the bride-quest and dragon-killing stores first became linked in the Northwest or in Southern Germany, though it seems possible that Ortnit's failure to kill the dragon was necessitated only when his story was linked with Wolfdietrich. Form and structure Ortnit and Wolfdietrich are both written in a strophic form called the Hildebrandston (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the Nibelungenlied and Kudrun). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three feet with a feminine ending, a caesura, then three feet with a rhymed masculine ending. The strophes are marked in the manuscripts by a Lombardic capital. In the printed Heldenb√ºcher, the Hildebrandston is transformed into the Heunenweise, an eight-line strophe: the long-line is split at the caesura and unrhymed line-endings are given rhymes, with the resulting rhyme scheme ABABCDCD . This necessarily involved considerable rewriting of the text: Editions  * (Includes editions of all versions of the poem, with detailed introductions.) *(Reprinted Georg Olms, Hildesheim, 1966) * (MS y, Lienhart Scheubels Heldenbuch) (MS k in current usage, not the Heidelberg MS K.)

The parish includes the hamlets of Bindon, Lower Chipley, Lower Wellisford, Ramsey and Runnington. The parish has a population of 535. Langford Budville has a few basic facilities; like most villages it has a church (St Peter's), a public house (The Martlet), and a school (Langford Budville Church of England Primary) There is also a hotel.Bindon House Hotel History The parishes of Langford Budville and Runnington were part of the Milverton Hundred, In the 1830s the Grand Western Canal was built which included the construction of Harpford Bridge at Langford Budville; a new warehouse was also built. Places of interest Bindon House has 17th-century origins but received a new front in the 19th century. Around 1865 the west wing and entrance porch were added, and around 1880 the Flemish gables and east wing were added. The east wing was demolished in the 1930s. The porch gable end of the south front has square pilasters with a crest of the Warre family. The property was purchased by Henry Warre in 1862, having previously been tenanted by relatives of Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister murdered in 1812. The church of St Peter dates from the 15th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. Until 1863 Langford Budville was a chapelry of Milverton, and in 1930 Runnington was united with the benefice. The small Church of St Peter and St Paul at Runnington is of a similar age. The cloth finishing works at Tone Mill is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. Nearby is the Langford Heathfield Site of Special Scientific Interest. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non- metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of Taunton Deane, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Wellington Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Taunton Deane county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. References * Without Consent by Philip Mantle and Carl Nagatis, (2002).

It is considered a leading American health care provider, as its flagship facilities have ranked in U.S. News & World Report \\"Honor Roll\\" of the approximately 15 to 20 best hospitals in America for over 15 years. As of 2016, flagship hospital, UPMC Presbyterian is ranked 12th nationally among the best hospitals (and first in Pennsylvania) by U.S. News & World Report and ranked in 15 of 16 specialty areas when including UPMC Magee- Hospital. This does not include UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh which ranked in the top 10 of pediatric centers in a separate US News ranking. History A mid-1920s plan for the new university medical center that would be located adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh's campus and medical school =Origins= Eye and Ear, Presbyterian, and Women's Hospitals circa 1943 UPMC has its roots in the 1893 establishment of Presbyterian Hospital, which serves as the medical center's flagship facility, and the 1886 founding of the Western Pennsylvania Medical College. Soon after its founding, the medical college became affiliated with the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1892, and in 1908, was fully integrated into the university which that same year was renamed to the University of Pittsburgh. Already having worked out informal agreements for teaching and staffing privileges with a number of local hospitals, Pitt and its School of Medicine desired to establish an academic medical center, and by the mid-1920s had formed a plan with a coalition of city hospitals to have them relocate to the Oakland neighborhood of the city that the university had itself moved to in 1909. The University provided Presbyterian Hospital, then located on the North Side, with a tract of land on its campus for construction of a new hospital which broke ground in 1930 and was subsequently opened in 1938. By the end of the 1930s, the University of Pittsburgh had helped to form the \\"University Medical Center\\" which included Falk Clinic, Children's, Eye and Ear, Libby Steele Magee, Presbyterian General, and Women's Hospital, as well as the planned Municipal Hospital. In 1949, a new affiliation agreement between the University and Presbyterian Hospital established a three-tiered mission of patient care, research, and education and by 1951, the hospital name changed to Presbyterian University Hospital in order to reflect its close ties with the University of Pittsburgh. In 1958, the \\"University of Pittsburgh Health Center\\" was noted to comprise (1) Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing, and the Graduate School of Public Health; (2) Presbyterian, Woman's, Children's, Eye and Ear, and Magee Hospitals; and (3) Falk Clinic, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Child Guidance Center, Salk Hall, and Central Blood Bank. Through the years, the University and the hospitals moved toward an ever-tightening alliance. In 1965, the University, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic which was managed by the School of Medicine, Presbyterian-University, Magee and Women's, Eye and Ear, and Children's Hospitals incorporated the University Health Center of Pittsburgh (UHCP). In 1969, Montefiore Hospital joined UHCP. In the 1970s, a new model of administration, in which clinical revenues were invested into research, was implemented at Western Psychiatric under the leadership of Thomas Detre. After guiding the psychiatric institute to become one of the largest recipients of National Institute of Health funding, Detre assumed leadership overseeing all six of the University's schools of health sciences in the early 1980s. Implementing the same administrative model in those units, the collective schools of the health sciences and medical center were ultimately transformed into one of the largest centers for biomedical research in the nation. =Merger and expansion= The seal of the University of Pittsburgh has previously been incorporated into the UPMC logo, and can be found on buildings and directional markers in and around various UPMC campuses, particularly those adjacent to the university Beginning in 1986, members of the University Health Center including Presbyterian University Hospital, Falk Clinic, the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and Eye & Ear Hospital began to consolidate. The consolidated group, re-termed the Medical and Health Care Division (MHCD) and led by Detre, became closely linked administratively, although Presbyterian University Hospital remained a separate entity. In 1990, MHCD acquired neighboring Montefiore Hospital which it merged with Presbyterian University Hospital to form the entity that was then renamed as the \\"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\\" (shortened to UPMC), which was the first time the current name of the medical center was officially used. UPMC then began to form a network of affiliated specialty and community hospitals in 1994 termed the Tri-State Health System and established a for-profit health insurance division, UPMC Health Plan, which contracted with these hospitals. In 1996, UPMC had moved to acquire South Side, Aliquippa and Braddock hospitals. Meanwhile, UPMC began to merge with several of the already affiliated Tri- State hospitals including St. Margaret Memorial, Shadyside, and Passavant hospitals in 1997 and Magee- Hospital in 1998. The acquisition and mergers of hospitals morphed the Tri-State Health System into a consolidation of hospitals that currently makes up a significant portion of the UPMC health system. Due to its immense growth of the medical center, as well as the University's concerns regarding the financial risks associated with its faculty practice plans in the face of national changes in health care reimbursements, the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC restructured their relationship and legally separated in 1998 thus launching UPMC as an independent nonprofit corporation with the University identified as a supported organization in its articles of incorporation. The University consolidated its physicians' practice plans and transferred them, along with the university's hospital management functions, to UPMC, with UPMC providing ongoing financial support to the University and its academic missions in return. The result was a mutually exclusive partnership of close affiliation formalized by a series of interrelated agreements and mutual executive oversights, which includes the sharing of numerous board members. This created a collaborative and coordinated decision-making model in which UPMC oversees all clinical activity, while the University of Pittsburgh remains the guardian of all academic priorities, particularly faculty-based research. Expansion of UPMC continued in 2001 as Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh began merging with UPMC. Since then, UPMC's growth has continued, including a merger with Mercy Hospital in 2008; the opening of new Children's Hospital facilities in 2009; the integrations of Hamot Medical Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 2011, Altoona Regional Health System in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 2013, and Jameson Health System in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 2016; along with the continued expansion of overseas operations and for-profit business ventures. In October 2016, Susquehanna Health, a four hospital system in north central Pennsylvania, became the first domestic hospital outside Western Pennsylvania to join the UPMC system. Subsequently, UPMC Susquehanna merged with two additional community hospitals in October of the following year. In December 2016, WCA Hospital of Jamestown, New York became the first domestic hospital outside of Pennsylvania in the UPMC system. In September 2017, Pinnacle Health, a seven hospital system in South Central Pennsylvania, merged with UPMC and concurrently merged with Hanover Hospital. Cole Memorial hospital partnered with UPMC Susquehanna and merged with the UPMC system in March, 2018. Somerset Hospital, located in Somerset, Pennsylvania, merged with UPMC on February 1, 2019. On February 3, 2020, Western Maryland Health System became the first Maryland hospital to join the UPMC system. UPMC now operates over 35 academic, community, and specialty hospitals in Pennsylvania and New York, as well as over 600 outpatient sites and doctors' offices, more than 50 facilities for physical, occupational, speech and specialty therapies, and 14 retirement and long-term care site, along with its international and for- profit ventures. =Notable physicians and researchers= Among the more renowned individuals who have worked with the University of Pittsburgh's medical center through its history are Jonas Salk who developed the polio vaccine while at the University of Pittsburgh, pediatric psychoanalyst Benjamin Spock, Peter Safar who pioneered CPR and the world's first intensive care training program at the medical center, and surgeon Thomas Starzl who perfected organ transplantation there.

UPMC contributed $887million, or more than 15 percent of its net patient revenue, to community services in Fiscal Year 2013, and provides more care to the most underserved areas than any other health care institution in the region. Criticism and controversies UPMC has been criticized for excessive profits, monopolistic practices, excessive advertising budgets, and focusing on overseas operations at the expense of domestic ones. In addition, various controversies have received significant local and national attention in recent years. In 2008, the administration and reporting of UPMC's living donor liver transplantation program received national attention when internal studies, spearheaded by transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl, questioned the safety of the procedure and ultimately resulted in the forced resignation of liver transplant program head, Amadeo Marcos. Another controversy arose in May 2011 for UPMC's live-donor kidney transplant program when a kidney infected with hepatitis C was transplanted into a non- infected person. The incident led UPMC to voluntarily shut down its kidney transplant program for two months, and resulted in the suspension of a nurse and demotion of a surgeon. Federal reviewers with United Network for Organ Sharing concluded human error at fault for the oversight and corrective plans that included multiple redundancies were instituted with oversight from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Because of the botched living donor kidney transplant at UPMC, the federal Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) put UPMC's transplant program on probation, a rarely used form of discipline handed down for some of the most serious transplant errors. The OPTN said it meted out the discipline not only because of the kidney transplant error, but because UPMC's transplant program was found to have problems in its communication and documentation procedures before. In April 2009, rival West Penn Allegheny Health System filed an antitrust lawsuit against the UPMC and health insurer Highmark, claiming a conspiracy to create a monopoly. The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice. West Penn Allegheny filed an appeal of this judgment. Upon appeal, the case was unanimously reinstated by the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2009, UPMC's administration decision to close UPMC Braddock hospital resulted in multiple protest and lawsuits by community groups who disputed UPMC's claims that the hospital was losing money and was underutilized. The facility, now demolished in preparation for redevelopment, closed in January 2010. In April 2013, UPMC has been criticized for paying low wages,Group says UPMC wage scale is harmful - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Post-gazette.com (2013-08-22).

Post-gazette.com (2013-04-11). Retrieved on 2013-09-04. In March 2013, the City of Pittsburgh filed a lawsuit in Federal court challenging the tax exempt status of UPMC as a public charity, in an effort to make UPMC to pay back taxes. The city alleged that UPMC has abused its status to avoid paying property taxes.Pittsburgh lawsuit challenges UPMC's tax status - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Post-gazette.com (2013-03-21). Retrieved on 2013-09-04. The city dropped its lawsuit in 2014. In February 2019, the Pennsylvania Attorney General submitted legal actions against UPMC to enforce requirements for open health care access based on the non-profit status of UPMC. These actions stem from a long-standing dispute between Highmark Health and UPMC, the largest two health-care providers in Western PA. In 2011, Highmark entered a partnership with West Penn Hospital System (now Allegheny Health Network). Because of this competitive threat, UPMC declared they would not accept Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance. In order to protect public access to health care while agreements between the two systems unwound, both UPMC and Highmark Health accepted a state-brokered consent decree. With the consent decree expiring in 2019, the Pennsylvania Attorney General attempted to negotiate continued access to care with both companies. Highmark indicated that it would accept the terms while UPMC did not. It is the failure to accept the proposal that the PA Attorney General cited as leading to the legal actions of February 2019.< UPMC then counter sued the Attorney General in federal court claiming his actions were \\"anti-competitive\\" and violate federal regulations and due process rights, while accusing him of \\"intervening in a high-profile matter solely to advance his own political goals.\\" In June 2019, UPMC and Highmark reached a deal for a 10-year contract to maintain access across both health systems and all lawsuits that had been brought by the Attorney General, UPMC, and Highmark were subsequently dropped. In popular culture The television medical dramas Heartland (2007) and Three Rivers (2009) were largely based on UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh's Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute. In both cases the hospitals are fictionalized, but in the latter series UPMC is also specifically referred to as another Pittsburgh-area hospital.

North Curry Meadow () is a 1.3 hectare (3.1 acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, notified in 1989. History The parish was part of the North Curry Hundred. North Curry was settled in Saxon times and was a royal manor in the 11th century. Around 1194, Richard the Lionheart (Richard I of England) deeded North Curry over to the Bishop of Wells, along with other possessions, in exchange for cash to pay off his ransom to the Austrian Emperor, Henry VI. North Curry parish traditionally included the hamlets of Helland, Knapp, Lillesdon, Moredon, Newport and Wrantage. In 1231 Henry III granted a licence for the Bishop of Bath and Wells to deforest the manor of North Curry and enclose the lands as parks. Reclamation of the surrounding moors before 1311 allowed the village to expand. A market village since the 13th century, North Curry's sources of wealth have included hunting, fishing, and wool trade, with access to other markets via the nearby River Tone. Evidence of the prosperity of the village can be seen in the exemplary architecture, including 68 listed buildings.North Curry: A Place in History, by Angela Dix, The course of the Chard Canal, now disused, runs across the south of the parish before entering Crimson Hill tunnel.

Saint-Quentin and Kedgwick are other towns along the route. With the exception of those towns, the highway runs almost entirely through sparsely populated forest land. It is the only highway connecting northwestern New Brunswick with the province's north shore.  History  Over several decades, Route 17 has received several upgrades, and new sections of road built, to improve safety. These upgrades have been designed to meet present-day standards, including flatter grades, creation of more passing lanes, upgrades to guard rail requirements and increased shoulder widths. Some examples of these, have been the new alignments of the highway north of Saint-Leonard, or the bypassing of Dawsonville, west of Campbellton.  Route description  Route 17's northern terminus is at a T intersection with Route 11 in Glencoe (Route 17 is a continuation of the Route 11 direct right of way.) It runs southwesterly from there, passing through the communities of Glen Levit, and Squaw Cap. Between the two communities, is a new section of highway, opened in the early 2000s bypassing Dawsonville, and adhering to modern highway standards. After roughly 19 kilometres, Route 17 crosses the Upsalquitch River, and passes through Robinsonville, before climbing Upsalquitch Hill. With an 11% grade, it is the steepest arterial highway grade in the province. Atop of the hill, the road passes through Glenwood. Southwest of Glenwood, the highway descends and then climbs back up Adams Gulch, while passing through the community of the same name. After running west in the wilderness for almost 10 kilometres, Route 17 passes through Menneval, then Saint-Jean-Baptiste, before heading through Kedgwick, where there is a sharp 90 degree turn. Once past Kedgwick, Route 17 turns south, due for the town of Saint-Quentin. After Saint-Quentin, the highway heads in a southwesterly manner once more and heads through wilderness, with only J.D. Irving's Sawmill in Veneer, in that stretch of woods. Approximately 50 kilometres later, Route 17 hits civilization in Saint- Leonard-Parent, nearing its southern terminus. Roughly 10 kilometres to the southwest, the highway reaches the town of Saint-Leonard. Passing under the Trans-Canada Highway, Route 17 continues to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, where it reaches it southern terminus. The speed limit varies throughout the route, from 50 km/h in Kedgwick and Saint-Quentin, to 90 km/h, on many rural and uninhabited stretches.

Despite being below 2,000 ft it is the highest point for about 5 miles in any direction; a consequence of the curious fact that the centre of the district is lower than the surrounding parts. Topography The main watershed of the Central Fells runs north-south, with Bleaberry Fell forming the northern end of the ridge. High Seat is the next fell to the south, before the land falls to High Tove. High Seat sends out the spur of Dodd to the north west, separated from the body of the fell by Ashness Gill ‚Äî a feeder of Watendlath Beck. Oddly, by the time the Gill reaches the famed viewpoint of Ashness Bridge, it has actually become Barrow Beck. The western flank here is clad in broadleaved woodland, but further south along Watendlath Beck this gives way to rock. Reecastle Crag being the principal face. The southern boundary of the fell is formed by Raise Gill on the western side of the ridge and Shoulthwaite Gill in the east. To say that they drain The Peewits ‚Äî the hideous bog on the ridge to High Tove ‚Äî would be untrue, but they are fed by it. Shoulthwaite Gill does not head due east for Thirlmere as might be expected, but turns due north to form the eastern boundary. It is cut off from the reservoir by the lower parallel ridge of Raven Crag and High Rigg and instead makes a beeline for the River Greta. Mere Gill, one of its many tributaries forms the north eastern edge of High Seat. This flows from a point on the ridge to Bleaberry Fell which bears the name of Threefooted Brandreth: (a brandreth being the word for a three-legged stand in an oven on which a griddle was placed when cakes etc. were baked.) Litt's Memorial Below Threefooted Brandreth on the eastern slope, sitting on a shallow saddle above Mere Ghyll is the Litt's Memorial. On 9 March 1880 John Litt was following the Blencathra Foxhounds when he inexplicably fell behind and failed to return. A search party found his body at that place the following day. As recorded in the \\"English Lakes Visitor and Keswick Guardian\\" for March 1880: > Man found dead on the mountains ‚Äì Early on Wednesday morning it was reported > that two men, named John Litt and John Vickers, who had been following the > Blencathra hounds the previous day had not returned. Litt had been last seen > on the bog about 200 yards west of Raven Crag where he had been, with other, > resting and watching the hounds in the valley below. ‚Ä¶ Although he seemed > somewhat fatigued he did not complain, and the hunters, absorbed in the > chase did not look behind. When his absence from home was known a number of > willing volunteers went to search for him. ‚Ä¶ Mr David Powley at once > proceeded to Mr Oliver, the shepherd on Castlerigg Fell, who probably was > the last person in Litt‚Äôs company, and the two immediately struck for the > point where Mr Oliver parted from the deceased. They took a dog with them > and it found the body not fifteen yards from the place they were making to. > The searchers were: Messrs C. C. Thompson, Thos. Hodgson (Station Road), J. > W. Grisdale, Thos. Harrison, David Powley, Joseph Bouch, Geo. Atkinson, > Isaac Wren, Joseph Bristo, Benjamin Hodgson, A. G. Pettit, and Wm. Wood. The memorial consists of two upright stones, one bearing a round plate inscribed 'In memory of J Litt who died March 9, 1880'. The second stone bears a faint inscription. Geology The summit is covered by peat, overlying the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation. There is a small bed of volcaniclastic sandstone to the south while the northern slopes are predominantly garnet-bearing porphyritic andesite.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit The upper part of the fell, in excess of a mile square, is soft, peaty and drab. The exception is the ridge itself, which is considerably wetter. A fence runs along the ridge, a useful guide in mist and occasionally necessary for bog bouncing. The summit is set on a small rock platform with an Ordnance Survey column. A rocky knoll (called Man) stands on the other side of the fence. The views are extensive due to the central location and a lack of higher neighbours. The Helvellyn range is seen end to end, together with a panorama of high fells on the other side of the ridge from Crinkle Crags in the south to Blencathra in the north.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Ascents By parking near Ashness Bridge on the road to Watendlath, access to the western side of the ridge can be gained at high level. Ashness Gill can be followed upwards through increasingly wet country until a final bee-line is made for the summit. From further up the road at the base of Reecastle Crag a more direct line is possible, or the climb can be made from Watendlath itself, first ascending High Tove via the zig-zags. The direct ascent noted by Wainwright from the hamlet appears to have access problems. Eastern approaches begin on the A591 at Rough How Bridge, making a start along the secluded valley of Shoulthwaite before heading up the fellside in the vicinity of Mere Gill.

The village has a population of 3,046. History The village is on the southern slope of Norton Camp, a large hillfort that shows evidence of occupation from neolithic times, through the Bronze Age, to the Roman occupation of Britain. The Church of All Saints dates from the late 13th and early 14th century. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. The parish of Norton Fitzwarren was part of the Taunton Deane Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of Taunton Deane, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Taunton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Taunton Deane county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Military connections Entrance to Norton Manor Camp, home of 40 Commando, Royal Marines =PoW Camp= It was the location of a 300-person Prisoner of War camp during World War II, initially housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners after the Battle of Normandy. POW Camp Number 665 - 'Cross Keys Camp', Norton Fitzwarren. =Royal Marines= Just north of the village is Norton Manor Camp, home of 40 Commando, Royal Marines. For many years it was the base of Junior Leaders Battalion, Royal Army Service Corps (until 1965 when RASC was disbanded) which became Junior Leaders Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport. From the early 1960s to the late 1970s, it took boys from age 15 yrs to age 17¬Ω years and trained them to be army transport drivers. Industry Norton Fitzwarren is located on the confluence of many fast flowing local water flows, and from the 1700s onwards became the base for many water-powered weaving mills, and after the riots in London, also many Silk Mills, which gave part of the area its name. For many years Norton Fitzwarren was the site of the main factory of the Taunton Cider Company producing cider brands such as Blackthorn Cider. Production was moved to Shepton Mallet after Matthew Clark plc, the UK division of Constellation Brands, bought Taunton Cider in 1995. Transport A former-GWR Autocoach is propelled (by GWR 4575 Class 5542) to the new station on the heritage-West Somerset Railway New housing in Station Road, on the site of the former Taunton Cider Company works Norton Fitzwarren was the site of a boat lift on the now disused section of the Grand Western Canal from 1839 to 1867. Norton Fitzwarren is on the former Bristol and Exeter Railway mainline, which was operated and then taken over by the GWR in 1890. The station became an important junction station, with branch lines to and diverging at this point. Resultantly, the station had two island platforms creating four platforms. There were also extensive freight handling facilities, as the station was located west of the Fairwater Yard, a large regional freight yard located south of the mainline. During World War II, the United States Army took over Norton Manor Camp located immediately northwest of the station, and equipped it with extensive railway sidings, all connected to the station. The first major railway accident occurred on 10 November 1890, and the second on 4 November 1940, which killed 13 Royal Navy personnel who were working at the camp. In 2018 a plaque honouring the victims of both crashes was unveiled in the village. Norton Fitzwarren station closed in 1966, the same year that the British Army supply depot closed. Taunton Cider took over the former goods yard to the north of the site, but this also closed in the early 1990s, and has been redeveloped as housing. Most of the former Minehead branch is now operated by the West Somerset Railway as a heritage railway.

The Nynehead Hollow is another prominent landmark in the village. It is believed that the \\"Hollow\\" was dug out by the Sandford family in the hope of making Nynehead Court quicker to get to from the servant houses which were situated in east Nynehead. Religious sites The church, dedicated to All Saints, is a small structure built of mostly of local red Permo-Triassic rock, probably on the site of an earlier church, with a square tower containing five bells. The interior of the church contains some monuments to the Sandford family of Nynehead Court. Sandford family The best known member of the Sandford family is probably the Reverend John Sandford, who was vicar of Nynehead from 1811 to 1834. From 1819 he was largely an absentee clergyman living in Italy, where he made a controversial marriage to Elizabeth Georgiana Morgan, who had been divorced in scandalous circumstances by her first husband, Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry, after admitting to adultery with a neighbour.

Originally known by the abbreviation ‚ÄúNJV‚Äù (New Jewish Version), it is now styled as ‚ÄúNJPS.‚Äù Tanakh, the new JPS translation The translation follows the Hebrew or Masoretic text scrupulously, taking a conservative approach regarding conjectural emendations: It avoids them completely for the Torah, but mentions them occasionally in footnotes for Nevi'im and Ketuvim. Attested variants from other ancient versions are also mentioned in footnotes, even for the Torah, in places where the editors thought they might shed light on difficult passages in the Masoretic text. The order of the books is as found in published Tanakhim, rather than that of common English Bibles. In particular, it follows the traditional Jewish division into Torah (the five books of Moses), Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings). Furthermore, the division into chapters follows the conventions established by printers of the Hebrew text, which occasionally differs from English Bibles. In the Psalms, for instance, the titles are often counted as the first verse, causing a difference of one in verse numbering for these Psalms with respect to other English Bibles. The editor in chief of the Torah was Harry Orlinsky, who had been a translator of the Revised Standard Version and would become the only translator of that version to work also on the New Revised Standard Version. The other editors were E. A. Speiser and H. L. Ginsberg. Associated with them were three rabbis: Max Arzt, Bernard Jacob Bamberger, and Harry Freedman, representing the Conservative, Reform, and Orthodox branches of organized Jewish religious life. Solomon Grayzel, editor of the Jewish Publication Society, served as secretary of the committee. The Torah appeared in 1962, with a second edition in 1967. The Five Megilloth (Five Scrolls) and Jonah appeared in 1969, the Book of Isaiah in 1973 and the Book of Jeremiah in 1974. Revised versions of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Jonah appeared in Nevi'im (1978), edited by Professor Ginsberg assisted by Professor Orlinsky. A separate committee was set up in 1966 to translate Ketuvim. It consisted of Moshe Greenberg, Jonas Greenfield and Nahum Sarna. The Psalms appeared in 1973 and the Book of Job in 1980. Revised versions of both, and the Megilloth, appeared in the complete Ketuvim in 1982. The 1985 edition listed the Ketuvim translation team as also including Saul Leeman, Chaim Potok, Martin Rozenberg, and David Shapiro. Since 2017, the bilingual Hebrew- English edition of the JPS Tanakh (1985 translation) has been digitalized and is available online for free on the website Sefaria. Revisions * The first one-volume edition of the NJPS translation of the entire Hebrew Bible was published in 1985 under the title Tanakh. It incorporates a thorough revision of the translation's sections previously issued individually. * A third edition of The Torah (the first section of the NJPS Tanakh) was published in 1992. * A bilingual Hebrew-English edition of the full Hebrew Bible, in facing columns, was published in 1999. It includes the second edition of the NJPS Tanakh translation (which supersedes the 1992 Torah) and the Masoretic Hebrew text as found in the Leningrad Codex. * The recent series of JPS Bible commentaries all use the NJPS translation. * The Jewish Study Bible, published in 2003, contains the NJPS translation in one volume with introductions, notes, and supplementary material. Oxford University Press, * The Contemporary Torah: A Gender-Sensitive Adaptation of the JPS Translation, published in 2006, includes the Five Books of Moses and a supplementary ‚ÄúDictionary of Gender in the Torah.‚Äù Its version of NJPS, which goes by the abbreviation CJPS, is ‚Äúcontemporary‚Äù in its use of gendered language only where germane, and in its drawing upon recent scholarship about gender roles in the ancient Near East. With regard to human beings, the CJPS adaptation sets out to represent the gender implications of the Torah's language as its composer(s) counted on the original audience to receive them, given the gender assumptions of that time and place. With regard to God, the CJPS adaptation employs gender-neutral language except where certain poetic passages invoke gendered imagery. Adoption by Jewish denominations The NJPS is the basis of the translation used in the official Torah commentaries of both Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism. Jews in Reconstructionist Judaism and the Chavurah movement also use both Reform and Conservative Torah commentaries, so the NJPS is effectively the primary translation for all forms of English-speaking Judaism outside of Orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Jews use a wider variety of translations, but many use the NJPS as well. * The Torah: A Modern Commentary, the Humash published by the Reform Movement in 1974‚Äì1980, with a one-volume edition in 1981, includes the NJPS translation. :A revised edition of this work was issued in 2005, which includes a version of the NJPS translation for the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy, newly adapted for gender accuracy. (The translations of Genesis, and the prophetic books in this edition, come from a different source.) * \\"Etz Hayim Humash,\\" the Humash published by the Conservative Movement in 2001, incorporates the NJPS translation (with minor modifications). All of these Jewish denominations use their respective Torah commentaries non-exclusively. Within their synagogue libraries, and in use in their adult education classes, one also may find a wide variety of other Torah commentaries, including many from Orthodox Jewish authors and editors. Usage * The JPS Torah Translation and excerpts from Prophets is used in The Torah: A Modern Commentary, the Commentary of the Reform Movement. * The JPS Torah Translation, excerpts from Prophets, and an edited version of its 5-volume Torah and 1-volume Haftorah Commentaries are used in the Etz Hayim, the Commentary of the Conservative Movement. * The JPS TANAKH Translation is used in the Oxford University Press Jewish Study Bible. * The JPS TANAKH has been selected as the official Bible for the International Bible Contest. * The JPS TANAKH has been selected as the official Jewish version to be used in its ‚ÄúBible as Literature‚Äù curriculum for American public schools as well as its Jewish Bible website. * The JPS TANAKH was selected by Quality Paperback Book Club for its ‚ÄúOld Testament‚Äù edition in its 5-volume Sacred Writings Series.

Biography Wright was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, the son of a merchant and a pillar of the local Unitarian church.Edward H. Madden, Chauncey Wright and the Foundations of Pragmatism. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1963, p. 3. With financial help from a benefactor, Wright attended Harvard, where his reading of Ralph Waldo Emerson led him to abandon his youthful Unitarianism. In 1852 he graduated from Harvard and became a computer to the Nautical Almanac. In college, he was mainly interested in science and mathematics. In the 1850s, however, he began reading philosophers such as Francis Bacon, John Stuart Mill, and William Hamilton, and he became a frequent contributor to the North American Review and the Nation, becoming a well-known defender of Darwinism and a critic of the English philosopher and social theorist Herbert Spencer. In 1870-71 he lectured on psychology at Harvard. Although he was best known to the reading public as a defender of Darwinism, he was an eclectic free-lancer in thought. Among his essays may be mentioned \\"The Evolution of Self- Consciousness\\" (1873) and two articles on evolution published in the early 1870s. Of these, the former endeavors to explain the most elaborate psychical activities of men as developments of elementary forms of conscious processes in the animal kingdom as a whole; the latter is a defense of the theory of natural selection against the attacks of St George Mivart and Alfred Russel Wallace. From 1863 to 1870 he was secretary and recorder to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in the last year of his life he lectured on mathematical physics at Harvard. He never married and was subject to periodic bouts of depression and alcoholism.Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 14. He died of a stroke just after his forty-fifth birthday.Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 29. Following his death, his close friend Charles Eliot Norton spoke of his great devotion to truth and his eagerness to hear criticisms of his own views. \\"To argue with him,\\" Norton wrote, \\"was a moral no less than an intellectual discipline.\\"Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 30. In 1872, Wright helped found The Metaphysical Club with other Harvard intellectuals such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His views on Darwinism played a significant role in shaping the ideas of the other members of the club., note 2 Religiously, Wright was an agnostic, arguing that we should suspend judgment on the existence of God because there is no firm evidence either way.Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 31. William James's famous will-to- believe argument was partly aimed at Wright's brand of agnosticism.Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 48 In ethics, he embraced utilitarianism, agreeing with John Stuart Mill that pleasures differ in quality as well as quantity. He was a staunch critic of Herbert Spencer's attempt to extend Darwinism into a law of cosmic and social progress. Like Mill and Auguste Comte, Wright embraced a positivistic approach to science that rejects the possibility (or even meaningfulness) of metaphysics.Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 91. His claim that scientific principles are \\"working hypotheses\\" influenced John Dewey and other later pragmatists. Wright's claim that science is metaphysically neutral (being uncommitted to naturalism, idealism, or any other general philosophical worldview or ontology) is seen by some as Wright's central contribution to philosophy.Madden, Chauncey Wright, p. 92. His essays were collected and published, with a biographical sketch, by Charles Eliot Norton in 1877, and his Letters were edited and privately printed at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1878 by James Bradley Thayer.

He is considered to have founded the French violin school. His brothers Jean-Marie Leclair the younger (1703‚Äì77), Pierre Leclair (1709‚Äì84) and Jean-Beno√Æt Leclair (1714‚Äìafter 1759) were also musicians. Biography Leclair was born in Lyon, but left to study dance and the violin in Turin. In 1716, he married Marie-Rose Casthanie, a dancer, who died about 1728. Leclair had returned to Paris in 1723, where he played at the Concert Spirituel, the main semi-public music series. His works included several sonatas for flute and basso continuo. In 1730, Leclair married for the second time. His new wife was the engraver Louise Roussel, who prepared for printing all his works from Opus 2 onward. Named ordinaire de la musique by Louis XV in 1733, Leclair resigned in 1737 after a clash with Guidon over control of the musique du Roy. Leclair was then engaged by the Princess of Orange ‚Äì a fine harpsichordist and former student of Handel ‚Äì and from 1738 until 1743, served three months annually at her court in Leeuwarden, working in The Hague as a private for the remainder of the year. He returned to Paris in 1743. His only opera Scylla et Glaucus was first performed in 1746 and has been revived in modern times. From 1740 until his death in Paris, he served the Duke of Gramont, in whose private theatre at Puteaux were staged works to which Leclair is known to have contributed. They included, in particular, a lengthy divertissement for the comedy (1749) and one complete entr√©e, , for the op√©ra-ballet by various authors, (1750).Pougin, p. 206; Sadler, p. 1118. Leclair was renowned as a violinist and as a composer. He successfully drew upon all of Europe's national styles. Many suites, sonatas, and concertos survive along with his opera, while some vocal works, ballets, and other stage music are lost. Murder In 1758, after the break-up of his second marriage, Leclair purchased a small house in a dangerous Parisian neighborhood in the northern part of Le Marais near the old Temple, where he was found stabbed to death on October 23, 1764. Although the murder remains a mystery, there is a possibility that his ex-wife may have been behind it ‚Äì her motive being financial gain ‚Äì although the strongest suspicion rests on his nephew, Guillaume-Fran√ßois Vial.

Cambria Farm which is now the site of a Park and ride close to Junction 25 of the M5 motorway was the site of a Bronze and Iron Age settlement and Roman farm. The tithings of Ruishton and Henlade formed part of the manor of Taunton Deane from the 9th century. The parish of Ruishton was part of the Taunton Deane Hundred. Henlade House was built between 1805 and 1815, by an unidentified Italian architect for John Proctor Anderdon. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

They originally consisted of Peggy DeCastro (1921‚Äì2004), Cherie DeCastro (1922‚Äì2010) and Babette DeCastro (1925‚Äì1992). When Babette retired in 1958, a cousin, Olgita DeCastro Marino (1931‚Äì2000), replaced her and when Peggy later left the group to go solo, Babette re-joined Cherie and Olgita. Peggy eventually returned and Babette once more retired. History The DeCastro Sisters began as a Latin- flavored trio and were protegees of Carmen Miranda. They eventually became more Americanized in their performances and added comedy. The biggest hit single for the group was \\"Teach Me Tonight\\", in 1954. The song reached No. 2 in the United States, and the follow-up, \\"Boom Boom Boomerang (song)Boom Boom Boomerang\\", reached No. 17.Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th edn, 2000 The group is referenced in an episode of The Sopranos, \\"Do Not Resuscitate\\", as one of the only music groups that matriarch Livia actually likes, along with Mario Lanza. The three original DeCastro Sisters ‚Äî Peggy, Cherie and Babette ‚Äî were raised in Havana, Cuba, in a family mansion that was seized by Fidel Castro during the Cuban revolution and is now used as the Chinese Embassy. Their mother, Babette Buchanan, was a Chicago-born Ziegfeld Follies showgirl who married the wealthy Cuban aristocrat Juan Fernandez de Castro, owner of a large sugar plantation in the Dominican Republic, where first daughter Peggy was born. De Castro later developed radio and television in Cuba with David Sarnoff, who was often a guest at their home and was also in charge of a planned project under the Batista regime to build a canal through Cuba, which never materialized. De Castro purchased a co-op apartment at The Dakota in Manhattan, where Cherie Dawn DeCastro was born on September 1, 1922. Youngest daughter Babette was born back in Havana. The De Castro Sisters, always strongly chaperoned, began their singing careers as young girls and patterned themselves as a Cuban version of the Andrews Sisters. They emigrated to Miami in 1942, where they were seen by an agent from General Artists Corporation (now ICM) and booked into the Copacabana in New York with the Will Mastin Trio featuring Sammy Davis Jr. As their careers progressed their act became more flamboyant, and they worked across the country, including at the Palladium in Hollywood, where they sang with Tito Puente's band and made their first recordings. In 1946, they provided several of the bird and animal voices for Walt Disney's animated Song of the South, including the Oscar-winning \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\". They appeared on screen with Carmen Miranda and Groucho Marx in the 1947 film Copacabana, the same year that they joined Bob Hope and Cecil B. DeMille on the live premiere broadcast special launching KTLA in Los Angeles, the first telecast west of the Mississippi. The sisters were introduced by Hope and sang \\"Babalu\\", which was filmed by a Paramount newsreel cameraman and is the only surviving footage of the original three-hour show. In 1954, the more Americanized DeCastro Sisters were signed by a small country label, Abbott Records, and their first release featured \\"It's Love\\" as the A-side, backed by a Sammy Cahn-Gene DePaul song, \\"Teach Me Tonight\\", which had been suggested at the last minute by their bass player. The label was pushing \\"It's Love\\", but Cleveland disc jockey Bill Randall turned the record over and \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" soon became a hit, peaking at No. 2 on the charts and selling more than five million copies. Several more recordings followed, including \\"Too Late Now\\", \\"Boom Boom Boomerang\\", \\"Snowbound For Christmas\\", \\"With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming\\", and numerous albums on a variety of labels including RCA Victor, ABC-Paramount, Capitol, and 20th Century-Fox. Now major headliners, they shared the bill with No√´l Coward when he made his Las Vegas debut at the Desert Inn in 1954, which had one of the most star-studded and publicized opening nights of any show in the town's history. Coward would watch their act every night while waiting to go on himself. They were part of another historic engagement in 1959, when they joined the Las Vegas debuts of George Burns as a solo act and a young singer named Bobby Darin at the Sahara. It was the DeCastros who told Darin that he should record one of the featured songs in his act, \\"Mack the Knife\\"; Darin thought it was just a nightclub number, but he later took their advice. The DeCastro Sisters appeared on most major TV shows including The Ed Sullivan Show and The Perry Como Show. They also made numerous film shorts including Universal's Swingin' and Singin with Maynard Ferguson and Riot in Rhythm with Harry James. At various times Peggy and Babette took leave from the act and were replaced by a cousin Olgita, so Cherie was the only sister who was part of every appearance and recording that the group ever made. In 1988, they made a comeback at Vegas World in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1997, they were part of KTLA's 50th anniversary broadcast in Los Angeles and headlined at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's Cinegrill. Three years later, they were inducted in the Casino Legends Hall of Fame as Las Vegas Living Legends. Cherie continued to perform and sang \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" on the 2004 PBS special My Music: Moments To Remember. Deaths Babette died of cancer in 1992. Olgita died of asthma on February 14, 2000. Peggy died of lung cancer on March 6, 2004 in Las Vegas, at the age of 82. Cherie, the only sister to appear on every recording, film, TV and stage appearance, died of pneumonia on March 14, 2010, at the age of 87.

History Around the crossroads at Staple Fitzpaine there are several large sandstone boulders. They are called devilstones and are said to have been thrown by the Devil from Castle Neroche (some went over Staple to land in the Witch Lodge area, another he tossed back over his shoulder into West Buckland). According to legend if you prick them with a pin they draw blood. English word 'Stapol' means pillar or post and it is thought likely that this gave the village the first part of its name.

The crenellated three-stage tower has merlons pierced with trefoil headed arches set on a quatrefoil pierced parapet. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The church has six bells, the heaviest at 16/17cwt. The no.2 is the oldest, from 1480, and the newest addition is the treble bell which was brought in during the mid 1980s from Chaffcombe church. In 1803 one of the bells was made by Thomas Castleman Bilbie of Cullompton, one of the Bilbie family of bell founders and clock makers. The churchyard is also home to a sandstone cross.

It is headquartered in Fullerton, California, and operates stores under the Vons and Pavilions banners. Before the acquisition by Albertsons, it was owned by Safeway and headquartered in Arcadia, California. History =Beginning= Charles Von der Ahe opened a 20-foot wide store named Von's Groceteria in downtown Los Angeles, California, in 1906. The business had grown to 87 stores by 1928, when he sold the operation to MacMarr Stores. MacMarr was acquired by M.B. Skaggs' Safeway in 1930. In 1932, his sons Theodore and Wilfred restarted the Von's Grocery Company. In 1948, Von's opened a pioneering store which offered self-service, pre-packaged produce, meat, and deli items. By 1958, it had doubled in size to 27 stores, the third- largest grocery chain in the Greater Los Angeles Area In 1960 it acquired the sixth-largest, competitor Shopping Bag, a merger that was challenged by the Federal Trade Commission on antitrust grounds. In 1966 the United States Supreme Court ruled against Von's in United States v. Von's Grocery Co. (384 U.S. 270), forcing a re-divestiture of the stores, which were eventually sold to Fisher Foods. The Von der Ahe family sold the chain to Household Finance Corporation in 1969. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1970, Vons had 128 stores, making it the 2nd largest supermarket chain in southern California behind Safeway. =1980s‚Äìpresent= Exterior of the Vons store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California In 1984, Vons was named official supermarket of the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 1985, William Davila was named president and CEO of Vons, the first Mexican American to be CEO of an American supermarket chain. Prior to his appointment, Davila worked for 37 years at Vons before becoming CEO. He opened Tianguis in 1986, catering to Hispanic consumers, and was well received as the company's television spokesman, starring in commercials in both English and Spanish during his tenure. He retired in 1999. In 1986, Household spun off Vons Companies in a leveraged buyout. To recapitalize itself, Vons merged with Detroit, Michigan-based Allied Supermarkets and sold off its assets outside California. Vons was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. In October 1985, Vons introduced Pavilions, a \\"combination store\\" concept which offered a wider variety of upscale products as well as pharmacy and other non-food products and services. Some stores that were smaller were branded Pavilions Place. In 1988, Safeway sold most of its stores in southern California and southern Nevada to Vons in exchange for an ownership stake. On April 8, 1997, Safeway acquired Vons for stock and Vons became a subsidiary of Safeway. Vons store (Woodland Hills, CA) before closing and reopening late 2015 as Haggen, then shutting down and reopening in 2017 as Bristol Farms In March 2014, Cerberus Capital Management (which also owns rival grocery chain Albertsons) agreed to terms to purchase Vons' parent, Safeway. Cerberus' plans to merge the chains would likely result in store closures, especially with both Vons and Albertsons having a significant presence in Southern California. In late 2014, the FTC mandated that the new Albertson's/Safeway merger sell off almost 200 stores to allow for sufficient competition in markets where both Safeway and Albertson's stores had existed in price rivalry. One of the key buyers was Bellingham, Washington-based Haggen grocers which rebranded the newly purchased stores in Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and Nevada in early 2015 only to sell back the affected stores just months later after Haggen was forced into bankruptcy as a result of purchasing the new stores. Haggen was soon after acquired by Albertson's. Lifestyle branding On April 18, 2005, Safeway began a $100 million brand re-positioning campaign labeled \\"Ingredients for life.\\" This was done in an attempt to differentiate itself from its competitors, and to increase brand involvement. Steve Burd described it as \\"branding the shopping experience.\\" The launch included a redesigned logo, a new slogan \\"Ingredients for life\\" alongside a four-panel life icon to be used throughout stores and advertising, and a web application called \\"FoodFlex\\" to improve consumer nutrition. Many locations are being converted to the \\"Lifestyle\\" format. The new look was designed by Michigan-based PPC Design. In addition to the \\"inviting decor with warm ambiance and subdued lighting,\\" the move required heavy redesign of store layout, new employee uniforms, sushi and olive bars, and the addition of in-store Starbucks kiosks (with cupholders on grocery carts). The change also involved differentiating the company from competitors with promotions based on the company's extensive loyalty card database. At the end of 2004, there were 142 \\"Lifestyle\\" format stores in the United States and Canada, with plans to open or remodel another 300 stores with this type of theme the following year. \\"Lifestyle format\\" stores have seen significantly higher average weekly sales than their other stores. By the end of 2006, shares were up proving that this rebranding campaign had a major impact on sale figures.

CICs are intended to be easy to set up, with all the flexibility and certainty of the company form, but with some special features to ensure they are working for the benefit of the community. They have proved popular and some 10,000 registered in the status's first ten years. As social enterprise A community interest company is a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or the community, rather than being driven by the need to maximize profit for shareholders and owners. CICs tackle a wide range of social and environmental issues and operate in all parts of the economy. By using business solutions to achieve public good, it is believed that CICs have a distinct and valuable role to play in helping create a strong, sustainable and socially inclusive economy. The community interest company emerged from many sources, many citing the absence in the UK of a company form for not-for-profit social enterprises similar to the public benefit corporation in the USA. One notable early proposal was advanced in 2001 by the Public Management Foundation in \\"The case for the public interest company,\\" The case for the Public interest company, Paul Corrigan, Jane Steele, and Greg Preston, Public Management Foundation, 2001. based on research supported by the Gulbenkian Foundation, Gordon Roddick, and the Office for Public Management. CICs are diverse. They include social and community enterprises, social firms, mutual organizations such as co-operatives, and large-scale organizations operating locally, regionally, nationally, or internationally. Legal forms and social objectives CICs must be limited companies of one form or another. A CIC cannot be a charity, an IPS or an unincorporated organization. Limited liability companies that do not have charitable status find it difficult to ensure that their assets are dedicated to public benefit. There is no simple, clear way of locking the support of such a company to a public benefit purpose, other than applying for charitable status. The community interest company is intended to meet this need. When a CIC is requested, the CIC regulator considers whether the application meets the criteria to become a CIC. If satisfied, the regulator advises the Registrar in Companies House who, provided that all the documents are in order, will issue a certificate of incorporation as a CIC. A charity can convert to a CIC with the consent of the Charity Commission. In so doing, it will lose its charitable status, including tax advantages. A charity may own a CIC, in which case the CIC would be permitted to pass assets to the charity. CICs are more lightly regulated than charities but do not have the benefit of charitable status, even if their objects are entirely charitable. Those who may want to set up a CIC are expected to be philanthropic entrepreneurs who want to do good in a form other than charity. This may be because: *CICs are identified explicitly with social enterprise. Some organizations may feel that this is more suitable than charitable status. *Members of the board of a charity may only be paid where the constitution contains such a power, and it can be considered to be in the best interests of the charity. It means that, in general, the founder of a social enterprise who wishes to be paid cannot be on the board and must give up strategic control of the organization to a volunteer board, which is often unacceptable. This limitation does not apply to CICs. *They are looking to work for community benefit with the relative freedom of the non-charitable company form to identify and adapt to circumstances, but with a clear assurance of not-for- profit distribution status. *The definition of community interest that applies to CICs is wider than the public interest test for charity. CICs must annually provide form CIC34 as part of their annual submission to Companies House. This includes confirmation of Director remuneration and some explanation of their social impact or evidence of the social benefit that they have provided over the last financial year. Formation and registration Formation and registration are similar to those of any limited company. New organizations can register by filing the Form IN01 and memorandum and articles of association together with a form CIC36 signed by all their directors, explaining their community credentials, to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales, or the Registrar for Scotland, with a fee of ¬£35. Since 11 March 2019, CICs can be registered online for a reduced fee of ¬£27. Existing companies can convert to a CIC by passing resolutions which make changes to their name and their memorandum and articles of association and by delivering to the Registrar of Companies copies of these documents, together with a fee for ¬£35, and a form CIC37 (which is similar to a CIC36, but asks for confirmation that the company is not a charity or that permission has been obtained from the Charity Commission to convert from a charity to a CIC). The Registrar will conduct the normal checks for registration and pass the papers to the Regulator of Community Interest Companies, to determine whether the company satisfies the community interest test. CICs cannot: *be politically motivated (regulation 3 of the Community Interest Company Regulations 2005) *be set up to serve an unduly restrictive group (rules 4 & 5) *be a charity *carry out unlawful activities.

After a year on the road, Morrissey founded a church in the Odd Fellows Hall in Beaverton, Oregon, after she felt she had received divine guidance to start a ministry. A church management consultant advised Morrissey and her husband to name the church after what they aimed to do; as they aimed to enrich people's lives, they called themselves the Living Enrichment Center.

Life Keys programs Living Enrichment Center had many statues, including \\"The Welcoming Jesus\\" by world-renowned sculptor Lorenzo Ghiglieri. In April 1997, LEC launched Life Keys, a weekly taped television show hosted by Morrissey that was syndicated across several states including Washington, California, Arizona, and Texas, mainly on public access stations. The LEC also produced audiotapes, CDs, and video cassettes of Morrissey's Sunday talks, which were available for purchase through LEC's bookstore. Often, audio cassettes of a Sunday service were available immediately after service. The audio tapes were also available via a mail subscription. Though most of the talks on Life Keys were delivered by Morrissey, some were recordings of talks given by visiting speakers such as Gandhi, Williamson, and Dyer. Life Keys was discontinued in 2004 when LEC filed for bankruptcy and closed. Morrissey's last talk distributed in the Life Keys series was entitled \\"The Right Questions to Ask\\" and was recorded on August 1, 2004. It was also her last talk as senior minister of LEC.

Investigators from the state of Oregon want to make sure that Morrissey is not diverting money from her income, as a stipulation of her plea bargain with the state was that a portion of her income must be used to repay her debt to her former congregation. KATU reported in 2007, that Morrissey has repaid only $74,000 since her plea bargain was struck in 2005.KATU News: Prophet of Profit (11/8/07): \\"Manin- Morrissey said she is following those rules. Her current church operates as a for-profit business, according to the state. She would not talk specifically about her finances, but we tracked down where the online contributions go. They are sent to a UPS store on Barbur Boulevard - to a post office box controlled by Manin-Morrissey. State investigators told KATU News they want to make sure Manin-Morrissey is not diverting income because a portion of her pay is supposed to go into an account for victims. So far, there is $74,000 in the account.

It is native to the Ohio Valley and Appalachian Mountains of the Eastern United States. It grows in mesophytic forest or floodplains, generally in acid to circumneutral soil, reaching a height of 20m to 48m (65 ft to 154 ft). Description The leaves are palmately compound with five (rarely seven) leaflets, 10‚Äì25 cm long and broad. The flowers are produced in panicles in spring, yellow to yellow-green, each flower 2‚Äì3 cm long with the stamens shorter than the petals (unlike the related A. glabra (Ohio buckeye), where the stamens are longer than the petals). The twigs have a faintly rank odor, but much less so than the Ohio buckeye, A. glabra. The fruit is a smooth (spineless), round or oblong capsule 5‚Äì7 cm diameter, containing 1-3 nut-like seeds, 2.5-3.5 cm diameter, brown with a whitish basal scar. The fruit is poisonous to humans but can be made edible through a leaching process. Cultivation Aesculus flava is cultivated as an ornamental tree. The tree's showy yellow flowers and good autumn color are attractive in larger gardens and in parks.Missouri Botanical Garden horticultural treatment: Aesculus flava . accessed 1.31.2013 This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Uses Native Americans roasted and soaked the poisonous seeds to remove the toxic element and consume them as food.
