Harris was born in Seattle, Washington. His father was a car dealer. He attended the University of Washington and earned a law degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He later became a lawyer in the Navy at the rank of captain.Tim O'Neil. \\"Whitney R. Harris, 97; prosecuted Nazi crimes after WWII\\". The Washington Post After the end of World War II, Harris was selected to be part of the legal team led by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson that began the prosecution of war criminals in Nuremberg, Germany. Harris led the team's case against Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking leader of the Nazi Security Police to face trial. He was successful in winning a conviction against Kaltenbrunner for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was also responsible for interrogating Rudolf Franz Ferdinand Hoess, the former commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp. For his work in the Nuremberg trials, Harris was decorated with the Legion of Merit. In February 2002, Washington University School of Law's \\"Institute for Global Legal Studies\\" was renamed to the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute in honor and recognition of Harris' lifelong achievements in the field of international justice, and his support of legal education and research. He was a member of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute's International Council. During an Experts' Meeting of The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative of the Institute in 2010 at the Brookings Institution, Harris made a plea just prior to his death to the legal experts, members of civil society and diplomats who were present. He stated. \\"Following the trials, the Genocide Convention was adopted in 1948, criminalizing the Nazis' attempt to exterminate European Jewry. The Geneva Conventions were elaborated in 1949, codifying the laws of war. But crimes against humanity- one of the most revolutionary and important elements of the Nuremberg Charter itself - were never set out in a treaty until the adoption of the International Criminal Court Statute in the summer of 1998. Practically speaking, what that means is that the words uttered after Nuremberg 'And never again' have but a hollow significance. My friends, this initiative of the Institute that bears my name is the first serious international effort to fill this gap, complete this work, and fulfill the Nuremberg legacy.\\" Harris spoke of the institutional evil of the Nazi regime in Germany during an interview in 2008: \\"Society lays the groundwork, and we develop in that society... We become part of that society, we're captivated by it, and we might do evil, too. It makes you wonder about where is the future of mankind - is evil going to triumph ultimately, or is good going to triumph? You have to find the good instincts that are in all of us.\\" Seeing environmental conservation as another important component in promoting good in the world, Harris was also a founding member of the Development Board of the International Center for Tropical Ecology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The center was renamed the Whitney R. Harris World Ecology Center after a significant donation in 2006.\\"About the center: Introduction\\".

WeirFoulds is deeply rooted in Canadian history, stretching back to when Toronto became the industrial center of Ontario in the late 1800s. The firm was founded initially as Spencer and MacDonald in 1870.City of Toronto Directory, 1870, Spencer & MacDonald partnership formed The firm is currently located in the Toronto- Dominion Bank Tower, at 66 Wellington Street West, in Toronto, Ontario.

Peter May, Publisher: Springer Verlag,Published Date: 2009-10-01, http://www.isbnlib.com/author/John_C__BaezReferenced in His recent fundamental results that extend the classical Van Kampen theorem to higher homotopy in higher dimensions (HHSvKT) are of substantial interest for solving several problems in algebraic topology, both old and new.The higher Van Kampen Theorems and computation of the unstable homotopy groups of spheres and complex spaces https://mathoverflow.net/q/39818 Moreover, developments in algebraic topology have often had wider implications, as for example in algebraic geometry and also in algebraic number theory. Such higher- dimensional (HHSvKT) theorems are about homotopy invariants of structured spaces, and especially those for filtered spaces or n-cubes of spaces. An example is the fact that the relative Hurewicz theorem is a consequence of HHSvKT, and this then suggested a triadic Hurewicz theorem.

His name means \\"Isesi lives\\". He may have been a son of pharaoh Djedkare Isesi and queen Meresankh IV, although this is debated. Isesi-ankh probably lived during the reign of Djedkare Isesi and that of his successor Unas. He was buried in a mastaba tomb in north Saqqara, now ruined. Filiation Isesi-ankh may have been a son of Djedkare Isesi, as suggested by his name and his title of King's son. In addition, similarities in the titles and locations of the tombs of Isesi-ankh and Kaemtjenent have led Egyptologists such as William Stevenson Smith to propose that the two were brothers and sons of Meresankh IV. Alternatively, Isesi-ankh may have been a son of Kaemtjenent. Even though Isesi-ankh bore the title of King's son, the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz have shown that this filiation was probably fictitious, being used only as an honorary title. In particular, inscriptions found on the construction blocks of his mastaba give one of his titles as Seal bearer of the king Isesi ankh, while Baud argues that had he really been the son of a king, this title would have been Seal bearer of the king, king's son, Isesi ankh. Consequently, Isesi-ankh's father was likely not Djedkare Isesi. Titles False door stela of Isesi-ankh giving all his titles, from his mastaba in North Saqqara. Isesi-ankh bore many titles showing that he made a successful career as a high official: *Overseer of all the works of the King, *Overseer of the expedition/troops, *Overseer of all judgements of the King, *Shepherd of the livestock, *Staff of the recruits, *Chief of the royal secrets, *Seal bearer of the God in the Two Great Barks, *Seal bearer of the God, *Director of the bark of Horus, *King's son, *Sole companion. Tomb Isesi-ankh was buried in mastaba D8, north of the Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara. The mastaba was first investigated in the 19th century by Auguste Mariette, and again briefly during the excavation season 1907-1908 of James Quibell. More extensive work took place under the direction of Said Amer El-Fikey in 1983, then director of the archaeological zone of Saqqarah. The excavations yielded two demotic papyri. A decade later, in 1994, the remaining decorations of the mastaba were studied under the direction of Yvonne Harpur, Field Director of the Oxford Expedition to Egypt. The structure is now in a ruined state and many of its reliefs and decorations are lost. The mastaba comprised a recessed facade with two columns. The architrave above the entrance and the two columns were inscribed with Isesi-ankh's titles, which are now damaged. At the back of the facade, a corridor leads to two rooms, one of which further leads to a cult chapel in the back, where the false door stela of Isesi-ankh was located. This false door, made of poor-quality marl, bears inscriptions that are better preserved than on the facade. These as well as the other reliefs on the false door were originally painted with a green enamel and the walls of the tomb were adorned with paintings on plaster, much of which have now disappeared although the green coloring has persisted.

They played in the Class A Western League (1917; 1924–27), the Class D Nebraska State League (1922–23; 1928–36; 1938) and the Class D Western League of 1939–41 (1939). Lincoln was first represented in organized baseball in 1886 as the Tree Planters in the reorganized original Western League. Lincoln's 19th century teams played in various leagues between 1886 and 1895. In 1906, Lincoln joined the Class A Western League as the Ducklings (1906), Treeplanters (1907), Railsplitters (1908–13) and Tigers (1914–16).BR Minors During this time, team nicknames were often unofficially assigned by sportswriters, and The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, published by Baseball America in 2007, lists other nicknames for the Lincoln franchise of the time, including Greenbackers and Antelopes. Adopted in 1917, Links was the most widely used of the several nicknames associated with Lincoln teams during the 20th century. They played home games at Antelope Park (through 1917) and Landis Field (after 1922)Nebraska Baseball History web site and won Nebraska State League championships in 1923 (under manager O.A. Beltzer), and 1934 (under Cy Lingle and Pug Griffin). Upon the introduction of the farm system, the Links were linked with Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals (1933–34), Cincinnati Reds (1936, as the Red Links), and St. Louis Browns (1938–39). After World War II: A new league, team, name and ballpark The Class A Western League had folded during the Great Depression in 1937, but with the boom in baseball attendance following World War II, it was revived in 1947 by U.S. Senator Edwin C. Johnson of Colorado. Lincoln was one of six cities represented in the 1947 Western League as the A's, reflecting its affiliation with the Philadelphia Athletics. The Lincoln A's moved into a new ballpark, Sherman Field, named for franchise owner Charles \\"Cy\\" Sherman,Cy Sherman Dies; Dean of American Sports Writers, The Lincoln Star (Lincoln, Nebraska) May 23, 1951, page 1 and 2, accessed October 17, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7061146// and https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7061235// and played for six seasons (1947–52), making the playoffs twice. Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Nellie Fox batted .311 for the 1948 Lincoln A's in his last season as a minor leaguer. However, in 1953 the Athletics abandoned Lincoln and were replaced by the Milwaukee Braves, who fielded a club identified by its final nickname, the Lincoln Chiefs. The Chiefs struggled on the field for their first three seasons, but in 1956, in the team's second year as an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, they won the Western League's first half and playoff championships. The 1956 Chiefs, managed by Larry Shepard, were paced by two standout performances. First baseman Dick Stuart clubbed 66 home runs — still the fourth-most in minor league history — and also led the league with 158 runs batted in. Pitcher Bennie Daniels, meanwhile, compiled a 15–3 win–loss record. The 1957 Chiefs repeated as Western League champions, edging out the Amarillo Gold Sox by a single game. But the Western League was in its twilight years; plagued by declining attendance and the defection of teams such as the Omaha Cardinals and Denver Bears to higher-level circuits, it folded after the 1958 campaign, one in which the Chiefs placed third in the league and in home attendance. A Nebraska team in the Three-I League The Chiefs played for three more seasons in organized baseball as a member of the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. But the Three-I League was also suffering from the woes that plagued the Western circuit, and it disbanded after the 1961 season.

Salinger first published in February 1948 in Good Housekeeping. Plot The story begins as the narrator fails out of college. His father offers to send him to Europe to learn languages he could use to help his business. While in Vienna, the narrator meets a girl, Leah. She is Jewish and attempts to give him lessons in German as he introduces her to pieces of Americana. He frequently stumbles over his new language while ingratiating himself with her and her family. They both spend time in his apartment, which is above hers. Some time passes before the narrator transfers to Paris, and then goes back to college in America. While in school he receives a letter from Leah informing him she is married. As with other letters in Salinger's works, the narrator carries it around with him for some time. News begins to spread that the Nazis have invaded Vienna, and he enlists as an infantryman. Since he is in Intelligence, he uses some of the skills acquired while studying the various languages. The story closes as he is in Vienna, after the war, and hears that Leah is dead. Presumably she was sent to Buchenwald, as the story alludes to this. The narrator finds the apartment, which is now an officer's quarters. He notices everything about it has changed and leaves abruptly. History The story was originally titled \\"Wien, Wien\\".

After graduating from school, the pair worked as mentors at the West Contra Costa Youth Service Bureau where they mentored teenagers and adolescents. He worked there, part- time,http://itsjulisa.com/locksmith/ for a decade before moving on to concentrate on his solo music career. Career =Battle rap= Locksmith first gained notoriety outside of the Bay Area as a battle rapper. In 2003, after beating the likes of Mistah FAB and A-Wolf on radio station 106.1 KMEL, he qualified for and became a contender on MTV's MC Battle joining a pool of 32 contenders, judged by Just Blaze and Kanye West.

In February 2004, The Frontline signed a deal with E-A-Ski's label IMG. Between 2002 and 2004, the duo had released three mixtapes. They released their debut studio album, Who R You, on October 12, 2004, which peaked at #48 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. On May 10, 2005, The Frontline released their second studio album, Now You Know, which peaked at #46 on the Independent Albums chart. In 2007, they released their third and final album, titled Left & Lock, on September 25. =Solo career= In March 2009, it was announced that Locksmith was working on a solo album titled Frank The Rabbit. It was slated to be entirely produced by E-A-Ski. It wasn't until he began his solo career in 2010, he started to cultivate a loyal fan base. Locksmith has toured with Joe Budden, Murs, R.A. the Rugged Man, Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks and collaborated with producers 9th Wonder and Ski Beatz.

It supports desktop-style applications with rich graphics and direct manipulation abilities, but without the installation or upgrade troubles of conventional desktop applications.The Lively Kernel A Self-supporting System on a Web PageThe Lively Kernel Application Framework Development began at Sun Microsystems Laboratories in Menlo Park, California, and later moved to the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam-Babelsberg near Berlin.  Overview  The Lively Kernel is a graphical composition and integrated programming environment written fully in the programming language JavaScript using standard browser graphics (W3C Canvas or SVG). It is thus accessible to any browser as a web page, and it begins operating as soon as the web page is loaded. It is able to edit its own code and graphics, and through its built-in WebDAV support, it can save its results or even clone itself onto new web pages. Along with its application development abilities, it can also function as its own integrated development environment (IDE), making the whole system self-sufficient with no tools except a browser.  Shapes, widgets, windows, IDE all on a Web page  The Lively Kernel uses a Morphic graphics model to add behavior to a scene graph built from browser graphics. Simple graphics are thus assembled into such standard widgets as sliders, scroll bars, text views, lists and clipping frames. A simple window system built from these widgets offers object inspectors, file browsers and code browsers. Even the rudimentary demo pages thus have the ability to edit and test new code in a simple code browser while the system is running. Lively has been used to build simple web sites, including its own tutorial, and also a client-side Wiki system that stores its pages in a versioned repository. Content can vary from relatively static pages of text to fully dynamic models that look and behave like Adobe Flash simulations. The Lively Kernel achieves complex dynamic behavior without any specific animation support (it does not use the animation features of SVG), but by simple scheduling of multiple green-thread processes in JavaScript.  Text and transformations  The Lively Kernel includes its own multifont text editor written in JavaScript. It includes support for centering, justification and similar rudimentary text composition abilities. Working in Lively thus has much the same feel as working in a web page design program, except that the on-the-fly text layout is not being done in an offline composition program, but it is the built-in dynamic behavior of text in the Lively Kernel. The liveliness of Lively graphics becomes even more apparent when manipulating the scale and rotation handles for objects and text. The whole code browser can be used when tilted 20 degrees on its side. Because the text editor is made up entirely of lively graphics, it works perfectly well when rotated or scaled, just as do the scroll bars, clipping frames, and the rest of the entire user interface.  Cross-browser compatibility  The Lively Kernel depends on browser support for JavaScript and SVG or Canvas graphics, all now part of the W3C standards. As of 2009, this means that it runs in Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Opera browsers. While this requirement might seem less compatible than HTML, Lively is actually more compatible across the browsers on which it runs than is HTML. This is because there is more uniformity among JavaScript, SVG and Canvas implementations than there is from one HTML implementation to another. Except for one small initial file, the Lively Kernel code base is entirely free of tests for which client browser is being used. As of 2011, Lively Kernel runs best in WebKit-based browsers such as Safari for Macintosh, or Chromium or Google Chrome for Windows. Running in Internet Explorer (Windows) requires Google Chrome Frame. Testing in all popular browsers is planned for the next release.  Integrated development environment  Lively includes an integrated development environment of considerable power, designed to work via WebDAV with a local set of a dozen or so source JavaScript files synchronizable with a versioned repository. If the user opens a SystemBrowser, all the JavaScript source files are listed in the file pane of the browser. If the user clicks on one of these files, it will be read, parsed (by an OMeta JavaScript parser) and displayed similar to a Smalltalk browser with functions or class definitions listed and, for each class, all the method names are shown. The user can click on a method name, edit its code in the bottom pane, and then save the new definition. The new definition will be checked for syntax and, if correct, it will be stored back in the .JS file. Moreover, if in \\"eval mode\\" (the usual case), the method will be redefined in the system that is running. This allows non-critical changes to be made without any need to restart Lively or any of the applications being developed. When all the source files are loaded, a rapid scan will find every reference to a selected text, and present all the code bodies that match in a separate sub-browser. The Lively IDE includes object inspectors and morph style panels for controlling fills, borders, and text styles. There are also facilities for debugging at error points and profiling for performance tuning, but these have not been pushed, owing to the improving quality of such run-time support in all the major browsers.  Lively Wiki  The IDE operates on its source code files in a versioned repository to manage evolution of the Lively code base. The same approach has been used to empower users with control over active web content in the form of a client-side Wiki. Because Lively includes facilities to edit the content in its worlds (scene graphs and other content), and to store that content as web pages, a WebDAV connection allows Lively to store new versions of its page content while it is being incrementally developed. As each new version is saved, it is viewable from the rest of the Internet and prior versions can be retrieved in cases of error or change of mind. It is notable that this Wiki style of evolving web content extends to all the textual, graphical, and scripting content in Lively, as well as to any new forms that may be defined, yet without any need for a Wiki server of any kind.Lively Wiki A Development Environment for Creating and Sharing Active Web Content, Krahn Ingalls Hirschfeld Lincke Palacz, WikiSym ’09, October 25–27, 2009 All that is required is a server providing a HTTP WebDAV interface. Increasing amounts of the Lively Project content is now maintained in this manner.  Lively for Qt  Lively for Qt is a new implementation of the Lively Kernel in which the \\"kernel\\" parts are replaced by functionality offered by the Qt framework.Lively for Qt: A Platform for Mobile Web Applications, Mikkonen Taivalsaari Terho, Mobility 2009, Sep 2-4 Lively for Qt inherits most of the basic functionality (such as the implementation of widgets, layout management, core event handling and core JavaScript support) from Qt. Lively for Qt retains the exceptionally interactive nature (the \\"liveliness\\") of the Lively Kernel, e.g., by allowing the user interface and application source code to be edited on the fly. However, in Lively for Qt the development work is performed using the familiar, well-documented APIs of the Qt platform.

Consequently, he was both a rugby union, and rugby league footballer for Halifax. =Club career= Fred Firth made his début for Wakefield Trinity during October 1899, and he played his last match for Wakefield Trinity during the 1900–01 season, he appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the 1974–75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.

Adults are around wide, with males being larger and having larger and more conspicuously coloured claws. The males wave their claws to communicate with other crabs, giving them their common name of semaphore crab. They can breathe both in air and under water, and feed at low tide on detritus in the sediment. H. cordiformis is the only species in the genus Heloecius and the family Heloeciidae. Description Adults of H. cordiformis are around wide, with a dark purple, mottled carapace. The compound eyes are on long eyestalks. The claws are sexually dimorphic, with males' claws showing positive allometry, while females' claws grow isometrically; a male's claws thus become proportionally larger as the crab grows, becoming much larger than those of females. The colour of the claws is correlated with both sex and size. The smallest crabs have green claws, followed by orange and pink, with the largest male crabs having purple claws; females with purple claws have small claws. The purple colour is the easiest of the four to distinguish against the reflectance spectrum of the mudflats on which the crabs live.Juvenile Heloecius cordiformis. Distribution H. cordiformis lives from Brisbane (Queensland), along the coast of New South Wales to Port Philip Bay (Victoria), as well as eastern parts of Tasmania. Ecology and behaviour H. cordiformis lives in intertidal mangroves, and in estuaries, where it is the most abundant crab species, usually living among the roots of the mangroves. H. cordiformis can breathe both in air and in water. While out of the water, H. cordiformis moves its carapace up and down; this capability allows the crab to breathe air without losing the water held in the gill chamber under the carapace. H. cordiformis is primarily a deposit feeder, sifting through the sediment for organic matter and the detritus from mangroves, but also has large mandibles that it uses to eat larger pieces of plants and animals. Both males and females use their claws alternately; while one is transferring food to the mouthparts, the other claw is collecting more material. Predators of H. cordiformis include a variety of birds and fish. Males signal to other crabs by waving their brightly coloured claws, which gives the species its common name of \\"semaphore crab\\". Systematics Heloecius cordiformis was first described as Gelasimus cordiformis by Henri Milne-Edwards, in the family Ocypodidae (Gelasimus is now a subgenus of Uca). It was transferred to a new genus by James Dwight Dana in 1851, alongside a newly described species, H. inornatus. A 1983 study concluded that Heloecius was the most primitive of the crabs in the family Ocypodidae, and erected a new subfamily for the genus, which was later raised to the rank of family, as Heloeciidae. Dana's H. inornatus and other species described in the genus are all considered taxonomic synonyms of H. cordiformis.

He bought the Salem Raiders of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League in 1982 and renamed them the Virginia Raiders.

The ACHL then convinced Brabham to take over the Nashville South Stars during the following season, which he relocated back to Salem in December 1983 as the Virginia Lancers, named after his chain of convenience stores. In 1984, he built the LancerLot Sports Complex in his hometown of Vinton, Virginia, to serve as home to the Lancers due to the cost of playing in the Salem Civic Center. In 1988, Brabham and Bill Coffey founded the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) as a minor professional ice hockey league with five teams, three of which were owned by Brabham — the Erie Panthers, Johnstown Chiefs, and the Virginia Lancers — as well as being a co-founder of a fourth team, the Knoxville Cherokees. He sold the Lancers in 1989, the Panthers in 1991, and the Chiefs in 1993. The ECHL has since become a development league for the National Hockey League. The LancerLot's roof caved in during the 1993 Storm of the Century and the ice rink was destroyed. Brabham sold the complex in 2018. Brabham died on March 30, 2020, at the age of 90.

Its principal and only material mineral resource interest is a 66% share of the Oyu Tolgoi Copper-Gold Mine in Southern Mongolia 200 km east of Dalanzadgad. The company was called Ivanhoe Mines until August 2, 2012 when a financing agreement was completed with Rio Tinto. The Oyu Tolgoi Project is considered one of the world's largest copper and gold porphyry deposits. For development to happen at Oyu Tolgoi, an agreement had to be made in which the Mongolian government took a 34% stake in the project; the royalty arrangement it currently has with the Mongolian government took years to reach which caused significant delays in project development. In Australia, Turquoise Hill Resources has stakes in mines containing gold, uranium, copper and the world's highest grade molybdenum and rhenium. In Mongolia the company controls several other gold and copper mine development projects. It owns a 50% interest in the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan through Altynalmas Gold and has exploration projects in China, Indonesia and the Philippines. Turquoise Hill Resources also owns 14% of Entree Gold, a company with interests in copper and gold projects in southern Mongolia and Arizona, and 14% of Exco Resources which operates Cloncurry's copper project and the White Dam gold mine in Australia. The company's largest shareholder is Rio Tinto, with a stake of 50.8%. This is up from 46.5% beforehand. In June 2011 Rio Tinto paid $502 million for 55 million additional shares, increasing its control to 46.5% from 42% (35% prior to that) and giving it an extra seat on the board (up to 7/14), though Rio Tinto was restricted from increasing its stake in the company to a majority before 2012. Since 2006 Rio Tinto invested $3.5 billion in Ivanhoe Mines. Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien is a special advisor to the company. In September 2010 it was reported that exploration around Oyu Tolgoi at the Heruga North deposit revealed higher reserves of gold and copper than previously estimated (the news caused IVN share prices to rise 6%). Capital spending is likely to reach $5Bn; in October 2010, Ivanhoe announced a new $1Bn share offering in order to raise funds to develop this mine. Due to new entitlement offers by Ivanhoe Australia (made to raise funding in order to develop assets in North Queensland, Australia) Ivanhoe Mines' interest in the company was reduced from 81% to 62%. At the end of March 2011 construction of Oyu Toloi was 15% complete. At the end of February 2012 construction of Oyu Tolgoi was 73% complete. In 2016 Turquoise Hill produced 201,300 tonnes of copper and 300,000 ounces of gold, exceeding guidance and generating US$1.2 billion in revenue. The Company recorded net income from continuing operations attributable to owners of Turquoise Hill of $210.6 million. History 2000 - In December ABM Mining (private) was merged into Ivanhoe Mines. At the time Ivanhoe's main assets included 50% of Myanmar's Monywa Copper Project (28,500 tonnes/year); that year production by both companies totalled 13,350 tonnes for copper, 2 million tonnes for iron ore pellets and 48,000 tones for iron ore concentrate. ABM Mining was founded in 1997 and remained a privately held company until the merger. 2002 - Subsidiary ABM Mining purchased all of the outstanding debt associated with the Savage River iron ore project in Tasmania, Australia giving ABM Mining a priority claim on the project's assets. 2005 - Savage River Project sold to Stemcor Holdings Limited of London for up to US$170 million. The spinoff was part of the company's efforts to shift focus to Oyu Tolgoi (specifically the Hugo deposit). 2007 - In May the company sold all of its coal projects including Ovoot Tolgoi to Asia Gold Corp (currently SouthGobi); as part of the transaction Asia Gold gave Ivanhoe Mines over 80 million more shares of the company raising its interest in it from 45% to a majority stake. Later in October Rio Tinto helped Ivanhoe gain access to a $350 million credit facility which Oyu Tolgoi needed for further development. 2008 - In January Ivanhoe Mines raised $117.9 million through a series of private placements one of which increased its interest in SouthGobi (when it converted preferred shares into common shares). Also that month the newly discovered Heruga Deposit at Oyu Tolgoi was for the first time officially acknowledged (estimates completed) as having a substantial resource of copper, gold and molybdenum. Three months later, in April the government approved the Ovoot Tolgoi project allowing Ivanhoe to begin production in the southern portion (Sunset Field). In May it sold its majority interest in Jinshan Gold Mines for C$216.7 million. Later that summer Ivanhoe's Australian subsidiary went public with a A$125 million IPO (62.5 million shares) and Rio Tinto helped the Oyu Tolgoi project acquire certain equipment. Ivanhoe Australia was floated on the ASX exchange with Ivanhoe Mines owning 80% of it. 2009 - Ivanhoe finally reached an agreement with the Mongolian Government on its share in Oyu Tolgoi, taxes as well as Ivanhoe's responsibilities when it comes to the environment and job opportunities for local people. In October Rio Tinto bought 46.3 million common shares for $388 million. In November the China Investment Corporation invested US$500 in SouthGobi in the form of a convertible debenture. 2010 - January - SouthGobi raised C$459 million by going public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In March $250 million of the $500 million China Investment Corporation debenture was converted into SouthGobi common shares; the move lowered Ivanhoe's interest in it to 57%. Also that year, Rio Tinto promised that it will not make any attempts to take over Ivanhoe Mines before October 18, 2011 (Rio Tinto's possible interest in the company is limited to 46.65%). 2012 - April - Ivanhoe Mines sells its 57.6% share of SouthGobi Resources to Chalco for $889 million. The decision came partly as a result of pressure from Ivanhoe's largest shareholder Rio Tinto to sell non core assets. However, the Mongolian government asked that work be stopped at the company's Ovoot Tolgoi mine. On July 31, 2012 Rio Tinto purchased $935 million worth of Ivanhoe shares putting its total interest in the company at 51%. To obtain the additional funding, it was required that Ivanhoe Mines change its name and that founder Robert Friedland resign as CEO. Six of the senior board members also resigned however they didn't include former CEO John Maken who became company president. 2013 – June - Turquoise Hill Resources announced it had secured a $225-million non-revolving bridge facility from majority shareholder Rio Tinto. Developments by product =Coal= Nariin Sukhait (Ovoot Tolgoi, flagship coal mine that is already producing, 114.1 million tonnes in reserves), and two development projects, the Soumber Deposit (55.5 million tonnes in reserves) and the Ovoot Tolgoi Underground Deposit. Ivanhoe exited these operations on April 2, 2012 when it sold its 57.6% interest in SouthGobi Resources Inc to Chalco for $889 million. Ivanhoe developed many other mines in Mongolia including Ovuut Tolgoi coal mine. =Molybdenum, silver, rhenium, uranium, lead, zinc= The mines, acquired in 2003 are located at Mount Isa, Cloncurry with the largest project being the Merlin mine which has the world's highest grade molybdenum-rhenium deposit,; the other is Tennant Creek. It has also acquired Barrick Gold's Osborne asset near Merlin ($18 million needed to complete the purchase) which has an ore processing operating plant =Copper, gold= Oyu Tolgoi (isn't scheduled to begin production until 2013) has measured and indicated reserves of at least 36.3 billion pounds of copper and 20.2 million ounces of gold. Newly discovered deposits at Oyu Tolgoi could add substantially to the measured and indicated reserves estimates. *Oyu Tolgoi, the world's largest gold, 3rd largest copper and gold mine still requires $4.6 billion in investment before construction is complete in 2012; annual production is scheduled to be 544,000 tonnes for copper and 650,000 ounces for gold. Kyzyl gold project In Northern Kazakhstan; according to an independent pre feasibility study by UK engineering and consultant group Scott Wilson Ltd. the mine's reserves are estimated at 3.3 million ounces and mine life 10 years. Oyu Tolgoi Construction of Shaft #2 at the Oyu Tolgoi project in the South Gobi Desert The copper and gold rich property discovered by Ivanhoe Mines in 2001, is in the process of being transformed into an open pit and underground mining operation. It is located 80 km north of the China Mongolia border giving the companies that produce there an added benefit (China is the world's biggest market for commodities futures). In September 2010 Oyu Tolgoi reserves were placed at 81.3 billion pounds for copper and 46.4 million ounces for gold. Construction of the Oyu Tolgoi mine was 15% complete at the end of March 2011, ahead of schedule which calls for first production in 2013 and full production in 2018. In 2011 14,000 people will be working at the site. By the end of February 2012 construction of Oyu Tolgoi was 73% complete. Relationship with Rio Tinto Rio Tinto has expressed interest in raising its stake in the company from 35% to 46.6%, eventually leading to a takeover, however, Ivanhoe Mines is not interested in selling out. Ivanhoe has implemented a shareholder rights plan aimed at preventing a creeping takeover. Though Ivanhoe still needs to raise billions of dollars to develop key projects it is confident that either other investors will come forward or the financing will become available (it is seeking $2 billion in financing from 13 institutions). On January 27, 2011 Ivanhoe used a rights offering to raise the $1.8 billion necessary to start development at the 66% owned Oyu Tolgoi mine. After the rights offering Robert Friedland (founder and ceo) will have his interest in the company lowered to 15.5% while Rio Tinto will have its interest maintained at 40.5%. On February 9, 2011 two Rio Tinto execs were elected to Ivanhoe's board putting the number of Rio Tinto board members at 6 (out of a total of 14), the move was made in response to Rio Tinto's growing interest in the company. In June 2011 Rio Tinto paid $502 million for 55 million more shares of Ivanhoe Mines or 4.5% more of the company (up to 46.5%). The move gave it 7/14 board seats. By early 2012 Rio Tinto owned 51%. In April 2012 Robert Friedland resigned as CEO of Ivanhoe Mines. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-04-19/ivanhoe-ceo-loses-in-rio- chess-game-over-mongolia-mine As of July 2018 the Chief Executive Officer of Turquoise Hill Resources is Ulf Quellmann, an experienced finance executive from Rio Tinto.https://www.turquoisehill.com/company/officers/ References Category:Companies based in Vancouver Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Category:Coal companies of Mongolia Category:Copper mining in Mongolia ","title":"Turquoise Hill Resources"},{"id":"27080039","text":"Uchiyama (written: ) is a Japanese surname.

Indeed, princes of royal blood did not hold public offices in the early Fifth Dynasty, however they are known to have acted as overseers of the construction of the king's pyramid during the subsequent Sixth Dynasty. It is thus possible that Neserkauhor, who lived between these two periods, acted as overseer on some of his father's projects. We do not know who his mother was. Neserkauhor was buried in Abusir, in a cemetery built in the second half of Djedkare's reign.

The Dubuque Climbers became the Dubuque Dubs, though the other teams remained the same. The Hawks finished first in the league. All teams from 1924 returned for 1925, with the Dubs becoming the Dubuque Ironmen. The Bunnies finished first in the league for the second time four years.

The bombings =23 April attacks= On 23 April, over a two-hour time span, a wave of coordinated bombings hit Shia Muslims leaving Friday prayers, Shiite neighbourhoods, and a market. The attacks consisted of five car bombs, which accounted for 58 deaths, and approximately 13 bombs in total. A car bomb outside the Abdel Hadi al-Chalabi mosque in Al-Hurriya killed five and wounded 14. Three bombs, including two car bombs, in the Sadr City district of Baghdad occurred near the headquarters of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, where followers gather for morning prayers every Friday. The bombings killed at least 39 and wounded 56 others in Sadr City. A car bomb and a suicide bomber in the Al-Ameen district in east Baghdad killed 11 worshipers leaving a Shiite mosque after prayers and wounded 23 additional people. \\"Why do they always target us? We are peaceful people. We come to pray and then go on our way,\\" remarked one angry survivor. Five homemade bombs were also detonated in the predominantly Sunni Al Anbar Governorate killing seven and injuring 11. A police officer responding to the bombings was killed by a roadside bomb. A cluster of houses was damaged in the attack. According to NPR correspondent Quill Lawrence, the bombs were targeted at a police detective and a judge living in the area, both of whom survived. Late on 24 April, the official death toll from the Friday attacks stood at 72. Around 120 people were wounded. =Continued violence= On 24 April, 13 additional people were killed when three bombs were detonated in Western Baghdad. The three bombs, which were hidden in plastic bags, injured 25 additional people. The three bombs exploded simultaneously in a billiard hall located in a mixed Sunni- Shiite neighbourhood. Perpetrators and aftermath Prime minister Nouri al- Maliki and other officials have blamed Al-Qaeda in Iraq for the bombing attacks. The attacks were widely seen as retribution for the killings of two top Al-Qaeda officials the previous Sunday. Security spokesperson Qassim al- Moussawi stated that \\"targeting prayers in areas with a [Shiite] majority is a revenge for the losses suffered by al Qaeda.\\" Iraqi political analyst Hameed Fadhel agreed, saying, \\"These are acts of revenge that are intended to send a message to the Iraqi government and the world that al-Qaida's existence will not be affected by the killing of specific leaders.\\" No one has officially claimed responsibility. The government expects \\"such terrorist acts to continue.\\" After the attacks, Muqtada al-Sadr offered to \\"Iraqi security forces to fight insurgents\\", sparking fear that he might be considering a revival of his Mahdi Army militia. Al-Sadr's aides claimed that he had no such plans. He urged his followers to remain calm and not provoke the United States, but added that he was prepared to have \\"hundreds of believers\\" join the Iraqi army and police forces. \\"The government might ask the help of individual citizens, not from armed groups,\\" presidential aid Ali al-Adeeb responded. On Friday and Saturday, citizens of the Sadr City enclave of Baghdad took to the streets for at least six separate funeral processions. Many of the victims were carried to the holy city of Najaf, 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the south. Some of the mourners supported the idea of reviving the Mahdi Army. \\"They can provide security. The government cannot,\\" remarked one citizen.

Description and history The Deshon-Allyn House is located on the campus of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum on the east side of Williams Street, north of downtown New London. It is a large 2½-story structure built out of random-laid stone, with corner quoins and openings framed by ashlar granite. It is covered by a truncated hipped roof with gabled dormers, and four brick chimneys projecting from its roof faces. The recessed entry is flanked inside the opening by Ionic columns and sidelights, with a transom window across the top. Above the entrance is a small Palladian window, its elements separated by pilasters. Many of its surviving interior features are identifiable in the publications of Asher Benjamin. The house was built in 1829 for Captain Daniel Deshon, the master of a local whaling vessel, and is a particularly elegant example of late Federal architecture. It was purchased in 1851 by Lyman Allyn, also a whaling captain who greatly enlarged his fortune by investing in railroads and other businesses. The museum that now owns the house was established in his memory by his daughter. Robert Ballard's Ocean Exploration Trust (founded 2008) established offices within the Deshon-Allyn House.

Early life Ethel Sylvia Knight was born on February 13, 1902 on a farm just outside Sunnyside, Alberta. She took her post secondary education at Edmonton Business College. Wilson married Dave Wilson, with whom she had three children. He died in 1935 after ten years of marriage. After her husband's death, Wilson entered the work force as a seamstress for Burns Meats, where she worked until her retirement in 1962. During that time she was active in the labour movement, eventually becoming Secretary of the Edmonton Labor Council. Political career =Edmonton City Council= In 1951, Wilson was nominated by the Edmonton Labor Council to run for a seat to Edmonton City Council in the municipal election. She was defeated, finishing tenth among thirteen candidates. She ran again the following year and was elected, taking fifth place. Wilson was re-elected in 1954, 1956, 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964. She retired from council in 1966. =Alberta Legislature= While still a member of Edmonton city council, Wilson ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature in the 1959 general election. She ran as a Social Credit candidate in the new electoral district of Edmonton North, which she won over three other candidates. She continued to hold her seat on Edmonton council while she served as an MLA. On November 30, 1962, Wilson was appointed to the cabinet as a Minister without portfolio by Premier Ernest Manning. The appointment made her the second woman in the history of Alberta to be appointed to cabinet (following UFA's Irene Parlby). She was also the first trade unionist since Alex Ross (1917-1926) to sit in a provincial cabinet. In the 1963 general election she was re-elected with some reduction in popular support. In the 1967 Alberta general election, Wilson defeated three candidates, including future NDP MLA Gordon Wright, getting almost as many votes as all her opponents put together. In 1971 Wilson's constituency of Edmonton North was abolished during redistribution, and she ran for re-election that year in the new electoral district of Edmonton-Kingsway. She was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Kenneth Paproski who was part of the P-C wave that took power that year.

Built about 1759, it is an architecturally unusual stone house with a gambrel roof, a style not otherwise seen in the city. Because of its unusual form, it was thought to have been built by French Huguenot immigrants at an earlier date. The house is owned by Connecticut Landmarks, along with the adjacent Joshua Hempsted House, operating the pair as the Hempstead Houses museum. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1970. Description and history The Nathaniel Hempstead House is located west of downtown New London, set close to the road at the corner of Hempstead and Truman Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story stone structure with a gambrel roof and brick end chimneys. The walls are formed out of dressed granite laid in regular courses with mortar. Its main facade is four bays wide, with the entrance in one of the center bays. A single small shed-roof dormer projects from the rear roof's steep face. Although the house was built in 1759 by Nathaniel Hempstead, the English grandson of Joshua Hempstead (whose 1678 home stands adjacent), its form and building material are unusual for southern New England in that period, leading to local lore attributing its construction to French Huguenot immigrants. It is possible that laborers who built the house were Acadians resettled to New London after the Expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia in the 1750s. The same workers may have worked on another major stone building in the city, the Shaw Mansion.

The name of the temple in Tamil means the \\"temple of the original lord of Koneswaram\\". It is situated from the port town of Trincomalee. The temple was constructed during the 17th century as a successor to the Koneswaram temple (Temple of Thousand Pillars) that was destroyed by Portuguese colonials in 1622. Of the original temple, only the main sanctum sanctorum remains, all other buildings are of newer construction. The Gopuram or main entrance tower was added in 1953 and it is one of the tallest in the region. The temple is built of stone and is surrounded by two enclosed path ways. The presiding deity is Siva but there are important cults associated with the veneration of Pattini Amman and Kathirkamaswami accommodated within the main premises as well. The temple also has minor shrines to Pillaiyar, Navagraha, Murukan, Valli and Tevayani. The temple celebrates daily services stipulated according to Agamic scriptures along with an elaborate annual festival that involves Tamil Hindus living in the general area of Trincomalee district. There are also festivals that pertain to Pattini Amman and Kathirkamaswami. As part of the Sri Lankan civil war, in the 1980s and 90's the village was depopulated and the temple abandoned. Since 2004 residents of the village have returned and the temple has been restored. History Ati Konanayakar temple is situated in the village of Tampalakamam that was part of the medieval semi-independent feudal division called Tampalakamam Pattu. Prior to the arrival of Portuguese in 1622 and then Dutch colonial overloads in 1656, leaders of the Tampalakamam Pattu and others around it were independent rulers sometimes subject to Jaffna kingdom or Kandyan kingdom. Tampalakamam is surrounded by lush paddy fields and was a prosperous settlement. The presiding deity is known as Ati Konanayakar and the consort as Hamsagamanambikai, another name for Mother goddess Amman). These names are reminiscent of the original presiding deity of the Koneswaram temple, Konesar and Annam Mennatai. The idol of the presiding deity is dated to the later Chola period (1070-1279 CE) and the consort to that of early Chola period based on the composition of metals and styles. (See picture here and here.) The temple's name and the separate shrine to Ati Konanaykar allude to the tradition that this temple was built to accommodate the idols that were saved from the destruction of the Temple of Thousand Pillars in Tricomalee by the Portuguese colonial officers. According to Tirukonasala Puranam a Tamil chronicle written during the period of Kandyan kingdom's ascendance in the general area of Tampalakamam Pattu, the temple was built with the help of Kandyan King Rajasingha II (1630–1689) after the loss of Koneswaram temple in the Tricomalee town. The idols that were saved from the destroyed temple were moved from place to place and eventually located in a secure territory under the Kandyan jurisdiction. According to the chronicle Vara rasasinkam identified with Rajasinghe II by historians such as S. Pathmanathan, also provided for the upkeep of the temple by allocating land to the temple in perpetuity and revenue distribution from local taxes. Another Tamil text of interest is Konesar Kalvettu. It is written from a point of view legitimizing the claims of the new temple, that is Ati Konnanayakar, to the traditions, revenue and services rendered to the destroyed Koneswaram temple. Authorship of the text is attributed to one Kavirasa Varotayan and it was written after the new temple was established. According to the Tirukonasal Puranam, Rajasingha II directed the local feudal lords to maintain the temple and its administration. These traditions were maintained by the local Vanniar chiefs of the Tampalakamam Pattu division during the ensuing period. The prevalence of this tradition as a successor temple to the original temple destroyed by the Portuguese was recorded by the Dutch colonial governor of Trincomalee, Van Senden in 1786. He recorded the physical status of the idols that were from the original Koneswaram temple. Residents of Tampalakamam Patuu made requests to the Dutch colonials to follow the traditions of allocating a portion of the revenue generated from paddy cultivation of rice to the maintenance of the temple. A similar request was also made to the British colonial governor Alexander Johnston by the Vanniyar lords of the Tampalakamam Pattu, after the British had captured the island in 1815. As a substitute temple to the original Koneswaram temple that was destroyed, tradition has endowed Ati Konanayakar with all privileges that was enjoyed by the previous temple. This includes the association of Hindus from various parts of Trincomalee district its festival organization to the assimilation of all local non-Saiva cults within the temple premises. During the Kandyan and later Dutch colonial period the Tamapalakamam temple also enjoyed revenue from the land that was given to it via royal endowments. During the British colonial period the temple came under the control of private ownership. The temple's private trustees were removed and in 1945 it became the responsibility of locally elected board. The Gopuram or gate tower was added in 1953. It is one of the largest towers in the region and is of five stories high. Temple layout The temple has as its main components, Garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum, most probably the only original building left over from the days when the temple was established. There are number of halls called as mantapam, such as arta mantapam, maka mantapam, snapana mantapam and stampa mantapam where the flag of the temple is erected. The entrance tower or iracakopuram is of recent addition and was added in 1953. the smaller structures have been renovated or reconstructed from time to time since the inception of the temple in the 17th century. The temple, which is of stone construction is surrounded by a circumambulatory enclosed by a brick wall beyond which there is an outer street. Rituals and festivals The rituals and daily worship at the temple is conducted according to Hindu religious scripts called Makutakamam. Worship is conducted three times daily and on special occasions such as Thaipongal, Thaipusam and Tamil New Year day. The annual festival has peculiar features unique to this temple. The tradition allocates various functions to be performed by members of the public from the surrounding country side. The Pulavanar or bard who sings songs comes from the village of Sampur. The craftsman who has to paint the temple flag that is hoisted during the festival comes from Killiveddy. The chief priest known as Kappukattiyar comes from the Kattukulampattu area in Muttur. The temple also assimilates the cult of Pattini, a local mother goddess who is also popular amongst the majority Sinhalese population of the rest of the island nation as well. The idol of Pattini is kept at Tampalakamam temple and taken to its place of veneration in Palampottaru and devotees from Trincomalee town also come in procession to the place of worship at the same time. After the ceremonies the idol is returned to the Ati Konanaykar temple premises. Another important festival is the one associated with Kathirkamaswami. He is the lord of the temple located in Kataragama and is venerated by both Sinhalese and Tamils of Sri Lanka as a form of Murugan. His festival is a combination of prescribed Hindu ritual Agamic texts and as well as non-Agamic rituals. During this festival a casket is placed in a sacred couch and taken around the outer courtyard in a procession. Many devotees participate in this festival and perform kavadi. Another unique festival associated with the temple is called Tirukulattu velvi which is sacrificial offering made to a man made irrigation reservoir known as a water tank. According to tradition, this festival was organized during legendary king Kullakottan in the original Koneswaram temple and was directed at the Kantalai Tank. During the festival local agriculturalists would congregate at the Kantalai Tank and offer boiled rice along with areca nut and betel leaves to the idols. Abandonment and restoration As part of the Sri Lankan civil war, the Tampalakamam village was severely affected leading to the abandonment of the village and the temple. During the 1990s the village was depopulated and the population was residing in refugee camps. The temple was used as a refugee camp as well. During the ensuing period demographic change had taken place in the surrounding area. According to Tamilnet, by 2003 the village and the region was resettled with returning refugees.

Born in Wombwell, he started his career with Rotherham Town in 1919, before joining his hometown club a year later. Numerous Football League clubs enquired to Wombwell with interest in acquiring the services of Howson, and in the summer of 1922 he joined Football League Third Division North club Nelson. After initially playing in the reserves, he was called up to the first-team for the home match against Ashington on 7 October 1922 due to an injury to Clement Rigg.

History A building referred to as a castle was mentioned in 1328, and acted as the headquarters of the Teutonic Order from 1619; though by 1774 it was derelict, and demolished, being replaced by the present Baroque palace, and the English garden laid out. It was extended in 1885 with two more wings. In 1974, it was sold to the city of Leverkusen and subsequently renovated in order to permanently function as the city's museum of modern art from 1985. The museum was the first one in North Rhine-Westphalia explicitly exhibiting works by famous international post-war painters, sculptors and installation artists. It presented artists such as Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, Louise Nevelson, Andy Warhol, Burhan Dogancay and Robert Motherwell. During the last 50 years, it collected 400 paintings and sculptures and 5000 prints by contemporary artists. In 2009, the museum was named \\"museum of the year\\" by the German section of the International Association of Art Critics. A report by KPMG published in February 2016 suggested closing the museum to reduce costs.

Born Alberta Henrietta Pfau in Jasper, Indiana, she began drawing at a very early age. Later in her life she recalled, \\"I always was attracted to faces. I find faces everywhere, even in scribbles on the wall.\\" Pfau entered the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in 1933 at the age of 18, taking the religious name Sister Edith. Her main ministry as a Sister was teaching art and English in Indiana, Illinois, Washington, D.C., California and Taiwan. Pfau's education ministry included eleven years teaching at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, eleven years at Immaculata Junior College in Washington, D.C., and ten years at Providence University in Shalu, Taichung, Taiwan. Education Pfau earned a bachelor's degree in English and art from Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College in 1941. Beginning in 1944 she attended summer sessions at the Art Institute of Chicago with the intent of pursuing a master's degree, but was unable to complete the program due to her teaching responsibilities. In 1951 she earned her Master's from Indiana State University, and a doctorate in education followed from Ball State University in 1971. As an academic, she focused on the subject of art in secondary Catholic education. Pfau also completed numerous summer sessions from the University of Notre Dame and The Catholic University of America. Works and honors \\"Mater Salvatoris\\"Pfau worked in a variety of media including oil, tempera, ceramics, polymer, wood and metal sculpture, silkscreen and acrylic. Well-known works include \\"Risen Christ\\" (oil, 1964), \\"Stations of the Cross\\" (egg-oil tempera, 1951), \\"Madonna and Child\\" (sculpmetal and polymer, 1953), and \\"St. Joseph and Child\\" (walnut sculpture, 1959). She became known for colorful religious paintings, often utilizing intersections of straight and curved lines and overlapping shapes. Her oil painting \\"Mater Salvatoris\\" (c. 1958) is an example of this technique. Numerous churches commissioned works from her including a set of stations of the cross for Our Lady Providence church in Brownstown, Indiana, another set for St. Francis Savier Church (Wilmette, Illinois), and \\"Christ the Pantokrator\\" for St. Cecilia Church in Tustin, California. Several of her screen print card designs were printed and produced by Community Art Chicago in the 1950s. Pfau's work was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1947 in an Exhibit of Sisters' Manuscripts. Throughout her career, Pfau won numerous awards for her work including first prize in oils from the Indiana College Art Exhibit (1935), first prize in painting at the Wabash Valley Art Exhibition held at Swope Art Museum (1946), several awards from the national Art for Religion exhibits (1959 and 1969). She earned a solo show of polymer painting and serigraphs during her doctorate studies at Ball State University in 1969.

It is the second church to serve the diocese as its cathedral. History Interior of the Cathedral of St. Peter The parish had its beginnings with the establishment of St. William's chapel in 1915. It was established as a mission of St. Mary's parish downtown. Property on the summit of Council Hill, also known as Piety Hill, was purchased in 1920 for a new parish. A combination church and school was built on Court Street beginning in 1921. The cornerstone for the present church was blessed by Bishop Loras Lane in August 1958 and it was dedicated on May 15, 1960. Bishop Arthur O'Neill designated St. Peter's as the diocesan cathedral on October 11, 1970. St. James on North Second Street in Rockford had been the pro-cathedral of the diocese from its foundation in 1908. Bishop Lane planned to construct a large pyramid-shaped cathedral, but his untimely death and the high projected construction costs doomed the project. What he had founded in 1962 as \\"Cathedral Parish\\" for the new cathedral was renamed Holy Family Parish. O'Neill formally consecrated St. Peter's on October 11, 1978. The present altar was consecrated by Cardinal Francis George of Chicago on September 29, 1998. Pipe organ St. Peter's houses a 1978 Wicks Organ Company pipe organ, Opus 5706.

It makes products such as Duac and Oilatum. Stiefel was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline at a price of $2.9 billion. The company was founded in 1847 by John David Stiefel, Ferdinand von Hebra and Paul Unna, who initially created medicated soaps. Early history The company's origins lie in the J.D. Stiefel Company which was established in 1847, in Germany, by John David Stiefel; its first products were candles but the company began making medicated soaps within several years of its founding. In the 1880s, the company began worldwide export of its products. The company's products were brought to the United States for the first time by August C. Stiefel, the grandson of J.D. Stiefel (the founder), in 1910 and named the company Stiefel Medicinal Soap Co., Inc. By 1914, Stiefel produced 103 different toilet, perfumed, and medicinal soaps and were packaged in seven different languages. One of J.D. Stiefel Company's original products in the 1920s, was called Stiefel Freckle Soap. In early advertisements, Freckle Soap claimed to wash \\"freckles and unsightly tan\\" away. At this time, soaps were packaged in tins to prolong the product's shelf life. 1940s-1960s In 1947 the business was resurrected, and registered in the State of New York under the name the Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company, Inc., initially operating from a former creamery in Oak Hill, New York. As the product line grew and diversified beyond medicinal soaps, the company was renamed Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. In 1948, the Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company worked with dermatologists to develop the Oilatum family of products, which treat dry skin and atopic dermatitis. In 1959, Zeasorb has the ability to absorb six times its weight in moisture. Stiefel developed Zeasorb products with dermatologists, who identified the need for such a powder. Introduced in 1960, Polytar first featured the combination of tars in a shampoo. In 1966, Stiefel introduced the first benzoyl peroxide product for acne—Sulfoxyl Lotion (5% benzoyl peroxide, 2% sulfur). The treatment was introduced to Canadian dermatologists as BenOxyl Lotion. As the Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company's product line grew and diversified beyond medicinal soaps, the company name was changed to Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. At that time, all production was done at the Oak Hill, New York, facility. Eventually its network of distributors, subsidiaries and manufacturing facilities in other countries allowed the company to manufacture and distribute products around the globe. During the 1960s, sales and manufacturing operations expanded to include Canada, Puerto Rico, Germany, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Ireland and other locations. By 1969, non-US international sales had reached $200,000. 1970s-2000 In the 1970s, the company expanded into South and Central America, the Caribbean, and France. The distributorship in Canada became a subsidiary, and manufacturing operations began in Sligo, Ireland. Between 1970 and 1979, the company averaged fifty percent growth every year and sales grew to $10.4 million. In 1977 the headquarters were relocated to Coral Gables, Florida. During the 1980s, Stiefel's first research and development facility outside of the US was established in 1985 in Slough, a town near the company's United Kingdom headquarters. (It was later moved to Maidenhead.) Another R&D; facility was established in Brazil. At the close of the 1980s international sales had grown to nearly $50 million. The company's operations continued to expand and by the 1990s Stiefel Laboratories had subsidiaries in more than 30 countries and relationships with distributors in 70 others. By the end of the decade, factories were operating in Ireland, Brazil, Singapore and Mexico, supplying markets around the world. Sales had reached $180 million. In 1991, Stiefel Laboratories founded Glades Pharmaceuticals to market generic dermatology products. Glades Pharmaceuticals later matured to market a full line of products including branded-generic and branded products. Brevoxyl/Solugel Creamy Wash is launched as the first benzoyl peroxide product containing dimethyl isosorbide to dissolve the benzoyl peroxide crystals and reduce irritation. 2000 onward In 2000, Stiefel Introduced Physiogel, a brand of skin care products. In 2006, Stiefel Laboratories makes its first major corporate acquisition when it acquires California-based Connetics Corporation, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for the dermatology market. In 2007, Revaléskin was introduced formulated with the antioxidant ingredient, CoffeeBerry. William D. (Bill) Humphries was promoted to president of Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., the privately held dermatology company in 2008. An acquisition of Barrier Therapeutics, Inc. (\\"Barrier Therapeutics\\") on August 6, 2008 was also completed. Stiefel was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in July 2009 to create a new specialist dermatology business. As part of the acquisition, Stiefel Laboratories is now branded \\"Stiefel, a GSK company\\" in advertising. Stiefel launches MaxClarity and receives FDA approval of two Rx products in the United States, Sorilux Foam and Veltin Gel in 2010. In 2012, customers began to have trouble sourcing Stiefel's popular anti-acne treatment, PanOxyl. In 2013, GSK discontinued the UK version of Stiefel's popular skin drying treatment, Zeasorb.

Early life Oliver was born to Daniel and Elizabeth (Kemble) Oliver on November 24, 1800 in North Beverly, Massachusetts. Originally named Thomas Henry, Oliver's name was changed, by the legislature, in 1821 to that of his mother's brother who had died in 1802. Oliver entered Phillips Academy, Andover in 1811 and Harvard College in the fall of 1814, however because Harvard was becoming overly Unitarian in its views and also more expensive, Oliver left Harvard after his sophomore year and transferred to Dartmouth College entering Dartmouth's Junior class in the fall of 1816. Oliver graduated from Dartmouth College. Oliver also received a degree Ad eundem from Harvard. In 1844 Oliver was appointed the Adjutant General of Massachusetts by Governor George N. Briggs.  References  Project Gutenberg eBook # 17724 released 2006-02-09 THE BAY STATE MONTHLY VOL. 3, No. 4 by Various On August 12, General HENRY KEMBLE OLIVER died in Salem, Mass., at the advanced age of eighty-five years. He was born in Beverly, Mass., Nov. 24, 1800, a son of Rev. Daniel Oliver and Elizabeth Kemble; was educated in the Boston Latin School, and Harvard College (for two years) and was graduated from Dartmouth College. After his graduation, he settled in Salem, and as Principal of the High and Latin Schools, and also of a private school, he was virtually at the head of the educational interests of the town for a quarter of a century. In 1848, he moved to Lawrence, Mass., to become agent of the Atlantic Mills. While living in Lawrence, he was appointed superintendent of schools, and in recognition of his services the \\"Oliver Grammar School\\" was founded. At an early day General Oliver became interested in military affairs as an officer of the Salem Light Infantry and in 1844 he was made Adjutant General of the Commonwealth, by Gov. Briggs, and held this office for four years. During the war he served with great satisfaction as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and performed the most arduous duties in a very faithful and acceptable manner. From 1869 to 1873 he was chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and ever after that became interested in reducing the hours of labor in factories and in the limitation of factory work by children. From 1876 to 1880 he was mayor of Salem, and displayed almost the same vivacity and energy in discharging the duties of this office, as an octogenarian, that he had shown in his youth. He was master of the theory and history of music, a good bass singer, a good organist, and the author of several popular compositions. Of these \\"Federal Street\\" seems likely to become permanent in musical literature. In his youth he sang in the Park street church in Boston and for many years he led the choir of the North church in Salem. \\"Oliver's Collection of Church Music\\" is one of the results of his labors in this direction. In conjunction with Dr. Tuckerman, he published the \\"National Lyre.\\" He was a member of the old Handel and Hayden Society and the Salem Glee Club, both famous musical organizations of his early days. In 1825 General Oliver married Sally, daughter of Captain Samuel Cook, by whom he had two sons and five daughters, as follows: Colonel S.C. Oliver, Dr. H.K. Oliver, Jr., Sarah Elizabeth, who married Mr. Bartlett of Lawrence, and who died about four years ago, Emily Kemble, who is the wife of Colonel Andrews, U.S.A., Mary Evans Oliver, who has been the faithful attendant of the general in his declining years, and Ellen Wendell, who married Augustus Cheever of North Andover. https://archive.is/20130126095025/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/7/7/2/17724/17724.htm Bibliography Footnotes External links * Category:1800 births Category:1885 deaths Category:State treasurers of Massachusetts Category:Mayors of Lawrence, Massachusetts Category:Mayors of Salem, Massachusetts Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Adjutants General of Massachusetts ","title":"Henry K.

It aired on May 13, 2010 on NBC. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael is surprisingly cheerful after learning his girlfriend is married. The new parents, Pam and Jim, have trouble staying awake in the office. Meanwhile, Angela takes matters into her own hands when Dwight refuses to honor their prenatal contract.http://www.tv.com/the-office/the- chump/episode/1339610/summary.html?tag=prev_episode;title It was written by Aaron Shure and was directed by Randall Einhorn. The episode has received mixed reviews from critics and was viewed by 6.604 million viewers. Plot The entire office braces for the fallout of Michael Scott (Steve Carell) learning about his girlfriend Donna's (Amy Pietz) infidelity, but surprisingly, Michael is as cheerful as usual. The office deduces that Michael is secretly still seeing Donna. When they confront him about this, Michael becomes defensive and refuses to cut off the adulterous relationship. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), having been in the situation of the cuckold when Angela was cheating on him with Dwight, decides to step up and make Michael confront his girlfriend's husband. They both go visit him while he is coaching a high school baseball team, and Andy gets the two of them to talk. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are working out the baby contract they signed a few months earlier. Instead of going to court, they have asked a mediator to sort out the issues. After pushing through the contract line for line, the mediator determines that the contract is solid but unenforceable. Instead, Angela could sue Dwight for damages up to $30,000 for breach of contract. Knowing that Dwight could never pay her damages, she offers him a \\"settlement\\": five separate sessions of intercourse. He accepts. Later, Dwight carries out various methods to try to sterilize himself before the first \\"session\\", such as holding his crotch near a running microwave, dropping books on it, and aggressively beating it with drumsticks. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) are both exhausted from the long nights with the new baby, and their work is being adversely affected. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) catches them both sleeping at their desks and talks to them privately about it. He asks them what they would do about the rumors of printers catching fire, but they both nearly fall asleep listening to him. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) hears them discussing how to get enough energy to make it through the day, and lets them in on a secret sleeping place in the warehouse they can use. Unfortunately for them, this secret location is within earshot of Dwight and Angela's \\"warehouse meeting\\" place, where Angela complains about the damage to Dwight's testicles while Dwight gripes about having to perform foreplay. After returning from the baseball game, Michael expresses a sense of freedom and power from the knowledge that he is having sex with another man's wife. Ryan Howard (B.J. Novak) tries the same attitude and petitions Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) for sex, but cannot hold through and says he was just joking. He explains to Michael that to do what he is doing, one has to be completely cold and uncaring of what other people think, and that he does not know how Michael can do it. The rest of the office increasingly shuns Michael. He leaves to secretly meet Donna at a motel for sex, but on the way there has a change of heart and breaks up with her via text message instead. He consoles himself, alone, with his favorite ice cream, and tells the camera crew that he chose being able to live with himself over being happy. At the end of the episode, Michael is ambushed by WBRE-TV reporters asking about the rumors of Sabre printers catching fire. Production The episode was written by Aaron Shure, his second writing credit of the season after \\"The Meeting.\\" It was directed by Randall Einhorn, his fourth episode of the season and twelfth in the series overall. After the episode aired NBC posted three deleted scenes on its website.http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/the-chump-clip-one/1227563/ Cultural references When Michael is confronted from his employees about continuing his relationship with Donna even after he knows she's married, he declares a \\"moment of silence\\" in honor of Michael Jackson to shut them up. Creed says his favorite movie starring James McAvoy was Wanted. When Andy and Michael have a conversation of Michael's affair they reference the 2009 film, Obsessed (which was about an affair) with Andy calling himself Beyoncé and Michael is Ali Larter (the movie also starred Idris Elba, who had appeared in a few episodes of \\"The Office\\"). Michael calls Stanley, \\"Morgan Freeman, narrating everything.\\" When Michael asserts that he is going to eat anything he wants, when he wants, Kevin replies, \\"That's a dangerous game, Friendo,\\" probably alluding to the movie No Country for Old Men. The characters on the show make reference to a fictional video game title, Rock Band: Billy Joel, to which Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly said \\"let’s hope never actually exists ever\\". Billy Joel, in response, sought to authorize the use of his songs with the actual Rock Band series as a means to snub Franich's comment. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"The Chump\\" was viewed by 6.60 million viewers with a 3.4 rating/10% share in the 18–49 demographic going down 3% from \\"The Cover-Up\\".

Retrieved May 14, 2010 Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote that the episode was too unrealistic like previous episodes. Rabin said Michael was too much of a jerk although he noted that \\"if the episode came up short in the likability and realism department it was nevertheless funny and full of great little character moments, like the dreamy, faraway look Darryl gets while describing the warehouse employee’s secret napping spot or Ryan’s response to Michael's new gung-ho, take-charge personality.\\"http://tv.avclub.com/the- office-the-chump-1798164971 Alan Sepinwall gave the episode a negative review, stating that the opening scene (where Michael was his usual nasty self towards Toby Flenderson and the rest of the office mostly supported Michael behaving that way) was not plausible, Michael's behavior as a cuckold was not enjoyable, and the Angela-Dwight \\"procreation contract\\" story was ridiculous. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly loved the fact that Pam Beesly had been featured more on the show. He remarked on the ending that \\"Coming at the end of a mostly light episode, that was a heavy line. Nice payoff, Office.\\" Neil Turitz of TV Guide remarked \\"One of the funnier episodes of late, especially the montage of Dwight continually causing himself great pain in the crotch area. Low humor, perhaps, but still funny.\\" Will Leitch of New York said \\"All in all, this penultimate episode took care of Michael, Dwight, and every other lingering thread from a meandering season except for the big one, in a very funny last-scene reveal.\\" References External links *\\"The Chump\\" at NBC.com Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Office (American season 6) episodes ","title":"The Chump"},{"id":"27080819","title":"List of centenarians (activists, non-profit leaders and philanthropists)"},{"id":"27080824","title":"List of centenarians (actors, filmmakers and entertainers)"},{"id":"27080829","title":"List of centenarians (artists, painters and sculptors)"},{"id":"27080830","text":"La Vida Bohème is an alternative independent band from Caracas, Venezuela, formed by Rafael Perez, Daniel De Sousa, Sebastian Ayala, and Henry D'Arthenay in late 2006 and mid-2007.

During 2007 they showed their music through the local night life and festivals. Their first EP, La Vida Bohème EP, with three songs, is available for download on the netlabel Fanzinatra. Their debut album, Nuestra was recorded and produced in Venezuela by Rudy Pagliuca (guitarist of Malanga) and mixed by Leonel Carmona and mastered in Argentina by Andrés Mayo. It is one of the first albums in Venezuela to be released on free download, through the record company All of The Above. A limited-edition CD was released in the summer of 2010 and sold directly by the band at shows or other events. The band has signed a licensing deal with Nacional Records, which will distribute Nuestra in USA, Canada and Mexico. The band has also produced videos for two of the album's singles: \\"Radio Capital\\", which was released in December 2009, and \\"Danz!\\", released in August 2010. In November 2010, YouTube censored the video for \\"Danz!\\", citing the video's inclusion of nudity. In September 2011, the band received two Latin Grammy nominations from Latin Recording Academy. \\"Nuestra\\" was nominated for Best Rock Album and \\"Radio Capital\\" was nominated for Best Rock Song. In November 2011, \\"Nuestra\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album.

Probably built in the late 17th century, it is one of the oldest houses on Norwich, and well-preserved example of vernacular First Period architecture. At the time of the American Revolutionary War it was probably owned by Dr. Philip Turner, a leading surgeon for the Continental Army. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1970. Description and history The Dr. Philip Turner House is located in Norwich's Norwichtown neighborhood, on the north side of West Town Street near its junction with Sturtevant Road. It is a colonial-era \\"half house\\", 2-1/2 stories tall and three bays wide, with clapboard siding and a large chimney behind the entrance, which is in the rightmost bay. A rear leanto section, giving the house a classic saltbox profile, is a later addition. Some of its exterior siding is of significant antiquity, as it is fastened with hand-cut nails and exhibits feathering typical of early clapboards. The interior is basically two chambers on the ground floor, with a parlor in front and kitchen in the rear. There are two bedrooms on the upper floor, with original wide pine floors and period wainscoting. The house is believed to date to the late 17th century. Its early ownership and construction history are not known, but foundational evidence on an adjacent property suggests it was here that Dr. Philip Turner lived around the time of the American Revolutionary War. Turner served with the Continental Army through much of the war, acting as a surgeon at the Siege of Boston before being appointed Surgeon General of the army's Eastern Department in 1777, a post he held until the war's end. He later became a staff surgeon for the United States Army.

Jews have resided in Toronto since the early 19th century. Since the 1970s, the city has been home to the largest Jewish population in Canada and become a centre of Jewish Canadian culture. Toronto's Jews have played an important role in the development of the city. According to the 2001 census, 164,150 Jews lived in Toronto, but this number has likely gone up significantly since. History The earliest record of Jewish settlement in York is an 1817 communication between colonial offices. The report indicated that several weddings had taken place, one of which was Jewish.Speisman, Stephen A., The Jews of Toronto: A History to 1937, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1979, p. 11. However, the first permanent Jewish presence in Toronto began in 1832, with the arrival of Arthur Wellington Hart, the Harts being among the most established Jewish families of British North America. By 1846, the census indicated that 12 Jews lived in Toronto, with the number doubling the following year.Speisman, Stephen A., The Jews of Toronto: A History to 1937, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1979, p. 15. The first Jewish cemetery was established in 1849 and Toronto's first synagogue, the Toronto Hebrew Congregation, was founded in 1856.Speisman, Stephen A., The Jews of Toronto: A History to 1937, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Limited, 1979, p.22. Holy Blossom Temple on Bond Street, 1900 In the late nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century, the Jewish community and other non- British immigrants were densely concentrated in \\"The Ward\\" between College Street, Queen Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue. Mendel Ryman, who immigrated to Toronto from Jezierna, a town in the Austrian Empire, in 1903, built the first Jewish bathhouse and mikvah (shvitz) on Centre Avenue.Tales of Toronto’s first Jewish shvitz Toronto's Jews generally centred themselves in distinct neighbourhoods and ethnic enclaves. By the 1930s, the largest concentration of Jews had moved west from \\"The Ward\\" to Kensington Market with Jews representing upwards of 80% of the population.Marks, Lynne, Kale Meydelach or Shulamith Girls: Cultural Change and Continuity among Jewish Parents and Daughters - a Case Study of Toronto's Harbord Collegiate Institute in the 1920s, CWS/CF7, no. 3 (1986): 85-89, 88. Between Queen and Bloor Streets, toward Dovercourt, Jews established a distinct domicile, forming the ethnic majority in many areas. Often, employment opportunities determined the areas in which the Jews settled, as in the case of the Spadina district, a hub of the textile industry. With the election of the first Parti Québécois government in 1976 and the looming prospect of Quebec independence, many members of Montreal's largely anglophone Jewish community migrated to Toronto. As a result, Canada's epicentre of Jewry effectively moved to Toronto.Tulchinsky, Gerald, Canada's Jews: A People's Journey, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 444-445. Simultaneously, Toronto Jews left the crowded confines of the ethnic neighbourhoods within the city's core, retreating to the near suburbs along Bathurst Street.\\",\\" Toronto. Retrieved on: 2010-04-23. In the 1990s and early 2000s many Jews from the former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrated to Canada, approximately 70% of whom chose to settle in Greater Toronto. Demographics In 1871, 157 Jews lived in Toronto, rising to 1,425 by 1891 and 3,090 by 1901. The community grew in the wake of immigration from Europe, where the Jews suffered from persecution and pogroms. By 1911, the Jewish population of Toronto had grown to 18,237. The number almost doubled by 1921. In 1931, there were 45,000 Jews living in Toronto, mostly Polish Jewish immigrants. After 1924, when the United States imposed immigration restrictions, Toronto attracted a growing number of Jewish immigrants. On the eve of World War II, the Canadian government also cracked down on immigration. As a result, only small groups of Austrian and German Jews fleeing Hitler found a safe haven in Toronto during this period. In 1941, the Jewish population was 49,046,Toronto, Ontario comprising the largest ethnic minority in Toronto.Tulchinsky, Gerald, Canada's Jews: A People's Journey, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 208. Religious and cultural institutions In 1849, Abraham Nordheimer purchased land for a cemetery on behalf of the Toronto Hebrew Congregation, an Orthodox synagogue that became known as the Daytshishe Shul. In 1856, Lewis Samuel of York, England helped to found the Sons of Israel Congregation, which merged with Toronto Hebrew Congregation in 1858. In the 1920s, the synagogue became a Reform synagogue, joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. As Jews fleeing the pogroms in Czarist Russia in the 1880s began to settle in Toronto, three new synagogues were established. Goel Tzedek and Beth Hamidrash Hagadol Chevra Tehillim, founded by Russian Jews in 1883, and Shomrei Shabbos, founded in 1888 by Jews from Galicia, Poland. In 1889, two more congregations were established: Beth Jacob, known as the Poylishe Shul, and Adath Israel, founded by Romanian Jews. For ten years, Shomrei Shabbos was housed in rented buildings along Richmond Street. The first permanent synagogue was on Chestnut Street. A year later, the first rabbi was brought to Toronto, Rabbi Joseph Weinreb of Busk, Galicia. In 1933, the synagogue moved to a larger building that could seat 300 on the corner of Brunswick and Sussex. In the decades leading up to World War I, the community established Jewish afternoon schools, theatres, a newspaper, and mutual-aid societies.Toronto's first synagogues Neighbourhoods Bathurst Street has been the heart of the Jewish community of Toronto for many decades.On Bathurst, the Spine of Jewish Toronto Since the early twentieth century, Jews have lived around Bathurst Street south of Bloor Street east to Spadina Avenue (particularly in the Kensington Market district) and west to beyond Christie Pits. After World War II, wealthier members of the community moved to Forest Hill.Stephen A. Speisman. The Jews of Toronto: a history to 1937. 1979. Today, much of the Jewish community resides along the street from north of St. Clair Avenue to south of Wilson Avenue and beyond the city limits at Steeles Avenue, extending from Steeles north until Elgin Mills Road in Richmond Hill.Bathurst Manor - Jewish Toronto Since the early 1970s, the northern stretch of Bathurst has become one of the centres of the Russian Jewish community in Toronto.Newtonbrook Neighbourhood Profile - Doing Jewish in Toronto The electoral district of York Centre has the largest number of Russo-Canadian voters in Canada.

Products for the military represent 50% of turnover against 50% civilian.  History  This company was founded in 1966 by two companies : CGE (Compagnie Generale d'Électricité becoming Alcatel-Alsthom) and Saint-Gobain. The aim was to exploit industrially and commercially the work of laboratories working on laser sources and laser equipment. In 1983, it became CILAS-Alcatel. In 1985, it was absorbed by two companies of optics : SORO Electro-Optics and BBT (Barbier Bernard and Turenne). Alcatel withdraws its laser activities in 1989, resulting in a change of ownership. In early 1990, the capital is divided between three companies, CEA Industries (now Areva), SAT and Unilaser Holding (Aerospace Group). CILAS-Alcatel becomes CILAS. Meanwhile, from late 1989, the Unilaser group also acquired the Optronics Division of Alcatel Marcoussis laboratories and named it Laserdot. Unilaser now gather Quantel, LISA, CILAS and Laserdot. From this moment, Laserdot and CILAS collaborate on joint projects. Laserdot is more oriented toward research and development whereas CILAS toward industrialization and production. In 1994, SAT withdraws CILAS' capital and shares of the two remaining shareholders passed to 57% for Unilaser and 43% for CEA Industry.

The State Highway 5 (West Bengal) (SH5) passes through Dishergarh. The neighbourhood is located on the banks of Damodar River. History According to popular belief, the name \\"Dishergarh\\" originated from \\"Shergarh\\" i.e. \\"The Fort of Sher Afghan\\", the Jagirdar of Burdwan.

Probably, this fort was a holiday resort of Sher Afghan who was the first husband of Mehr- un - nissa (later Noor Jehan after marrying Jehangir). It is said that Jehangir got Sher Afghan killed to possess Mehr - un - nissa whose renowned beauty he was obsessed with.

The house has two parts, an older saltbox section, and a more typical Georgian 2-1/2 story frame structure at the front, with a side gable roof and central chimney. The house is built into a hillside, such that the front basement is fully exposed, and the main entrance is now made through an opening in the basement wall, below the original entrance. The facade is four bays wide, with an irregular placement that has the entrance at the center, two bays to its left, and one to its right. The leanto section at the rear is also two stories in height, with irregular placement of windows and doors. The interior retains many original features, including wooden paneling and fireplaces. The house was built c. 1750 by Joshua Lathrop, who operated a drugstore with his brother Daniel, believed to the first such operation in the Connecticut Colony. Joshua Lathrop remained in partnership with his brother until 1774, and then with his nephews and son until his death in 1807. The house is further historic due to the possibility that Benedict Arnold may have lived here during his apprenticeship with the Lathrops.

It has been converted to residential use. Description and history The Broad Street School building is located in a residential area north of downtown Norwich, on a lot bounded on the north by Rockwell Street and the south by Broad Street. It is a two-story masonry structure, with a granite foundation, yellow brick exterior with trim elements of brown brick and granite, and slate hip roof. It is T-shaped in layout, with a central block flanked by slightly projecting wings, and a projecting section at the rear. The central block facade is fronted by a project porch with an arcade of round-arch openings topped by a low balustrade.

The school was built in 1897 to a design by Wilson Potter, a well-known New York City architect who had already executed several commissions for Connecticut school districts. The building's relatively high-style architecture is probably due in part to its placement in what was at the time Norwich's elite residential neighborhood. The school exemplified state-of-the-art thinking about school buildings, providing high ceilings with well-lit classrooms, facilities segregated by grade and sex, and indoor plumbing.

Biography John Ross Black was born in Dunipace, Stirlingshire on 26 May 1900. His elder brother Adam played for Leicester City, and holds the record for the most first-team appearances for the club. He served in the Gordon Highlanders Army regiment in the late 1910s, before starting his football career. After his retirement from football, Black continued to live in England, and he died in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, in December 1993 at the age of 93. Career Black started his football career with Scottish Junior side Denny Hibernian in the early 1920s. In April 1921, he was signed as an amateur by Football League First Division club Sunderland. He was awarded a professional contract at the start of the 1921–22 season, but did not become a first-team regular and made only two first-team appearances for the team during the campaign. In the summer of 1922, Black signed for Football League Third Division North outfit Nelson on a free transfer. He was not inserted straight into the team, but made his debut for the club in the sixth league game of the season, a 2–0 win over Southport on 23 September 1922. He continued to play at outside-right for the next nine matches, scoring his first Nelson goal in the 1–0 win against Tranmere Rovers on 28 October, before his place in the side was taken by Sid Hoad.Dykes, p. 76 In January 1923, Black was moved to inside left for two games before a spell at centre forward in which he scored three goals in four matches, including a brace against Chesterfield on 10 March. Towards the end of the campaign he was moved into the defense, and played several games at right wing-half and right fullback. He ended the season with five goals in 23 appearances as Nelson finished as champions of the Third Division North, gaining promotion to the Football League Second Division for the first time in their history. In a higher division, Black found his first-team opportunities limited, playing six games at the start of the season, including one match in the unfamiliar position of inside-right. His final league appearance for Nelson came on 15 September 1923 in the 1–1 home draw with Hull City.Dykes, p. 77 Black transferred to Third Division North side Accrington Stanley in February 1924. He impressed during his spell at Peel Park, netting five goals in 14 league games. His performances earned him a move to Chesterfield in the summer of 1925, for a fee of £25. In his first season with the Spireites, he made 19 league appearances but failed to get on the scoresheet. Black suffered a broken leg at the start of the 1925–26 season, restricting him to only two more league games for the club before leaving to join Third Division South side Luton Town at the start of the following campaign. After almost 100 league appearances in four seasons with the Bedfordshire outfit, Black joined Bristol Rovers, where he played 49 games and scored two goals before retiring from football at the end of the 1931–32 season.

The combined films have an epic scope, spanning most of the globe over half a century. Beginning with the very first session of the United Nations, and ending in 1990 – when, after 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela, the best known leader of the African National Congress toured the world, a free man. Produced and directed by Connie Field, it includes other events such as the Sharpeville massacre, the Soweto uprising, the murder of Steve Biko,New York Times, 14 April 2010, A Fight Against Bigotry and Violence, Lasting 45 Years and 8 ½ Hours and covers the role of some people less well known outside South Africa than Nelson Mandela, such as African National Congress leader Oliver Tambo.CounterPunch, 20 April 2010, Anti-Apartheid in 8½ Hours The title comes from the lyrics of the Gil Scott-Heron song \\"Johannesburg\\". Synopsis In the 1950s many black South Africans realized that the struggle against apartheid had to be built in four arenas of action: mass action, underground organization, armed struggle, and international mobilization. Have You Heard From Johannesburg takes viewers inside that last arena, the movement to mobilise worldwide citizen action to isolate the apartheid regime. Inspired by the courage and suffering of South Africa's people as they fought back against the violence and oppression of racism, foreign solidarity groups, in cooperation with exiled South Africans, took up the anti-apartheid cause. Working against heavy odds, in a climate of apathy or even support for the governments of Hendrik Verwoerd, John Vorster and P.W. Botha, campaigners challenged their governments and powerful corporations in the West to face up to the immorality of their collaboration with apartheid. This was not just a political battle; it was economic, cultural, moral, and spiritual. The struggle came to many surprising venues: it was waged in sports arenas and cathedrals, in embassies and corporate boardrooms, at fruit stands and beaches, at rock concerts and gas stations. Thousands died, but in the end, nonviolent pressures played a major part in the collapse of apartheid and thus in the stunning victory of democracy in South Africa. Episodes 1\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: Road To Resistance The first film begins in 1948 when the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That same year South Africa implemented a system of laws called apartheid to racially segregate its people in every aspect of life. The black majority in South Africa, led by the African National Congress, mounted the Defiance Campaign, attracting the attention of activists in places like England, Sweden, and the United States - and sowed the seeds of an international anti- apartheid movement. The world reacted with horror when peaceful protesters were shot in the South African township of Sharpeville and the entire African National Congress leadership was forced underground or imprisoned. At the end of Road To Resistance Nelson Mandela is jailed for life and the movement in South Africa is effectively shut down as hundreds escape into exile. 2\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: Hell Of A Job The second film begins when African National Congress Deputy President Oliver Tambo escaped from South Africa into exile and embarked on what became a 30-year journey to engage the world in the struggle to bring democracy to South Africa. With resistance inside South Africa effectively crushed by the apartheid regime, the fate of the liberation struggle was in Tambo's hands. He first found allies in the newly independent countries of Africa, and with their collective strength behind him, he approached the United Nations for support, insisting that the apartheid government could be forced to the negotiating table if the Security Council would sanction and isolate the regime. But the Western powers refused to act, forcing Tambo to search for new support. He successfully petitioned the Soviet Union for help in building a guerrilla army, a decision that landed Tambo and the African National Congress in the vice of the Cold War and haunted his global efforts for years to come. But two individuals helped to open crucial doors in the West: Olof Palme, Prime Minister of Sweden, and Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, whose early support inspired Oliver Tambo to seek out strategic partnerships with faith leaders worldwide. At the beginning of the 1970s, Tambo and the ANC had gained financing from Sweden and support from the World Council of Churches, whose members in congregations around the world joined the fight against apartheid. With these new allies on his side, Tambo had the beginnings of a worldwide movement. 3\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: The New Generation In the third film it is youth, both inside and outside South Africa, who next joined the growing movement against apartheid. Buoyed by new support in Western countries, Oliver Tambo returned to the United Nations to try to convince the world body to sanction South Africa. His efforts gained new public support as the brutal suppression of a youth uprising in the South African township of Soweto and the controversial death of Steve Biko turned South Africa from a country into a cause, a worldwide emblem of injustice. In 1977 a significant victory was won when the United Nations issued a mandatory arms embargo: the first in history. But South Africa's strongest trading partners in the West still would not sanction it economically, and as Tambo headed to Zambia to minister to the African National Congress' growing guerrilla army, a bloodbath seemed inevitable. But even as the most powerful western governments refused to heed Tambo's calls for cultural and economic boycotts, the citizens of those western nations would help turn the tide. 4\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: Fair Play In the fourth film athletes and activists around the world, faced with governments reluctant to take meaningful action against the apartheid regime, hit white South Africa where it hurts: on the playing field. International boycotts against apartheid sports teams help bring the human rights crisis in South Africa to the forefront of global attention and sever white South Africans' cultural ties to the West. Knowing that fellow blacks in South Africa were denied even the most basic human rights - let alone the right to participate in international sports competitions - African nations refused to compete with all-white South African teams, boycotted the Olympics and created a worldwide media spectacle that forced the International Olympic Committee to ban apartheid teams from future games. The Africa-led coalition led the fight to exclude South Africa from soccer, boxing, track, cycling, judo, fencing, gymnastics, volleyball and numerous other competitions, and barred South African teams from nearly all sports events by the 1970s. Only South Africa's world champion rugby team remained, and citizens in key western countries where rugby is played took to the fields to close the last door on apartheid sports. The sports campaign became the anti-apartheid movement's first victory and succeeded in culturally isolating the white minority in an arena of passionate importance. 5\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: From Selma To Soweto The fifth film focuses on one of South Africa's most important and powerful allies, the United States. It became a key battleground in the anti-apartheid movement as African- Americans led the charge to change the government's policy toward the apartheid regime. A grassroots movement to get colleges, city councils, and states to divest their holdings in companies doing business in South Africa spread across the entire nation pressuring the U.S. Congress to finally sanction South Africa. This stunning victory is won against the formidable opposition of President Ronald Reagan. African-Americans significantly altered U.S. foreign policy for the first time in history. European sanctions followed, and with them, the political isolation of the apartheid regime. 6\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: The Bottom Line The six film is the story of the first-ever international grassroots campaign to successfully use economic pressure to help bring down a government. Recognizing the apartheid regime's dependence on its financial connections to the West, citizens all over the world, from employees of Polaroid to a General Motors director, from student account-holders in Barclays Bank to consumers who boycott Shell gas, all refused to let business with South Africa go on as usual. Boycotts and divestment campaigns brought the anti-apartheid movement into the lives and communities of people around the world, helping everyday people understand and challenge Western economic support for apartheid. Faced with attacks at home and growing chaos in South Africa, international companies pulled out in a mass exodus, causing a financial crisis in South Africa and making it clear that the days of the apartheid regime were numbered. 7\\\\. Have You Heard From Johannesburg: Free At Last The seventh, and final, film dives into the heart of the conflict, South Africans tell the story of the most important effort in the anti-apartheid campaign of the 80's: the alliance that brought together anti-apartheid forces in South Africa as never before. A mass movement gained unprecedented momentum when three generations of resistance fighters band together as the United Democratic Front. Faced with growing international isolation, the apartheid government tried to win allies and convince the world of the merit of its piecemeal reforms even as it struggled to suppress open revolt, at times using savage secret tactics. The United Democratic Front protests climaxed in a new Defiance Campaign, and internationally, Nelson Mandela became a household name as the campaign to free him ignited a worldwide crusade. Caught between an unstoppable internal mass movement and ongoing international pressure, the apartheid regime was finally forced to the negotiating table and at last lifts the decades-long bans on the African National Congress. After twenty-seven years in prison, Nelson Mandela was released, sparking a global celebration as he toured the world to thank all. After 30 years in exile, Oliver Tambo was finally able to return to South Africa. But the struggle had taken a heavy toll on him and he would die one year before his comrade, Nelson Mandela, is elected the first black president of a democratic South Africa.

The PC version had support for both EGA and VGA graphics, as well as an Ad-Lib or Soundblaster soundcard.

It follows South African AIDS activist Zackie Achmat and Canadian AIDS activist Tim McCaskell as they fight for access to treatment for HIV/AIDS. It was also inspired by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson's opera Four Saints in Three Acts. The film premiered at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Teddy Award for Best Documentary. Background Zackie Achmat is a South African HIV-positive activist who founded the Treatment Action Campaign in 1998. The organization focuses on access to drug treatment for HIV/AIDS patients who cannot afford private health care. Achmat refused to take medication himself until the South African government made antiretroviral treatments available through public sector hospitals. Tim McCaskell is a Canadian activist who founded the AIDS Action Now! organization, and has campaigned for better access to treatment. Director John Greyson has been involved in AIDS activism since the 1980s. In 2001, he and musician David Wall had the idea to write an opera about Achmat's treatment strike after a piece on him appeared in The New York Times. The work originally took the form of an eight-part video installation. It was inspired by the 1920s opera Four Saints in Three Acts by Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein. Content The film features documentary footage and interviews with Achmat and McCaskell, as well as Gugu Dlamini, Stephen Lewis, Simon Nkoli, interspersed with operatic performances. Fictional elements feature Gertrude Stein writing an opera about Achmat and McCaskell. It is narrated by a singing albino squirrel. Release and reception Fig Trees premiered at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) on February 9, 2009. It had been accepted as a rough cut and finished shortly before the festival. It went on to play at the Inside Out Film and Video Festival in Toronto, the Seattle International Film Festival, Outfest, the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, the Paris Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Watch Docs Film Festival in Poland and the Hamburg Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.

Dinah Sheldon (Shirley Temple) is a student at an exclusive girls' school who starts campaigning for women's rights. Her minister father (Robert Young) and her boyfriend Tom Wade (John Agar) do not approve. Plot In 1905, Dinah Sheldon (Shirley Temple), an enthusiastic art student, is expelled from Miss Ingram's Seminary for wearing two petticoats instead of five, attending political rallies and insisting that she be allowed to study nudes. When she is sent home to Baltimore, Dinah's understanding father, Dr. Andrew Sheldon (Robert Young), an Episcopalian pastor, easily forgives his headstrong daughter this latest calamity, but her mother Lily (Josephine Hutchinson) encourages her to be more conventionally feminine. Dinah's childhood sweetheart, Tom Wade (John Agar), also believes that she should settle down and confesses that, since her absence, he has begun dating the more \\"continental\\" Bernice Eckert (Carol Brannon). Dinah feigns indifference to Bernice, telling Tom that her only ambition is to study art in Paris, and he agrees to help her fulfill her dream. When Dinah is arrested during a brawl in a public park, which starts after four loafers begin arguing over one of her paintings, the overworked Tom is asked to provide bail for all five. Out of gratitude, Dinah offers to write a speech for Tom on equality, which he is scheduled to deliver the next night at the Forum Society's Spring Dance. While preparing the speech, which is a modified version of one of her own debates, Dinah learns that her exit from jail was witnessed by two women, who then relayed the information to Dan Fletcher (Albert Sharpe), Andrew's Scottish vestryman. Dan is upset by the scandal because Andrew has just become a candidate for the new bishop's post, and suggests that he punish Dinah. Instead, the less ambitious Andrew encourages Dinah's dreams by confessing that, as a youth, he had a short career as a ballroom dancer but gave it up to protect his father's reputation. That night, Dinah shows up late at the Forum Society, and Tom is forced to read her speech cold. He is shocked to discover that her \\"equality\\" topic is female emancipation and is laughed at by the large crowd. The humiliated Tom dotes on Bernice and informs Dinah that he no longer wants to be seen with her. Aware of Tom's rejection, Andrew offers to be Dinah's partner in a waltz contest, and father and daughter easily defeat Tom and Bernice. Later, Dinah visits Tom at the automobile garage where he works as a mechanic and begs him to pose for a portrait she intends to enter in a competition called \\"Spirit of Labor.\\" Although Tom at first refuses to help, Dinah soon talks him into posing by promising to disguise his face in the finished painting. She then dresses him in a bathing suit and hammer and paints his likeness in the seclusion of the family greenhouse. Dinah enters the painting in the contest anonymously, but because Tom's face is clearly identifiable, her identity is soon surmised. In addition, because she painted Tom as half undressed, her reputation is called into question, and Andrew, who has been nominated to the bishop's job, is suddenly embroiled in yet another scandal. Tom is then fired from his job and dumped by a jealous Bernice. Pressured by Lily and Dan, Andrew reluctantly agrees to send Dinah to her aunt in Pittsburgh until his promotion is assured. Tom, meanwhile, finds himself hotly defending Dinah's honor to Bernice, and as the contrite Dinah is about to leave for the train station, he insists on riding with her in the family carriage. On the way there, a suffrage parade is harassed by a group of jeering men, and Dinah and Lily come to the women's rescue, causing a small riot. Just as a regretful Andrew is about to rush to the station to bring Dinah home, he learns of the incident and bails his family and Tom out of jail. The next day in church, Andrew tells Dan he has been \\"ruminating\\" about his future and delivers a critical, impromptu sermon on tolerance to his congregation. Andrew's stand moves his family to tears, and just as Tom finally confesses his love to Dinah, Andrew learns that he has been made bishop. Cast Reception The film recorded a loss of $875,000.

History The event was named in after the Valley View Ferry which connects auto traffic between the county seats of Richmond in Madison County and Nicholasville in Jessamine County and is widely regarded as the Kentucky's oldest continually operating business. The event was inaugurated on 11 October 1991 and was won by the 31-1 longshot La Gueriere in a time of 1:43.49. Two weeks later La Gueriere proved that her win was not a fluke by winning the Grade I Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes. From 1994 to 1998 the event was classified as Listed and in 1999 the event was upgraded to Grade III. The race was split into two divisions in 2009 and 2012. In 2006 due to inclement weather the event was move to the synthetic track and in 2015 also the event was moved off the turf to the dirt track.

Public contributions Just like what the auto industry did to the buggy whip, the age of refrigeration came, and the harvesting of ice became a dead industry.

The school was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1985. Current population is 75. Elevation 1,791 feet. U.S. Dept of the Interior Settlers and Community On December 15, 1847, a petition was submitted to create Gillespie County. In 1848, the legislature formed Gillespie County from Bexar and Travis counties. While the signers were overwhelmingly German immigrants, names also on the petition were Castillo, Pena, Munos, and a handful of non-German Anglo names. The community was originally settled by German immigrants Dietrich Rode, a director of the original Zion Lutheran Church in Fredericksburg, and William Kothe in 1852. Texas State Historical Association Rode also served as a Lutheran lay minister in his home at Cherry Springs, leading to the establishment of Christ Lutheran Church. The still active church has some 200 members. Mr. Rode’s original home still stands near the church. The 1860 Census of Gillespie County listed 117 people in Cherry Spring. John O. Meusebach brokered the Meusebach-Comanche Treaty in 1847, making area settlers safe from Comanche raids. However, Kiowa, and Apache depredations were still committed against the settlers. The most famous white captive of the area was Herman Lehmann. Lehmann later ran the cattle drive stop that became the Cherry Springs Dance Hall. John O. Meusebach was buried in Cherry Spring in the family cemetery after his death in 1897.

Philadelphia Free Press was a 1960s era underground newspaper published biweekly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 1968 to 1972. Originally launched at Temple University in May 1968 as the monthly Temple Free Press, it separated from Temple and became the Philadelphia Free Press in September 1968. Robert Glessing described the early evolution of the Free Press in his book The Underground Press in America: > \\"The Philadelphia Free Press was initially a quiet voice on the Temple > University campus reporting only on college issues. Originally an > unimaginative, pictureless two-page paper, the Free Press grew under > doctoral candidate Bill Baggins and his activist staff to a colorful > sixteen-page format including coverage of local, state and national movement > news.\\"The Underground Press in America by Robert J. Glessing (Inidan > University Press, 1971), p. 65. The Free Press was published by a collective and distributed free at Philadelphia-area colleges, with circulation in the thousands. Operating on a shoestring, its costs were partly subsidized by record company advertisements, with one generous record company even insisting on paying $300 for a $50 ad. The Free Press was more political than its local underground competition, the Distant Drummer, which cost 15 cents and was more interested in covering rock 'n' roll than the antiwar movement.Rauch, Jennifer.

Early founders included Bill and Judy Biggin, Jim Quinn (an organizer for the DuBois Club), and Temple undergraduates Rick Rubin and Art Platt; and contributors included local gay activist Kiyoshi Kuromiya. In early 1970 some of the more culturally oriented contributors, including Art Platt, left to form their own rival paper, the Plain Dealer. The Free Press ran into a number of difficulties due to its Marxist-Leninist revolutionary politics; the paper was repeatedly harassed by the Philadelphia police under Frank Rizzo, in 1969 the paper was banned from Pennsylvania State University for its use of four letter words, Jim Quinn was briefly expelled (and subsequently reinstated) by Temple, and in 1971 Bill Biggin, a Canadian, was deported by the US Department of Justice.\\"Young Canadian to be Deported\\", Gettysburg Times, April 7, 1971, p. 5.

The show was created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin after the pair were both hospitalised for different reasons. Brock and Unwin were deeply concerned with what they saw within hospitals and decided to pitch a document in 1985 for the BBC. It was reported the pitch document 'read like a manifesto', and the show was then commissioned. Geraint Morris was appointed as the show's producer. Casualty was commissioned to boost ratings on BBC One at peak times after ratings began to decline between 1984 and 1985. Prior to first series airing, Brock and Unwin visited a hospital in Bristol where they met a charge nurse called Pete Salt. Salt was appointed the series medical advisor. The first series of Casualty consisted of fifteen episodes, which aired weekly on a Saturday night. Each episode was individually titled. The first series featured ten main characters, who were all appointed different roles within the A&E; department. By the end of the first series, two actors would not be returning for the second series: Julia Watson (Baz Samuels) and George Harris (Clive King).  Cast  = Overview = The first series of Casualty featured ten main characters. All ten characters were introduced in the first episode of the series. The fifteenth episode saw the last appearances of characters Baz Samuels and Clive King, whose respective departures would be explained in the second series. The other eight characters reprised their roles in series two. Throughout the duration of the first series, there were seven notable actors who appeared in guest roles. Graham Cole played a junior doctor in episode one, Michael Garner played PC McMorrow in episode four, Alfred Molina played Fleet Street journalist Harry Horner in episode four, while Vas Blackwood also appeared in episode four, as Bob.

During their time at the hospital, the pair were 'deeply concerned by what they saw'. Brock and Unwin pitched a document and sent it to the BBC in 1985. Unwin said in an interview with Radio Times that their pitch 'read like a manifesto', with the first sentence being: \\"In 1948, a dream was born - a National Health Service. In 1985, the dream is in tatters.\\" Unwin said that he and Brock were both 'left–wing and passionate', and that they 'knew what stories there were to tell'. After the commissioning of Casualty, the BBC decided to team Unwin and Brock up with television producer Geraint Morris. One of the reasons Casualty was produced was to help boost decreasing ratings for the BBC between 1984 and 1985 during peak viewing times on Friday and Saturday evenings. Before Brock and Unwin scripted the first series, they took a visit to a hospital based in Bristol. There, they met Pete Salt, a charge nurse. Salt was appointed the series medical advisor, advising the team of Casualty on what was and wasn't medically possible or accurate.

The House was founded with the original intention of creating accommodation for Belgian and Russian refugee students but became a centre used by students of all countries.

The song became a staple of Coborn's act, performed on tour in different languages throughout the world. Coborn confirmed that Gilbert's inspiration was the gambler and confidence trickster Charles Wells.Michael Kilgarriff (1998) Sing Us One of the Old Songs: A Guide to Popular Song 1860-1920Coborn, C.: The Man who Broke the Bank (pp. 227-8): (London: Hutchinson, c. 1928) Wells was reported to have won one-and-a-half million francsThe Times, 13 July 1893 at the Monte Carlo casino, using the profits from previous fraud. However, others suggested as the model include Joseph Jagger (see Men who broke the bank at Monte Carlo) and Kenneth MacKenzie Clark, father of famed art historian Kenneth Clark.Secrest, Meryle (1984). Kenneth Clark: A Biography. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston. p. 6. Coborn writes that he was acquainted with Gilbert, and it is thus likely that his account is correct. Coborn claims in his 1928 autobiography that to the best of his recollection he first sang the song in 'the latter part of 1891.'Coborn, C.: The Man who Broke the Bank (p. 228): (London: Hutchinson, c. 1928) An advertisement in a London newspaper suggests, however, that he first performed it in public in mid-February 1892.The Era, 13 February 1892 The song remained popular from the 1890s until the late 1940s, and is still referenced in popular culture today. Coborn, then aged 82, performed the song in both English and French in the 1934 British film Say It With Flowers.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025745/ The song title inspired the 1935 US romantic comedy The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo. Although the song appears in the film, the narrative bears little relation to either the song or to the story of Charles Wells. The film and song were involved in the copyright case Francis, Day & Hunter Ltd v Twentieth Century Fox Corp. The song appears in Booth Tarkington's 1918 novel The Magnificent Ambersons, as well as in Orson Welles' 1942 film adaptation. In the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) sings the tune while riding across the desert to the camp of Prince Faisal. A short excerpt is included in the film The Railway Children. In Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow, Tyrone Slothrop, evidently knowing the song but not having understood the lyrics properly, spends time in Monte Carlo fruitlessly looking for the Bois de Boulogne. A parody titled The Tanks That Broke the Ranks Out in Picardy was written in 1916. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). The melody of the song is used in the season eleven episode of American Dad! \\"The Shrink\\". After the lead character, Stan, employs a CIA shrink ray in order to live in a miniature city of his own creation, the character sings \\"The Man Who Built the World in His Basement\\".

Simon Van Ness owned 300 acres of the north- east boundary. He also gathered some of this land through private contracts with the Lenape Native Americans. Eventually, he ran into trouble with the Lords Proprietor of the region, so he accepted their terms and got a deed on September 3, 1744, confirming he owned the land. After his death in 1749, Simon distributed the land to his four children and two sons-in-law. His son Isaac was given most of what is now Fairfield, New Jersey. Isaac's son Peter was named executor of the will of Isaac Reyken (Ryker) on September 30, 1768. Peter Van Ness then became the first registered owner of the Van Ness House, along the Passaic River where it can still be found today. Changes to the house The house went through some renovation in the 1840s, 1930s, and today has electricity.

He began was a pilot in the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War, and rose to senior command in the Second World War. After the latter he held several senior appointments until his retirement in 1948. and in 1947 was made a Commander of the Legion of Merit of the United States of America. Sorley was instrumental in the specification of the armament of both the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane, he founded the Empire Test Pilots' School, foresaw the need for air-to-air missiles in the post-Second World War world and, having left the RAF to join De Havilland, provided the RAF with such a weapon system. Military career Sorley joined the Royal Naval Air Service in 1914. He served with distinction as a pilot in the First World War, earning the Distinguished Service Cross \\"for the determined and successful bombing attacks on the \\"Breslau\\" and \\"Goeben\\" on 20 January 1918, and subsequent days, both by day and by night.\\" In the immediate post-war years he served in Iraq and Palestine before returning in 1924 to join the staff of the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment in Felixstowe. Sorley was appointed Officer Commanding No. 8 Squadron in 1931 and squadron leader at the Operational Requirements section at the Air Ministry in 1933. It was during his time as squadron leader in charge at the Operational Requirements section that the Operational Requirement F.36/34, which governed the procurement of both the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane, was amended on his recommendationGlancey 2006, pp. 37–38. to change the armament from two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns in each wing to four .303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings.Price 1977, p. 32. This recommendation was based on extensive work carried out by Air Ministry staff, the mathematical calculations showing the need for eight machine guns being carried out by Captain F. W. 'Gunner' Hill.Keith C.H. I Hold My Aim. George Allen and Unwin, London, 1946 Sorley went on to be Officer Commanding, No. 4 Armament Training Station at RAF West Freugh in 1937. In 1939 Sorley was made Station Commander at RAF Upwood and in 1940 he became Commandant of the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;), MOD Boscombe Down, after which he became Assistant Chief of the Air Staff. In his role as Controller of Research & Development, Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1943 he created the Test Pilots' Training Flight, which was soon renamed the Test Pilots' School, the world's first such training establishment. It became the Empire Test Pilots' School the following year.Johnson, 1986, p.19. He was knighted in the King's Birthday Honours List in June 1944. After the War he was appointed Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief at Technical Training Command. Upon his retirement from the RAF in 1948, Sorley joined the Board of De Havilland Propellers Ltd as its Managing Director, a post he held for twelve years. He recognised the need to diversify from manufacturing propellers due to the advent of the jet engine and was instrumental in the development of the de Havilland Firestreak airborne infrared missile, which became the RAF's main air defence weapon at the time.

Autrey Chair in Social Sciences and Professor of Sociology in the Rice University Department of Sociology, director of the Religion and Public Life Program in Rice's Social Sciences Research Institute, and a Rice Scholar at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. She is also a Faculty Affiliate in the Rice Department of Religion. Ecklund received a B.S. in Human Development and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Sociology from Cornell University. Her research focuses on institutional change in the areas of religion, immigration, science, medicine, and gender. She has authored numerous research articles, as well as four books with Oxford University Press and a book with New York University Press. Her latest book is Secularity and Science: What Scientists Around the World Really Think About Religion (Oxford University Press, 2019) with authors David R. Johnson, Brandon Vaidyanathan, Kirstin R. W. Matthews, Steven W. Lewis, Robert A. Thomson Jr., and Di Di. Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think Ecklund's 2010 book, Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think, is a systematic study of what scientists actually think and feel about religion. In the course of her research, Ecklund surveyed nearly 1,700 scientists and interviewed 275 of them. Ecklund concluded that \\"Much of what we believe about the faith lives of elite scientists is wrong. The 'insurmountable hostility' between science and religion is a caricature, a thought-cliche, perhaps useful as a satire on groupthink, but hardly representative of reality.\\"Rod Dreher (2010 April 30). \\"Science vs. Religion: What do Scientists Say?\\", accessed 2 June 2014. In her book she mentions her most recent finding that at least 50% of scientists consider themselves to have religious traditions. Some of Ecklund's other findings about scientists' self descriptions: * 34% were atheist (12% of which also call themselves spiritual), 30% were agnostic, 27% had some belief in God (9% have doubts but affirm their belief, 5% have occasional belief, 8% believe in a higher power that is not a personal God), and 9% of scientists said they had no doubt of God's existence. While more atheistic than the rest of the U.S. population, the research demonstrates that about a third (36%) of these scientists maintain some belief in God, a considerably smaller proportion than the approximately 90% in the general American population. * Most scientists that did express some belief in God considered themselves \\"religious liberals\\". * Some atheist scientists still considered themselves \\"spiritual\\". * Religious scientists reported that their religious beliefs affected the way they think about the moral implications of their work, not the way they practice science.Rod Dreher (2010 April 30). \\"Science vs. Religion: What do Scientists Say?\\", accessed 2 June 2014. Ecklund explains that scientists who believe in God may live \\"closeted lives\\" to avoid discrimination. Others are what she calls “spiritual entrepreneurs,” seeking creative ways to work with the tensions between science and faith outside the constraints of traditional religion. The book centers on portraits of 10 representative men and women working in the natural and social sciences at top American research universities. Ecklund reveals how scientists--believers and skeptics alikes--are struggling to engage the increasing number of religious students in their classrooms. She argues that many are searching for \\"boundary pioneers\\" to cross the picket lines separating science and religion and overcome the \\"conflict thesis\\". =Criticisms= Jason Rosenhouse is Associate Professor of Mathematics at James Madison University. Rosenhouse is critical of some of Ecklund's research summaries. In particular, he contests her claim that \\"As we journey from the personal to the public religious lives of scientists, we will meet the nearly 50 percent of elite scientists like Margaret who are religious in a traditional sense\\" (page 6, Ecklund, 2010). Rosenhouse says that \\"religious in a traditional sense\\" is never clearly defined. He suggests that she may be referring to her finding that 47% of scientists affiliate themselves with some religion, but says that calling them \\"religious in a traditional sense\\" is therefore misleading, because only 27% of scientists have any belief in a God, even though many more than that associate with religious cultures.Jason Rosenhouse (2010 May 20). \\"Scientists and Religion\\", accessed 2 June 2014. Other work In 2006, Ecklund published Korean American Evangelicals: New Models for Civic Life, an examination of the civic narratives, practices, and identities of second-generation Korean- American evangelicals. The book looks at how Korean Americans use religion to negotiate civic responsibility, as well as to create racial and ethnic identity. The work compares the views and activities of second generation Korean Americans in two different congregational settings, one ethnically Korean and the other multi-ethnic, and includes more than 100 in-depth interviews with Korean American members of these and seven other churches around the country. It also draws extensively on the secondary literature on immigrant religion, American civic life, and Korean American religion. The book was reviewed in several academic journals.Reviewed in: The Christian Century v. 124 no. 23 (Nov. 13 2007) (non-academic magazine); American Journal of Sociology v. 113 no. 3 (Nov. 2007); Choice v. 45 no. 2 (Oct. 2007).

(information from Book Review Digest database, accessed 25 May 2010) Ecklund's completed research projects include the Religion among Academic Scientists (RAAS) study; the Religion, Immigration, Civic Engagement (RICE) study; the Perceptions of Women in Academic Science (PWAS) study; the Religious Understandings of Science (RUS) study; the Ethics among Scientists in International Context (EASIC) study; the Religion among Scientists in International Context (RASIC) study; the Religion, Inequality, and Science Education (RISE) study; and research on religion and medicine. Ecklund's research project, Religion among Scientists in International Context (RASIC), is the largest cross-national study of religion and spirituality among scientists. The project was funded by a multimillion-dollar grant from the Templeton World Charity Foundation. The study began with a survey of biologists and physicists at different points in their careers at top universities and research institutes in France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States—national contexts that have very different approaches to the relationship between religious and state institutions, different levels of religiosity, and different commitments to scientific infrastructure—and was followed by qualitative interviews. The study surveyed 22,525 scientists, and 9,422 scientists responded to the survey; the study included qualitative interviews with 609 of these scientists. In 2016 Ecklund, along with co-authors, published \\"Religion among Scientists in International Context: A New Study of Scientists in Eight Regions\\" in the journal Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World. Funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, the Ethics among Scientists in International Context (EASIC) study explored how scientists understand ethical issues in relation to science, with particular attention to the ways scientists’ perspectives on religion may or may not influence their ethical perspectives. To that end, researchers interviewed 211 physicists in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States about how they approach ethical issues associated with research integrity and the effects of industry financing. Ecklund has published over 70 articles in peer-reviewed social scientific, medical, and other journals.Ecklund CV , accessed 2 June 2014; similar findings obtained from searches on PsycINFO (10) and Pubmed (3), 25 May 2010. With an interest in translating academic research to a broader public, she has written blogs and essays for The Scientist, The Chronicle of Higher Education, the Social Science Research Council, Science and Religion Today, The Washington Post, USA Today, Huffington Post and the Houston Chronicle. Religion and Public Life Program Ecklund serves as the director of the Religion and Public Life Program (RPLP) at Rice University. The mission of the RPLP is to conduct top-notch research, train scholars, and engage local, national, and global communities by offering programs that advance dialogue about religion in the public sphere. The RPLP brings together scholars who study religion, religious leaders from different traditions, and students and community members from a variety of backgrounds and with diverse religious perspectives. The RPLP facilitates conversations about religion not only within the academy, but between the academy and the broader public. A relatively new program, the RPLP was launched in 2010 as part of the Social Sciences Research Institute at Rice University.

Beach House is a historic house at 18 Brightwood Lane in West Hartford, Connecticut. Built in 1900-01, it is one of the town's finest examples of Shingle style architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 23, 1990. Description and history The Charles E. Beach House is located in a residential area on West Hartford's south side. It is located on the north side of Brightwood Lane, which is now filled with residential development on the former grounds of the house's once-larger estate. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with busy asymmetrical massing, including projecting sections and gables. The main roof is pierced by two large dormers, one gabled and the other gambreled, on what is now its primary southeast-facing facade. A single-story porch extends across part of that facade and around to the west. At the western end of the attic level is a polygonal screened porch. The exterior is finished entirely in natural-finish wooden shingles, with trim painted green. A fieldstone porte-cochere is located on the northwest facade, which was the building's original front. The interior, in a marked contrast to the simple finishes of the exterior, is richly decorated. The house was built in 1900-01 on what the Beach family called Vine Hill, for Charles E. Beach, whose family were an important business and financial family in the Hartford business community. Beach's father had purchased the estate in stages beginning in 1859, and developed it as a dairy farm. Beach built this house, along with several surviving outbuildings (now separate residences on Brightwood Lane), and maintained it until his death in 1940. The family the subdivided the property, donating a portion to the town for Beachland Park. West Hartford has three major examples of Shingle architecture, of which this is the best-preserved. In 2004, the house became famous after a group of teenagers entered the property and defaced several pieces of rare Victorian furniture in the living room. According to the teens, they were absolutely trashed, and \\"have no regrets\\" since the night was \\"frickin' wicked\\". The minors also discovered the body of Leonid Fyodorov in the wine cellar of the house the same night.

In the early 1970s, Price was deputy director of the Sloan Commission on Cable Communications, an entity which produced the report \\"On the Cable, The Television of Abundance\\" (1971). Price's first scholarly and public interest achievements were in the area of American Indian Law. In the 1970s, he published Law and the American Indian. He also helped found California Indian Legal Services and the Native American Rights Fund. His work coincided with his tenure at the UCLA School of Law, where he was a professor. For much of the decade, he represented Cook Inlet Region, Inc., a Native Corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Act and served as counsel for Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles. In the early 1980s, he was the court-appointed referee in Crawford v. Los Angeles Board of Education, the Los Angeles school desegregation case. He is also the Joseph and Sadie Danciger Professor of Law and director of the Howard M. Squadron Program in Law, Media and Society at the Cardozo School of Law, where he served as dean from 1982 to 1991. Professor Price was founding director of the Program in Comparative Media Law and Policy (PCMLP) at the University of Oxford. In honor of his role, PCMLP created an International Media Media Law Moot Court competition after him, the annual Price Media Law Moot Court. He also established the Center for Media, Data and Society at Central European University. His work on media and the post-1989 transitions included service on the Commission on Radio and Television Policy, established late in the Gorbachev era to bring together Soviet and US professionals and academics working on broadcasting and society. During this period, Price established and edited the Post-Soviet Media Law and Policy Newsletter. This eventuated in a book, Russian Media Law and Policy in the Yeltsin Decade, edited by him, Andrei Richter and Peter Yu.

However, accompanying the publicity for the start of the new series were comments by producer Geraint Morris that there would be no more programmes, stating quite unequivocally that: \\"We felt it should end on a high after thirty episodes.\\" Once again as the characters of Holby's A&E; department battled to save their night shift on screen, off screen a similar battle was being waged – and won. After six weeks on air, the critics were finally warming to the series and there were no longer any Government complaints about content. Following the dramatic episode Cry For Help, in which Paramedic Sandra Mute is stabbed the programme seemed to secure audiences of more than 10 million and therefore a sense of security to the programme. An example of the series' now infamous tendency to bare similarity to real life events came during an episode where the team had to dig out bodies from a house bombed in an IRA attack. Just hours after being screen, an IRA bomb ripped through Enniskillen. It seemed that the writers had put their fingers on the country's pulse without exaggeration and from that point onwards no one dared to call it far-fetched again.

Description and history The Timothy Goodman House stands in southeastern West Hartford, on the west side of Quaker Lane (a busy north-south local artery) just north of its junction with Jackson Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide, with a large central chimney and a rear leanto section, giving it a saltbox appearance. The bays are symmetrically located but not regularly spaced, with wide spaces on either side of the center entrance. The doors, windows, and house corners all have simple trim. The interior includes a number of early 18th-century features, including wood paneled fireplace surrounds, enclosed main beams, and original period doors and door hardware. The construction date of the house is unclear. Analysis of its roof system suggests a construction date of about 1720, but no house is recorded on deeds for this land until 1778, when Timothy Goodman sold land and dwelling to Isaac and Gideon Webster. Goodman had purchased the land, without dwelling, in 1751 from the grandfather of Noah Webster.

The range of its activities is quite wide, including historical aspects of World and Armenian navigation and shipbuilding, reconstruction of ancient Armenian vessels, study of sea routes, old maps, navigation devices, banners, collecting data on Armenian navigators, making underwater archaeological surveys and research. Since 1985 the Club has organized 15 exhibitions and has carried out several surveys on Armenian navigation. 26 different types of vessels (rafts, leather boats, log- boats, boats and ships) used in historical Armenia, were restored and reconstructed. Members of the Club permanently participate in international conferences on underwater archaeology and nautical history and have published a number of articles. Medieval sailing ship replica reconstruction and test (1985-2003) \\"Cilicia ship during trip around Europe\\".The Ayas Nautical Research Club has built a replica of a 13th-century merchant sailing ship of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The ship was reconstructed in strict accordance with the information found in medieval manuscripts and miniatures, using the techniques and technologies available in the 13th century. The ship of 20 metres in length and displacing 50 tonnes was tested in 2002-2003 on Lake Sevan in Armenia. Expedition around Europe (2004-2006) The Cilicia is a functioning replica of a 13th-century merchant sailing ship of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. It has sailed the medieval sea trade routes around Europe, via the Black and Mediterranean Seas, the Atlantic Ocean, the North and Baltic Seas, the rivers of Russia and finishing on the Black Sea, passing more than 15,000 nautical miles, visiting 63 ports in 25 countries of Europe and Asia. This is the first time in the history of navigation, that a vessel has closed a full ring around Europe by water. The travel was equipped with accessories typical of the 13th century (navigation tools, merchandise goods, food, clothes, etc.) replicating the methods of navigation and the lifestyle of medieval sailors. The main goal of the experiment was to feel and to check how medieval sailors had sailed and operated with such vessels. Common responsibility to safeguard historical and cultural heritage was the objective. The Expedition highlighted the significant role of travelers and merchants in establishing connections between cultures and civilizations separated by seas, and the ship as the symbol and means of unification. Expedition to the Caribbean (2007-2008) (jointly with the ANAHIT association) In 1698 the well known pirate William Kidd had captured an Armenian merchant ship Quedagh Merchant in the Indian Ocean. He changed the name of the ship and sailed it to the Caribbean. In 1699 the ship was abandoned near the coast of the Dominican Republic. We have sailed by sailing yacht “Anahit” (ketch under Armenian flag), from Annapolis, Chesapeake bay, to the Caribbean (Dominican Rep.). We have found the remains of the vessel (guns) and investigated in site the shipwreck area. Kidd took his most valuable prize, the Armenian ship Quedagh Merchant, in January 1698 and scuttled his own unseaworthy Adventure Galley. When he reached Anguilla, in the West Indies (April 1699), he learned that he had been denounced as a pirate.

Traditional Sevanian sailing boats reconstruction (on- going project, 2008 - ) Two old ‘Sevanian’ sailing boats at Lake Sevan Ayas Nautical Research Club has restored the old Sevanian sailboat. There are plans to build 10 boats and organize an annual international regatta of the traditional sailing fishing boats of Lake Sevan. Two of them were sailed and tested in summer 2009. It is hoped that the development of such sailing as a sport will bring attention to the problems of the ecology of Lake Sevan.

Built about 1774, it is one of the town's small number of surviving 18th-century buildings, and is a well-preserved example of a Georgian farmhouse. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1986. Description and history The Daniel Hosmer House is located in central West Hartford, at the southwest corner of North Main Street and Asylum Avenue, both of which are busy through streets. It is set well back, facing North Main Street, with a low brownstone retaining wall marking a probable early route of the road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a centered doorway, and overhanging second floor. The doorway is topped by a five-light transom window and flanked by simply-decorated molding. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the main block. This house was probably built by Daniel Hosmer in 1774, around the time of his marriage, on land belonging to his family. Hosmer was the grandson of Stephen Hosmer, one of West Hartford's first settlers. The area was at the time farmland, and was sold by Hosmer in 1788. The property included a number of farm outbuildings when it was listed on the National Register in 1986; these have since been demolished.

Geography and history Gjønnes is the district southwest of Presterud, Nadderud and Bekkestua, south and east of Haslum, north of Ekeberg, Ramstad and Ballerud. Geographically, the most significant feature of Gjønnes was the Nadderud Watershed (), with several small creeks from northern Bærum confluencing south of Gjønnes farm before continuing southwest towards Øverlandselva. Most of the creek system is now led underground through a pipe system. Much of the riverbed southwest of Gjønnes is used as a pedestrian road. A grinding mill was operated at Gjønnes, but it was only usable during flooding. The name stems from the local farm, whose name has been recorded as Gieffnes (1578), Gioffuenes (1617) and Gionæs (1723). The farm has been owned by the Haslum family since 1883. In 1826 the farm was registered with 210 decares of crop, four horses, sixteen cattle and sixteen sheep. In 1939 it had 296 decares of crop, four horses, forty cattle, six swine and 25 chicken. Gjønnes farm also had a limestone oven. The former croft Kleiva was separated from Gjønnes in 1820. In 1939 Kleiva had 19 decares of crop, one horse, six cattle and 20 swine. Farming later decreased significantly, and the periphery of the farmland was soon built up with housing. This development was spurred by the creation of the Kolsås Line light rail. The farm still exists, but in 2009 politicians agreed to allow housebuilding on much of the remaining soil. Sports and education The upper secondary school Nadderud was raised at southern Nadderud, not far from Gjønnes farm, in 1958. Politicians agreed to building the school in 1957, and it had 326 students in its first year. The school building being temporary, it was only intended to exist for five years, but the number of students rose and it was necessary to proliferate the school's lifespan; in 1965 it had 547 students. The school was finally discontinued in 2004, being replaced by a new school between Gjønnes and Haslum; the name Nadderud was kept for the new school. In conjunction with the new school, a new multi-sports hall called Gjønneshallen was completed in 2005. It was the largest sports complex in Bærum at the time. It has one section mainly for team handball, and another section with a small artificial turf football field, a strip with athletics rubber and a climbing wall. It also has rooms for weight training, spinning and the like. On the other side of the school is found the headquarters of Haslum's sports team Haslum IL; a small complex with two football fields (bandy during the winter) and an indoor hall mostly used for handball. Before 1973, Stabæk IF operated a small ski jumping hill named Gjønnesbakken. It was located on the small hill Gjønnesåsen northwest of the farm. Transport Bus 42 uses the National Road 160.

By 1934 Andy had expanded his operation to include the General Motors line, which was to become one of the world’s largest automobile manufacturers. Over the decades the business has continued to grow and has now evolved into a group that consists of 22 Canadian dealerships from coast to coast. Today, The Murray Automotive Group has over 1000 employees and sells nearly 15,000 vehicles each year. History =Abbotsford= In May 2003 Hall Pontiac Buick GMC in Abbotsford, British Columbia was purchased by the Murray Automotive Group and became Murray Pontiac Buick GMC. In June 2007 Abbotsford Motorcade, Abbotsford's Chevrolet Cadillac dealership, was purchased by the Group and became Murray Chevrolet Cadillac. By mid-2008, the two dealerships were granted permission by General Motors to combine operations at the Murray Chevrolet Cadillac site in the Fraser Valley Automall and became Murray Chevrolet Cadillac Pontiac Buick GMC (commonly referred to as Murray GM - Abbotsford). Stocking a large inventory of both new and used vehicles, they service the Fraser Valley and Lower Mainland areas of British Columbia. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the dealership was given first place balloting in the Abbotsford Times Readers Choice Award as Abbotsford's Best New Car/Truck Dealership's. In July 2013, Murray Kia in Abbotsford opened in the Fraser Valley Automall next door to Murray GM. =Yarmouth= In April 2008 Yarmouth Motormart in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia as well as its satellite location in Barrington, Nova Scotia was acquired by the Murray Automotive Group. These two dealerships marked the Murray Auto Group's first acquisitions in Eastern Canada. The two locations which were being operated by Pat Sullivan since the death of her husband Chris Sullivan, were renamed \\"Murray GM Yarmouth & Barrington\\". The new managing partner is Jeff Little, a 15-year General Motors of Canada employee. In September 2014 an announcement was made that Jeff Little & the Murray Automotive Group will be bringing the Dodge, Chrysler Jeep and Ram brands to Yarmouth with a new Murray Dodge dealership. The new store is scheduled to open early 2015. =Leduc= Murray Chevrolet in Leduc, Alberta joined the Murray Automotive Group in August 2008. It dealt largely in trucks due to the large number of oil and farm businesses nearby. In June 2009 General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and as part of the restructuring plan it chose to not renew its sales and service agreements with 245 Canadian dealerships. Leduc received its termination letter in spring 2009, although having planned to keep their doors open until October 2010, they received an offer for the property and decided to sell. They closed their doors November 30, 2009. Awards and Distinctions =Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies= The Murray Automotive Group was awarded Platinum status in 2009. This distinction is only given to businesses that qualify for Best Managed for a minimum of 6 consecutive years. =Canada's top 100 employers= In 2005 the Murray Automotive Group was selected by Mediacorp Canada Inc. as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers.

The stamps are known as such because they were only printed in those two colours; lilac being used for the d, 2d, d, 3d values and dull green for the 4d, 5d, 6d, 9d and 1s. New stamps were required because The Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1881 necessitated postage stamps that were also valid as revenue stamps. Therefore, the Penny Lilac issued that year was inscribed \\"POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE\\" and the Lilac and Green stamps were inscribed \\"POSTAGE & REVENUE\\", whereas the previous 1880 stamps (known as the Provisional Issue) were only inscribed \\"POSTAGE\\". The colours were used because the authorities were concerned that the existing stamps were being soaked off envelopes and reused, and they wished to use fugitive inks that would wash away if immersed in water; the only fugitive ink colours available at the time were lilac and green. The first stamp to be introduced was the 9d on 1 August 1883, which was rushed into use because there was an urgent need for a stamp of that value; the others followed on 1 April 1884. The designs featured Queen Victoria’s head in profile, with lettering in the corners. The 2d, d, 6d, and 9d stamps were in horizontal format and the d, 3d, 4d, 5d and 1s were vertical. The dull stamps were not popular, and the 1884 Stamp Committee was formed to make decisions about improved replacements. In 1887 they were superseded by the Jubilee Issue, with a variety of designs and colours.Stanley Gibbons Great Britain Specialised Stamp Catalogue Volume 1: Queen Victoria Due to the fugitive nature of the ink, many surviving examples of the green stamps have lost their original colour following soaking to remove them from paper; the examples that still have good colour are the most sought after by philatelists.

The saddle-point approximation is used with integrals in the complex plane, whereas Laplace’s method is used with real integrals. The integral to be estimated is often of the form :\\\\int_Cf(z)e^{\\\\lambda g(z)}\\\\,dz, where C is a contour, and λ is large. One version of the method of steepest descent deforms the contour of integration C into a new path integration C′ so that the following conditions hold: # C′ passes through one or more zeros of the derivative g′(z), # the imaginary part of g(z) is constant on C′. The method of steepest descent was first published by , who used it to estimate Bessel functions and pointed out that it occurred in the unpublished note by about hypergeometric functions. The contour of steepest descent has a minimax property, see . described some other unpublished notes of Riemann, where he used this method to derive the Riemann–Siegel formula.

The following is the main tool for constructing the asymptotics of integrals in the case of a non-degenerate saddle point: =Complex Morse lemma= The Morse lemma for real-valued functions generalizes as followsLemma 3.3.2 on page 113 in for holomorphic functions: near a non-degenerate saddle point of a holomorphic function , there exist coordinates in terms of which is exactly quadratic.

An illustration of Complex Morse lemma Proof of complex Morse lemma The following proof is a straightforward generalization of the proof of the real Morse Lemma, which can be found in., page 54; see also the comment on page 479 in . We begin by demonstrating :Auxiliary statement. Let be holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin and . Then in some neighborhood, there exist functions such that ::f(z) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i g_i(z), :where each is holomorphic and ::g_i(0) = \\\\left. \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f(z)}{\\\\partial z_i} \\\\right_{z=0}. Proof of auxiliary statement From the identity :f(z) = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{d}{dt} f \\\\left (t z_1,\\\\cdots, t z_n \\\\right ) dt = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial f(z)}{\\\\partial z_i}\\\\right_{z=(t z_1, \\\\ldots, t z_n)} dt, we conclude that :g_i(z) = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial f(z)}{\\\\partial z_i}\\\\right_{z=(t z_1, \\\\ldots, t z_n)} dt and :g_i(0) = \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial f(z)}{\\\\partial z_i} \\\\right_{z=0}. Without loss of generality, we translate the origin to , such that and . Using the Auxiliary Statement, we have :S(z) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i g_i (z). Since the origin is a saddle point, :\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial S(z)}{\\\\partial z_i} \\\\right_{z=0} = g_i(0) = 0, we can also apply the Auxiliary Statement to the functions and obtain :S(z) = \\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n z_i z_j h_{ij}(z). (1) Recall that an arbitrary matrix can be represented as a sum of symmetric and anti-symmetric matrices, :A_{ij} = A_{ij}^{(s)} + A_{ij}^{(a)}, \\\\qquad A_{ij}^{(s)} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\left( A_{ij} + A_{ji} \\\\right), \\\\qquad A_{ij}^{(a)} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\left( A_{ij} - A_{ji} \\\\right). The contraction of any symmetric matrix B with an arbitrary matrix is :\\\\sum_{i,j} B_{ij} A_{ij} = \\\\sum_{i,j} B_{ij} A_{ij}^{(s)}, (2) i.e., the anti-symmetric component of does not contribute because :\\\\sum_{i,j} B_{ij} C_{ij} = \\\\sum_{i,j} B_{ji} C_{ji} = - \\\\sum_{i,j} B_{ij} C_{ij} = 0. Thus, in equation (1) can be assumed to be symmetric with respect to the interchange of the indices and . Note that :\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S(z)}{\\\\partial z_i \\\\partial z_j} \\\\right_{z=0} = 2h_{ij}(0); hence, because the origin is a non-degenerate saddle point. Let us show by induction that there are local coordinates , such that :S(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}(u)) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2. (3) First, assume that there exist local coordinates , such that :S(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(y)) = y_1^2 + \\\\cdots + y_{r-1}^2 + \\\\sum_{i,j = r}^n y_i y_j H_{ij} (y), (4) where is symmetric due to equation (2). By a linear change of the variables , we can assure that . From the chain rule, we have :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(y))}{\\\\partial y_i \\\\partial y_j} = \\\\sum_{l,k=1}^n \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S (z)}{\\\\partial z_k \\\\partial z_l} \\\\right_{z=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(y)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_k}{\\\\partial y_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_l}{\\\\partial y_j} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial S (z)}{\\\\partial z_k } \\\\right_{z=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(y)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\phi_k}{\\\\partial y_i \\\\partial y_j} Therefore: :S_{yy} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(0)) = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}'_y(0)^T S_{zz}(0) \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}'_y(0), \\\\qquad \\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}'_y(0) eq 0; whence, :0 eq \\\\det S_{yy} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(0)) = 2^{r-1} \\\\det \\\\left( 2H_{ij}(0) \\\\right). The matrix can be recast in the Jordan normal form: , were gives the desired non-singular linear transformation and the diagonal of contains non-zero eigenvalues of . If then, due to continuity of , it must be also non-vanishing in some neighborhood of the origin. Having introduced \\\\tilde{H}_{ij}(y) = H_{ij}(y)/H_{rr}(y), we write :\\\\begin{align} S(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(y)) =& y_1^2 + \\\\cdots + y_{r-1}^2 + H_{rr}(y) \\\\sum_{i,j = r}^n y_i y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{ij} (y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ =& y_1^2 + \\\\cdots + y_{r-1}^2 + H_{rr}(y)\\\\left[ y_r^2 + 2y_r \\\\sum_{j=r+1}^n y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{rj} (y) + \\\\sum_{i,j = r+1}^n y_i y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{ij} (y) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ =& y_1^2 + \\\\cdots + y_{r-1}^2 + H_{rr}(y)\\\\left[ \\\\left( y_r + \\\\sum_{j=r+1}^n y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{rj} (y)\\\\right)^2 - \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=r+1}^n y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{rj} (y)\\\\right)^2 \\\\right] + H_{rr}(y) \\\\sum_{i,j = r+1}^n y_i y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{ij}(y) \\\\end{align} Motivated by the last expression, we introduce new coordinates :x_r = \\\\sqrt{ H_{rr}(y) } \\\\left( y_r + \\\\sum_{j=r+1}^n y_j \\\\tilde{H}_{rj} (y)\\\\right), \\\\qquad x_j = y_j, \\\\quad \\\\forall j eq r. The change of the variables is locally invertible since the corresponding Jacobian is non-zero, :\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\partial x_r}{\\\\partial y_k} \\\\right_{y=0} = \\\\sqrt{H_{rr}(0)} \\\\left[ \\\\delta_{r,\\\\, k} + \\\\sum_{j=r+1}^n \\\\delta_{j, \\\\, k} \\\\tilde{H}_{jr}(0) \\\\right]. Therefore, :S(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}(x)) = {x}_1^2 + \\\\cdots + {x}_r^2 + \\\\sum_{i,j = r+1}^n {x}_i {x}_j W_{ij} (x). (5) Comparing equations (4) and (5), we conclude that equation (3) is verified. Denoting the eigenvalues of S_{zz}(0) by , equation (3) can be rewritten as :S(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(w)) = \\\\frac 12 \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\mu_j w_j^2. (6) Therefore, :S_{ww} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(0)) = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}'_w(0)^T S_{zz}(0) \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}'_w(0), (7) From equation (6), it follows that \\\\det S_{ww} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(0)) = \\\\mu_1 \\\\cdots \\\\mu_n. The Jordan normal form of S_{zz}(0) reads S_{zz}(0) = P J_z P^{-1}, where is an upper diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues and ; hence, \\\\det S_{zz} (0) = \\\\mu_1 \\\\cdots \\\\mu_n. We obtain from equation (7) :\\\\det S_{ww} (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(0)) = \\\\left[\\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}'_w(0) \\\\right]^2 \\\\det S_{zz}(0) \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}'_w(0) = \\\\pm 1. If \\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}'_w(0) = -1, then interchanging two variables assures that \\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}'_w(0) = +1. = The asymptotic expansion in the case of a single non-degenerate saddle point = Assume # and are holomorphic functions in an open, bounded, and simply connected set such that the is connected; # \\\\Re(S(z)) has a single maximum: \\\\max_{z \\\\in I_x} \\\\Re(S(z)) = \\\\Re(S(x^0)) for exactly one point ; # is a non-degenerate saddle point (i.e., and \\\\det S_{xx}(x^0) eq 0). Then, the following asymptotic holds :I(\\\\lambda) \\\\equiv \\\\int_{I_x} f(x) e^{\\\\lambda S(x)} dx = \\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{n}{2}} e^{\\\\lambda S(x^0)} \\\\left(f(x^0)+ O\\\\left(\\\\lambda^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\prod_{j=1}^n (-\\\\mu_j)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}, \\\\qquad \\\\lambda \\\\to \\\\infty, (8) where are eigenvalues of the Hessian S_{xx}(x^0) and (-\\\\mu_j)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} are defined with arguments :\\\\left  \\\\arg\\\\sqrt{-\\\\mu_j} \\\\right < \\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{4}. (9) This statement is a special case of more general results presented in Fedoryuk (1987)., pages 417-420. Derivation of equation (8) An illustration to the derivation of equation (8) First, we deform the contour into a new contour I'_x \\\\subset \\\\Omega_x passing through the saddle point and sharing the boundary with . This deformation does not change the value of the integral . We employ the Complex Morse Lemma to change the variables of integration. According to the lemma, the function maps a neighborhood onto a neighborhood containing the origin. The integral can be split into two: , where is the integral over U\\\\cap I'_x, while is over I'_x \\\\setminus (U\\\\cap I'_x) (i.e., the remaining part of the contour ). Since the latter region does not contain the saddle point , the value of is exponentially smaller than as ;This conclusion follows from a comparison between the final asymptotic for , given by equation (8), and a simple estimate for the discarded integral . thus, is ignored. Introducing the contour such that U\\\\cap I'_x = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(I_w), we have :I_0(\\\\lambda) = e^{\\\\lambda S(x^0)} \\\\int_{I_w} f[\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}(w)] \\\\exp\\\\left( \\\\lambda \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\tfrac{\\\\mu_j}{2} w_j^2 \\\\right) \\\\left \\\\det\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}_w'(w) \\\\right  dw. (10) Recalling that as well as \\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}_w'(0) = 1, we expand the pre-exponential function into a Taylor series and keep just the leading zero- order term :I_0(\\\\lambda) \\\\approx f(x^0) e^{\\\\lambda S(x^0)} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^n} \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\lambda \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\tfrac{\\\\mu_j}{2} w_j^2 \\\\right) dw = f(x^0)e^{\\\\lambda S(x^0)} \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\lambda \\\\mu_j y^2} dy. (11) Here, we have substituted the integration region by because both contain the origin, which is a saddle point, hence they are equal up to an exponentially small term.This is justified by comparing the integral asymptotic over [see equation (8)] with a simple estimate for the altered part. The integrals in the r.h.s. of equation (11) can be expressed as :\\\\mathcal{I}_j = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\lambda \\\\mu_j y^2} dy = 2\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\lambda \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{-\\\\mu_j} y\\\\right)^2} dy = 2\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\lambda \\\\left \\\\sqrt{-\\\\mu_j} \\\\right^2 y^2\\\\exp\\\\left(2i\\\\arg\\\\sqrt{-\\\\mu_j}\\\\right)} dy. (12) From this representation, we conclude that condition (9) must be satisfied in order for the r.h.s. and l.h.s. of equation (12) to coincide. According to assumption 2, \\\\Re \\\\left( S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right) is a negatively defined quadratic form (viz., \\\\Re(\\\\mu_j)<0) implying the existence of the integral \\\\mathcal{I}_j, which is readily calculated :\\\\mathcal{I}_j = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{-\\\\mu_j}\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}} \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\xi^2}{2}} d\\\\xi = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}} (-\\\\mu_j)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}. Equation (8) can also be written as :I(\\\\lambda) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{n}{2}} e^{\\\\lambda S(x^0)} \\\\left ( \\\\det (-S_{xx}(x^0)) \\\\right )^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\left (f(x^0) + O\\\\left(\\\\lambda^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\right), (13) where the branch of :\\\\sqrt{\\\\det \\\\left (-S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right)} is selected as follows :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left (\\\\det \\\\left (-S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right ) \\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} &= \\\\exp\\\\left( -i \\\\text{ Ind} \\\\left (- S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right ) \\\\right) \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\left \\\\mu_j \\\\right^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Ind} \\\\left (-S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right) &= \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\arg (-\\\\mu_j), && \\\\arg(-\\\\mu_j) < \\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}. \\\\end{align} Consider important special cases: * If is real valued for real and in (aka, the multidimensional Laplace method), thenSee equation (4.4.9) on page 125 in ::\\\\text{Ind} \\\\left(-S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right ) = 0. * If is purely imaginary for real (i.e., \\\\Re(S(x)) = 0 for all in ) and in (aka, the multidimensional stationary phase method),Rigorously speaking, this case cannot be inferred from equation (8) because the second assumption, utilized in the derivation, is violated. To include the discussed case of a purely imaginary phase function, condition (9) should be replaced by \\\\left  \\\\arg\\\\sqrt{-\\\\mu_j} \\\\right  \\\\leqslant \\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{4}. thenSee equation (2.2.6') on page 186 in ::\\\\text{Ind} \\\\left (-S_{xx}(x^0) \\\\right ) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} \\\\text{sign }S_{xx}(x_0), :where \\\\text{sign }S_{xx}(x_0) denotes the signature of matrix S_{xx}(x_0), which equals to the number of negative eigenvalues minus the number of positive ones. It is noteworthy that in applications of the stationary phase method to the multidimensional WKB approximation in quantum mechanics (as well as in optics), is related to the Maslov index see, e.g., and .  The case of multiple non-degenerate saddle points  If the function has multiple isolated non-degenerate saddle points, i.e., : abla S \\\\left (x^{(k)} \\\\right ) = 0, \\\\quad \\\\det S_{xx} \\\\left (x^{(k)} \\\\right ) eq 0, \\\\quad x^{(k)} \\\\in \\\\Omega_x^{(k)}, where :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\Omega_x^{(k)} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^K is an open cover of , then the calculation of the integral asymptotic is reduced to the case of a single saddle point by employing the partition of unity. The partition of unity allows us to construct a set of continuous functions such that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\rho_k(x) &= 1, && \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\Omega_x, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho_k(x) &= 0 && \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\Omega_x\\\\setminus \\\\Omega_x^{(k)}. \\\\end{align} Whence, :\\\\int_{I_x \\\\subset \\\\Omega_x} f(x) e^{\\\\lambda S(x)} dx \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\int_{I_x \\\\subset \\\\Omega_x} \\\\rho_k(x) f(x) e^{\\\\lambda S(x)} dx. Therefore as we have: :\\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\int_{\\\\text{a neighborhood of }x^{(k)}} f(x) e^{\\\\lambda S(x)} dx = \\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{n}{2}} \\\\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\\\\lambda S \\\\left (x^{(k)} \\\\right )} \\\\left ( \\\\det \\\\left(-S_{xx} \\\\left (x^{(k)} \\\\right )\\\\right) \\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} f \\\\left (x^{(k)} \\\\right ), where equation (13) was utilized at the last stage, and the pre-exponential function at least must be continuous.  The other cases  When and \\\\det S_{zz}(z^0) = 0, the point is called a degenerate saddle point of a function . Calculating the asymptotic of : \\\\int f(x) e^{\\\\lambda S(x)} dx, when is continuous, and has a degenerate saddle point, is a very rich problem, whose solution heavily relies on the catastrophe theory. Here, the catastrophe theory replaces the Morse lemma, valid only in the non-degenerate case, to transform the function into one of the multitude of canonical representations. For further details see, e.g., and . Integrals with degenerate saddle points naturally appear in many applications including optical caustics and the multidimensional WKB approximation in quantum mechanics. The other cases such as, e.g., and/or are discontinuous or when an extremum of lies at the integration region's boundary, require special care (see, e.g., and ). Extensions and generalizations An extension of the steepest descent method is the so-called nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method. Here, instead of integrals, one needs to evaluate asymptotically solutions of Riemann-Hilbert factorization problems. Given a contour C in the complex sphere, a function f defined on that contour and a special point, say infinity, one seeks a function M holomorphic away from the contour C, with prescribed jump across C, and with a given normalization at infinity. If f and hence M are matrices rather than scalars this is a problem that in general does not admit an explicit solution. An asymptotic evaluation is then possible along the lines of the linear stationary phase/steepest descent method. The idea is to reduce asymptotically the solution of the given Riemann-Hilbert problem to that of a simpler, explicitly solvable, Riemann-Hilbert problem. Cauchy's theorem is used to justify deformations of the jump contour. The nonlinear stationary phase was introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993, based on earlier work of the Russian mathematician Alexander Its. A (properly speaking) nonlinear steepest descent method was introduced by Kamvissis, K. McLaughlin and P. Miller in 2003, based on previous work of Lax, Levermore, Deift, Venakides and Zhou. As in the linear case, steepest descent contours solve a min-max problem. In the nonlinear case they turn out to be \\"S-curves\\" (defined in a different context back in the 80s by Stahl, Gonchar and Rakhmanov). The nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method has applications to the theory of soliton equations and integrable models, random matrices and combinatorics.

In 1810 the Twin Springs Hotel (later known as the Mineral Spring Hotel, part of the Crowninshield estate and the Fay Estate Mansion of Lynn) was built near the spring, whose water was rich in iron and believed to possess medicinal qualities. Patients traveled great distances to drink the water and, for a time, to worship the goddess Hygeia to restore their health. This \\"classical worship\\" damaged the hotel's reputation, and it was later converted into the private summer residence of Richard Sullivan Fay.https://books.google.com/books?id=zMAWAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA109-IA2&dq;=%22spring+pond%22+hygeia&lr;=&cd;=2#v=onepage&q;=%22by%20the%20ruddy%20spring%20upon%20an%20estate%20partly%20in%20Salem%2C%20partly%20in%20Lynn%22&f;=false The Register of the Lynn Historical Society, Volumes 16-18 By Lynn Historical Society (Lynn, Mass.), page 107-109 From 1847–1865 Fay (an Anglo-American farmer, merchant and manufacturer) lived on a estate on the hillsides surrounding Spring Pond partly in Lynn (the present Fay Estate), partly in present-day Salem (the present Camp Lion and WalMart, extending to Danvers Road), growing in his arboretum (which was open to the public) a variety of rare and exotic trees and shrubs imported from other parts of the world; many arrived here first in the United States, among them the American tulip tree.

Ltd. of Ryland Street, Birmingham, using an X-ray photograph by Hall-Edwards, and bearing his signature Blue plaque outside Birmingham Children's Hospital, formerly Birmingham General Hospital The monument to the Martyrs of Radiology in Hamburg John Francis Hall-Edwards FRSE (19 December 1858 – 15 August 1926) was a British doctor and pioneer in the medical use of X-rays in the United Kingdom. Life Hall-Edwards was the son of John Edwards, and was born on Moseley Road, Kings Norton near Birmingham. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Birmingham. He then studied medicine, apprenticing under Prof Richard Hill Norris at Queens College Medical School. Norris was both a surgeon and keen amateur photographer, being an early user of the dry-plate process, and he familiarised Hall-Edwards with photographic techniques. Hall- Edwards was licensed to practice medicine by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. From around 1885 he shows a strong interest in photography and was President of the Midland Photographic Club 1891-93. In 1895 he was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Photographic Society following a lecture to the London Camera Club. Initially his work focussed on photography through microscopes. On 11 January 1896 he made the first use of X-rays under clinical conditions when he radiographed the hand of an associate, revealing a sterilised needle beneath the surface. A month later on 14 February he took the first radiograph to direct a surgical operation. He also took the first X-ray of the human spine. In 1899 he was made the first Surgeon Radiographer – at the General Hospital in Birmingham (also serving outlying hospitals). In February 1900 he joined the Warwickshire Regiment to act as the first military radiographer, joining them in the Boer War in South Africa, being based at both Deelfontein and Pretoria. He remained in this role for fourteen months. In 1906 he was elected first President of the British Electric-Therapeutic Society. Hall-Edwards's interest in X-rays cost him his left arm. A cancer (then called X-ray dermatitis) was sufficiently advanced by 1904 to cause him to write papers and give public addresses on the dangers of X-rays and only then were protective measures begun. He lost his personal battle and his left arm had to be amputated at the elbow in 1908, and four fingers on his right arm soon thereafter, leaving only a thumb. His left hand is at the Birmingham University Museum as a specimen to demonstrate the effects of radiation. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1911. His proposers were Edmond Carlier, Richard Hill Norris, Dawson Turner and Joseph Riley Ratcliffe. He served as a City Councillor in Birmingham from 1920 to 1925. He sat on the Public Health Committee and did much to promote knowledge and understanding of cancer in the medical field. He died of cancer at his home, 112 Gough Road in Edgbaston, on 15 August 1926. He was cremated at Perry Barr Crematorium. His name was one of 169 included on the Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected in Hamburg, Germany in 1936.

The title was created in 1975 by King Juan Carlos and bestowed upon Carmen Franco, the daughter and only child of Spain's Caudillo, General Francisco Franco. Together with the dukedom, she received a coat of arms of new creation. These arms are a variation of the arms of Andrade family of Galicia, from whom Franco was descended through females. In 1950, Carmen Franco, 1st Duchess of Franco, had married Cristóbal Martínez-Bordiú, 10th Marquess of Villaverde, by whom she had several children. Dukes and duchesses of Franco are also Grandees of Spain. After the death of the 1st Duchess of Franco, succession of the ducal title with accompanying dignity has been requested by her eldest daughter María del Carmen Martínez-Bordiú y Franco.Boletín Oficial del Estado: no. 74, p. 25370, 26 March 2018. Retrieved 2018-04-30 Under Spanish nobiliary law, her eldest daughter Maria is first in line, but does not succeed automatically; with the application to the Crown and the issue of the Royal Letter of Succession, and after an announcement period of thirty days, succession only legally enters into force after a tax is paid. In 2018, the far-left Izquierda Unida party sent a letter to King Felipe VI asking that title of Duke or Duchess of Franco be repressed as a violation of Spain's Historical Memory Law but the power to make or unmake nobility resides solely in the Spanish monarch and is not covered by that law. The Dukedom was granted to the heir apparent, María del Carmen Martínez-Bordíu y Franco, the eldest daughter of the late Duchess, on the same year, as published in the Official State Gazette on 4 July 2018.

Women who joined the WTC were commonly known as Lumber Jills.Brayley & McGregor p. 51. Formation Formed in 1942, the origins of the WTC go back to the First World War when the Women's Timber Service had been formed to help with the war effort. In 1940 to solve a labour shortage and an increased demand for timber the Forestry Commission started recruiting women both as forestry workers but also to work in sawmills.Swanston p. 1. In 1942 responsibility passed from the Forestry Commission to the Home Timber Production Department of the Ministry of Supply and the women became part of the new corps. Organisation As many of the women who had joined the Forestry Commission came from the Women's Land Army (WLA), the WLA took over the administration and recruitment for the WTC and although the WTC was officially part of the WLA it retained a separate identity. The uniforms were identical except that the WTC replaced the WLA felt hat for a beret and wore the WTC badge. A full set of kit consisted of:- * 2 green jerseys * 2 pairs of riding breeches * 2 overall coats * 2 pairs of dungarees * 6 pairs of woolen knee socks * 3 beige knit shirts * 1 pair boots * 1 pair of brown shoes * 1 pair of gumboots or boots with leggings * 1 green beret * 1 melton overcoat * 1 oilskin or mackintosh * 2 towels * a green armlet and a metal badge * a bakelite hat badge The corps was divided into nine geographic areas responsible for the work and welfare of the women in that area.Swanston p. 3. Accommodation ranged from purpose built hutted camps, through small hotels and hostels to private billets. Never as large as the WLA, the WLC did have a maximum strength of over 6,000 working throughout the United Kingdom. The corps was a mobile organisation so the workers could be posted anywhere. Duties The work of the WTC included all the jobs involved with forestry including felling, snedding, loading, crosscutting, driving tractors, trucks, working with horses and operating sawmills. A more specialist skill was measuring which was the job of assessing the amount of timber in a tree, measuring the amount of timber felled, surveying new woodlands and identifying trees for felling. Initial training consisted of a four to six week course at one of the Corps depots before being posted to a billet elsewhere. The work was heavy and arduous but there was a grudging acceptance from farmers and foresters that the women of the WTC were as good as the men they had replaced. Pay ranged from 35 to 46 shillings per week.Hendrie p. 41. Towards the end of the war some of the women were considered skilled enough to be posted to Germany to help salvage the sawmills there.Elder Disbandment and subsequent recognition The WTC was disbanded in 1946 when each member was awarded a personal letter signed by Queen Elizabeth. Other than this no recognition of the WTC (or the WLA) was made and it was not until 2000 that former members of the WTC were allowed to take part in the annual Remembrance Sunday parade in London. In 2007, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced that all surviving members of the WTC would be entitled to wear a new badge to commemorate their service in the Corps. In 2012, the Forestry Commission marked the 70th anniversary of the WTC. On Remembrance Day 2012, BBC Countryfile broadcast a tribute to the work of the WTC with veteran members, filmed in the Forest of Dean. National memorial Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum On 10 October 2007 Forestry Commission Scotland unveiled a national memorial to the women of the WTC in the form of a life size bronze sculpture by Malcolm Robertson. The statue is in the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park near Aberfoyle, Stirling. In October 2014, a memorial statue to both the Women's Land Army and the Women's Timber Corps was formally unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.

He composed more than 50 works for carillon and made more than 700 transcriptions of carillon music; many of which are still performed in Europe and North America. In 1958, he won the International Carillonneurs' Prize at the Brussels World's Fair. For RCA Victor he released the LP album Carols at the Carillon of Saint Joseph's Oratory for which he wrote the arrangements. His Marche du maréchal and his Marche H.I.C. were recorded by Howard Cable and his Notule No. 1 and Profil canadien no 2. were included on Gordon Slater's LP Bells and Brass. Many of his original manuscripts and papers are a part of the collection at the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.\\"La vie et la mort d'un carillonneur\\", Musique périodique, vol 1, Jan-Feb 1977 Life and career Born in Montreal, Quebec, Allard's initial musical training was with Antonio Thompson and Father Joseph-Gers Turcotte at the Trois-Rivières seminary where he studied piano and music theory. He was a clarinetist in the city concert band of Grand-Mère, Quebec during his youth and later served as that ensemble's conductor. He also worked as an organist at a few churches in that town. He earned a lauréat diploma from the Université Laval and then entered the Conservatoire national de musique in Montreal where he earned a licentiate diploma. At the conservatoire, he was a pupil of Eugène Lapierre in organ and harmony. After graduating from the conservatoire, Allard was a clarinetist in the Central Band of the Royal Canadian Air Force in Rockcliffe, Ontario from 1942-1945. He then entered the Royal Carillon School \\"Jef Denyn\\" in Mechelen, Belgium in 1946 where he earned a carillonneur diploma in 1948. At the school, he studied composition with Jef van Hoof and bell ringing with Staf Nees. He pursued further studies at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1948-1949 where his teachers included Eugène Bigot (conducting), Maurice Duruflé (orchestration), and Olivier Messiaen (aesthetics). In 1949, Allard returned to Canada where he initially struggled to find a suitable appointement in his chosen career as a carillonneur. He finally attained a position as the carillonneur at Saint Joseph's Oratory in Montreal in 1955, a post he remained in for two decades. He gave annual concert tours throughout North America between 1959-1976. In 1975, he left Saint Joseph's to become the carillonneur at the Peace Tower in Ottawa. He remained there until his death one year later at the age of 61.

Since 1928, he ran his own studio in Cologne.Gabriele Saure, \\"Faßbender, Joseph,\\" AKL, Volume 37 (Munich and Leipzig: K.G. Saur, 2003), p. 168. As an artist, he primarily produced abstract paintings. During the Second World War he was obliged to work as a Wehrmacht cartographer. Since 1946 he ran a studio at Bornheim near Bonn. In 1947 Fassbender founded at Schloss Alfter near Bornheim, together with Hann Trier, Hubert Berke and some other artists and men of letters, the \\"Donnerstagsgesellschaft\\" in order to revive, and promote, modern painting in the Rhineland. In 1951 he organized an exhibition for his friend, Max Ernst. In 1955, 1959 and 1964, Fassbender participated at the documentas I-III in Kassel. In 1958 the artist was appointed professor of painting and drawing at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he retired in 1968.http://www.kunstakademie- duesseldorf.de/galerie/ausstellungen/joseph-fassbender.html Fassbender also designed many placards and book jackets.

Its founders included New York Mayor Richard Varick and Gulian Verplanck, a future influential politician in the state and nationally. A conservative organization, the Academy was from 1817-1836 led by the painter John Trumbull as president. He had long practiced the classical ideal of art and became known as a tyrant in his attitude toward young painters.Trumbull's paintings by then were considered out of style. \\"John Trumbull (painter)\\", Encyclopedia.com. The Academy's conservatism and Trumbull's unyielding attitude eventually led to such a level of dissatisfaction among the younger painters that they formed a splinter group. In 1825 they abandoned the American Academy to found the National Academy of Design, also in New York.American Academy of the Fine Arts, entry at Encyclopedia.com. The American Academy said it regretted the loss of the young artists, but affirmed its traditions. Ultimately it did not attract enough students and support, and closed in 1841.Verplanck, Gulian C., An address delivered at the opening of the 10th exhibition of the American Academy of the Fine Arts, 2nd ed., Carvill, 1825.

He attended Punahou School 1867–1873, and then Oberlin College. He greatly expanded Castle & Cooke in the sugar and railroad industries. He is credited with winning control of the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company from Claus Spreckels in 1898, which he sold to Alexander & Baldwin for a large share of their stock. This episode resulting in a lawsuit by the former manager of the plantation, William J. Lowrie. He bought large amounts of land, such as Kaneohe Ranch. Castle's house in Waikiki He served as an officer in the Kingdom of Hawaii army in 1890, and was appointed to the Bureau of Immigration. In 1891 he was acting Auditor General, and Collector General of Customs from April 15, 1893 to August 31, 1897. Later in 1897 he served as secretary of the delegation from the Republic of Hawaii sent to Washington, D.C., to lobby for annexation at the request of Lorrin Andrews Thurston. During the decade up to 1906, he tried to lure white labor colonists to the Islands. The last failed effort was organized by Peter Demens who offered to bring all Spiritual Christians from Russia to Hawaii, and cost Castle $30,000. He built a large house called Kainalu near Diamond Head. When the Honolulu Rapid Transit & Land Co. was in danger of failing, he used his financial resources to keep the effort alive.

It is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes the malaria parasite. The disease it and other members of the genus Babesia cause is a hemolytic anemia known as babesiosis and colloquially called Texas cattle fever, redwater or piroplasmosis. It is transmitted by bites from infected larval ticks of the order Ixodida. It was eradicated from the United States by 1943, but is still present in Mexico and much of the world's tropics. The chief vector of Babesia species is the southern cattle fever tick Rhipicephalus microplus (formerly Boophilus microplus). In 2007, the sequence of its genome was announced. Measuring 8.2 million base pairs, its genome is remarkably similar to the genome of Theileria parva, the cause of East Coast fever (theileriosis) in cattle.  Infection  Babesia bovis is transmitted transovarially, from the female ticks to the eggs, and can remain resident in tick populations for up to four years without infecting a vertebrate host. More commonly, a larval tick feeds upon a domestic cow, an African buffalo or a water buffalo, releasing the parasites into the animal's bloodstream. The involvement of the larval stage of the ticks in the cycle is specific to B. bovis; other Babesia species only involve adult ticks. The parasites then invade individual red blood cells, multiplying and destroying the host cells until the animal is stricken with hemolytic anemia. Adult ticks which feed upon infected cattle are infected themselves, completing the cycle. In humans, infection is rare and usually only affects splenectomized patients.

Lagrange's identity is fundamental in Sturm-Liouville theory. In more than one independent variable, Lagrange's identity is generalized by Green's second identity. Statement In general terms, Lagrange's identity for any pair of functions u and v in function space C2 (that is, twice differentiable) in n dimensions is: :vL[u]-uL^*[v]= abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol M, where: :M_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\\\\left( v \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_j} -u \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right ) + uv \\\\left( b_i - \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial a_{ij}}{\\\\partial x_j} \\\\right ), and : abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol M = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_i} M_i, The operator L and its adjoint operator L* are given by: :L[u] = \\\\sum_{i,\\\\ j =1}^n a_{i,j} \\\\frac {\\\\partial ^2 u }{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i \\\\frac {\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_i} +c u and :L^*[v] = \\\\sum_{i,\\\\ j =1}^n \\\\frac {\\\\partial ^2 (a_{i,j} v) }{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_j} - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac {\\\\partial (b_i v)}{\\\\partial x_i} + cv. If Lagrange's identity is integrated over a bounded region, then the divergence theorem can be used to form Green's second identity in the form: :\\\\int_\\\\Omega v L[u]\\\\ d\\\\Omega = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} u L^*[v]\\\\ d\\\\Omega +\\\\int_S \\\\boldsymbol{M \\\\cdot n } \\\\, dS, where S is the surface bounding the volume Ω and n is the unit outward normal to the surface S. =Ordinary differential equations= Any second order ordinary differential equation of the form: :a(x)\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + b(x)\\\\frac {dy}{dx} +c(x)y +\\\\lambda w(x) y =0, can be put in the form: :\\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x) \\\\frac {dy}{dx} \\\\right ) +\\\\left( q(x)+ \\\\lambda w(x) \\\\right) y(x) = 0. This general form motivates introduction of the Sturm–Liouville operator L, defined as an operation upon a function f such that: :L f = \\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x) \\\\frac {df}{dx} \\\\right) + q(x) f. It can be shown that for any u and v for which the various derivatives exist, Lagrange's identity for ordinary differential equations holds: : uLv - vLu = - \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\left[ p(x) \\\\left(v\\\\frac{du}{dx} -u \\\\frac{dv}{dx} \\\\right ) \\\\right]. For ordinary differential equations defined in the interval [0, 1], Lagrange's identity can be integrated to obtain an integral form (also known as Green's formula): :\\\\int_0^1 \\\\ dx \\\\ ( uLv-vLu) = \\\\left[p(x)\\\\left(u \\\\frac {dv}{dx}- v \\\\frac {du}{dx} \\\\right)\\\\right]_0^1, where \\\\ p=P(x), \\\\ q=Q(x), \\\\ u=U(x) and \\\\ v=V(x) are functions of \\\\ x. \\\\ u and \\\\ v having continuous second derivatives on the = Proof of form for ordinary differential equations = We have: :uLv = u \\\\left[\\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x) \\\\frac {dv}{dx} \\\\right) + q(x) v \\\\right], and :vLu = v \\\\left[\\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x) \\\\frac {du}{dx} \\\\right) + q(x) u \\\\right]. Subtracting: :uLv-vLu = u \\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x) \\\\frac {dv}{dx} \\\\right)-v \\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x) \\\\frac {du}{dx} \\\\right). The leading multiplied u and v can be moved inside the differentiation, because the extra differentiated terms in u and v are the same in the two subtracted terms and simply cancel each other. Thus, :uLv-vLu = \\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( p(x)u \\\\frac {dv}{dx} \\\\right)-\\\\frac {d}{dx} \\\\left( v p(x) \\\\frac {du}{dx} \\\\right), ::=\\\\frac {d}{dx}\\\\left[p(x)\\\\left(u \\\\frac {dv}{dx}- v \\\\frac {du}{dx} \\\\right)\\\\right], which is Lagrange's identity.

Pre-colonial period The first postal services in Namibia (then known as South West Africa) started in 1814 with the deployment of messengers facilitating communication between the early mission stations at Warmbad and Bethanie and later to Keetmanshoop and Gross Barmen. This service was expanded in 1846, connecting the South West African mission stations to those in South Africa. German colonial period The first post office of South West Africa was founded in Otjimbingwe in 1888, further offices were established in Windhoek (1891) and Swakopmund (1895). South African period The South African Army overran the colony in 1914–15 and the territory was controlled by South Africa until Namibian independence in 1990. Independent Namibia Namibia has issued regular definitive and commemorative stamps since independence in 1989. NamPost is the company responsible for postal service in Namibia. It has 743 employees in 135 post offices, and reserves of N$2.51 million. CEO of NamPost is Festus Hangula. In 1989, the last stamps of South West Africa were a set of 15 depicting minerals and mining. Shortly before their issue in 1990, the territory gained independence as Namibia. As the stamps were new, most of the designs were kept with only the name changed (cuprite was dropped and willemite added for the Namibian issue). Another problem was that one of the stamps, for boltwoodite, had an error in its chemical equation. This was corrected in the Namibian issue.Minerals on Stamps by Paul Glover, 14 November 2008.

A map showing the location of Fezzan This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Fezzan and Ghadames, both now part of Libya. Fezzan is a south-western region of modern Libya. It is largely desert but broken by mountains, uplands, and dry river valleys (wadis) in the north, where oases enable ancient towns and villages to survive deep in the otherwise inhospitable Sahara. Ghadames is an oasis town in the west of Libya. It lies roughly 549 km in the southwest of Tripoli, near the borders with Algeria and Tunisia. Fezzan and Ghadames was a territory in the southern part of the former Italian colony of Libya controlled by the French from 1943 until Libyan independence in 1951. It was part of the Allied administration of Libya.  Fezzan and Ghadames Fezzan was captured by Free French forces of Chad in 1943. Initially, twelve regular, three air mail, five pairs of parcel post, and five postage due stamps of Libya and Italy were overprinted Fezzan and surcharged in French currency, in assorted denominations ranging from 50 centimes to 50 francs. These stamps are listed in the French Ceres catalogue of French Colonies in both mint and used condition. They are mentioned in passing in the Scott catalogs but are not listed or priced.

The Falkland Islands are located over from South America, to the north of the Antarctic convergence, where cooler waters from the south mix with warmer waters from the north. Winds mostly come from the west, creating a difference between the relative levels of precipitation between the eastern islands and the western islands. The total annual rainfall is only about . Although snow falls, strong winds mean it often fails to settle. The temperature of the islands fluctuates within a narrow band, not reaching higher than or lower than . There are long hours of daylight in the summer, although the actual number of hours of sunlight is limited by cloud cover. Köppen classification 400px The Falkland Islands have a maritime climate in the transition region between the tundra and subpolar zones (Köppen classifications ET and Cfc respectively). The climate is very much influenced by the cool South Atlantic ocean and its northerly Patagonian current. The oceanic climatic type is characterised by both low seasonal and diurnal temperature ranges and no marked wet and dry season while in the sub-arctic zone the average monthly maximum temperature exceeds for no more than four months of the year and the average monthly minimum does not drop below . In addition to parts of the Falklands, a maritime subarctic climatic zone is found in parts of coastal Iceland, Faroe Islands, northwestern coastal Norway, southern islands of Alaska and parts of the Alaskan Panhandle, the southern tip of South America and mountainous areas of Europe including the Scottish Highlands and southwestern Norway. Sunshine During summer the Falklands experience long daylight hours. During summer the islands run on Daylight Saving Time, at UTC −3 as opposed to the normal time of UTC −4, entering summer time at on the first Sunday of September and leaving it on on the third Sunday of April. However, due to cloud cover, the average number of hours in summer with direct sunlight is only 6 hours. The average number in winter is only 2–3. In 2011, the Falkland Islands government announced that the islands will remain on summer time during the winter, when the clocks would normally be set back. Winds The winds moving over the islands are mostly westerly winds. There is almost no seasonal variation in wind direction, which is less than for 60 percent of the time, from for 20–25 percent of the time, and and above 8–12 percent of the time. Gales are frequent, especially during winter. The average wind speed in Stanley is . Temperature The Antarctic convergence, where cold waters from the south mix with warm waters from the north helping to regulate temperature The islands have cool temperatures, which fluctuates in a narrow range. Average monthly temperatures range from around in January and February to around in June and July, corresponding with summer and winter. The maximum temperature reached is around in January, and the minimum is in July. The annual average is around . The archipelago is located from the coast of South America, between 51° and 52°S. The location of the archipelago, to the north of the Antarctic convergence, helps to moderate the temperature as cool waters from Antarctica mix with warmer waters from the Atlantic. Precipitation Rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year, although it is low because of the archipelago's location to the east of South America. Owing to the westerlies and the shielding effect of the Andes, the western side of the archipelago is much drier than the eastern side, and mountain ranges are much wetter on their eastern slopes than their western slopes. Port Stanley and Port Howard on eastern islands both receive about of rainfall every year, as opposed to islands such as Westpoint which only receives a year. The overall rainfall for the archipelago is around . The flat areas, in particular Lafonia are the driest areas of the islands with precipitation in the range a year. Other writers have recorded an average of 310 mm per year in the west of the islands. The rainfall in 2009 as recorded from 17 different stations in The Wool Press varied between 356 mm at Cape Dolphin and 898 mm at Port Howard. During winter sleet and snow does fall, but it is temporary and does not often settle for long. Due to vegetation on the islands resembling a tundra, the ground remains damp as it is often impermeable to water. Climate changes The climate has become drier and warmer over the past 50 years, but it is predicted that the islands will become cooler with more rain and cloud cover. This is because melting Antarctic ice is predicted to result in cooler air from the south, counteracting warmer air from the north. Sea temperature has also risen steadily since the 1960s. Rainfall data suggests that it increased from 1910 to 1940, decreased until 1995, then began to increase again. Storms are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity.

The 504th EMIB was transformed from the 504th Military Intelligence Brigade in late 2007 becoming one of three active duty Surveillance Brigades of the United States Army. The brigade is tasked to improve the situational awareness for commanders at division level or higher, so they can adapt their units combat power for the current operations. For this the Military Intelligence Brigades can deploy unmanned aerial vehicles, signals gathering equipment, human intelligence collectors and long range surveillance patrols. In 2015, the brigade returned to its original name and mission as the 504th Military Intelligence Brigade supporting III Corps with its intelligence needs.75 years of service, 504th leads a storied history on military intelligence triumphs; by CPT Kevin Sandell, 504th MI Bde, Public Affairs; dated 26 January 2017, last accessed 2 July 2017 The 504th EMIB is currently composed of: * 25px Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) * 25px 163rd Military Intelligence Battalion (163rd MIB)'Always Ready' brigade fields enhanced equipment (14 Sep 2015) The Prophet System and Modular Integration Kit upgrades vehicles for mobile and/or fixed-site signals collection, direction finding, processing and reporting at 163rd MIB * 25px 303rd Military Intelligence Battalion (303rd MIB) The 504th EMIB conducts intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in support of III Corps.  History  The 504th BfSB traces its lineage to the 137th Signal Radio Intelligence Company (Aviation). Activated in the early days of World War II the unit redesignated as 137th Signal Radio Intelligence Company. The unit earned battle streamers for the campaigns of Northern France, Central Europe and the Rhineland. After World War II the brigades name and tasks were subject to many changes, but on 21 April 1978 the 504th Military Intelligence Group (Corps) was activated and began its evolution to a Military Intelligence Brigade. On 16 September 1985, the brigade was designated as the 504th Military Intelligence Brigade (Corps) at Fort Hood and supported the III Armored Corps. At that time the brigade consisted of a Headquarters & Headquarters Detachment and three Military Intelligence Battalions: * 25px 15th Military Intelligence Battalion (Aerial Exploitation) * 25px 163rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Tactical Exploitation) * 25px 303rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Operations) With the Transformation of the United States Army the 504th was redesignated as the 504th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade. To fulfill its new mission the brigade relinquished control of the 15th Military Intelligence Battalion and activated three new companies: a Network Support Company, a Forward Support Company and a Long Range Surveillance Troop (B-38th CAV) while restructuring the Headquarters & Headquarters Detachment into a company and expanding its missions. The two remaining Military Intelligence battalions assumed identical missions as intelligence collection battalions. The brigade's Troop B (LRS), 38th Cavalry Regiment, activated on 16 February 2008, was reorganized and redesignated on 24 June 2010 as Troop C (LRS)(ABN) as part of the newly activated 2nd Squadron, 38th Cavalry Regiment with Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT), Troop A, Troop B, and Troop C, 2d Squadron, 38th Cavalry Regiment. While Troop C within various squadrons of the 38th Cavalry Regiment is sometimes locally referred to as Company C, HQ Department of the Army policy states, \\"HQDA approved MTOE does not allow for a separate infantry company.\\" In the case of the 1st Squadron, HQ DA wrote, \\"As documented, the company is a subordinate of 1–38th CAV and as such will carry the designation of Troop C, 1–38th CAV.\\" The policy applies to the 2d Squadron, 38th Cavalry Regiment as well.

The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth. The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation. History of the concept The term global civics was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind global ethics, global justice and world citizenship, inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World, a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world. Criticism Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that civics assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a world government, global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws. Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists. The role of universities The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully \\"provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings.\\" See also * Cosmopolitanism * Global citizenship * Universal value References Further reading  Category:Active citizenship Category:Community building Category:Civil society ","title":"Global civics"},{"id":"27083007","text":"Morris Cecil Davis (1 March 1904 - 13 November 1968) was a Canadian composer, arranger, and conductor.

Plot summary The short story presents a humorous account of Genghis Khan's day. The first section is an encounter with a woman in his home, where a soldier instructs the woman to ask the Khan questions about his day with affection, to which he replies in an apathetic manner. The soldier, while repeatedly thrashing and threatening the woman, demands that she continue to ask the Khan questions about his day in an affectionate manner like a wife. The Khan takes out some scrolls and begins to read them, while the soldier instructs the woman to continue her line of questioning and nag the Khan. The woman, afraid for her life, finally gives up and falls at the Khan's feet offering herself in order for the ordeal to stop, to which the Khan's replies \\"No\\" and \\"you'd only laugh — you're just like all the others.\\" The section then ends with the line, \\"He stormed out of the hut and rode off into the night in such a rage that he almost forgot to burn down the village before he left.\\" The second section deals with a conversation between the Khan and his son, Ogdai, after the Battle of Samarkand. Ogdai tells the khan of his plans to attack Persia the following morning and proceed further in their campaign. Khan replies in a laid-back manner about his busy schedule for the next week and eventually the month of March. He then complains that he will be too busy in April since he has plans to go to Africa. A troubled Ogdai pleads with his father to conquer the world in May. Khan replies \\"Well, I don't like to commit myself that far in advance. One feels so tied down if one's life is completely mapped out beforehand. I should be doing more reading, for heaven's sake, when am I going to find the time for that?

He first approaches the Khan and asks him to check the spelling of his name on his clipboard. When the Khan agrees that the spelling is correct, he proceeds to insult the khan before taking off in his spaceship.

It is an application of FRET wherein a pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores are excited and detected on a single molecule level. In contrast to \\"ensemble FRET\\" which provides the FRET signal of a high number of molecules, single-molecule FRET is able to resolve the FRET signal of each individual molecule. The variation of the smFRET signal is useful to reveal kinetic information that an ensemble measurement cannot provide, especially when the system is under equilibrium. Heterogeneity among different molecules can also be observed. Methodology A scheme of a typical smFRET experiment (A), FRET distance curve (B), and a time trajectory (C). Single molecule FRET measurements are typically performed on fluorescence microscopes, either using surface-immobilized or freely-diffusing molecules. Single FRET pairs are illuminated using intense light sources, typically lasers, in order to generate sufficient fluorescence signal to enable single molecule detection. Wide-field multiphoton microscopy is typically combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF). This selectively excites FRET pairs on the surface of the measurement chamber and rejects noise from the bulk of the sample. Alternatively, confocal microscopy minimizes background by focusing the fluorescence light onto a pinhole to reject out of focus light. The confocal volume has a diameter of around 220 nm, and therefore it must be scanned across if an image of the sample is needed. With confocal excitation, it is possible to measure much deeper into the sample than when using TIRF. Fluorescence signal is detected either using ultra sensitive CCD or scientific CMOS cameras for wide field microscopy or SPADs for confocal microscopy. Once the single molecule intensities vs. time are available the FRET efficiency can be computed for each FRET pair as a function of time and thereby it is possible to follow kinetic events on the single molecule scale and to build FRET histograms showing the distribution of states in each molecule. However, data from many FRET pairs must be recorded and combined in order to obtain general information about a sample or a dynamic structure. = Surface-Immobilized = In surface-immobilized experiments, biomolecules labeled with fluorescent tags are bound to the surface of the coverglass and images of fluorescence are acquired (typically by a CCD or scientific CMOS cameras). Data collection with cameras will produce movies of the specimen which must be processed to derive the single- molecule intensities with time. If a confocal microscope with a SPAD detector is used, a molecule searching is done first by scanning the sample. Then the confocal point sits on a molecule and collects intensity-time data directly, giving the sample drifting is negligible or an active feedback loop is used to keep track of the molecule. An advantage of surface-immobilized experiments is that many molecules can be observed in parallel for an extended period of time until photobleaching (typically 1-30 s). This allows to conveniently study transitions taking place on slow time scales. A disadvantage is represented by the additional biochemical modifications needed to link molecules to the surface and the perturbations that the surface can potentially exert on the molecular activity. In addition, the maximum time resolution of single- molecule intensities is limited by the camera acquisition time (> 1 ms). = Freely-Diffusing = SmFRET can also be used to study the conformations of molecules freely diffusing in a liquid sample. In freely-diffusing smFRET experiments (or diffusion-based smFRET), the same biomolecules are free to diffuse in solution while being excited by a small excitation volume (usually a diffraction-limited spot). Bursts of photons due a single-molecule crossing the excitation spot are acquired with SPAD detectors. The confocal spot is usually fixed in a given position (no scanning happens, and no image is acquired). Instead, the fluorescence photons emitted by individual molecules crossing the excitation volume are recorded and accumulated in order to build a distribution of different populations present in the sample. Depending on the complexity of this distribution, acquisition times varies from ~5 min to several hours. A distinctive advantage of setups employing SPAD detectors is that they are not limited by a \\"frame rate\\" or a fixed integration time like when using cameras. In fact, unlike cameras, SPADs produce a pulse every time a photon is detected, while an additional electronics is needed to \\"timestamps\\" each pulse with 10-50 ns resolution. The high time resolution of confocal single-molecule FRET measurements allows to potentially detect dynamics on time scales as low as 10 μs. However, detecting \\"slow\\" transitions on timescales longer than the diffusion time (typically ~1 ms), is more difficult than in surface-immobilized experiments and generally requires much longer acquisitions. Normally, the fluorescent emission of both donor and acceptor fluorophores is detected by two independent detectors and the FRET signal is computed from the ratio of intensities in the two channels. Some setup configurations further split each spectral channel (donor or acceptor) in two orthogonal polarizations (therefore requiring 4 detectors) and are able to measure both FRET and fluorescence anisotropy at the same time. In other configurations, 3 or 4 spectral channels are acquired at the same time in order to measure multiple FRET pairs at the same time. Both CW or pulsed lasers can be used as excitation source. When using pulsed lasers, a suitable acquisition hardware can measure the photon arrival time with respect to the last laser pulse with picosecond resolution, in the so-called time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) acquisition. In this configuration each photon is characterized by a macro-time (i.e. a coarse 10-50 ns timestamp) and a micro-time (i.e. delay with respect the last laser pulse). The latter can be used to extract lifetime information and obtain the FRET signal. Data Analysis of Surface Immobilised smFRET Typical smFRET data of a two-dye system are time trajectories of the fluorescent emission intensities of the donor dye and the acceptor dye, called the two channels. Mainly two methods are used to obtain the emission of the two dyes: (1) accumulative measurement uses a fixed exposure time of the cameras for each frame, such as PMT, APD, EMCCD, and CMOS camera; (2) single photon arriving time sequence measured using PMT or APD detectors. The principle is to use optical filters to separate the emissions of the two dyes and measure in two channels. For example, a setup using two halves of a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is explained in the literature. For a two-dye system, the emission signals are then used to calculate the FRET efficiency between the dyes over time. The FRET efficiency is the number of photons emitted from the acceptor dye over the sum of the emissions of the donor and the acceptor dye. Usually, only the donor dye is excited, but even more accurate information can be obtained if donor and acceptor dye are alternatingly excited. In a single excitation scheme, the emission of the donor and acceptor dyes is just the number of photons collected for the two dyes divided by the photon collection efficiencies of the two channels respectively which are the functions of the collection efficiency, the filter and optical efficiency, and the camera efficiency of the two wavelength bands. These efficiencies can be calibrated for a given instrumental setup. :FRET= \\\\frac {\\\\tfrac {I_A} {\\\\eta_A Q_A} }{\\\\tfrac {I_A} {\\\\eta_A Q_A} + \\\\tfrac {I_D} {\\\\eta_D Q_D}}. where FRET is the FRET efficiency of the two-dye system at a period of time, I_A and I_D are measured photon counts of the acceptor and donor channel respectively at the same period of time, \\\\eta_A and \\\\eta_D are the photon collection efficiencies of the two channels, and Q_A and Q_D are quantum yield of the two dyes. Thus, I/\\\\eta calculates the actual number of photons emitted from the dye. If the photon collection efficiencies of the two channels are similar and the actual FRET distance is not interested, one can set the two \\\\eta = 1, and the two quantum yields to 1 as well. (A) An example time trajectory of the acceptor (red) and donor (blue) channel photon counts collected at 1 ms time resolution. (B) Data binned into 10 ms time resolution to reduce the noise. The inset shows the smFRET time trajectory calculated with the equation. Larger photocounts part has large noise dominated by count-dependent Gaussian noise and the small photocounts area dominated by the Poisson noise. For the accumulative emission smFRET data, the time trajectories contain mainly the following information: (1) state transitions, (2) noise, (3) camera blurring (analog of motion blur), (4) photoblinking and photobleaching of the dyes. The state transition information is the information a typical measurement wants. However, the rest signals interfere with the data analysis thus have to be addressed. =Noise= The noise signal of the dye emission typically contains camera readout noise, shot noise and white noise, and real-sample noise, that each follows a different noise distribution due to the different sources. The real-sample noise comes from the thermal disturbance of the system that results in the FRET distance broadening, uneven dye orientation distribution, dye emission variations, fast blinking, and faster-than-integration-time kinetics. Slow variations of the dye emission are likely considered false- positive states that should be experimentally avoid by choosing different dyes. The other noises are from the excitation path and the detection path especially the camera. In the end, the noise of the raw emission data is a combination of noises with Poisson distribution and Gaussian distribution. The noises in each channel sometimes (e.g. for single-photon detectors) can be simplified to the summation of an intensity-dependent Gaussian noise (the higher the count the larger the noise; it is a combination of Gaussian and larger-amplitude Poisson noise that can be represented by the Gaussian function) and a Poisson background noise (signal-count-independent). The latter noise dominates when the channel is in the OFF or low-intensity state (right figure). The noises in the two channels then are combined into the non- linear equation listed above to calculate the FRET values. Thus, the noise on the smFRET trajectories is very complicated. The noise is asymmetric in above and below the mean FRET values and its magnitude changes towards the two ends (0 and 1) of the FRET values due to the changing uncertainties of the A and D channels. Most noises can be reduced by binning the data (see the Figure) with a cost of losing time resolution. See GitHub (postFRET) for an example MATLAB codes to simulate smFRET time trajectories without and with noise (GitHub link https://github.com/nkchenjx/postFRET). =Camera blurring= Camera blur simulated with an example 3-state smFRET using the postFRET simulator (two simulations). The signal to noise ratio is set at about 20 for both simulations. The time resolution is simulated at 1 ms then binned to 10 ms, the integration time of the simulated experiments. The simulation rate constants are listed on the left, a small part of the trajectory is shown in the middle (alternative colors represent different molecules), and the FRET histogram of all molecules (100) is shown on the right. The camera blurring signal comes from the discrete nature of the measurements. The emission signal has a mismatch with the real transition signal because one or both are stochastic (random). When a state transition happens between the readout of two emission reading intervals, the signal is the average of the two parts in the same measuring window, which then affects the state identification accuracy and eventually the rate constant analysis. This is less a problem when the measuring frequency is much faster than the transition rate but becomes a real problem when they approach each other (figure on the right). In order to reflect the camera blurring effect in the simulated smFRET trajectories, one must simulate the data in a higher time resolution (e.g. 10 times faster) than the data collection time then bin the data into the final trajectories. See GitHub (postFRET) for an example MATLAB codes to simulate smFRET time trajectories with a faster time resolution then bin it to the measuring time resolution (integration time) to simulate the camera blurring effect. =Photoblinking and photobleaching= The time trajectories also contain the photoblinking and photobleaching information of the two dyes. This information has to be removed which creates gaps in the time trajectory where the FRET information is lost. The photoblinking and photobleaching information can be removed for a typical dye system with relatively long photoblinking intervals and photobleaching lifetimes that has been chosen in the measurement. Thus, they are less a problem for data analysis. However, it will become a big problem if a dye with short blinking intervals or long dark-state lifetime is used. =State identification algorithms= Several data analysis methods have been developed to analyze the data, such as thresholding methods, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) methods, and transition point identification methods. Thresholding methods simply set a threshold between two adjacent states on the smFRET trajectories. The FRET values above the threshold belong to a state and the values below belong to another. This method works for the data with a very high signal to noise ratio thus have distinguishable FRET states. This method is intuitive and has a long history of applications. An example source code can be found in the software postFRET. HMMs base on algorithms that statistically calculate probability functions of each state assignment, i.e. add penalties to a less probable assignment. The typical open source-code software packages can be found online such as HaMMy, vbFRET, ebFRET, SMART, SMACKS, MASH-FRET, etc. Transition-point analysis or change- point analysis (CPA) uses algorithms to identify when a transition happens over the time trajectory using statistical analysis. For example, CPA based on Fisher information theory and the Student's t-test method (STaSI, open-source, GitHub link https://github.com/LandesLab/STaSI) identifies state transitions and minimizes description length by selecting the optimum number of states, i.e. balancing the penalty of noise and total number of states. A list of software packages can be found on the KinSoftChallenge website.https://sites.google.com/view/kinsoftchallenge/tools =Rate analysis= Once the states are identified, they can be used to calculate the Förster resonance energy transfer distances and transition rate constants between the states. For a parallel reaction matrix among the states, the rate constants of each transition cannot be pulled out from the average lifetimes of each transition, which is fixed the inverse sum of the rate constants. The lifetimes of transitions from one state to all other states are all the \\"same\\" for a single molecule. However, the rate constants can be calculated from the probability functions, the number of each transition over the total time of the state it transfers from. : k_{if} = \\\\frac {N_{if}}{\\\\sum_{f=1}^{f=n} t_{if}} = \\\\frac {N_{if}}{t_i} An example state identified trajectory and the dwell-time histogram of each transition. Lifetime is the average of all dwell- times, which is the inverse of the sum of all rate constants of the state to other states. where i is the initial state, f is the final state of the transition, N is the number of this transitions in the time trajectories, n is the total number of state, k is the rate constant, t is the time of each state before the transition happens. For example, one measures 130 second (s) of smFRET time trajectories. The total time of a molecule stay on state one is t1 = 100 second (s), state two t2 = 20 s, and state three is t3 = 10 s. Among the 100 s the molecule stays state one, it transfers to state two 70 times and transfers to state three 30 times at the end of its dwell times, the rate constant of state 1 to state 2 is thus k12 = 70/100 = 0.7 s−1 , the rate constant of state 1 to state 3 is k13 = 30/100 = 0.3 s−1. Typically the probabilities of the lengths of the 70 times or the 30 times transition (dwell times) are exponentially distributed (right figure). The average dwell times of the two distributions of state one, i.e. the two lifetimes, τ12 and τ13, are both the same at 1 s for these two transitions (right figure). The number of transition N can be the total number of state transition, or the fitted amplitude of the exponential decay function of the accumulated histogram of the state dwell-times. The latter only works for well behaved dwell-time distributions. A system under equilibrium with each state parallel transfers to all others in first-order reactions is a special case for easier understanding. When the system is not under equilibrium, this equation still holds but care should be applied to use it. The interpretation of the above equation is simply based on the assumption that each molecule is the same, the ergodic hypothesis. The existence of each state is just represented by its total time which is its \\"concentration\\". Thus, The rate of transition to any other state is the number of transition normalized by this concentration. Numerically, the time concentration can be converted to number concentration to mimic an ensemble measurement. Because the single molecules are the same to all other molecules, we can assume that the time trajectory is a random combination of a lot of molecules each only occupies a very shot period of time, say 𝛿t. Thus, the \\"concentration\\" of the molecule at state n is cn = tn / 𝛿t. Among all these \\"molecules\\", if Nnf transfer to state f during this measuring time 𝛿t, the rate of transfer by definition is r = Nnf / 𝛿t = knf cn. Thus knf = Nnf / tn. One can see that the single molecule measurement of rate constant is only dependent on the ergodic hypothesis, which can be judged if statistically enough number of single molecules are measured and expected well-behaved distributions of dwell times are observed. Heterogeneity among single molecules can be observed as well if each molecule has distinguishable set of states or set of rate constants. =Reduce the uncertainty level= The uncertainty level of the rate analysis can be estimated from multiple experimental trials, bootstrapping analysis, and fitting error analysis. State misassignment is a common error source during the data analysis, which originates from state broadening, noise, and camera blurring. Data binning, moving average, and wavelet transform can help reduce the effect of state broadening and noise but will enhance the camera blurring effect. The camera blurring effect can be reduced via faster sampling frequency relies on the development of a more sensitive camera, special data analysis, or both. Traditionally in HMMs, the data point before and after the transition is specially assigned to reduce the wrong assignment rate of these data points to states in between of the transition. However, there is a limitation for this method to work. When the transition frequency is approaching the sampling frequency, too much data are blurred for this method to work (see above the figure of the camera blur). A two-step data analysis method has been reported to increase the analysis accuracy for such data. The idea is to simulate a trajectory with the Monte Carlo simulation method and compare it to the experimental data. At the right condition, both the simulation and the experimental data will contain the same degree of blurring information and noise. This simulated trajectory is a better answer than the raw experimental data because its ground truth is \\"known\\". This method has open-source codes available as postFRET (GitHub link ) and MASH-FRET. This method can also slightly correct the effect of the non-Gaussian noise that has caused trouble to accurately identify the states using the statistical methods. The current data analysis for smFRET still requires great care and special training which is in a call for deep-learning algorithms to play a role to free the labor in data analysis.  Advantages of smFRET  Ensemble FRET analysis of a heterogeneous population SmFRET allows for a more precise analysis of heterogeneous populations and has a few advantages when compared to ensemble FRET. One benefit of studying distances in single molecules is that heterogeneous populations can be studied more accurately with values specific for each molecule rather than computing an average based on an ensemble. This allows for the study of specific homogeneous populations within a heterogeneous population. For example, if two existing homologous populations within a heterogeneous population have different FRET values, an ensemble FRET analysis will produce a weighted averaged FRET value to represent the population as a whole. Thus, the obtained FRET value does not produce data on the two distinct populations. In contrast, smFRET would be able to differentiate between the two populations and would allow analysis of the existing homologous populations. SmFRET also provides dynamic temporal resolution of an individual molecule that cannot be accomplished through ensemble FRET measurements. Ensemble FRET has the ability to detect well- populated transition states that accumulate in a population, but it lacks the ability to characterize intermediates that are short-lived and do not accumulate. This limit is addressed by smFRET which offers a direct way to observe the intermediates of single molecules regardless of accumulation. Therefore, smFRET demonstrates the ability to capture transient subpopulations in a heterogeneous environment. Kinetic information in a system under equilibrium is lost at the ensemble level because none of the concentrations of the reactants and products change over time. However, at the single- molecule level, the transfer between the reactants and products can happen at a measurable high rate and balanced over time stochastically. Thus, tracing the time trajectory of a particular molecule enables the direct measurement of the rate constant of each transition step, including the intermediates that are hidden in the ensemble level due to its low concentrations. This allows smFRET to be used to study an RNA’s folding dynamics. Similar to protein folding, RNA folding goes through multiple interactions, folding pathways, and intermediates before reaching its native state. SmFRET is also shown to utilize a three-color system better than ensemble FRET. Using two acceptor fluorophores rather than one, FRET can observe multiple sites for correlated movements and spatial changes in any complex molecule. This is shown in the research on the Holliday Junction. SmFRET with the three-color system offers insights on synchronized movements of junction's three helical sites and near non-existence of its parallel states. Ensemble FRET can use three-color system as well. However, any obvious advantages are outweighed by three-color system's requirements which includes a clear separation of fluorophore signals. For a clear distinction of signal, FRET overlaps must be small but that also weakens FRET strength. SmFRET corrects its overlap limitations by using band-pass filters and dichroic mirrors which further the signal between two fluorescence acceptors and solve for any bleed through effects.  Applications  A major application of smFRET is to analyze the minute biochemical nuances that facilitate protein folding. In recent years, multiple techniques have been developed to investigate single molecule interactions that are involved in protein folding and unfolding. Force-probe techniques, using atomic force microscopy and laser tweezers, have provided information on protein stability. smFRET allows researchers to investigate molecular interactions using fluorescence. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was first applied to single molecules by Ha et al. and applied to protein folding in work by Hochstrasser, Weiss, et al. The benefit that smFRET as a whole has afforded to analyzing molecular interactions is the ability to test single molecule interactions directly without having to average ensembles of data. In protein folding analysis, ensemble experiments involve taking measurements of multiple proteins that are in various states of transition between their folded and unfolded state. When averaged, the protein structure that can be inferred from the ensemble of data only provides a rudimentary structural model of protein folding. However, true understanding of protein folding requires deciphering the sequence of structural events along the folding pathways between the folded and unfolded states. It is this particular branch of research that smFRET is highly applicable. FRET studies calculate corresponding FRET efficiencies as a result of time-resolved observation of protein folding events. These FRET efficiencies can then be used to infer distances between molecules as a function against time. As the protein transitions between the folded and unfolded states, the corresponding distances between molecules can indicate the sequence of molecular interactions that lead to protein folding. Another application of smFRET is for DNA and RNA folding dynamics. Typically, two different locations of a nucleotide are labeled with the donor and acceptor dyes. The change of the distance between the two locations changes over time due to the folding and unfolding of the nucleotide plus the random diffusion of the two points over time, within each measuring window and among different windows. Due to the complexity of the folding/unfolding trajectory, it is extremely difficult to measure the process at the ensemble level. Thus, smFRET becomes a key technique in this field. On top of the challenges of smFRET data analysis, one challenge is to label multiple positions of interest, another is from the two- point dynamics to calculate the overall folding pathways. Single-molecule FRET can also be applied to study the conformational changes of the relevant channel motifs in certain channels. For example, labeled tetrameric KirBac potassium channels were labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores at particular sites in order to understand the structural dynamics within the lipid membrane, thus allowing them to generalize similar dynamics for similar motifs in other eukaryotic Kir channels or even cation channels in general. The use of smFRET in this experiment allows for visualization of the conformational changes that cannot be seen if the macroscopic measurements are simply averaged. This will lead to ensemble analysis rather than analysis of individual molecules and the conformational changes within, allowing us to generalize similar dynamics for similar motifs in other eukaryotic channels. The structural dynamics of the KirBac channel was thoroughly analyzed in both the open and closed states, dependent on the presence of the ligand PIP2. Part of the results based on smFRET demonstrated the structural rigidity of the extracellular region. The selectivity filter and the outer loop of the selectivity filter region was labeled with fluorophores and conformational coupling was observed. The individual smFRET trajectories strongly demonstrated a FRET efficiency of around 0.8 with no fluctuations, regardless of the state of the channel. Recently, single-molecule FRET has been applied to quantitatively detect target DNA and to distinguish single nucleotide polymorphism. Unlike ensemble FRET, single-molecule FRET allows real time monitoring of target binding events. Additionally, Low background, high signal-to-noise ratio observed with single-molecule FRET technique leads to ultra-sensitivity (detection limit in the femto-moles range) These days, different types of signal amplification steps are incorporated in order to push down the detection limit.  Limitations  Despite making approximate estimates, a limitation of smFRET is the difficulty of obtaining the correct distance involved in energy transfer. Requiring an accurate distance estimate gives rise to a major challenge because the fluorescence of the donor and acceptor fluorophores, as well as the energy transfer, is dependent on the environment and how the dyes are oriented, which can vary depending on the flexibility of where the fluorophores are bound. This issue, however, is not particularly relevant when the distance estimation of the two fluorophores does not need to be determined with exact and absolute precision. Extracting kinetic information from a complicated biological system with transition rate around a few millisecond or below remains challenging. The current time resolutions of such measurements are typically at millisecond level with a few reports at the microsecond level. There is a theoretical limitation from the dye photophysics. The lifetime of the excited state of a typical organic dye molecule is about 1 nanosecond. In order to obtain statistical confidence of the FRET values, tens to hundreds of photons are required, which put the best possible time resolution to the order of 1 microsecond. In order to reach this limit, very strong light is required (power density in the order of 1×1010 W m−2, 107 sun typically achieved by focusing a laser beam using a microscope), which often cause photodamage to the organic molecules. Another limitation is the photobleaching lifetime of the dye, which is a function of light intensity and oxidation/reduction stress of the environment. The photobleaching lifetime of a typical organic dye under typical experimental conditions (laser power density just a few sun) is in a few seconds, or a few minutes with the help of oxygen scavenger solutions. Thus kinetic events longer than a few minutes is difficult to probe with organic dyes. Other probes with longer lifetimes such as quantum dots, polymer dots, and all-inorganic dyes have to be used instead of the organic dyes.

The Security Council noted that there had been no progress towards a political solution, no measures introduced to prohibit the firing of weapons near the buffer zone, and that the freedom of movement of UNFICYP was being restricted in Northern Cyprus. After extending the mandate of UNFICYP, the Council welcomed the appointment of Han Sung-Joo as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Cyprus. It deplored the incident on 3 June 1996 in which a Greek Cypriot guard was killed in the buffer zone and Turkish Cypriot soldiers prevented UNFICYP troops from assisting the guard and to investigate the incident. Concern was also expressed at buildup of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus, and tension was also increasing over military training flights. The aim was to demilitarise the island eventually. The military authorities on both sides were asked to: :(a) respect the integrity of the buffer zone and allow complete freedom of movement to UNFICYP; :(b) enter into negotiations, in accordance with Resolution 839 (1993) with UNFICYP regarding the prohibition of firing weapons; :(c) assist in demining and clearing booby-trapped areas; :(d) cease military construction in the vicinity of the buffer zone; :(e) extend the 1989 unmanning agreement to cover areas of the buffer zone. The Turkish Cypriots were also urged to do more to improve the living situation of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in their territories. Greek Cypriots were called to end discrimination against Turkish Cypriots. Both parties were called upon to end the current impasse and resume direct negotiations. The decision of the European Union to begin accession talks with Cyprus was an important new development that could facilitate a comprehensive agreement. The Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report back to the Council by 10 December 1996 on developments on the island.

It is said that he fought for the leadership for the organization against Héctor Beltrán Leyva and Sergio Villarreal Barragán with the help of Edgar Valdez Villarreal. He was also in charge of some routes for the transport of drugs to the U.S. on behalf of the Beltrán Leyva and Sinaloa Cartels. Kingpin Act sanction On 2 October 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Álvarez Vázquez under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with nine other international criminals and six entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Capture On April 21, 2010, the Mexican military raided a household in Huixquilucan; during the raid, troops were met with gunfire from cartel gunmen. After the gunfight, soldiers cordoned off the zone which led to the capture of Gerardo Alvarez-Vázquez.

Other names for this species are derived from several Australian languages. The Kurrama peoples know the plant as murrurpa, murrurbaor and morama, the Panyjima call it mururru and the Nyangumarta mururr. Description The bushy glabrous shrub has a rounded to spreading habit and normally in height, sometimes reaching and usually to a width of . The bark is smooth and a light grey colour. The narrowly elliptic to oblong- elliptic or obovate to oblanceolate, phyllodes have a length of and a width of . It produces yellow flowers from April to November. The simple inflorescences have globular heads with a diameter of about containing 16 to 32 rich golden flowers. Following flowering woody light brown seed pods form that are long and . The pods have a straight to shallowly curved shape and contains glossy, dark brown to black seeds that are arranged longitudinally inside. The seeds have an obloid-ellipsoid shape and are long and with a red to orange aril. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in the work Leguminosae. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. Synonyms for the species include Acacia elliptica, Acacia binervosa, Acacia bivenosa var. borealis and Acacia bivenosa subsp. bivenosa. It was briefly reclassified as Racosperma bivenosum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley before being reverted to the current name in 2006. A group of Acacia known as the A. bivenosa group of plants with similar features contains 12 species including; A. ampliceps, A. bivenosa, A. cupularis, A. didyma, A. ligulata, A. rostellifera, A. salicina, A. sclerosperma, A. startii, A. telmica, A. tysonii and A. xanthina. Distribution and habitat It is widespread in arid areas of northern Australia. It is common in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia. Also found in the Northern Territory and western Queensland, north of 25°S, with an outlier on Dorre Island, Shark Bay, Western Australia. It grows in various kinds of soils, including coastal sand, on rocky hills and gullies, in shrubland and open woodland, and is often associated with spinifex. Uses The bush can be heavily grazed by stock, especially as a seedling. Indigenous Australians used to find edible grubs from around the roots. It is often used in land rehabilitation as a primary colonizer. It is commercially available is seed form for garden planting in dry environments.

He also played Australian rules football with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Maddocks, who also went by the first name of Dick, debuted at first-class level with Victoria in 1948. From the 1948/49 to 1951/52 seasons, he was restricted to non Sheffield Shield fixtures against Tasmania, who were yet to enter the competition. In the last of these matches, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February 1952, Maddocks scored his maiden first-class century and was involved in a record 343 run partnership with debutant Jeffrey Hallebone for the fifth wicket. He finished on 271, the second highest score made by a Victorian against Tasmania after Bill Ponsford. Finally in 1953/54, Maddocks got his chance to play Sheffield Shield and took part in all seven matches Victoria played, scoring 345 runs at 28.75. He also took his only first-class wicket, in a match against New South Wales at the MCG. With the visitors chasing just 68 for victory in their fourth innings, Maddocks was allowed a bowl and dismissed opener Ron Briggs caught behind, by his brother and Test cricketer Len Maddocks. It was the only full season he would ever play but he also made some appearances in the 1955/56 and 1957/58 competitions. Maddocks made his Victorian Football League appearances while still trying to break into the Victorian cricket team, during the 1948 VFL season. He played five games and kicked three goals for North Melbourne. He also represented the North Melbourne Cricket Club in district cricket, playing 239 times before his retirement in 1965.The Age, \\"Long cricket career ends\\", 30 September 1965, p. 20 Also played baseball for Victoria, and once held a Victorian table tennis title.

After briefly working for the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), he received a scholarship from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and travelled to the US in 1978 (where he has since remained), completing his PhD at the University of Minnesota in 1984. He then moved to the University of Southern California, becoming Chairman of his department from 1999–2005. Since then he has held the NIOC Chair, which was formerly known as the \\"Shah Chair\\", having been endowed by Shah Reza Pahlavi. He has also been a visiting professor in Australia and Europe, and a consultant to many industrial corporations. Political views Since 2003, Sahimi has written many articles on the subject of Iranian politics (particularly the Iranian nuclear programme) for websites such as Payvand, Antiwar.com and the Huffington Post. He has been a regular columnist for Tehran Bureau since 2008, and has written occasional pieces for the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journalhttp://viterbi.usc.edu/assets/022/12892.pdf the Harvard International Review and The Progressive. Sahimi writes in broad support of moderate and reformist elements of Iranian politics, considering himself a member of the Iranian Green Movement and often reprinting statements of prominent Greens. He holds the view that Iran's disputed 2009 election was fraudulent. He has on many occasions defended Iran's nuclear program as being peaceful, and the actions of Iran as being essentially legal and justifiable (originally in a seven-part series at Payvand entitled Iran's Nuclear Program). In the process, he has frequently levelled criticism against other writers on the subject, accusing Con Coughlin (of the UK Daily Telegraph) of knowingly spreading lies and disinformation, and David Albright of exceptional bias. (Albright responded to the criticism in a program on antiwar.com radio). He has also criticized two former Deputy Directors-General of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen and Pierre Goldschmidt, citing unnamed sources to accuse Heinonen of breaking the IAEA protocols by leaking confidential information (to David Albright) and of spreading unconfirmed claims about the contents of a laptop that was supposedly stolen from Iran and given to Western intelligence agencies, as part of a \\"crusade against Iran.\\" He also accused Goldschmidt of having a \\"personal agenda\\" about Iran's nuclear program, whilst also disputing his assessment that Iran has violated the NPT. In his writings on Iran's nuclear program Sahimi has also expressed the view that the United Nation's Security Council sanction resolutions against Iran are illegal. Because of his strong support for the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear program and the similarity of his arguments to those used by the Iranian government in its IAEA submissions,e.g., he has been accused of being close to the government in Tehran.

Club career Born in San Sebastián, Elduayen made his professional debuts with local Real Sociedad, being barred by legendary Luis Arconada. In the 1985–86 season, however, as the starter suffered a severe injury in the first La Liga game, he was chosen by manager John Toshack as his successor, and the Basques eventually finished in seventh position but with one of the worst defensive records in the competition (51 goals against with 34 matches from the player). In the 1986 summer, Elduayen signed with fellow top flight club Atlético Madrid, starting in his first year but being relegated to the substitutes bench after the emergence of Abel Resino, who had been playing with the reserves. He experienced his best years with Real Burgos CF, helping the lowly Castile and León side to three consecutive seasons in the first division. In 1991–92, as they finished in a best-ever ninth position, he played in all 38 games (3,338 minutes) and only conceded 43 goals, winning the Don Balón Award for Best Spanish Player in the process.Spain – Footballer of the Year; at RSSSF In 1993, after Burgos relegation, Elduayen signed for Deportivo de La Coruña for about 1 million pesetas.

Physical Therapy. 81(12): 1904-1911. Components of spinal locomotion Reflex pathway: a pain receptor (sensory neuron) sends signals via the posterior horn, followed by a muscle activation (motor neuron) response via the anterior horn. =Centrally generated patterns= The spinal cord executes rhythmical and sequential activation of muscles in locomotion. The central pattern generator (CPG) provides the basic locomotor rhythm and synergies by integrating commands from various sources that serve to initiate or modulate its output to meet the requirements of the environment. CPG within the lumbosacral spinal cord segments represent an important component of the total circuitry that generates and controls posture and locomotion.Dietz 2003. Spinal cord pattern generators for locomotion. Clin. Neurophysiol. 114:1379–89. This spinal circuitry can function independently in the absence of descending input from the brain to generate stable posture and locomotion and even modulate activity to match changing conditions (e.g., stepping over obstacles).Forssberg H, Grillner S, Rossignol S. 1975 Phase dependent reflex reversal during walking in chronic spinal cats. Brain Research. 85:103–107. This capability improve with training (spinal plasticity) and therefore it is believed that spinal cord has the capability to learn and memorize.Garraway SM, Hochman S. 2001. Serotonin increases the incidence of primary afferentevoked long-term depression in rat deep dorsal horn neurons. Journal of Neurophysiology 85:1864–1872.Rygh LJ, Tjolsen A, Hole K, Svendsen F. 2002. Cellular memory in spinal nociceptive circuitry. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology. 43:153–159. =Sensory feedback= The sensory feedback originates from muscles, joints, tendons and skin afferents as well as from special senses and dynamically adapts the locomotor pattern of spinal cord to the requirements of the environment. These afferent sensory receptors perceive deformation of tissue, the amount of pressure (stretch or simply, placement), direction of movement, speed and velocity at which movement is occurring. Sensory modulation of CPG Simplified schema of basic nervous system function: signals are picked up by sensory receptors and sent to the spinal cord and brain, where processing occurs AT EACH LEVEL AND results in MODULATION OF signals sent FROM the spinal cord and out to motor neurons The dynamic interactions between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust the timing and amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle.Simonsen EB, Dyhre-Poulsen P. 1999. Amplitude of the human soleus H reflex during walking and running. Journal of Physiology. 515:929–939. It is important to note that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters.Grillner, S., Rossignol, S., 1978. On the initiation of the swing phase of locomotion in chronic spinal cats. Brain Research. 146, 269–277. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.Pearson, K.G., Rossignol, S., 1991. Fictive motor patterns in chronic spinal cats. Journal of Neurophysiology. 66, 1874–1887. The spinal cord processes and interprets proprioception in a manner similar to how our visual system processes information.Reggie Edgerton 2004. Plasticity of the spinal neural circuitry after injury. Annual Review of Neuroscience. 27:145–167. When a painting is viewed, the brain interprets the total visual field, as opposed to processing each individual pixel of information independently, and then derives an image. At any instant the spinal cord receives an ensemble of information from all receptors throughout the body that signals a proprioceptive “image” that represents time and space, and it computes which neurons to excite next based on the most recently perceived “images.” The importance of the CPG is not simply its ability to generate repetitive cycles, but also to receive, interpret, and predict the appropriate sequences of actions during any part of the step cycle, i.e., state dependence. The peripheral input then provides important information from which the probabilities of a given set of neurons being active at any given time can be finely tuned to a given situation during a specific phase of a step cycle. An excellent example of this is when a mechanical stimulus is applied to the dorsum of the paw of a cat. When the stimulus is applied during the swing phase, the flexor muscles of that limb are excited, and the result is enhanced flexion in order to step over the obstacle that created the stimulus.Forssberg H.1979 Stumbling corrective reaction: a phase-dependent compensatory reaction during locomotion. Journal of Neurophysiology, 42:936–953. However, when the same stimulus is applied during stance, the extensors are excited. Thus, the functional connectivity between mechanoreceptors and specific interneuronal populations within the spinal cord varies according to the physiological state. Even the efficacy of the monosynaptic input from muscle spindles to the motor neuron changes readily from one part of the step cycle to another, according to whether a subject is running or walking.Lovely RG, Gregor RJ, Roy RR, Edgerton VR.1990. Weight-bearing hindlimb stepping in treadmill-exercised adult spinal cats. Brain Research. 514:206–218 In the absence of CPG, control by brain as it happens in complete spinal cord injury, sensory feedback is very important in generating rhythmic locomotion. Firstly, locomotor movements can be initiated or blocked by some proprioceptive afferent inputs. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it. Secondly, proprioceptive afferents may participate in adapting walking speed, in determining overall cycle duration, and in regulating the structure of the step cycle’s subphases (i.e., swing, stance), which is required for speed adaptation and interlimb coupling.Zehret al,2003 Neural control of rhythmic human arm movement: phase dependence and task modulation of Hoffmann reflexes in forearm muscles. Journal of Neurophysiology. 89:12–21. Thirdly, proprioceptive afferents are involved in setting the level of muscle activity through various reflex pathways.Duysens J, Pearson KG. 1980. Inhibition of flexor burst generation by loading ankle extensor muscles in walking cats. Brain Res.187:321–332. Developmental evidence Ultrasound recordings have captured in utero images of human fetuses at 13–14 gestational weeks \\"creeping and climbing\\" and producing alternating steps.Ianniruberto and Tajani Ultrasonographic study of fetal movements. Seminars in Perinatology 5: 175–181, 1981. [Web of Science][Medline]. Onset of stepping in the fetus precedes development and myelination of most descending brain pathways strongly suggesting human spinal cord locomotor CPG and sensory feedback coordination and plasticity. Collectively, studies across the first postnatal year indicates that a locomotor continuum extends from neonatal stepping to the onset of independent walking further suggesting human locomotion is controlled by CPG and sensory input interaction. Rehabilitation The injured spinal cord is an “altered” spinal cord. After a SCI, supraspinal and spinal sources of control of movement differ substantially from that which existed prior to the injury,Dietz et al, 1998b. Locomotor pattern in paraplegic patients: training effects and recovery of spinal cord function. Spinal Cord. 36:380–390. thus resulting in an altered spinal cord. The automaticity of posture and locomotion emerge from the interactions between peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) to work in synergy, each system having intrinsic activation and inhibition patterns that can generate coordinated motor outputs. =Electrical stimulation= Numerous experiments have demonstrated that electrical stimulation (ES) of the lumbosacral enlargement and dorsal root can induce locomotor EMG patterns and even hindlimb stepping in acute and chronic low-spinal animals and humans.Grillner S, Zangger P. 1984. The effect of dorsal root transection on the efferent motor pattern in the cat’s hindlimb during locomotion. Acta Physiologica Scandinavia. 120:393–405.Gerasimenko YP, Avelev VD, Nikitin OA, Lavrov IA. 2003. Initiation of locomotor activity in spinal cats by epidural stimulation of the spinal cord. Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology. 33:247–254. Increased stimulation amplitude resulted in increased EMG amplitudes and an increased frequency of rhythmic activity. High frequencies of stimulation (>70 Hz) produced tonic activity in the leg musculature, which suggests that the upper lumbar stimulation may activate neuronal structures that then recruit interneurons involved in CPG.Dimitrijevic MR, Gerasimenko Y, Pinter MM.1998. Evidence for a spinal central pattern generator in humans. Annals of the New York Academy of Science. 860:360–376. =Treadmill training= Treadmill training (more commonly known as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern.Hornby, George T., Zemon, David H., & Campbell, Donielle. 2005. Robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training in individuals following motor incomplete spinal cord injury. Physical Therapy, 85(1), 52-66. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings.Winchester, Patricia & Querry, Ross. 2006. Robotic-orthoses for body weight supported treadmill training. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America, 17(1), 159-172. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work in conjunction with a treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training. In Humans with clinically complete SCI, there is evidence that treadmill training can improve several aspects of walking with some weight support assistance. Dietz and colleagues reported that after several weeks of treadmill training, the levels of weight bearing that can be imposed on the legs of clinically complete SCI subjects during treadmill walking significantly increases.Dietz V, Colombo G, Jensen L, Baumgartner L.1995. Locomotor capacity of spinal cord in paraplegic patients. Annals of Neurology. 37:574–582. When stepping on a treadmill with body-weight support, rhythmic leg muscle activation patterns can be elicited in clinically complete subjects who are otherwise unable to voluntarily produce muscle activity in their legs.Maegele M, Muller S, Wernig A, Edgerton VR, Harkema SJ. 2002. Recruitment of spinal motor pools during voluntary movements versus stepping after human spinal cord injury. Journal of Neurotrauma. 19:1217–1229. A recent study has demonstrated that the levels of leg extensor muscle activity recorded in clinically complete SCI subjects significantly improved over course of several weeks of step training.Wirz M, Colombo G, Dietz V. 2001. Long term effects of locomotor training in spinal man. Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. 71:93–96. the stepping ability of clinically complete SCI subjects can improve in response to step training, but the level of improvement has not reached a level that allows complete independence from assistance during full weight-bearing. Also in humans with complete or motor-complete SCI, a novel approach using a CPG-activating drug treatment called Spinalon was shown to acutely induce episodes of rhythmic locomotor-like leg movements or corresponding electromyographic activity. Largely due to the knowledge gained from studies on spinalized animals, two general principles have emerged for exciting the spinal circuits that generate stepping: * Body weight–supported treadmill training improves the ability of the lumbosacral spinal cord to generate weight-bearing stepping. * Patterns of sensory input provided during locomotor training are critical for driving the plasticity that mediates locomotor recovery.

As a conductor he had a long and fruitful partnership with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; conducting orchestras for feature films and television and radio programs for more than 40 years. He also worked as a guest conductor with orchestras and opera companies throughout Canada and served on the conducting staff of the Opéra du Québec. The Canadian Encyclopedia describes him as \\"a conductor with a sober but efficient technique, who was always faithful to the written score [and] equally at ease conducting concerts, opera, and lighter repertoire.\\" His best-known compositions are his Prélude for strings and the song, La Musique des yeux. He is the father of soprano Yolande Deslauriers-Husaruk. Life and career Born in Montreal, Deslauriers was a child prodigy and began his career as a concert violinist as a young teenager. He studied the violin with Émile Taranto and Camille Couture. He notably gave annual concert tours with singers Paul Dufault and Joseph Saucier in Canada and the United States between 1924-1929. He also studied with Claude Champagne (orchestration) Auguste Descarries (counterpoint and instrumentation), Romain-Octave Pelletier I (harmony and solfège) between 1918-1923. During the early 1930s he worked as a violinist and conductor aboard cruise ships.Husaruk, Yolande. \\"Jean Deslauriers\\", Le Bulletin, vol 1, no. 4, 1978 In 1935 Deslauriers became a member of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra with whom he played for the next decade. In 1936 he began working for CBC Radio in Montreal as a conductor, conducting orchestras for such programs as Radio-Concerts canadiens, Théâtre lyrique Molson, and Concerts d'opéras among others. As television became a more established medium he also conducted for CBC TV programs like L'Heure du concert, Sérénade, and Concerts populaires. He notably conducted the orchestra for the LaFlèche Trophy Award-winning radio and television program Serenade for Strings from 1937-1957. Following World War II he began arranging and conducting the scores for many films for the CBC. In 1954 he conducted one of the first opera broadcasts by CBC TV with a televised version of Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville. He conducted several more opera broadcasts for the CBC, including performances of André Messager's Monsieur Beaucaire (1954), Charles Gounod's Roméo et Juliette (1971) and Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly (1977). During the 1960s and 1970s Deslauriers was highly active as a guest conductor with symphony orchestras in such Canadian cities as Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. He notably conducted the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of Robert Turner's Three Episodes for Orchestra in 1966 and conducted the premiere of François Morel's Prismes-Anamorphoses with the CBC Symphony Orchestra in 1968. He also worked as a conductor for opera productions, notably serving as the music director of the Théâtre lyrique du Québec from 1967–1970 and as the assistant conductor of the Opéra du Québec from 1972-1975. During the 1970s he worked as a guest conductor for productions with the Canadian Opera Company and the Edmonton Opera. He also taught on the music faculty of the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Trois-Rivières where he was the first conductor of the school's orchestra. Having never retired, Deslauriers died in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec in 1978 at the age of 68. Upon his death, his large collection of musical scores was donated to the library at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. His personal papers are part of the collection at the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec. In 1975 the Montreal concert auditorium Plateau Hall was renamed the Salle Jean-Deslauriers in his honor.

The following players meet both of the following two criteria: #Have played at least one Superliga game. Players who were signed by Superliga clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or European games, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included. #Are considered foreign, i.e., outside Denmark. A player is considered foreign if he is not eligible to play for the national teams of Denmark. Clubs listed are those that the player has played at least one Superliga game for. Seasons listed are those that the player has played at least one Superliga game in. Note that seasons, not calendar years, are used. For example, \\"1992–95\\" indicates that the player has played in every season from 1992–93 to 1994–95, but not necessarily every calendar year from 1992 to 1995. Included in parentheses are also the number of games and goals in each series of years. In bold: players that have played at least one Superliga game in the current 2009–10 season, and the clubs they have played for. They include players that have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of a Superliga club that have not played a Superliga game in the current season.

Early life Tamar-kali was born and raised in Brooklyn a 2nd generation musician through her father, who was a band leader and played bass in local funk and soul bands. Her father even had her perform with the band as she was exposed to singing along with live instrumentation as a child. She grew up with an eclectic appreciation for music with influences from home and choral classical training at school. She spent the summers of her childhood with her mother's family on St. Helena Island, South Carolina where she developed a deep appreciation for her Gullah roots, a mixture of Indigenous Southern U.S. and West African customs and languages. She attended Catholic School for 13 years, which she credits for her rebellious nature and sound. Her musical inspirations include PJ Harvey, Grace Jones, The Mars Volta, Deftones, Betty Davis, Patti Smith, Archie Bell and the Drells, Ray, Goodman and Brown, Crown Heights Affair and Quicksand.

In 2006 she released her first music video for the single \\"Boot\\" off her debut EP Geechee Goddess Hardcore Warrior Soul. The theme dealt with a young black girl lacking awareness of her own beauty, being left vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Her debut studio album, Black Bottom, was released in Fall 2010 on the OyaWarrior label. In March 2018, she created multi-disciplinary project named Demon Fruit Blues. This video premiered at Mabou Mines in New York City. It is about the journey of misogyny spanning from the Garden of Eden to the present while also including biblical elements as well as female African deities and feminist theory. This project was entirely composed by Tamar-Kali with instrumentation include acoustic guitar, harp, violin, viola, cello, and bass. The composition was informed and motivated by her own life as a black woman and artist. =Composing= Tamar-kali is a frequent collaborator with director Dee Rees. She scored her first feature film Mudbound, for which she won the World Soundtrack Award in the Discovery of the Year category The film marks her third collaboration with the director after appearing in Pariah, which was Rees' first feature film, and writing a song for Bessie on HBO. For Bessie, she provided a few songs on the soundtrack including her own vocals as well as performing with her band in one of the scenes.

Biography He was born in Durban, South Africa, to English parents,\\"Joan's Feelgood memories of her son Lee\\". Echo. 22 November 2010. Retrieved 5 July 2013 was brought up in Ealing, and moved to Canvey Island with his family when he was 13.Staig, Laurence. \\"Obituary: Lee Brilleaux\\". The Independent. 9 April 1994. Retrieved 23 March 2013. He co-founded Dr Feelgood with Wilko Johnson in 1971 and was the band's lead singer, harmonica player and occasional guitarist. According to one obituary: \\"Brilleaux and Johnson developed a frantic act, often charismatically dressed in dark suits and loose ties, shabby rather than smart. The rough, and almost ruthless, edge which ran through his vocal and harmonica style reflected the character and philosophy of the band.\\" In 1976, Brilleaux helped found Stiff Records, one of the driving forces of the \\"New Wave\\" of the mid- to late-1970s, with a loan of £500. Johnson left Dr Feelgood in 1977 but Brilleaux continued the band with Gypie Mayo on guitar in 1978. By 1984 he was the only founder member remaining. In 1986, he recorded the album Brilleaux, featuring songs by Johnny Cash. His last performance was in January 1994, at the Dr Feelgood Music Bar in Canvey Island. He died on 7 April 1994 of lymphoma, at the age of 41, at his home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Legacy After a one-year hiatus Dr. Feelgood appointed Pete Gage as their new vocalist. In 2011, contemporary artist and Dr. Feelgood fan Scott King announced his intention to commemorate Lee Brilleaux by erecting a 300 foot gold-plated statue of the musician on the foreshore in Southend-on-Sea close to the legendary Kursaal where the band played some of their most important gigs. An e-petition was launched to collect signatures in support of the project, and it now has approximately 1500 signatures. In 2014, music writer Zoë Howe announced her intention to write Roadrunner, a biography based on Brilleaux's life, including a collection of his life stories and memories, with classic and unseen images. The book reached 100% crowd-funding via Unbound on 18 May 2014. Howe is also the co-author of Looking Back at Me, an autobiography of Wilko Johnson, the original guitarist with Dr. Feelgood. The book was published, by Polygon, as Lee Brilleaux: Rock'n'Roll Gentleman.

During the skirmish Poustaminie approached the Paiutes and laid down his weapons to show his peaceful intentions but Wahveveh had him killed by one of his braves. In a related incident taken on by his brother Chief Paulina, a scouting party was organized for the intention of vengeance for Paulina's murder of Wasco Chief Queapama. This party was led by First Sergeant Billy Chinook and other Wasco Scouts of the U.S. Army. They attacked a Paiute camp at Dry Creek, capturing or killing all 32 Paiutes. The scouting party also located Paulina above Lake Henry on Steens Mountain. Paulina retreated to a cave protected by boulders but Chief Wahveveh and two other Paiutes were not able to escape and were killed by the Wascos.Barly, 35 Wahvevah and Paulina had a third brother, Oitsi, who also fought alongside them.

She operated in the Atlantic trades for five years. So engaged on the evening of June 1, 1973, the vessel was involved in a disastrous collision with the oil tanker Esso Brussels in lower New York Harbor and was damaged so badly that she was removed from active service. Collision with Esso Brussels Just before midnight on June 1, 1973, Sea Witch completed her port call at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island and departed for sea carrying a load of 445 containers below deck and 285 containers above deck. Under the command of Sandy Hook Pilot John T. (Jack) Cahill and her captain, John Paterson, the ship proceeded through the Kill van Kull towards lower New York Harbor and the Narrows, passing the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at 0029 hours on June 2. Directing the helmsman to bring the ship to a heading of 167 degrees in order to begin transiting the Narrows, Cahill also ordered the ship's speed increased to 13.4 knots, just shy of the maximum permitted harbor speed of 14 knots. With the ship now moving closer to 15 knots due to the effects of a strong 2-3 knot ebb tide as she passed by the general anchorage off Stapleton, Staten Island, Cahill ordered a course correction at 0036 hours to port to bring the ship's heading to 158 degrees to bring her in line with the center of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The second turn never occurred. When the ship did not respond as expected the helmsman advised the captain that Sea Witch was no longer responding to steering inputs, Captain Paterson quickly ordered steering control transferred from the port side steering system to the starboard system, while Cahill ordered the rudder put hard over to port. Both the captain's and the pilot′s attempts to regain control of Sea Witch proved futile, as both the port and starboard steering systems were connected into a single mechanism atop the vessels rudder post by a faulty \\"key,\\" a device similar to a cotter pin, which had failed. Without this small fastener in place all steering control of Sea Witch was lost, and with the ship rapidly moving out of the channel toward Staten Island Cahill ordered the engines to full astern, began sounding a series of short rapid blasts on the ship's whistle, and asked Captain Paterson to sound the general alarm to alert the ship′s crew. After attempts by the chief mate and two able seaman stationed on the bow to release both of Sea Witch's anchors failed, Cahill locked the whistle to sound continuously to alert nearby vessels, particularly the nearby oil tanker of her distress as she continued her turn towards the anchored, fully laden vessel. Less than five minutes had passed from the initial loss of steering control aboard Sea Witch before she was within a ship′s length from Esso Brussels′ midship, and with the ship still making 13 knots with her engines in full reverse and a collision now unavoidable, Cahill and Paterson ordered the crew off the bow and abandoned the forward superstructure. Aboard Esso Brussels, the 36-member crew had roughly two minutes′ warning of the impending collision before the sharply raked bow of Sea Witch, heavily reinforced for operations in icy harbors, rammed into the tanker at 0042 hours. Rather than crumpling and deforming from the force of its impact with the hull of Esso Brussels, Sea Witch′s bow retained its shape as its tore into three midship cargo tanks of Esso Brussels, locking both ships together and allowing a significant amount of her load of light Nigerian crude oil to spray onto both ships and spill into the surrounding waters. Sparks from the collision and severed electrical wiring quickly ignited the highly volatile oil and a tremendous explosion occurred, leaving both ships afire and wreathed in a large and growing pool of burning oil. As the crew of Esso Brussels made their own attempt to abandon their ship, the crew aboard Sea Witch mustered in her aft superstructure, where they attempted to lower her aft lifeboats. Heavy smoke, heat, and a growing number of shrapnel-laced explosions from several burning containers filled with aerosol cans frustrated their initial efforts, and as the rapidly spreading burning oil slick enveloped the ship the effort was abandoned and the crew took shelter in a cabin equipped with a half-inch fire hose to await rescue. During this time, the still-engaged engines of Sea Witch began to pull the two ships into the center of the Narrows, where the burning pool of oil sent flames high enough to scorch the bottom of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge above the water's surface. Fortunately, the anchor chains on Esso Brussels parted at this point allowing both ships to pass under the bridge quickly, preventing the steel from suffering significant heat damage. Propelled by the outbound tide and the engines of Sea Witch, the two furiously burning ships proceeded into outer New York Harbor, where they ran hard aground in Gravesend Bay. Rescue Within minutes of the initial collision and explosion, the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) fireboat Fire Fighter had departed its nearby station at Marine Company 9 in Stapleton and arrived at what the firefighters aboard would later describe as a sea of flames that extended in front of them. Initially assuming there had been an explosion on Esso Brussels, the fireboat began to pour water onto the ship from its starboard bow, keeping their ship upwind and upcurrent from the smoke and flames now heading towards the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Following the inferno as it proceeded under the bridge and into Gravesend Bay, Fire Fighter maneuvered to a new position along the side of Esso Brussels and those aboard caught their first sight of the fully involved hull of Sea Witch and realized that there were actually two vessels involved in the fire instead of just one. Moving toward the stern of Sea Witch in an attempt to look for survivors, Fire Fighter and her crew found the entire ship enveloped by the burning slick and much of the after superstructure heavily aflame. Aboard Sea Witch, the 31 surviving crewmen had been trapped in the rear cabin for more than half an hour, enduring dozens of close-quarter explosions from the ship's cargo and temperatures so high that the crew was forced to spray the surrounding bulkheads with water in order to stave off being baked to death. With both ships now grounded and the fires steadily progressing aft the crew aboard were left with little option but to abandon ship, leading Cahill to make a final effort to try to signal any of the tugs and fireboats now circling the burning vessels. Covering himself with a wet blanket to shield himself against the heat and flames, Cahill went to Sea Witch's stern and used his flashlight to signal a fireboat he could see in the distance. Quickly spotted by the astonished captain aboard Fire Fighter, the fireboat used its 5-inch (127-mm) bow monitor to cut a path through the burning slick in order to reach the stern of Sea Witch, and once in position used every monitor on board to keep the flames at bay as her crew rigged two ladders onto Sea Witch, allowing the 31 trapped men to descend to safety at 0145 hours. A further seven members of Sea Witch′s crew were recovered from the water surrounding the ship and the ship′s electrician was rescued from aboard ship by the crew of M/V Brian McAllister at approximately 0245 hours. Musters would later reveal that three of Sea Witch′s crew had died, two men missing and presumed dead and her captain, who had died of an apparent heart attack while awaiting rescue. Esso Brussels had also lost her captain and twelve of her crew in the collision and subsequent fire. Aftermath The MV Chemical Pioneer at Searsport, ME With all survivors accounted for, FDNY fireboats, United States Coast Guard cutters, and harbor tugs set about extinguishing the fires aboard the two ships, and by dawn on May 31 all fires aboard Esso Brussels were declared out and the two ships were separated. Initially ordered to use their maximum pumping capacity to snuff the heavy flames still burning aboard Sea Witch, the fireboat fleet was called off after the ship developed a 25° list to port and threatened to capsize. Electing to let the fire burn itself out, the captain of the port released all but one FDNY marine unit from the scene, the one which stayed remaining with the ship for a further 15 days until all fires were declared out on June 14, 1973. Pumped out and placed under tow, the charred hulk of Sea Witch was moved to an outer pier at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn, where she would remain for the next eight years. Eventually sold in situ to commercial interests, the hulk of Sea Witch was subsequently drydocked at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, and cut into two pieces; her still-operational stern and machinery spaces were rebuilt and attached to a newly built chemical tanker, Chemical Discoverer, which was operating in July 2020 as Chemical Pioneer. Sea Witch′s fire-damaged bow was relocated to the Baltimore, Maryland, scrapyard of Kurt Iron & Metals Company, where its former fuel tanks were used to store waste oils until being scrapped in 2008..

It is closely related to Melaleuca alsophila and Melaleuca citrolens, being differentiated from them by the number of flowers in a group. In this species, they are in groups of three (called triads). It is a small to medium- sized tree, sometimes with several trunks when growing in the open. It usually grows in areas with saline soils that are regularly flooded, often near mangroves.Distribution of M. acadioides Description Melaleuca acacioides is a tree, usually with white or grey papery bark, sometimes growing as high as . The young growth is covered with rather long, soft hairs. Its leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, and are long and wide, glabrous when mature, narrow oval in shape, sometimes with a small point on the end and with many distinct oil glands. The flowers are white to cream and arranged in spikes, sometimes at the tips of the branches and sometimes in the leaf axils. Each spike contains 2 to 10 groups of flowers in threes. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and each bundle contains 6 or 7 stamens. Flowers appear in winter and spring and are followed by woody capsules long grouped in clusters along the stem. flowers foliage fruits Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca acacioides was first described in 1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (acacioides) is a reference to the similarity of the leaves to those of some Acacia species. The ending -oides is a Latin suffix meaning \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\". In 1986, the genus Melaleuca was reviewed by Bryan Barlow and Melaleuca acacioides was separated into three groups - a new species, Melaleuca citrolens and two subspecies: *Melaleuca acacioides F.Muell. subsp. acacioides *Melaleuca acacioides (A.Cunn.ex Benth.) Barlow subsp. alsophila. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca acacioides occurs from western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory to Cape York Peninsula and New Guinea. It grows on the landward side of mangroves and samphire in slightly saline soils. Uses =Traditional uses= Aboriginal people used the leaves of Melaleuca acacioides (and of M. argentea and M. leucadendra) as flavouring in cooking. \\"Bee bread\\" (produced from pollen) and honey were foods collected from native bee hives prevalent in swamp forests, including those of Melaleuca acacioides. =Essential oils= Selinenes, which are an important part of celery seed oil, are major components of the essential oils extracted from the leaves of this species. =Other uses= The timber of Melaleuca acadioides is strong and dark coloured. The trunks may have a use as small poles and as fuel. Melaleuca acacioides may also be useful as a windbreak in difficult coastal situations.

Discovered in 1948, and having produced of oil during its peak year in 1950, it now has but one active oil well producing a little over a barrel of oil a day, and is very near to exhaustion, with only 343,000 recoverable barrels of oil remaining throughout its extent according to the official California State Department of Conservation estimate. p. 101-2. As of 2010, the only active operator was Longview Production Company. Setting The Guijarral Hills are a low range of hills, rising a little more than a hundred feet above the floor of the San Joaquin Valley to the east, and scarcely noticeable in the shadow of the nearby Coast Range of central California. These low hills are the surface expression of the southern portion of the Coalinga Anticline, which separates the smaller, largely agricultural Pleasant Valley to the west from the main portion of the California Central Valley to the east. The town of Coalinga is about eight miles (13 km) west of the hills, with the large Coalinga Oil Field wrapping around the town in a crescent shape. The Guijarral field is a similar, smaller, and separate field southeast of the giant Coalinga field.Hunter, G.W. Guijarral Hills Oil Field: California Division of Oil and Gas, Summary of Operations. 1951. Vol. 37 No. 1. pp. 13-19. The major road through the field is Jayne Avenue, which runs east to west, connecting Interstate 5 to Coalinga. California State Route 33 runs from north to south, west of the field, joining with Jayne Avenue. The Pleasant Valley State Prison, also on Jayne Avenue, is adjacent to the oil field on the west. Climate in the area is arid to semi-arid, and native vegetation consists of grassland and low scrub. Summertime temperatures routinely exceed , and freezes occur during the coldest months, although snow is rare. Most precipitation occurs in the winter. Runoff to the west and north is into Los Gatos Creek, which flows northeast into the San Joaquin Valley; runoff to the south and east is into Zapato Chino Creek, which joins with Los Gatos Creek draining to the northeast. Elevations in the vicinity range from around in Los Gatos Creek north of the hills to at the highest point in the hills; the productive portion of the oil field ranges from around 550 to above sea level.USGS 1:24000 topographic map, Guijarral Hills quadrangle (1991) Geology Oil well with pumpjack, oil-water separator, and storage tanks on the Guijarral Hills field The field, like many in and adjacent to the California Central Valley, is an anticlinal structure, in which oil has accumulated through both structural and stratigraphic mechanisms. The Guijarral Hills are a segment of a long anticline which includes the Kettleman Hills to the southeast, and which continues to the northwest as the large eastern extension of the Coalinga Oil Field (named there the Coalinga Anticline, and Anticline Ridge on United States Geological Survey maps). The uppermost productive units in the field are sand lenses within the Miocene-age Temblor Formation, named the Smith and Allison respectively from upper to lower. The most productive unit, and the first to be discovered, is the Leda Sands, which reside in the Miocene-age Vaqueros Formation, underlying the Temblor. The impermeable Salt Creek member of the same Vaqueros Formation is above the Leda Sands, trapping the oil and preventing its natural upward movement.DOGGR, pp. 196, 200, 202, 204 Other oil pools were found later, including the Gatchell, Dessell, McAdams, Sanger, Bourdieu, and Smith, with the most recent discovery being the Dessell pool in 1962. These pools are accumulations of oil in permeable sand lenses within less permeable lithologic units. Oil quality varies throughout the field but is always medium to light, with API gravity between 27 and 38. Sulfur content is generally low, with no pool over 0.63 percent by weight. In 2008 the remaining active well reported a water cut of 96%, a high value typically indicating a field near the end of its useful life (once that much of the fluid pumped from the reservoir is water, the cost to extract oil exceeds the revenue generated by selling it).DOGGR 2009, p. 91 History, production, and operations The Guijarral field was discovered relatively late (1948) because of the depth and relative inaccessibility of the oil-producing formations. While the enormous Coalinga field is but a few miles away, in a similar anticlinal structure, it is richly productive at under below ground surface, and hence was easier to exploit. Drillers attempted to find oil at the Guijarral Hills in the 1920s, but the maximum depth of their boreholes was only a little over , and while these boreholes were in good locations had they been drilled sufficiently deep, they were abandoned. The discovery well was put in by Barnsdall Oil Company in 1948 to a depth of and flowed over ; by the end of 1948, seven more wells had been drilled to follow on this success. Development of the field was fast, with 55 new wells drilled in 1949, and another 20 in 1950. The field reached peak production in 1950 with over of oil pumped that year.DOGGR, p. 198 As the Leda Sands had proven to be spectacularly productive, operators began searching for other rich petroleum deposits, and in 1949 found the second-most productive unit, the Allison Sand; in 1954, the rich North Leda unit; in 1957, the Gatchell pool, and in 1962 the Dessel pool. The discontiguous Polvadero pool was discovered in 1953 by Superior Oil Company, and reached its peak production in 1956.DOGGR, pp. 196-203 Production in all areas and units gradually declined after the early peak, in a typical production curve for an oil field. Many companies have operated on the field in its 60-year history, with Union Oil, now Chevron Corporation, being one of the largest players. As of 2010, the only active operator remaining on the field was Longview Production Company, who retained one periodically active well. (Fields with no active wells must be formally abandoned in short order; it is often in an operator's interest to keep at least one well operating if there is any potential either for redevelopment or sale.) In early 2010, the Australian firm Solimar Energy acquired a portion of the field with intent to redevelop, believing that the field contained considerable untapped reserves; they stated they intended to have the first new well operating by mid-2010.Solimar Energy acquires oil leases in the San Joaquin Basin, January 2010 References * California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III.

Immediately before taking command of Lark, Wilson had commanded in the Caribbean.Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, pp.217-8. On 21 April Lark engaged with an unknown French cutter that she drove on shore, but was not, however, able to destroy. A neutral vessel that came out on 23 April informed Wilson that the cutter carried 10 guns and 36 men, and that after she got off the shore she had sailed to the Texel roads along the inside of the barrier islands. Then on 25 April Lark captured the French privateer cutter Impregnable. Lark ran the Impregnable on shore on Vlie Island where Impregnable's crew got ashore under the protection of about 100 troops who had gathered there. Wilson then sent his small boat to get Impregnable off. Lark's sailors came under musket fire from the troops on shore so Wilson sent his large boat, which cleared away the soldiers.

For England, Wales, and Scotland, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 makes hateful behaviour towards a victim based on the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) in a racial group an \\"aggravating factor\\" for the purpose of sentencing in respect of specified crimes. A \\"racial group\\" is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the Public Order Act 1986, and offences under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/uksi_20032267_en.pdf The Police and CPS have formulated a definition of hate crimes and hate incidents, with hate speech forming a subset of these. Something is a hate incident if the victim or anyone else think it was motivated by hostility or prejudice based on: disability, race, religion, transgender identity or sexual orientation.

All the offences in Part 3 attach to the following acts: the use of words or behaviour or display of written material, publishing or distributing written material, the public performance of a play, distributing, showing or playing a recording, broadcasting or including a programme in a programme service, and possession of inflammatory material. In the circumstances of hatred based on religious belief or on sexual orientation, the relevant act (namely, words, behaviour, written material, or recordings, or programme) must be threatening and not just abusive or insulting. The Football Offences Act 1991 (amended by the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999) forbids indecent or racialist chanting at designated football matches. The use of prisons to regulate hate speech has been critiqued from a normative perspective. Reform Section 5 campaign In 2012, a campaign was launched by the Christian Institute to remove the word \\"insulting\\" from section 5 of the Public Order Act. The campaign was backed by a number of high-profile activists including comedian Rowan Atkinson and former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis. On 12 December 2012, the House of Lords voted in favour of amending the Public Order Act to remove the word \\"insulting\\". In January 2013, the government announced that it would accept the amendment, despite having previously opposed it. The amendment to the Public Order Act was duly passed into law, as section 57 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013. Section 57 of the Act came into force on 1 February 2014.Statutory Instruments 2013/2981 art. 3 Selected cases On 13 October 2001, Harry Hammond, an evangelist, was arrested and charged under section 5 of the Public Order Act (1986) because he had displayed to people in Bournemouth a large sign bearing the words \\"Jesus Gives Peace, Jesus is Alive, Stop Immorality, Stop Homosexuality, Stop Lesbianism, Jesus is Lord\\". In April 2002, a magistrate convicted Hammond, fined him £300, and ordered him to pay costs of £395. On 2 September 2006, Stephen Green was arrested in Cardiff for distributing pamphlets which called sexual activity between members of the same sex a sin. On 28 September 2006, the Crown advised Cardiff Magistrates Court that it would not proceed with the prosecution. On 8 December 2009, Mr Justice Richard Clancy, sitting at Liverpool Magistrates' Court, acquitted Ben and Sharon Vogelenzang, hoteliers, of charges under the Public Order Act 1986 and under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Vogelensangs were charged after a guest at their hotel, Ericka Tazi, complained that the Vogelenzangs had insulted her after she appeared in a hijab. On 4 March 2010, a jury returned a verdict of guilty against Harry Taylor, who was charged under Part 4A of the Public Order Act 1986. Taylor was charged because he left anti-religious cartoons in the prayer-room of Liverpool's John Lennon Airport on three occasions in 2008. The airport chaplain, who was insulted, offended, and alarmed by the cartoons, called the police. On 23 April 2010, Judge Charles James of Liverpool Crown Court sentenced Taylor to a six-month term of imprisonment suspended for two years, made him subject to a five-year Anti- Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) (which bans him from carrying religiously offensive material in a public place), ordered him to perform 100 hours of unpaid work, and ordered him to pay £250 costs. Taylor was convicted of similar offences in 2006. On 20 April 2010, police arrested Dale McAlpine, a Christian preacher, of Workington in Cumbria, for saying that homosexual conduct was a sin. On 14 May 2010, the Crown decided not to prosecute McAlpine. Later still the police apologised to McAlpine for arresting him at all, and paid him several thousand pounds compensation. On 23 April 2018, Scottish YouTuber Mark Meechan of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire was fined £800 after being found \\"grossly offensive\\" for posting a YouTube video that was viewed over 3 million times depicting him training his girlfriend's pug to respond to the phrase \\"Sieg Heil\\" by lifting his paw in a Nazi salute. Tory MP Philip Davies requested a review of freedom of expression in parliament in response to the conviction. Comedians Ricky Gervais and David Baddiel tweeted in support of Meechan. Tom Walker, Shappi Khorsandi, and Stephen Fry defended Meechan and criticised other comedians for their silence on the issue. Meechan, who plans to appeal, was sentenced to pay an £800 fine on 23 April 2018. A crowd of about 500 people protested the move in London. In 2017, 19-year old Croxteth resident Chelsea Russell quoted a line from Snap Dogg's song \\"I'm Trippin'\\" on her Instagram page. The line, which read \\"Kill a snitch nigga, rob a rich nigga\\", was copied from a friend's page as part of a tribute to Frankie Murphy who was killed in a car accident at age 13. Hate crime investigators were alerted to the presence of the slur and charged Russell with \\"sending a grossly offensive message by means of a public electronic communications network\\". Defence lawyer Carole Clarke stated that she received a request from one of the arresting officers that the word \\"nigga\\", the subject of the trial, not be used in court. In April 2018, District Judge Jack McGarva found Russell guilty and delivered a sentence which included a £585 fine, a curfew and an ankle monitoring bracelet. However, Russell's conviction was overturned by Liverpool Crown Court on 21 February 2019.

It is a dense shrub or small tree with fibrous or papery bark and is common in areas seasonally inundated during the wet season. Description Melaleuca alsophila is a dense shrub or tree to and is often multistemmed. There is considerable variation in its leaf size, even on one individual plant but they are commonly long (sometimes up to ), flat, 5 to 7-veined and spirally arranged on the stem. They are typically oval to tear-drop shaped, tapering near the stem. The flowers are cream to white, in small dense heads. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and in this species there are 9 to 16 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs in the dry season, from March to October and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules about , cup or barrel-shaped, occurring singly or in small clusters. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca alsophila was first informally described by Allan Cunningham from a specimen collected on the north west coast of Australia during a voyage of . The description was formally applied in 1866 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (alsophila) is from the Greek alsos, meaning \\"grove\\" and philos \\"loving\\", referring to the habitat of the species. Distribution and habitat Saltwater paperbark is found on sandy, often saline soils along watercourses, in swamps, on floodplains, coastal flats, and various saline habitats. It occurs in the Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Northern Kimberley, Victoria Bonaparte, Great Sandy Desert and Pilbara biogeographic regions of Western Australia. Indigenous uses Aboriginal people in the Kimberley region knew the plant to be a favourite resting place for pigeons and they used its trunk to build shelters. Native, stingless bees often make their hives in the trunk and branches. The bark can be used as a mosquito repellant and an infusion of its leaves is used to relieve the symptoms of a cold.

The plant which has an electricity generation capacity of 5 MW has been under construction since 2001 and came online in 2010, becoming Iran's first geothermal power plant. It uses steam formed by the injected water into specially drilled wells which can be more than deep. The water is heated up, deep in the ground where temperature is above . The heated up water upon de-pressurization at the surface turns to steam which is then used to power steam turbines for electricity generation. The plant is being further expanded to provide geothermal heating to areas in Ardabil Province for both domestic as well as industrial purposes. As power plant is situated in touristic Sabalan area, it is also hoped the nonpolluting nature of the plant will help to preserve the nature and attract more tourism to the area. In long term, Iran plans to use the gained experience with this power plant in installation of up to 12 other geothermal stations in the country.سايت خبری وزارت نيرو – وزيرنيرو: تكميل اولين نيروگاه زمين ‌گرمايي ‌ايران مراحل پاياني را مي‌گذراند.

(A painting from Jason's Tomb) Jewish pirates were those seafaring Jewish people who engaged in piracy. While there is some mention of the phenomenon in antiquity, especially during the Hasmonean period, most Jewish pirates were Sephardim who operated in the years following the Alhambra Decree ordering the expulsion of Iberia's Jews. Upon fleeing Spain and Portugal, some of these Jews became pirates and turned to attacking the Catholic Empire's shipping as both barbary corsairs from their refuge in the Ottoman dominions, as well as privateers bearing letters of marque from Spanish rivals such as the United Netherlands. Many Jews also were involved in backing Spanish-attacking privateers economically. They viewed this campaign to be a profitable strategy of revenge for their expulsion and the Inquisition's continued religious persecution of their Jewish and converso brethren in both the Old and New Worlds. Piracy in the ancient world: pirates of Joppa Ancient Jewish life was concentrated around in the highlands of the Samarian and Judaean Mountains, located some distance from the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, Jews were initially not very active in seafaring or navigation. After 142 BCE, the Jewish Hasmonean state acquired ports of their own. Joppa (Jaffa), Ashdod and Gaza were added to their domain, and a small number of Jewish sailors developed. Jewish pirates were first mentioned by Josephus. There is a drawing of a pirate ship following two merchant ships at Jason's Tomb in Jerusalem. The drawing shows three ships, one of which is a war ship with Jason holding the bow and getting ready to shoot. The painting is dated back at early 1st century BCE. Seleucid Empire decay was a result of the Maccabean war, and was followed by an influx of Jewish and Syrian pirates operating from Levant. Pompey's journey to Judea may indicate a connection between Jewish and Cilician pirates. As a matter of fact there were so many Jews at sea during Pompey's time, some of whom were pirates, that king Antigonus II Mattathias was accused of sending them out on purpose. By the end of First Jewish–Roman War, also known as The Great Revolt, Jews who had been driven out of Galilee rebuilt Joppa (Jaffa), which had been destroyed earlier by Cestius Gallus. Surrounded and cut off by the Romans they rebuilt the city walls, and used a light flotilla to demoralize commerce and interrupt the grain supply to Rome from Alexandria. In The Jewish War, Josephus wrote: In July 67 Vespasian attacked Joppa. The people of Joppa took to the sea, but a pre-dawn storm wrecked the ships. Many drowned, others killed themselves. Those who survived the wreck, numbering about 4,200, were killed by Romans. Joppa was destroyed once again. After Joppa's destruction for the second time, Vespasian built a citadel there to prevent the Jewish pirates from retaking the city. The Romans considered their victory over Joppa's pirates very important, and commemorated it with a large number of coins for \\"naval victory.\\" Premodern Sephardi piracy =Iberian Jewish pirates= The Age of Exploration was in part enabled by a crucial navigational advances developed by the primarily Jewish Majorcan cartographic school as well as Abraham Zacuto's ephemerides. Zacuto, Royal Astronomer and Historian of Portugal, left Portugal rather than become Christian. Vasco da Gama even lent his name to his Jewish pilot Gaspar da Gama. Many Jews also worked as ship navigators. Suddenly expelled from Iberia, their knowledge and skills in ship navigation made them enemies of the state and were contributing factors to the development of Jewish piracy in that age. After Jews were expelled from Spain and Portugal, many of them settled in the friendlier Muslim lands of the Mediterranean (the Ottoman Empire for example). Like their Muslim compatriots who were likewise expelled in 1492, Jews were also looking to revenge Iberian Christians by sharing with Muslims the newest military technique and secrets used by Christians. And they also joined in on the Muslim anti-Christian piracy of the Mediterranean, such as Sinan Reis and Samuel Pallache. The English State Papers of 1521 bear evidences of Sinan Reis, who sailed with Hayreddin Barbarossa: Christopher Columbus himself noticed a great symbolism in the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and his sea voyages of discovery, when he started his diary with this statement: =Jewish pirates of Jamaica= Today, there are only around 200 Jews in Jamaica. However, at some point 20% of Kingston's population were Portuguese and Spanish Jews, while Spanish Town was founded by escaped Jews. The first Jews landed on the island in 1530 just 40 years after it was discovered by Christopher Columbus. While for a time the Columbus family's rule kept out the Inquisition, when their power was eroded and the Church began threatening the crypto-Jewish populace, they aided the British conquest of the Isle. Under the British, Port Royal Jamaica was home not only to privateers bearing letters of marque for operating against the Spanish, some of whom were Jewish, but was also home to a large Jewish community which economically backed the raids against the Spanish. In 2008 an old Jewish cemetery was discovered outside Kingston. Some tombstones have not only Hebrew writing, but are also marked with the skull and crossbones — pirate symbols. Jewish pirates of Jamaica named their ships for ancient Jewish heroes and prophets like Prophet Samuel, Queen Esther and Shield of Abraham. They targeted Spanish and Portuguese merchant ships. One of the most famous Jewish pirates of Jamaica was Moses Cohen Henriques, who in 1628, led with Piet Pieterszoon Hein the only successful capture of the Spanish treasure fleet. He went on to aid the Dutch capture of northeast Brazil from Portugal. Notable pirates =The Great Jew= Holy League of Charles V under the command of Andrea Doria at the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Sinan, called The Great Jew by the Spaniards, was one such Jewish refugee whose family emigrated from Spain to the Ottoman Empire, according to some non-academic authors. He sailed as a barbary corsair under Hayreddin Barbarossa. Some attribute to him the defeat of an Imperial- Spanish fleet in 1538 at the Battle of Preveza. Some non-academic authors, mistaking him for Sinan Pasha and sometimes again mistaking the latter's place of burial, Üsküdar, for Shkodër in Albania (both places bearing the alternative name of Scutari), wrote erroneously that Sinan the Jew is buried in a Jewish cemetery in Albania. =Yaacov Kuriel= Yaacov Kuriel was born to a Jewish family which converted to Christianity under pressure from the Inquisition when Yaakov was a child. As a young man, Yaacov Kuriel was a captain of the Spanish fleet until he was caught by the Inquisition. He was freed by his sailors, most of whom were marranos themselves. For many years after that his only goal was revenge. He had three pirate ships under his command. Little is known about what happened to him later. Some believe that eventually he made his way to the Holy Land, studied Kabbalah and died peacefully of old age.

As a composer his music is written in an essentially folkloric and popular style which avoids harmonic sophistication. His compositional output includes several orchestral works, chamber works, and works for solo piano. He also wrote 4 ballets and a considerable amount of music for radio programs. In 1937 his symphonic poem Légende won the Jean Lallemand Prize which led to the work's premiere performance that year by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under conductor Wilfrid Pelletier. The work was repeated by the orchestra in concerts the following year under conductor Sir Ernest MacMillan.\\"Hector Gratton, eminent Canadian composer\\", CRMA, vol 1, Jan 1943 Life and career Born in Hull, Quebec (now Gatineau, Quebec), Gratton studied music theory and composition with Albertine Morin-Labrecque, Oscar O'Brien, and Alfred Whitehead. He was a piano student of Alphonse Martin and Alfred La Liberté. From La Liberté he gained a great appreciation for the works and aesthetics of Nikolai Medtner and Alexander Scriabin, two composers which influenced his own compositional style. During the 1920s, Gratton toured with Charles Marchand performing folk music that was harmonized by O'Brien. He notably performed in concerts with Marchand at the CPR Festivals between 1927-1930. He soon after began working for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during the early years of national radio. He composed and conducted music for Je me souviens, one of the first major Canadian radio series which featured scripts by Félix Leclerc. Also notable among his compositions for CBC Radio was the incidental music for Cécile Chabot's 1945 Christmas story L'Imagerie. Gratton died in Montreal in 1970 at the age of 69. He was made an associate of the Canadian Music Centre posthumously. Several of his original manuscripts are part of the collection at the Library and Archives Canada.

The quartet consists of lead Billy Yost, guitarist Jonny Ifergan, and bassist Daniel Leu. They released their debut LP, Sorry All Over the Place, on September 18, 2015 via Jullian Records. The album was recorded by Jim Eno (the drummer for Spoon) at his studio Public Hi-Fi in Austin, Texas. Rolling Stone says The Kickback \\"conjures the very best parts of The Veils and The Walkmen and The Killers, writing lean, nervy songs that snarl and snap.\\" Their sophomore album Weddings & Funerals was released on July 14, 2017. They have also released a clutch of EPs. History The group was formed as singer/guitarist Billy Yost's \\"first attempt to get a 'college band thing' going\\" at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota. The band name was chosen after Yost's readings on the Enron scandal while attending the university. http://inyourspeakers.com/content/news/282-kickback-powerful- music-jamming-band-02192014 =Early years= The story begins in 2009 when Billy and Danny Yost and Zach Verdoorn decided to leave their South Dakota home and move to Chicago. http://www.abeerwiththeband.com/the-kickback/\\"I was terrified about making the move ... I loved where I grew up. I spent a lot of time there writing songs for this record, and figuring out what I had to offer. But I needed a bigger pool of musicians who I had things in common with musically\\", he has stated. Upon arriving in Chicago, Yost assembled the band through Craigslist ads, weathering a series of changes until the band arrived at the current lineup. Despite Yost's status as the founding member and primary songwriter, The Kickback is a truly collaborative effort built around each member’s artistic vision. =A clutch of EPs= After releasing \\"Great Self Love\\" in 2010 and \\"Mea Culpa Mea Culpa\\" in 2011, they received attention from Rolling Stone's Hype Monitor blog as well as Chicago music critic and Sound Opinions contributor Jim DeRogatis. After a few years of writing and recording demos, the band was ready to record their debut LP. A milestone moment came when the band, with humor and bravado, sent their demos to Jim Eno from Spoon (one of Billy’s primary modern artistic inspirations). Jim responded favorably and got in touch with the band. =Sorry All Over the Place= The Kickback's debut LP was released September 18, 2015, on Jullian Records. It was recorded and produced by Jim Eno at his studio Public Hi-Fi in Austin, Texas. Consequence of Sound announced the album and premiered the track \\"White Lodge\\" on June 15, 2015. Grantland called the track \\"a witty, nervy, and melodic dagger that exudes dread without completely giving up on the possibility of transcendence.\\" The Nerdist premiered the full album and said \\"[The Kickback's] extremely competent, catchy debut effort Sorry All Over the Place belies how nimbly the group is able to transition from ballad to Smashing Pumpkins-esque rock outbursts, to extended instrumental jams.\\" =Weddings & Funerals= The Kickback's sophomore album, produced by Dennis Herring, was released on July 14, 2017.

The episodes originate from on-the-road locations as well as at the band's rehearsal space in Chicago.

Donaldson was the founding publisher of the weekly newspaper, the Edinburgh Advertiser. He was also known for selling cheap copies of books after their copyright had expired in disregard to London booksellers' opinions on literary property. Early years Donaldson was the son of Dr James Donaldson (died 1754), a textile manufacturer and Treasurer of Edinburgh. His mother was Elizabeth Weir (died 1768). He had an older brother, John. His paternal grandfather was Capt. James Donaldson, publisher of the Gazette.Couper, p 108 Donaldson inherited approximately £10,000 from his father. In 1748, he opened a bookselling shop in Edinburgh. Two years later, on 29 August 1750, he was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Edinburgh by right of his father in lieu of an apprenticeship. He married a merchant's daughter, Anna Marshall, on 10 January 1751 and may have received a substantial dowry. Career Having the financial wherewithal, Donaldson become a junior partner of Alexander Kincaid from 1751–58.Sher, p. 313 In its first year, Kincaid & Donaldson published Dr. Francis Home's Essay on the Contents and Virtues of Dunse-Spaw and Henry Home's Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion. In 1752, Kincaid & Donaldson was the sole publisher David Hume's Political Discourses. After Donaldson left Kincaid, his involvement with the Scottish Enlightenment's new books was essentially over, with the exception of his involvement with James Boswell.Sher, p. 314 Kincaid went on to become Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Donaldson joined the printing firm of Sands Donaldson Murray & Cochran in 1755–1759. He worked with John Reid at Castlehill from 1760 until 1765. In 1764, they began printing and publishing the Edinburgh Advertiser, though Reid remained with the newspaper for less than a year. Donaldson maintained at least two book shops while publishing the twice-weekly Advertiser, one being at the Strand, London, and the other in Edinburgh.Couper, p. 106 From 1765 until 1772, he had a shop at Castlehill. Donaldson and his older brother John also owned a bookstore in London, selling books that were printed in Scotland until July 1773 at which time John remained at the Arundel Street shop, and Alexander moved to St Paul's Churchyard. In 1774, after ten years printing and publishing the Edinburgh Advertiser, Donaldson turned it over to his 22-year-old son, James.Couper, p. 109 =Battle of the booksellers= Donaldson was a notable \\"purveyor of cheap reprints\\" that were no longer protected by the Statute of Anne in a time known as the \\"Battle of the booksellers\\". His attitude towards copyright was not embraced by London merchants who stood to lose large sums of money over books printed in Edinburgh and sold in London. The English poet Samuel Johnson disliked Donaldson, and criticised him, saying, \\"[Donaldson] is a fellow who takes advantage of the law to injure his brethren...\\" While he made a fortune in his reprint business, he and others also bore the expense of legal actions in this regard. These included Osborne v Donaldson (1765), against publisher Thomas Osborne, and Millar v Donaldson (1765); in 1769, Donaldson sued Reid over printing-house practices. In 1773, London bookseller James Hinton and Edinburgh writer Alexander M'Conochie sued Donaldson and John Wood in Edinburgh, and John Meurose in Kilmarnock over copyright infringement of several titles. Donaldson and his brother John were appellants in Donaldson v Beckett (1774), against the printers and booksellers Thomas Becket (or Beckett) (previously apprenticed to British publisher Andrew Millar), Peter Abraham de Hondt, John Rivington, William Johnson, William Strahan, Thomas Longman, William Richardson, John Richardson, Thomas Lowndes, Thomas Caslon, George Kearsley, Henry Baldwin, William Owen, Thomas Davies, and Thomas Cadell. The case resulted in a ruling by the British House of Lords on the issue of perpetual common law copyright and copyright as a statute that could have a limited duration. James Boswell was Donaldson's advocate in at least three of these lawsuits, Donaldson v Beckett, Donaldson v Reid and Hinton v Donaldson. Boswell, best known as Samuel Johnson's biographer, referred to Donaldson as \\"the prodigious Vendor of Literature\\", and the \\"Great Donaldson\\". Donaldson published several of Boswell's works. Personal life It is unlikely that Donaldson is the same Alexander Donaldson mentioned as a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh as that gentleman is described as a Professor of Oriental Languages at Edinburgh University. He retired in 1789 and bought Broughton Hall, located a mile to the northeast of central Edinburgh, which had been the residence of Archibald Stewart, Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1745). He died at Broughton Hall in 1794, leaving an estate valued at £100,000. He is buried in Greyfriars Churchyard. His surviving son, James (1751–1830), inherited the Edinburgh business. He, too, died at Broughton Hall, in 1830. James was the benefactor of Donaldson's Hospital after his death. Partial works James Thomson's The Seasons, published by Alexander Donaldson * – (1758).

Formed by Fergal Purcell and John Kavanagh in 1993 the band combines traditional Celtic music with black metal to form Celtic black metal. They have released one demo album, one EP, and three albums. They came onto the scene in 1994 with the much acclaimed 'Starside' demo. The demo was widely traded in the underground and attributed to the band's later record deal. The demo itself comprises two distinct sounds; from the epic black metal sounding 'Empyrean' and 'Warrior' penned by Purcell to the more Celtic sounding 'Starside' and 'Rite of passage' written mainly by Kavanagh. Indeed, it was this black metal sound lost when Purcell quit the band in 1996 that resulted in the band's major and sometimes- lamented change in sound style post Starside. Etymology The band derived its name from geis (pl. Geasa), which in Irish mythology and folklore, is an idiosyncratic taboo, whether of obligation or prohibition, similar to being under a vow or spell. A geis can be compared with a curse or, paradoxically, a gift. If someone under a geis violates the associated taboo, the infractor will suffer dishonor or even death. On the other hand, the observing of one's geasa is believed to bring power. Often it is women who place geasa upon men. In some cases the woman turns out to be a goddess or other sovereignty figure.MacKillop, James (1998) A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology.

The newspaper, under the ownership of Elmer C. Johnson, would go on to be merged with three other local newspapers (The Lyons Times, Summit Valley Times, & Clear Ridge Times) and be known under the masthead of The Times.  History  The Brookfield Enterprise was started in 1932 by former linotype operator and publisher of The Melrose Parker newspaper Porter Reubendall as a weekly paper full of advertisements of Brookfield businesses. The paper was to be distributed for free to every home in Brookfield, as well as, the Hollywood & Congress Park sections of Brookfield. The first issue of the Brookfield Enterprise was printed, on a printing press that could only print 12 x 15 in. paper, on Dec., 9, 1932 in the small basement of Reubendall's home at 9125 Sheridan Ave. in Brookfield, IL.. Distribution of the paper was handled by a group of men sent over from the local work relief office and the paper itself was initially assembled as a family effort with \\"Mama, the children and the in-laws\\" helping out according to Reubendall. While the first issue of the newspaper was about business and advertising-orientated, Reubendall soon decided that he would include small news stories and information concerning Brookfield's governmental affairs. By 1936, the Brookfield Enterprise was printing 3,000 copies a week out of its new offices at 3724 Prairie Ave. in Brookfield. The paper had been so well received that it was necessary for Reubendall to invest in a larger Babcock Printing Press to handle the work. With the onset of World War II, the military draft had begun to cut into his male workforce and according to Reubendall, \\"it became necessary for me to work every evening, and it became quite a burden.\\" So, in January 1945 Reubendall sold the paper to Robert Hladik and Lawrence Morrell Gross. Soon after the sale the paper began to falter. In September 1945, Elmer C. Johnson, then a printer's apprentice and freelance photographer for the Chicago Daily News, Chicago Tribune and in the arly 1930s a writer of the weekly columns \\"On the Funny Side\\" & Radio Ramblings\\" in the South Side News was hired as managing editor of the Brookfield Enterprise. In January 1947, Mr. Gross sold his interest in the paper to Mr. Hladik and Mr. Johnson then bought a half-interest in the paper. By 1949, Elmer C. Johnson and his wife Genevieve bought out Mr. Hladik's half of the paper and became sole owners of the Brookfield Enterprise. In the 1950s the Brookfield Enterprise, now owned by photographer Elmer C. Johnson, became billed as \\"Brookfield's Picture Newspaper\\" and as \\"A Picture News-Weekly. It was also at this time that the newspaper began to focus on hard news as well as community and governmental news. In 1951, Mr. Johnson acquired the Lyons Times, Summit Valley Times and the Clear Ridge Times publishing them all under the name Enterprise Publications. Elmer C. Johnson (who carried his Rolleiflex camera everywhere he went) worked as publisher, editor, writer and photographer for the paper. Writing stories on a second-hand typewriter that he bought in Oak Park, Illinois which was, according to the shop's owner, previously owned by writer Ernest Hemingway. Whether the proprietor's claim was true or not, it did make for a good story. In 1958, Johnson moved the Enterprise to a new office at 9034 Brookfield Ave. in Brookfield, Illinois and then again in 1960 he moved to a much larger office at 8694 W. 47th St. in Lyons, Illinois. In 1967, Elmer C. Johnson's photo of the deadly tornado (an F4) that hit Oak Lawn, Illinois and left a trail of destruction eastward to Lake Michigan, appeared with a title \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" on the front page of the Chicago American and in special sections of the Chicago Tribune & Chicago Sun-Times. The National Weather Service says that it is \\"the only known tornado photo of this event\\". Johnson took the photo of the tornado while at the Southfield shopping center to pick up an ad from a store for his Enterprise Publication. According to a story in the Chicago American, Johnson, who always had his camera in his car, saw the tornado forming and ran to his car from where he took the photograph. Of the photo, Johnson said \\"I opened the lens way up and shot. It was moving so fast I kept losing the funnel behind the buildings.\\" Between 1975 and 1979, the four newspaper editions published by Enterprise Publications and now under the masthead of The Times, were reduced to two editions covering Lyons Township and Garfield Ridge with a circulation of 50,000. Beginning in the 1970s, The Times was billed as having \\"More photos and local news\\" and included a contest that included a reader winning money if their car was spotted with a Times bumper sticker on the bumper. The bumper sticker read \\"In our town it's The Times- an Enterprise Publication.\\" In 1979, Elmer's son and managing editor of The Times Denny C. Johnson, moved the paper from free distribution to a paid subscription and newsstand sales operation. By 1983 the paper had roughly 5,000 subscribers and 500 weekly newsstand sales. The papers operations were now being run out of an office at the former Old Willow shopping complex in Willow Springs, Illinois. However, on Oct. 8, 1985, subscribers and advertisers received a letter that stated > \\"No Times this week! Sorry but after more than 52 years of service to the > community, Enterprise Publications Co. is temporarily suspending publication > of The Times' Lyons Township edition, so we can reorganize our operations.\\" The letter went on to say, > \\"Due to the increased costs of printing, mailing, labor and other expenses, > we are forced to take this action. Paid subscriptions will be honored and > dated up when we resume publication. Please bear with us during this period. > Sincerely, The Times, Enterprise Publication Co.\\" And the paper ceased publication.

Slightly further south, the Oakley Creek waterfall The rock-lined upper channel of the stream Oakley Creek (Māori name Te Auaunga) is a creek in Auckland, New Zealand. While heavily human-modified (being surrounded for most of its length by suburban development, especially in the upper reaches), it has a number of important ecological features, such as having the former Auckland City's only natural waterfall (which is also the largest in urban Auckland). The least modified regions, with mostly natural channels and significant riparian vegetation, exists between approximately Blockhouse Bay Road and the inlet at the northern edge of Waterview. A walkway runs along a good part of the creek in the section northwest of Mt Albert. This area of the creek is also significant for a relatively large number of archeologically significant sites, due to the use of the creek by Maori reaching inland from the inlet (landing sites and settlement remnants), and due to the later lack of strong European settlement along this part of the area. The creek has also inspired a local community group, \\"Friends of Oakley Creek\\" which is working to restore it to a more natural state, and improve the water quality. One of the group's major concerns is the impact of the SH20 Waterview Connection on the stream, i.e. the form this motorway is to take under or near the creek. Other concerns include the high levels of metals in the stream, such as zinc, copper and lead, from its urbanised catchment, and the fact that the culvert under Great North Road impedes fish migration. As one of the results of community interest in the revitalisation of the stream, a set of Oakley Creek Rehabilitation Guidelines was developed for the works which occurred near the stream at around the time the Waterview motorway tunnel building project took place. These primarily included removing the currently rock-lined, tight channelisation of the stream, and reintroducing a riparian margin. Auckland Council adapted the NZTA/Boffa Miskell-developed guidelines for some areas of the stream not affected by the motorway. . The native plantings are now becoming well established, although the drought during the summer of 2019/2020 killed a number of ecologically important specimens. Nonetheless the planting includes a good range of native species and an increasing number of native birds are being attracted to the area as a result. The pathway adjacent to the stream has become increasingly popular as a walking and relaxation area for local residents. The project demonstrates the social and ecological value of well conceived environmental restoration initiatives and the importance of involving community groups in the planning, planting and maintenance of such projects.

It is the least widespread of the Serbo-Croatian subdialects in Croatia. It is an Ijekavian accent of Shtokavian dialect, with a sporadic presence of Ikavisms. Unlike Eastern Herzegovinian, the Dubrovnikan subdialect shares some common features of Ikavisms from Eastern Bosnian subdialect. Neoshtokavisation gave similar results in Dubrovnik as in East Herzegovina, but starting points were different for both. This subdialect was once considered independent; however, today it is considered a part of Ijekavian Neoshtokavian (East Herzegovina subdialect). Some features are still different, like certain vowels. The majority of loanwords come from the Ragusan dialect of the Dalmatian language and from Italian (Florentine and Venetian dialects).

His compositional output primarily consists of anthems for choir and works for solo organ. In the 1980s he completed and published four volumes of hymns. Many of his compositions have been published by Concordia Publishing House and MorningStar Music Publishers. Early life, career, and education in England Born in London, Wolff became a choir soloist at the Savoy Chapel when he was 6 years old. By age 13 he was playing the organ for church services at St Matthew's Oakley Square in London where he held the position of assistant organist. He entered the Royal College of Music (RCM) in 1933 where he was a Kent Scholar. He earned a Bachelor of Music from the RCM in 1937. His teachers at the school included Sir Walter Alcock (organ), Dr. Ernest Bullock (organ), and Charles Herbert Kitson (music composition). While studying at the RCM he won the Royal College of Organists's Limpus Prize. After graduating from the RCM, the London County Council appointed Wolff as a senior instructor in music where one of his junior students was Madeleine Dring.Dring diaries 1937-38 He also served as the director and conductor of both London's chapter of the Gilbert and Sullivan society and the Clapham Operatic and Orchestral Society.

Career in North America Towards the end of World War II, Wolff was the conductor of the Canadian Military Headquarters Choir for their performances in Europe. This connection led to his appointment to the organ and music theory faculty at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto in 1946. He left there in 1948 to join the faculty at the University of Toronto (UT) where he taught alongside Ernest MacMillan and Healey Willan through 1956. Among his notable pupils were F. R. C. Clarke and James Gayfer. From 1946-1952 Wolff served as the organist and choirmaster at the Metropolitan United Church (MUC) in Toronto. He composed several anthems for the MUC's choir, 12 of which were published together under the title Metropolitan Series of Choral Music in 1946. He also published two solo organ works around this time: Prelude on Greensleeves (1946) and Festival Fanfare (1950). In 1951 he co-founded the Orpheus Choir of Toronto with John Cozens. From 1952-1956 he was organist and conductor of The Cathedral Singers at the Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal.

It is set in the same universe as Marr's previous YA novels, but is not a sequel to Fragile Eternity; rather, it is a companion novel like Ink Exchange was, focusing on a different set of characters.  Plot  The prologue of Radiant Shadows shows Devlin, the high court's Assassin, agreeing to shelter a spectral girl name Rae in faerie without his queen's knowledge. It then skips forward about a century, to show the high queen, Sorcha, ordering Devlin to kill a baby halfling, the child of the Gabriel, along with a warning that it should \\"never enter faerie\\". The novel then cuts to the present day, to Ani, the halfling whose life Devlin spared, as she tries to fit in with the other hounds, but cannot, due to her father's protectiveness and her mortal blood. Devlin, meanwhile, has been told by Sorcha to stay in the mortal world to keep an eye on her son, Seth. Devlin and Ani meet at the crows nest, where she drains his energy and he leaves with a taste of her blood. Ani is different from other hounds, due to her ability to feed on both emotions and touch, and mortal and faery. Irial, the former dark king, has been performing tests to identify what about her is different and introduce it to his court to strengthen them. This also, however, draws the attention of Devlin and Sorcha's other sister, Bananach, the essence of war. She tells Ani that she has to kill Seth and Niall, or give Bananach her blood. Ani can do neither, and is soon found by an unclaimed steed. Ani, Devlin and the steed -which Ani names Barry, short for Barracuda- leave the state to get away from Bananach. In Faerie, meanwhile, Rae, who is a dreamwalker, enters Sorcha's dream and gives her a way to watch Seth in the mortal world. Unfortunately, she becomes obsessed with this, and without her rulership faerie starts to dissolve. Bananach pays a visit, and starts killing members of the high court. Scared, Rae contacts Devlin through a dream and informs him of this turn of events. Devlin and Ani return to huntsdale only to find that Bananach has killed Ani's sister Tish. Ani demands that they should then kill Bananach, \\"breath for breath\\", but Devlin informs her that neither of the twins can be killed without killing all of faerie. Bananach later goes to stab Ani, but Irial throws himself in front of her, taking the wound that would be hers. The knife dissolves inside him, poisoning him, and Bananach says that he will not last the fortnight. Irial tells his successor ,Niall, that he \\"wishes he hadn't been king when they met\\", referring to Niall's backstory as revealed in Ink Exchange, then Ani, Devlin, Rabbit and Seth leave for faerie. Devlin was injured in the fight, and Ani allows him to drink her blood, healing him and binding them together. With Seth returned to faerie, Sorcha awakens, and together Devlin, Ani and Rae form the shadow court to balance the high court. (This, however, leaves the dark court out of balance, this will presumably be remedied in the final book, Darkest Mercy.) They also seal the veil between the mortal and faerie worlds so that one cannot return to the mortal world without both the High and Shadow court's help.

In the majors, he played for the New York Giants and was primarily a second baseman, while in the Cuban League and the U.S. minor leagues he mostly played first base.Figueredo 2003, p. 489. A defensive specialist, according to Roberto González Echevarría, Rodríguez \\"was considered the best defensive first baseman in Cuba\\" of his time.González Echevarría 1999, p. 176. He was also a long-time manager in the Cuban League and managed for one season in the minors. He was inducted into the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951.Figueredo 2003, pp. 147, 253, 509. Rodríguez was born in Havana in 1894. His younger brother Oscar also became a baseball player and manager in the Cuban League and the minor leagues and joined José as a member of the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1960.Figueredo 2003, pp. 489, 509. González Echevarría 1999, p. 56. Baseball career =United States= José Rodríguez toured the United States with a Cuban team, the Habana Reds, in 1915 and was recruited by the New York Giants. He joined the Giants in spring training in 1916. News reports from spring training suggested that Rodriguez \\"may develop into a high class player like Palmero, the young Cuban pitcher,\\" and that manager John McGraw expected him \\"to develop into a star first baseman.\\" After spring training he was assigned to the New London Planters in the Eastern League, where he hit .263. Rodríguez debuted with the Giants on October 5, 1916, when he appeared as a pinch runner. In 1917 he was assigned to the Rochester Hustlers in the International League, where he hit .252. When he was again called up by the Giants, he played in seven major league games and hit .200 in 20 at bats. After spring training in 1918, Rodríguez was retained by the Giants as their utility infielder. He hit poorly, and after Larry Doyle, the regular second baseman, had surgery in May, the Giants acquired other infielders such as Bert Niehoff and Ed Sicking. Rodríguez ended the season with a .160 batting average in 40 games. After the season, he was traded to Rochester, ending his major league career. Rodríguez played the next two seasons as Rochester's first baseman, hitting .264 and .320. When the Rochester team was sold after the 1920 season, the new owners, George Stallings and Walter Hapgood, sold most their players; Rodríguez was sold to the Bridgeport Americans of the Eastern League. He played in the Eastern League from 1921 to 1930, playing for Bridgeport, the Worcester Panthers, the Providence Rubes, and the Pittsfield Hillies. He hit as high as .316, and his overall minor league average was .284. He played for the Canton Terriers of the Central League and the Binghamton Triplets of the New York–Pennsylvania League in 1930 and 1931, before returning to the Eastern League where he ended his U.S. career with the Allentown Buffaloes and Norfolk Tars in 1931 and 1932. Rodríguez returned to minor league baseball for one season in 1948 as the manager of the Sherman-Denison Twins in the Big State League. =Cuba= 1932 All Star team Rodríguez began his professional career in the winter of 1914/15 as the first baseman of the Fe club of the Cuban League. The following winter he moved to Almendares. The team, which included Cristóbal Torriente, Adolfo Luque, José Méndez, Ramón Herrera, and Rafael Almeida, won the championship, with Rodríguez hitting .286. He again played for a championship team, the Orientals, in the winter of 1917, but hit only .194. The league didn't play in the winter of 1917/18, but in 1918/19 he again played for Almendares and hit .312.Figueredo 2003, pp. 115, 120, 124, 129. In 1919/20 he moved to Habana, where he played shortstop and hit .278. In 1920/21, still with Habana, he played third base and was part of another championship, hitting .226. The next winter, the Cuban League season terminated after only five games; Rodríguez had returned to first base and hit .368.Figueredo 2003, pp. 133, 138, 142. The following winter, 1922/23, his role shifted as he became the playing manager of Almendares.Figueredo 2003, p. 147. In his third season as manager, 1924/25, he won the league championship with a team powered by Negro league stars, including five future members of the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame—Bullet Rogan, Andy Cooper, John Henry (\\"Pop\\") Lloyd, Biz Mackey, and Oscar Charleston—as well as Dick Lundy, Newt Allen, and Valentín Dreke, and major leaguers Adolfo Luque and José Acosta.Figueredo 2003, pp. 157–159. He won his next championship as manager for Almendares in 1931/32, his last season as a full-time player and a season in which no American players were signed to play in the Cuban league. He continued to play part-time until 1938/39 and to manage for various teams until 1943/44. In 1950 he became the general manager of the minor league Havana Cubans.Figueredo 2003, pp. 196–197, 227, 253, 334. Rodríguez died in 1953 at the age of 58.

R. Rahman, who accompnied for the music and background score for the 2010 Hindi film of the same name, directed by Mani Ratnam. It was released on 7 May 2010, by the label T-Series. The soundtrack features six songs, with four additional tracks included in the film were released later; the lyrics being penned by Gulzar. The same soundtrack was used for the Tamil version of the film, titled Raavanan as well as the Telugu dubbed version, titled Villain. Development The soundtrack is especially noted for the use of rich instruments, Indian as well as Middle Eastern. Several new singers are introduced through this film. Rahman as usual, brought some experimental tracks like \\"Beera Beera\\" and \\"Thok De Killi\\". There is a folk song \\"Kata Kata\\", a kind of Sufi song \\"Ranjha Ranjha\\" as well as melodies like \\"Behene De\\" and \\"Khilli Re\\" in the soundtrack. The choreography of the songs by Ganesh Acharya, Brinda, Shobhana and Astad Deboo is also considered the highlight of the songs. The album kicks off with \\"Beera Beera\\", that was premiered on the official teaser of the film. It was sung by Vijay Prakash and it begins with an African chant that was sung by Mustafa Kutoane. It describes the lead character played by Abhishek Bachchan. This track was picturised on the introduction scene of Bachchan. The African chant explains the wild character of him. The song continues throughout the opening credits. \\"Behene De\\", sung by Karthik and Mohammed Irfan was regarded as the highlight of the album by many reviewers. The song, which takes many fascinating turns mid way, was the first completely picturised song in the film. Its shot on the beauties of Athirapally waterfalls in Kerala and features Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. The song is widely regarded as the biggest song in Karthik's musical career. He recorded the song in 2009 October from Rahman's Chennai studio and has performed it live in many programmes. The next track \\"Thok De Killi\\" is sung by one of Rahman's most trusted singers Sukhwinder Singh and is a fast and peppy number. Guitar is the major instrument used and it ends in a frenzy and uses Arabic esque phrases here and there. The song is picturised as a war dance by Abhishek Bachchan and his gang (consisting of Ravi Kishan, Ajay Gehi etc.). Aishwarya Rai is also featured in the music video, as watching Beera dance from a distance. \\"Ranjha Ranjha\\" is a kind of Sufi song, with a little folk instrumentation and is sung by Javed Ali and Rekha Bhardwaj, who is noted for the rendering of another folk song \\"Genda Phool\\" from Delhi-6 by Rahman. The lyrics of the opening lines of the song is adapted from Sufi Saint and Poet Baba Bulleh Shah's \\"Ranjha Ranjha Kardi\\". Though this song doesn't feature in the movie, another version of the song that is sung by Ila Arun and Richa Sharma was featured in the film. The song is used in the background of the movie only. \\"Khili Re\\" is a romantic song and is sung by Reena Bhardwaj, who was replaced by Shreya Ghoshal in the Tamil version. Its instrumentation is based on flute and sitar. Picturised on Aishwarya Rai and Vikram from Kolkata, the alap portion of this song features a classical dance performance by Aishwarya Rai. The song was choreographed by well known actress and dancer Shobhana. \\"Kata Kata\\" is a situational song that is rich in percussions and was shot as a wedding song. The song was based on traditional Indian music and Middle Eastern music, and had oud and shehnai are used in the interludes. This song was shot with 1000 dancers in Orchha, Madhya Pradesh. \\"A huge set was created in Orchha to shoot this song which took four days to wrap up and has been choreographed by Ganesh Acharya,\\" says a Unit hand. This song may seem a little similar in picturisation and mood to \\"Rukmani Rukmani\\" (from Roja), both being wedding songs involving a group of singers, but if \\"Rukmani Rukmani\\" was a mischievous set-up for the nuptial night, this one's sung like a warning, but with equal amount of revelry and fanfare. \\"Kata Kata\\" is reportedly the most lavish song that Mani Ratnam has ever shot in his career. The only full song out of the four additional tracks \\"Jaare Ud Jaare\\" was performed by Rahman. According to Rahman, \\"The song was a very last minute addition. I saw the movie and felt like adding a song to a particular situation in the film. The lyrics of the song were ready for a while however I had to yet compose the tune. Meanwhile we had already planned our music release for the 7th of May so we didn't want to delay or postpone that because of one song. The song may be later added to the album; however it would feature in the film.\\" It was composed and recorded by Rahman in his Mumbai studio within a few hours. The song starts in the movie during the acclaimed climax scene of the movie and continues throughout the end-credits. Release As Raavan became a major anticipated project, following the success of Rahman's previous album, several false rumours about the soundtrack of the film were disseminated to websites and magazines. Many songs claimed to be songs from Raavan, like \\"Pairon Pe Jannat Hain\\", \\"Kaadhale\\" etc. and another set of fake track lists were spread through internet. The audio release was scheduled in March 2010, but since the release date of the film was changed, the audio release was changed to April last week.CT presents the list of movies that will rock screens in the coming weeks The track list was officially published on 3 May 2010 and the music was launched officially on 7 May 2010 by Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. However, CDs were available in some stores on 6 May 2010 itself. The soundtrack features 6 songs composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Gulzar. During the audio release, an additional track was performed by Rahman, titled \\"Jaare Ud Jaare\\", which was not included in the CD. The song was cited to be an \\"instant composition\\" by Rahman, \\"The night before the launch, Rahman closeted himself in his Mumbai studio and worked through the night to compose the song\\", the source adds. This song is believed to be included in the later stages. The soundtrack also features three more additional songs that were featured in the movie. However the official track list has only 6 songs.  Reception  The soundtrack for the movie has received positive reviews, with most reviewers hailing the album to be one of Rahman's best recent works. The Hindu said, \\"Raavan is further proof that A.R. Rahman always saves some of his best stuff for old friend Mani Ratnam. There's no escaping Raavan. Or Rahman. They will get you.\\" According to The Times of India, Raavan is an interesting audio track, although Rahman's earlier associations with Mani Ratnam remain unforgettable. A review on Bollywood Hungama said, \\"There are number of gems in the album, most notably being \\"Ranjha Ranjha\\", \\"Beera Beera\\" and \\"Thok De Killi\\". Go for it, this one is not to be missed as it has Rahman coming up with one of his best soundtracks in recent times.\\"Music Review of Delhi 6 By Joginder Tuteja. Bollywood Hungama. Retrieved on 2010-06-18 A review by the Hindustan Times said, The trio (Rahman, Gulzar and Mani) has brought out a lethal combination presenting a soundtrack that is fresh, high on energy and in tune with the soul of the movie. According to Rediff's Sukanya Verma, \\"A. R. Rahman stays true to the element of Ratnam's vision as there's never any attempt to show off or introduce unnecessary elements. The outcome is exquisite. Or should I say expected.\\" A review by NDTV said, \\"The album is a musical treat and impresses thoroughly. When Rahman teams up with Gulzar and Mani Ratnam, the result is pure magic.\\"  Track listing  = Hindi version = Additional tracks = Tamil version = Collector's edition = Telugu version =  Album credits  Credits adapted from A.

Biography He was born in Castlerea, County Roscommon in 1750, entered Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in 1766, and was elected Fellow and took orders in 1775. He became Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at TCD in 1786.Erasmus Smith's professors of Mathematics Mathematics at TCD 1592–1992 In 1798 the bishopric of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh was most unexpectedly conferred upon him by Lord Cornwallis. He was also a musician, an enthusiastic botanist, and somewhat of an artist. The Gentleman's Magazine says: \\"The versatility of his talents, the acuteness of his intellect, and his intense application to study were happily blended with a native unassuming modesty, a simplicity of manners, unaffected, and infinitely engaging; a cheerfulness and vivacity; … a firm and inflexible spirit of honour and integrity.\\" One of the pleasures he hoped to derive from a country residence, on his appointment to the bishopric, was the opportunity of pursuing his botanical studies; but shortly after his elevation, symptoms of cancer developed themselves. During his terminal illness he continued his studies with great activity, revising his works for the press, and even studying Syriac for the purpose of editing a new version of the Psalms. He died at Whitworth, in Lancashire, 28 November 1800, aged 50.

Hopkins for the construction of a new dormitory to house students for the Washington & Jefferson Academy. The new \\"fire-proof\\" building, named Hays Hall after President George P. Hays, contained three floors of dormitories. It was designed by famed Pittsburgh architect Frederick J. Osterling. It opened for use on January 8, 1902 and was completed on June 23, 1903, with a total construction cost of $95,977.59. All told, Hays Hall could house 60 students, plus 6 faculty members and the Academy Principal's family. The first floor contained a large stairway, reception hall, a dining hall and kitchen facility capable of feeding 150, and an office area. The amenities included steam heat and electric lighting. The floors were arranged in a 2-room suite style, with each student having his own room plus a communal study area. Each floor had two communal bathrooms, with three shower baths on the 5th floor. =Use by the College= Hayes Hall in 1912. When the Academy was closed in 1912, Hays Hall was used as College's first dormitory, housing 80 college students. President James D. Moffat planned to use Hays Hall as the beginning of a school-wide dormitory system, as this was becoming standard in colleges at the time. Upperclassmen were given the first opportunity to acquire rooms. Room and board was \\"furnished to students as near to cost as possible,\\" which amounted to $5 to $8 a month in 1912. \\"Table board\\" cost $4 a week. The affairs of the dormitory were regulated by an elected student \\"senate.\\" The rooms were furnished and linens were supplied by the college for free. Miss Sadie Hewitt was employed as the \\"House Mother\\" and took care of the students. In 1915, residence in Hays Hall was restricted to freshmen and the faculty compelled out-of-town students to take rooms there, a college first. Renovations were made in the 1924, including a redecoration of the rooms with new carpets and furniture. The Beau Street wing on the first floor contained a soda fountain. In 1925, the dorm lobby piano was removed by the Christian Life Service League, who had wanted to use it for their services. Hays Hall residents erupted in protest, arguing that the League had no need for the piano, since there was one in the Old Main Chapel. Even Miss Hewitt weighed in on the controversy, saying that the \\"lack of a piano encourages gambling and other violations of the rules since the piano is, especially to non frat men, frequently an only source of pleasure.\\" In 1926, the League voted to return the piano back to Hays. During the increased enrollment following World War II, the dining room was moved to Old Main and the college bookstore moved to that space from the Administration Building. In 1948, tile floors were installed in showers and the interior was repainted. The exterior woodwork was also painted. Following the enrollment spike, the dining hall returned to Hays Hall and the bookstore moved back to the Administration Building. =Partial closing and demolition= The Hays Hall dining room By 1968, Hays Hall had deteriorated to the point where it no longer able to house students. The plaster walls had become difficult to maintain and the plumbing and heating units had fallen into disrepair. The 4th and 5th floor had fallen the furthest into disrepair. On February 1, 1968, the living quarters of the building were closed. Student opinion was mixed on the decision. Some students has been unhappy with the inconvenient shower facilities and the echo-filled hallways, while other students expressed fondness for the building. To replace the lost living space, the college entered into an agreement with the nearby George Washington Hotel, whereby the college rented the entire 5th and 6th floors as a dormitory for three years. The Hays Hall furniture moved there as well. These floors contained 25 rooms each, which was enough for the 86 former residents of Hays Hall, the House Mother, and four floor proctors. The dining hall moved to newly completed The Commons in March 1968. The infirmary remained, with the old dining hall converted into the Bookstore. During its time as a dormitory, it was home to 4,000 freshmen. A suite of rooms in Hays Hall At the time, the possibility of renovating the Hays Hall remained open. Some plans called for the opening of the first three floors at a later date, converting the building to house office space, or expanding the Bookstore to encompass more of the first floor. Another campus modification plan called for the closing of Lincoln Street and widening College Street, which would require the full demolition of Hays Hall. In 1982, after years of neglect by the college and modernization of the fire code, the building was considered to be a fire hazard. The central staircase was deemed especially hazardous, as it would operate as a flue in the event of a fire, which would quickly turn the building into a \\"furnace.\\" It was closed in 1982, with amorphous plans to refurbish it at a later date. During the 1980s and early 1990s, plans to renovate the building periodically resurfaced. Other discussions considered having the building designated as a historic landmark. These plans never materialized due to the costs involved. Hays Hall was demolished in the summer and fall of 1994. The orate ironwork in the lobby was preserved and later used in The Burnett Center. Following demolition, the plot remained a green space for several years.

He arrived in Guantanamo on June 16, 2002. He was repatriated on July 16, 2003. McClatchy News Service interview On June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published a series of articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives. mirror Tariq Khan was one of the former captives who had an article profiling him. At the time of his interview, Tariq Khan was working as a real estate agent in Pakistan. His McClatchy interviewer described his account of his travel to Afghanistan as far-fetched. He said that in November 2001 he had traveled to Quetta, a city in Pakistan near the Afghan's southern border, to buy a quantity of cigarettes to sell. His visit coincided with Ramadam. And, at the mosque he went to pray at in Quetta he agreed to accompany some religious pilgrims—not realizing that they planned to cross the Afghan border. Tariq Khan told his interviewer: Tariq Khan described his group of pilgrims being captured near Mazari Sharif, nine days later. Mazari Sharif is across the mountains in the north of Afghanistan. Tariq Khan described being crammed into crowded shipping containers by troops under the command of General Dostum, where many of his fellow captives died. He said Dostum's troops fired into the containers, while they were crammed with men. He described spending several months crammed into a small cell in Dostum's prison at Sherberghan. He said the cell was so crowded the men had to take turns sitting down, because there wasn't enough room for them all to sit down at the same time. He then spent another six months in US custody in the Kandahar detention facility. Tariq Khan's interviewer described him losing confidence as he spoke, and declining to answer questions about seeing Koran desecration, or to answer questions about conditions at Guantanamo. He said that he had to check in with Pakistani security officials every day, and he was afraid he would be punished for talking to a western reporter.

The Convento de San Esteban is a Dominican monastery situated in the Plaza del Concilio de Trento (Council of Trent) in the city of Salamanca. History The Dominicans settled in Salamanca in about 1255, but their original monastery was demolished to construct the parish church of St. Stephen in 1524, at the initiative of Cardinal Juan Álvarez de Toledo. Construction took until 1610, and involved Martin de Santiago, Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón, Juan Ribero Rada and Pedro Gutiérrez. However, the layout and design are by Juan de Álava, who began the work in 1524, as evidenced by a plan in his possession. Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón was involved with the transepts and the dome. Although the church is considered to be an excellent example of the Plateresque style, the long period of construction explains the mixture of styles ranging from Gothic to the late Baroque, the latter not so noticeable in the architecture but very apparent in the reredos of the main altar by José de Churriguera. According to tradition, Christopher Columbus stayed in this monastery (actually in the earlier building it replaced) when he came to Salamanca to defend his idea of reaching the Indies by sailing west, against the geographers of the University. During the Counter Reformation it was an important center where for the Dominicans who founded the School of Salamanca, headed by Francisco de Vitoria. Art and Architecture =Facade= Reredos-like facade of the monastery church The facade comprises the front of the church and the adjacent monastery portico. The front the church is one of the finest examples of the Plateresque style. It is conceived as an external reredos, in the form of a triumphal arch under whose barrel vault unfolds the abundant decoration characteristic of this style. The martyrdom of St. Stephen is featured in the tympanum, with a calvary above, both reliefs executed by Juan Antonio Ceroni in the early 17th century. The portico, composed of arches, is inspired by Italian renaissance loggias, its plain ornamentation contrasting with the decorative exuberance of the church facade. It was executed by Juan Ribero Rada between 1590 and 1592, but the spandrel medallions are the work of the sculptor Martin Rodríguez. =Church= Choir showing the Triumph of the Church by Antonio Palomino Construction of the church commenced under the architect Juan de Álava in 1524, followed by Brother Martin de Santiago, who was succeeded by Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón. It was consecrated in 1610. It has a Latin cross plan with a single nave, with the choir above a segmented arch at the foot of the church. The styles present are late Gothic in the lower parts of the building to the Renaissance in the dome and presbytery. It measures 14.5 metres wide by 27 metres high in the nave and 44 metres at the dome. In the choir features a paintings of the Triumph of the Church of Antonio Palomino and a Madonna and Child by Rubens . =Cloisters and Chapter- houses= Cloister of the Kings The main cloister, the processional cloister or the \\"Cloister of the Kings\\", is the work of Brother Martin de Santiago, a member of the monastery. The lower level blends elements the Gothic and the Renaissance. The arches that border the garden are semicircular, in Renaissance style but treated as Gothic, and divided by three mullions. The vaults of the four bays are ribbed with Gothic features. In the center of the garden stands a shrine. The upper level has a simple wooden ceiling, galleried by forty arches, resting on pilasters, whose capitals are decorated with grotesques and other motives. From the ground floor the chapter houses can be accessed. The \\"Ancient Chapter\\" is dark, simple and austere, from the 14th century, with work from the following centuries. One of its sections is the chapel, where at the upper level the most prominent members of the monastery are buried, including Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto. Ordinary members of the order are buried at the lower level where the monks sat on benches against the walls for their meetings. The \\"New Chapter\\" is larger, more monumental and better lit than the older one and dates from the 17th century. It is similar in design to the sacristy, which is accessed via the Soto staircase. =Sacristy= Sacristy The sacristy was built in the 17th century under the patronage of Brother Pedro de Herrera Suárez, bishop of Tuy, by architects Sardiña Alonso and Juan Moreno. The walls feature Corinthian pilasters with curved and triangular pediments, topped with pyramids, all in classical taste. The frieze is decorated with brackets and various allegories. The patron built the sacristy also as a place for his burial: in a niche, high on the left, his stone polychrome effigy, the work of Antonio de Paz, is seen in prayer. Images of the Assumption of the Virgin, St. Peter and St. Paul by the same artist are found in the headwall, presided over by a Christ figure in the foreground known as Jesus of Promise. =Soto Staircase= The Soto Staircase, designed by Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón between 1553 and 1556. This staircase was built between 1553 and 1556 and its name comes from the patron, Brother Domingo de Soto, professor at the University (part of the School of Salamanca) and confessor of Emperor Charles V. The designer was the architect Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón, who used a revolutionary new technique of cantilevering the stairs out from the walls, without other bearers, creating a space that allows the transition from the lower to the upper cloister. It is decorated with polychrome relief floral coffers, and Mary Magdalene appears in its upper section. =Main Reredos= Main reredos of the monastery church, created in 1692 by José de Churriguera The work of José de Churriguera, crowning the head of the church, has six large twisted columns, covered with decorative foliage. In the center is a tabernacle conceived as a pavilion, flanked by a pair of columns on each side, and between those of the two columns at the edges stand niches that harbour the sculptures of St. Dominic of Guzmán and St. Francis of Assis, attributed to the designer of the altarpiece. Centered above this is a painting by Claudio Coello whose theme is the martyrdom of St. Stephen. Everything is covered with gold and richly decorated, resulting in one of the most monumental Spanish baroque altarpieces. =Areas reserved for the monastic community= In the part of the building reserved for the sole use of the monastic community there are two cloisters. One is known as the \\"Columbus Cloister\\" where, according to tradition, the explorer conferred with the brethren over his project. It dates from the late 15th century, but its layout is simple, with round arches resting on robust and simple capitals, and with a Baroque window in the background. The other is called the \\"Cisterns Cloister\\" and features a decorative austerity, marked by empty spaces and smooth surfaces, which contrasts with the decorative exuberance of other parts of the building. Institutions =Faculty of Theology= The monastery houses the Pontifical Theological Faculty of St. Stephen, founded in 1947, successor to the General Study of Theology which was set up in San Esteban in 1222. Activities of the Faculty include the Conversations of San Esteban, the San Esteban School of Theology and the St. Thomas Aquinas Internet School of Theology at www.fatse.org. It also has its own publishing house, Editorial San Esteban. =Guilds= San Esteban is also the canonical seat of the Dominican Fraternity of Holy Christ of the Good Death which makes its penitential procession in Salamanca's Holy Week at dawn on Good Friday, and the Royal and Pontifical Sacrament Confraternity of Mary, Mother of God of the Rosary and St. Pius V fraternity of glory, restarted recently after years of inactivity.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, but by the 1990s, tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers seen today. Synopsis The season peaked in May with a near-record of 392 tornadoes that month. June brought over 200 tornadoes, including several that became famous for their videos. The death total for the year was relatively low at 30 (fewest since 1986). Events Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1995 in the United States. January In January, 36 tornadoes were confirmed in the US. Despite the low number, three people were killed in the Southeast US from separate tornadoes during the month. February Seven tornadoes were confirmed in the US in February. An F3 tornado on February 16 killed six people in Arab, Alabama, and injured 130, making it the tornado responsible for the most deaths in 1995. March and April In March, 49 tornadoes were confirmed in the US, followed by 130 tornadoes in April. May May's US total was 392 tornadoes confirmed. =May 6–27= A long-lived series of deadly tornado outbreaks occurred throughout almost the entire month of May; 13 deaths occurred due to the outbreaks. Nearly 300 tornadoes, including four that were rated F4, occurred during this period from the Central US through the Southeast and into the Mid-Atlantic. =May 29= An unusual F4 tornado killed three people in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. A car was thrown a 1000 ft, which was the basis for the F4 rating. June In June, 216 tornadoes were confirmed in the US. =June 2= A F4 tornado near Dimmitt, Texas, was covered closely by the Probe 1 Vortex team, making it \\"the most comprehensively observed tornado in history.\\" =June 8= Several tornadoes in the Texas Panhandle caused widespread destruction. The Pampa F4 tornado struck the industrial section of the town, featured on several weather and disaster-related documentaries and captured on video. Two other F4 tornadoes near Allison and Kellerville were also captured on video. None of those tornadoes caused any fatalities. The Kellerville tornado has been debated to be of F5 strength, but the final rating was F4. July - September The 162 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July were followed by 53 tornadoes in August and 19 tornadoes in September. October- December The US had 74 tornadoes confirmed in October. Seventy-nine tornadoes were confirmed in the US in November. An F2 tornado killed two in Arkansas that month. Then, 18 tornadoes were confirmed in the US in December.

It is the type genus of subfamily Depressariinae, which is often - particularly in older treatments - considered a distinct family Depressariidae or included in the Elachistidae, but actually seems to belong in the Oecophoridae.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), FE (2009), and see references in Savela (2003) The genus' type species is the parsnip moth. Its scientific name has been much confused for about 200 years. Adrian Hardy Haworth, on establishing the genus Depressaria in his 1811 issues of Lepidoptera Britannica, called the eventual type species Phalaena heraclei, an unjustified emendation of P. (Tortrix) heracliana. In this he followed such entomologists of his time as Anders Jahan Retzius, who in 1783 had believed the parsnip moth to be a species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. But in fact, this was a misidentification; Linnaeus' moth was actually the one known today as Agonopterix heracliana. To make matters worse, John Curtis popularized another incorrect spelling, D. heracleana, apparently first introduced (as Pyralis heracleana) by Johan Christian Fabricius in his 1775 Systema Entomologiae.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004) Species New species of Depressaria continue to be discovered and described.

The mill has been restored to working order. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 23743. History Tochmaland was built in to drain the Tochmaland polder. It was originally the sawmill Welgelegen, Veendam, Groningen. The mill was moved by millwright J B Donders of Tilburg, Noord- Brabant, who had quoted a lower price for the move than millwrights from Kollum.It was formerly fitted with four Patent sails. The mill ceased working in 1946 when the windshaft broke and repair was deemed too expensive. A brick shed containing an electrically driven Archimedes' screw was erected next to the mill. A proposal to demolish the mill was rejected by the mayor of the gemeente Kollumerland en Nieuwkruisland. 0n 30 December 1948, the mill was purchased by the gemeente. Restorations were undertaken in 1949, 1963 and 1983. since 1995, an electric motor has been installed in Tochmaland to drive its Archimedes' screw, and the installation in the brick shed demolished. Description Tochmaland is what the Dutch describe as an Grondzeiler. It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sails reaching down almost to ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft which was cast by H J Koning, Foxham, Groningen, in 1912. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 63 cogs. This drives the wallower (33 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel, which has 44 cogs drives a gearwheel with 41 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the Archimedes' screw is diameter. The screw is diameter and long. It is inclined at 19½°. Each revolution of the screw lifts of water. Public access Tochmaland is open on Saturday mornings.

Its three spans included an open-spandrel ribbed arch over Roaring Brook, flanked by two closed-spandrel arches. The southwestern closed-spandrel arch spanned the former Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad (Laurel Line), converted to highway use in 1964 as the Central Scranton Expressway. The northeastern closed-spandrel arch spans the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, now a heritage railroad operated by Steamtown National Historic Site. Built in 1921-1922, the bridge was notable as an example of Progressive Era civic involvement, its construction having been promoted by a citizens' group called the South to East Scranton Bridge Association. It was designed by New York City-based consulting engineer Abraham Burton Cohen, although Scranton Department of Public Works chief engineer William A. Schunk and his assistant Charles F. Schroeder were more actively involved in day-to-day supervision of construction. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Construction of a replacement bridge on a parallel alignment began in October 2014 and was completed in December 2017. The old bridge was demolished in June 2018.

It is a particular church that is autonomous (sui juris), using the Byzantine Rite and the ancient Greek language (the language that was the principal of all peoples in the tradition of the Eastern Churches) or the Albanian language (the mother language of the community) for the liturgy, whose Italo-Albanian (Arbëreshë) members are concentrated in Southern Italy (Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria), and Sicily. The Italo-Albanian Church is in full communion with the Pope of Rome, directly subject to the Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches, but follows the ritual and spiritual traditions that are common in most of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Church members are the descendants of the exiled Albanians who fled to Italy in the 15th century under the pressure of the Turkish persecutions in Albania and the territories inhabited by Albanians in the Balkans and the Peloponnese. The Albanian population in Italy has maintained until today the language, customs and religious rites of their origin. This Church maintains the heritage, the ethnic, cultural and religious tradition of its Albanians ancestors, keeping alive the spiritual and liturgical tradition of the Eastern Church from the time of Justinian (6th century).  Name  The Byzantine rite was brought to Italy in the 15th century by Albanian exiles fleeing from Albania, Epirus and Morea because of persecution by Ottoman Turks of Muslim faith. Italy had already known Eastern Christian rites in previous centuries, but these had since disappeared. The Albanians, Orthodox united in Rome with the Council of Ferrara-Florence, brought with them language, customs, customs and belief, jealously keeping the Byzantine rite and naturally bridging between East and West (see Albanian missions in Albania in 1690-1769, contacts with Ohrid, Cretan Byzantine art and new missions of re-Christianization of Albania in 1900 Ines Angjeli Murzak, Returning Home to Rome: The Basilian Monks of Grottaferrata in Albania, Grottaferrata 2009). The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church Is therefore characterized by a specific ethnic group: the Albanians of Italy, Arbëreshë or Italo-Albanesi. The only place where the Byzantine Rite remained in Italy was the Monastery of Grottaferrata, an Italo-Greek foundation, which had become steadily latinized through the centuries. The Albanians of Sicily and Calabria, from the eighteenth to the present, were bringing the monastery back to life, where most of its monks, abbots and students were and are Italo- Albanian, began to once again flourish. The name \\"Greek\\" refers to the Byzantine Rite (as opposed to \\"Latin\\" Roman Rite) and not to an ethnic component.  History  = Byzantine period = The conquest of Italy by the Byzantine Empire in the Gothic War (535–554) began a Byzantine period that included the Byzantine domination of the Papacy from 537 to 752. It is uncertain whether the Byzantine Rite was followed in any diocese of Southern Italy or Sicily before the 8th century. The spread of Greek monasticism in Italy received a strong impulse from the Rashidun Caliphate invasion of the Levant and Egypt, and later from the ban on religious images or icons. The monks naturally retained their rite, and as the bishops were not infrequently chosen from their number, the diocesan liturgy, under favourable conditions, could easily be changed, especially since the Lombard occupation of the inland regions of Southern Italy cut off the Greeks in the South from communication with the Latin Church. When, in 726, Leo III the Isaurian withdrew Southern Italy from the patriarchal jurisdiction of Rome and gave it to the Patriarch of Constantinople, the process of hellenization became more rapid; it received a further impulse when, on account of the Muslim conquest of Sicily, Greeks and Hellenized Sicilians fled to Calabria and Apulia. Still it was not rapid enough to suit the Byzantine emperors, who feared lest those regions should again fall under the influence of the West, like the Duchy of Rome and the Exarchate of Ravenna. Finally, after the Saxon emperors had made a formidable attempt to drive the Greeks from the peninsula, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas and the Patriarch Polyeuctus made it obligatory on the bishops, in 968, to adopt the Byzantine Rite. This order aroused lively opposition in some quarters, as at Bari, under Bishop Giovanni. Nor was it executed in other places immediately and universally. Cassano and Taranto, for instance, are said to have always maintained the Roman Rite. At Trani, in 983, Bishop Rodostamo was allowed to retain the Roman Rite, as a reward for aiding in the surrender of the city to the Greeks. In every diocese there were always some churches which never forsook the Roman Rite; on the other hand, long after the restoration of that rite, there remained Greek churches with native Greek clergy. = Re-Latinization = The restoration of the Roman Rite began with the Norman conquest in the 11th century, especially in the first period of the conquest, when Norman ecclesiastics were appointed bishops. Another potent factor was the reform of Pope Gregory VII, who in his efforts to repress marriage among the Latin clergy found no small obstacle in the example of the Greek priests. However, he and his successors recognized the Byzantine Rite and discipline wherever it was in legitimate possession. Moreover, the Latin bishops ordained the Greek as well as the Latin clergy. In the course of time the Norman princes gained the affection of their Greek subjects by respecting their rite, which had a strong support in the numerous Basilian monasteries (in the 15th century there were still seven of them in the Archdiocese of Rossano alone). The latinization of the dioceses was complete in the 16th century. Among those which held out longest for the Byzantine Rite were Acerenza (and perhaps Gravina), 1302; Gerace, 1467; Oppido, 1472 (when it was temporarily united to Gerace); Rossano, 1460; Gallipoli, 1513; Bova (to the time of Gregory XIII), etc. But even after that time many Greek priests remained in some dioceses. In that of Otranto, in 1583, there were still two hundred Greek priests, nearly all native. At Reggio, Calabria, Count Ruggiero in 1092 had given the Greeks the church of S. Maria della Cattolica, whose clergy had a Protopope, exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop; this was the case until 1611. In 1695 there were in the same dioceses fifty-nine Greek priests; after thirty years there was only one. Rossano still had a Greek clergy in the 17th century. The few native Greek priests were afterwards absorbed in the tide of immigration (see below). Of the Basilian monasteries the only one left is that of Grottaferrata, near Rome. In Sicily the latinization was, for two reasons, accomplished more easily and radically. First, during the rule of the Muslim most of the dioceses were left without bishops, so that the installation of Latin bishops encountered no difficulty; secondly, the Normans had come as liberators, and not as conquerors. Important Greek colonies, founded chiefly for commercial reasons, were located at Venice, Ancona (where they obtained from Clement VII and Paul III the church of S. Anna, which they lost in 1833, having been declared schismatical in 1797), Bari, Lecce (where, even in the 19th century, in the church of S. Nicola, Divine worship was carried on in the Greek tongue, though in the Roman Rite), Naples (where they have the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo, erected in 1526 by Tommaso Paleologo Assagni), Leghorn (where they have the church of the Annunziata, 1607). In Rome there was always a large colony observing the Greek Rite. From the end of the 6th century until the ninth and tenth there were several Greek monasteries among which were Cella Nova, near S. Saba; S. Erasmo; San Silvestro in Capite; the monastery next to Santa Maria Antiqua at the foot of the Palatine. Like other nations, the Greeks before the year 1000 had their own schola at Rome. It was near the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. Even in the pontifical liturgy - at least on some occasions - a few of the chanted passages were in Greek: the custom of singing the Epistle and Gospel in both Latin and Greek dates from that period. = Albanian influx = Besides the first large emigration of Albanians which took place between 1467 and 1470, after the death of the celebrated George Castriota Scanderbeg (when his daughter, who had become the Princess of Bisignano, invited her countrymen to the Kingdom of Naples), there were two others, one under Ottoman Empire Sultan Selim II (1566–1574), directed to the ports along the Adriatic Sea and to Livorno; the other about 1740. In the course of time, owing to assimilation with the surrounding population, the number of these Italo-Greeks diminished, and not a few of their villages became entirely Latin. To educate the clergy of these Greeks, Pope Gregory XIII founded in 1577 at Rome the Greek College of St. Athanasius, which served also for the Greek Catholics of the East and for the Ruthenians, until a special college was instituted for the latter purpose by Pope Leo XIII. Among the alumni of St. Athanasius was the celebrated Leo Allatius. Another Greek-Byzantine ecclesiastical college was founded at Piana degli Albanesi in 1715 by P. Giorgio Guzzetta, founder of an Oratory of celibate Greek-Byzantine clergy. At Firmo the seminary of SS. Pietro e Paolo existed from 1663, erected by the Propaganda to supply priests for Albania. It was suppressed in 1746. Finally Pope Clement XII, in 1736, founded the Corsini College in the ancient Abbey of San Benedetto Ullano in the charge of a resident bishop or archbishop of the Greek Rite. Later it was transferred in 1794 to San Demetrio Corone, in the ancient Basilian monastery of S. Adriano. Since 1849, however, and especially since 1860, this college has lost its ecclesiastical character and is now secularized. Seminaries for the Albanians of Italy were set up in San Benedetto Ullano, and then in San Demetrio Corone, (Calabria) in 1732 and in Palermo, Sicily, in 1734. = Ecclesiastical status = Until 1919, the Italo-Greeks were subject to the jurisdiction of the Latin diocesan bishops. However, the popes at times appointed a titular archbishop, resident in Rome, for the ordination of their priests. When Clement XII established the Corsini College at San Benedetto Ullano in 1736, he placed it in charge of a resident bishop or archbishop of the Greek Rite. Pope Benedict XIV, in the papal Bull \\"Etsi pastoralis\\" (1742), collected, co-ordinated and completed the various enactments of his predecessors, and this Bull was still law in 1910, regulating the transfer of clergy and lay people between the communities of the Greek Church and Latin Church, and specifying that children of mixed marriages would be subject to the Latin Church. = Sui juris = On 6 February 1784, the pre-diocesan Ordinariate of the Albanians in Sicily was created, with Bishop Papàs Giorgio Stassi, titular Bishop of Lampsacus, first holding that position. By 1909, another Ordinary for the Greeks of Calabria was residing at Naples. The 20th century saw the foundation in 1919 of the Eparchy of Lungro (an Eastern Catholic bishopric) in Calabria, which serves Byzantine-Rite Albanians in mainland Italy, and on 26 October 1937 of the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci for those in Sicily promoted from the Ordinariate of Sicilia. One month before the foundation of the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci in 1937, the Byzantine-Rite Monastery of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata, not far from Rome, was given the status of a territorial abbacy, separating it from the jurisdiction of the local bishop. In October 1940, the three ordinaries held an inter-eparchial synod for preserving their Byzantine traditions and unity with an Orthodox Church of Albania observation delegation. On 25 October 1941, the Eparchy of Piana dei Greci was renamed as the Eparchy of Piana degli Abanesi /Eparhia e Horës së Arbëreshëvet. In 2004 and 2005, a second inter-eparchial synod was held in three sessions approving 10 documents for \\"the synod’s theological and pastoral context, the use of Scripture, catechesis, liturgy, formation of clergy, canon law, ecumenical and interreligious relations, relations with other Eastern Catholic Churches, re-evangelization and mission.\\" They were submitted to the Holy See and were still in dialogue as of mid-2007 in regards to their promulgation.  Organisation  St. Nicholas of Myra Cathedral, Lungro of the Albanians of continental Italy Piana degli Albanesi Cathedral of the Albanians of Insular Italy There are three ecclesiastical jurisdictions composing the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church: * Eparchy of Lungro degli Italo- Albanesi * Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi * Territorial Abbacy of Santa Maria of Grottaferrata The eparchies themselves have not been organized as a Metropolitan church, and remain on an equal footing, directly subject to the Holy See. These eparchies allow the ordination of married men as priests, and they also govern a few Latin Church parishes within the respective territories of the eparchies. As of 2010, the church's membership was estimated at approximately 61,000 faithful, with two bishops, 45 parishes, 82 priests, 5 deacons, and 207 religious brothers and sisters. Information sourced from Annuario Pontificio 2010 edition In the church there are the following religious institutions: the Italo-Albanian Basilian Monks Order of Grottaferrata (present in Lazio, Calabria and Sicily), the Suore Collegine della Sacra Famiglia, and the congregation of the Italo-Albanian Basilian Sisters Figlie di Santa Macrina (present in Sicily, Calabria, Albania and Kosovo). Italo-Albanian communities were formed in the cities of Milan, Turin, Rome, Naples, Bari, Lecce, Crotone, Cosenza and Palermo, as well as in Switzerland, Germany, United States, Canada, Argentina and Brazil. They depend, however, on Latin dioceses and only in some cases is the Byzantine liturgy celebrated. Over the centuries, albeit limited, there have been contacts religious between Albanians of Italy with the Christian East (monasteries of Crete) and Albania (Archdiocese of Shkodër, Durrës, Himarë). Important is the spiritual and cultural contribution of the monks and ieromonaci Albanians in the monastery of Grottaferrata. Outside of Italy there are some diaspora communities Italo-Albanian organized in religious associations and parishes. In the United States there are other churches of the Byzantine Rite (for example Our Lady of Wisdom Church in Las Vegas, under the jurisdiction of the Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Phoenix, and Italo-Greek Catholic Mission of Our Lady of Grace in New York, under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.) and more generally of the Eastern rite or different ethno-linguistic and historical tradition.

The tmem242 gene is located on chromosome 6, on the long arm, in band 2 section 5.3. This protein is also commonly called C6orf35, BM033, and UPF0463 Transmembrane Protein C6orf35. The tmem242 gene is 35,238 base pairs long, and the protein is 141 amino acids in length. The tmem242 gene contains 4 exons. The function of this protein is not well understood by the scientific community. This protein contains a DUF1358 domain (Domain of Unknown Function 1358).  Domain  The TMEM242 protein has a conserved domain of unknown function pfam 07096, DUF 1358., which covers the first 121 aa of the protein. This domain is conserved in eukaryotes. Associated Proteins Several predicted interacting proteins and functional sites on the protein have been identified. One of the predicted interacting protein is MAP2K1IP1, which is a scaffold protein. This protein is known to be involved in the MAP Kinase pathway. The MAP Kinase pathway is associated with the Alzheimer's pathway through a protein called Tau or MAPT. Excessive phosphorylation of this protein leads to aggregation of neurons which can cause Alzheimer's disease. Other associated proteins include GGT7, RNF5, ELOVL4, GPR42, BCL2L13, HEATR1, IZUMO4, ARID1B, SIAE, EDARADD, URB1, ZDHHC14, KIF11, RRM2, KCTD13, TMEM31, NDUFA3, SGPL1, CNR2, and GJA8. All of the listed proteins have known functions.  Function  The tmem242 protein is highly expressed in many tissues, but the most highly expressed in the brain, heart, adrenal, and thyroid.  Homologs and orthologs  There are homologs and orthologs of the tmem242 protein in a variety of species. The species have diverged as far back as 794 million years ago. The following species have been found as having orthologs to the tmem242 protein in their genome: * TMEM242, H. sapiens * TMEM242, P. troglodytes * Tmem242, M. musculus * C1H6orf35, R. norvegicus * TMEM242, C. lupus * TMEM242, B. taurus * C3H6ORF35, G. gallus * tmem242, D. rerio * tmem242, X. tropicalis * AgaP_AGAP009165, A. gambiae * CG11699, D. melanogaster This image shows the corrected divergence for tmem242 compared to fibrinogen and cytochrome C The image to the right represents the rate of divergence for tmem242 (blue) compared to fibrinogen (red) and cytochrome C (green). This graph shows that tmem242 is evolving at a rate that is in between that of fibrinogen, which evolves quickly, and cytochrome C, which evolves slowly.  Gene Level Regulation  The promoter for the tmem242 gene is located upstream, but includes the transcription and translational start sites. This promoter was found using ElDorado by Genomatix. This promoter has many transcription factor binding sites. Some of these transcription factors include TFIIB, Mouse Krueppel like factor, and NKX homeodomain factors. One notable transcription factor is the Retinoblastoma-binding protein with demethylase activity. There are ubiquitous basal level expression of tmem242 in all tissues in human and mouse. There are other tissues with increase expression levels such as the cerebellum and the hippocampus. There is increase expression levels in many parts of the brain along with kidney and prostate. Tmem242 is also expressed in smaller amounts such as heart, adrenal gland, and thyroid.  Transcriptional Level Regulation  Tmem242 has several predicted post-transcriptional stem loop structures in the 5' UTR. These structures use binding, both traditional and modified, to create stem loop structures in the untranslated regions of the mRNA.  Protein Level Regulation  There are various forms of protein level regulation for tmem242. Tmem242 is found in a membrane within the cell. It is likely tmem242 is found in the cellular membrane or the mitochondrial membrane, but other sub cellular locations are possible. These include the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane. There are various phosphorylation sites present on tmem242. These sites include cAMP and cGMP dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and a protein kinase C phosphorylation site. These site all favor the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues. Other post-translational modifications include a N-myristoylation site, which covalently adds a myristate molecule.  Protein Composition  There are various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can occur in tmem242. A few cause stop codons, others make either silent mutations or missense mutations. Tmem242 is 141 amino acids long, and contains at least one residue of each amino acid. There are two transmembrane domains, one spanning from approximately the 28th residue to the 48th reside. The second domain spans from approximately the 82nd residue to the 102nd residue. These amino acid residues are approximate as various sources have approximations for the transmembrane domains. = Secondary Structure = Tmem242 has several secondary structures. The two transmembrane domains have alpha helices. These helices are formed from uncharged residues that are buried in the membrane. These helices are not exposed for binding. Other parts of the tmem242 protein may form secondary structures. = Tertiary Structure = The tmem242 protein further folds to its final structure to embed in a membrane. It is likely tmem242 is embedded in the cellular membrane, there is also potential for tmem242 to embed in the mitochondrial membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. = Post-translational Modification = Tmem242 undergoes various post-translational modification. There are 11 serine residues that have a potential to be phosphorylated. Those sites occur in residue numbers 13, 20, 51, 57, 65, 74, 76, 77, 119, 128, and 130. There are also four threonine residues that have the potential to be phosphorylated. Those site are residue numbers 36, 49, 123, and 137. Other post-translational modifications that potentially happen occur at specific motif sites. There are 12 motif sites in tmem242 that correlate to 4 different motif types. The four types are cAMP and cGMP dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, casein kinase II phosphorylation site, N-myristoylation site, and protein kinase C phosphorylation site. There is one cAMP and cGMP dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site in tmem242, and this motif has a preference for phosphorylation of threonine and serine residues. There are four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and this motif is a serine/threonine kinase. There are six N-myristoylation sites in tmem242, and this motif signals a covalent attachment of myristate. There is one protein kinase C phosphorylation site which signals phosphorylation of serine or threonine resides.

The Baltic states were occupied and annexed, becoming the Soviet socialist republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. After their annexation by Nazi Germany, the USSR reoccupied the Baltic territories in 1944 and maintained control there until the Baltic states regained their independence nearly 50 years later in the aftermath of the Soviet coup of 1991.  Sovietization  = Resistance and deportations = Riga in May 1941 Between 1940 and 1987, the Soviet Union carried out a process of sovietization which aimed to weaken the national identities of the Baltic peoples. An important factor in the attempt to achieve this was large-scale industrialisation then direct attacks on culture, religion and freedom of expression.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 126. For the Soviet authorities the elimination of opposition and the transformation of the economics went hand in hand. The Soviet used massive deportations to eliminate resistance to collectivisation and support for the partisans. The Baltic partisans resisted Soviet rule by armed struggle for a number of years. The Estonian Forest brothers, as they were known, enjoyed material support among the local population. The Soviets had already carried out deportations in 1940–41, but the deportations between 1944 and 1952 were much larger in number. In March 1949, the top Soviet authorities organised a mass deportation of 90,000 Baltic nationals, whom they labelled as enemies of the people, to inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union. Soviet prison doors on display in the Museum of Occupations in Tallinn. Antanas Sniečkus, the leader of the Communist Party of Lithuania from 1940 to 1974 The total numbers of those deported between 1944 and 1955 has been estimated at 124,000 in Estonia, 136,000 in Latvia and 245,000 in Lithuania. The deportees were allowed to return after the secret speech of Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, however many did not survive in their years in Siberia.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 129. Large numbers of the inhabitants of the Baltic countries fled westwards before the Soviet forces arrived in 1944. After the war, the Soviets established new borders for the Baltic republics. Lithuania gained the regions of Vilnius and Klaipeda, but Estonia and Latvia ceded some eastern territories to the Russian SSR. Estonia lost 5 percent and Latvia 2 percent of its prewar territory. = Industrialization and immigration = The Soviets made large capital investments for energy resources and the manufacture of industrial and agricultural products. The purpose was to integrate the Baltic economics into the larger Soviet economic sphere. The industrial plans and a transport infrastructure were advanced by the Soviet standards.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 130. In all three republics, manufacturing industry was developed at the expense of other sectors, notably agriculture and housing. The rural economy suffered from the lack of investments and the collectivization.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 131. Baltic urban areas were damaged during wartime and it took ten years to make up for losses in housing. New constructions were often poor quality and ethnic Russian immigrants were favored in housing.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 132. Estonia and Latvia received large-scale migration of industrial workers from other parts of the Soviet Union that changed the demographics dramatically. Lithuania also received immigrants, but to a lesser degree. Ethnic Estonians constituted 88 percent before the war, but in 1970 the figure dropped to 60 percent. Ethnic Latvians constituted 75 percent, but the figure dropped to 56.8 percent in 1970Ethnic composition of population by USSR republics. 1970 census and further down to 52 percent in 1989.Ethnic composition of population by USSR republics. 1989 census In contrast, in Lithuania the drop was only 4 percent. However, absence of Russian immigration was only a part of explanation as Lithuania gained the Vilnius area, fewer Lithuanians fled west and the state lost its Jewish minority. There was a difference between ethnic Russians. People who moved from Russia before 1940 annexation and knew the local language were named as \\"local Russians\\", for they had better relations with locals than those who settled later.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 134. Baltic communists had supported and participated the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. However, many of them died during the Great Purge in the 1930s. The new regimes of 1944 were established native communists who had fought in the Red Army. However, the Soviets also imported ethnic Russians to fill political, administrative and managerial posts. For example, the important post of second secretary of local Communist party was almost always ethnic Russian or a member of another Slavic nationality.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 139.  Everyday living  Estonian Song Festival in Tallinn in 1980 The Baltic republics were largely isolated from the outside world between the late 1940s and the mid-1980s. The Soviets were sensitive about the Baltic area not only because concerns about its loyalty, but also because of a number of military installations located there due to its proximity to several non Eastern Bloc states, including surveillance centres and a submarine base. During the late 1960s, Soviet democratic movements found support amongst Baltic intellectuals. The Soviet Union signed the Helsinki Accords and the following year, a monitoring group was founded in Lithuania which produced dissident publications during the 1970s and 1980s.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 135. Nationalism and religion inspired people to small-scale demonstrations and underground activities. The European Parliament passed a resolution supporting the Baltic cause in 1982.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 136. The Soviet Union maintained ethnic diversity, but on the other hand it made efforts to impose uniformity. A new wave of Russification of education system began in the late 1970s attempting to create a Soviet national identity. The education of Baltic children was conducted in their native languages, but the Russian language was compulsory. In addition, the Soviet authorities limited freedom of expression in literature and the visual arts. The song festivals remained a means of national self-expression. Nevertheless, intellectual life and scientific research were advanced by Soviet standards.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 138. However, after 1975 there were increasing problems with shortages of consumer and food products, social problems, unchecked immigration and damage to the environment.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 142. By the 1980s there was social and political tension both within the Baltic republics and between them and Moscow.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 144.  Road to independence  = Soviet reforms = The Era of Stagnation brought about the crisis of the Soviet system and reforms could not be long delayed. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms failed to take into account that the USSR was held together by military force which repressed all forms of nationalism. The freedoms of Glasnost released long-held feelings of nationalism in the Baltic republics, in a development known as the Singing Revolution.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 147. The first major demonstrations against the system were in Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals and by the end of 1988 the reform wing had gained a decisive position in the Baltic republics.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 149. At the same time, coalitions of reformists and populist forces assembled in Popular Fronts. They concentrated largely on calls for autonomy rather than independence.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 150. The Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic made the Estonian language the state language again in January 1989, and similar legislation was passed in Latvia and Lithuania soon after. Next, the Baltic republics declared their sovereignty: in November 1988 in Estonia, in May 1989 in Lithuania and July 1989 in Latvia.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 151. The Estonian Supreme Soviet reserved the right to veto laws of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet even referred to Lithuania's independent past and its illegal annexation into the Soviet Union in 1940. The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR was more cautious. The presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union condemned the Estonian legislation as unconstitutional.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 152. Head of KGB in Lithuania Eduardas Eismuntas argues with Lithuanian protesters, January 1990 The first Supreme Soviet elections took place in March 1989. There was still only one legal communist party, but the availability of multi-candidate choice encouraged the popular fronts and other groups to spread their own electoral message. The Communist Party in all three Baltic republics was divided along nationalist lines, and political leaders were increasingly responding to people rather than the party. The biggest demonstration was the Baltic Way in August 1989, where people protested on the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop treaty by a human chain linking hands across the three republics.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 154. Still, by 1990, there were not yet calls for political independence but demands for economic independence from Moscow.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 153. = Restorations of independence = In February 1990, the Russia Supreme Soviet elections led to the independence Sąjūdis-backed nationalists achieving a two-thirds majority. On 11 March 1990, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet declared Lithuania's independence. As a result, the Soviets imposed a blockade on 17 April.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 163. Latvia and Estonia, with large Russian minorities, lagged behind.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 158. At the same time, the Popular Fronts were in increasing the pressure in Latvia and Estonia, as the citizens committee movement prepared for wholly non-Soviet elections to take place at or near the time of the Supreme Soviet elections. They saw that independence could never be restored legally by organs of the occupying powers.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 159. The pro-independence candidates received overwhelming majorities in the Supreme Soviet elections of March 1990.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 160. On 30 March 1990, the Estonian Supreme Soviet declared independence. In particular, it declared the 1940 annexation illegal and began the transition towards an independent Republic of Estonia. On 4 May 1990, the Latvian Supreme Soviet made a similar declaration.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 162. On 12 May 1990 the leaders of the Baltic republics signed a joint declaration known as the Baltic Entente.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 165. By mid-June the Soviets started negotiations with the Baltic republics on condition they agreed to freeze their declarations of independence. The Soviets had a bigger challenge elsewhere, in the form of the Russian Federal Republic proclaiming sovereignty in June.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 164. Simultaneously the Baltic republics also started to negotiate directly with the Russian Federal Republic. In Autumn 1990, they set up a customs border between the Baltic states, the Russian Federation and Belarus.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 181. After the failed negotiations the Soviets made a dramatic attempt to break the deadlock and sent troops to Lithuania and Latvia in January 1991. The attempts failed, dozens of civilians were killed, and the Soviet troops decided to retreat.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 187. In August 1991, the hard-line members of the Soviet government attempted to take control of the Soviet Union. One day after the coup on 21 August, the Estonians proclaimed independence. Shortly afterwards Soviet paratroops seized the Tallinn television tower. The Latvian parliament made similar a declaration at the same day. The coup failed but the Collapse of the Soviet Union became unavoidable. On 28 August, the European Community welcomed the restoration of the sovereignty and independence of the Baltic states.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 189. The Soviet Union recognised the Baltic independence on 6 September 1991. The Russian troops stayed for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993. On 26 July 1994 Russian troops withdrew from Estonia and on 31 August 1994, Russian troops withdrew from Latvia.Hiden & Salmon (1994). p. 191. The Russian Federation ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear facilities in Paldiski on 26 September 1995 and in Latvia after Skrunda-1 suspended operations on 31 August 1998 and subsequently dismantled. The last Russian soldier left Skrunda-1 in October 1999, thus marking a symbolic end to the Russian military presence on the soil of the Baltic countries.The Weekly Crier (1999/10) Baltics Worldwide.

The Canadian Encyclopedia states, \\"Considered too avant-garde for his time because of Debussy's influence on his music, Mathieu gained recognition too late to inspire the generation that followed.\\" The pianist Léo-Pol Morin was one of the few important exponents of his work, notably including Mathieu's Chevauchée and Trois Préludes in his concert repertoire. Mathieu's song Un peu d'ombre (1913) was included in a number of recitals given by Marguerite Bériza and Sarah Fischer in Europe. Early life and career in Canada Born in Grondines, Quebec, Mathieu's parents were farmers. In 1906 he moved to Montreal where he began to study the piano with Alphonse Martin and singing with Céline Marier at the age of 16. Through Marier he met pianist and composer Alfred La Liberté who instilled within him an admiration for the works of Alexander Scriabin. He soon began composing music. His first major work was the choral piece Le Poème de la mer (1908) which he dedicated to Marier. Many of his early piano compositions display a strong influence of Scriabin, including Chevauchée (1911) and Sonata (1927). Mathieu obtained the post of organist at St-Jean- Berchmans Church in Montreal in 1907. In 1908 he opened his own teaching studio in Montreal which he ran for over the next decade. He also taught at the Conservatoire national de musique. Many of his students became winners of the prestigious Prix d'Europe, including Jean Dansereau, Auguste Descarries, Wilfrid Pelletier, and Ruth Pryce. In 1910 he began studying music composition, the organ, and the piano with Alexis Contant. Studies in France In 1920 Mathieu entered the Schola Cantorum in Paris on the advice of Albert Roussel. His studies were initially made possible through the generous support of funds raised by his friends, and later by a 1923 grant from the Quebec government (notably the first such grant awarded to a composer) which enabled him to continue studies in France for four more years. At the Schola Cantorum he studied composition with Vincent d'Indy and conducting with Vladimir Golschmann. He also studied psychology at the Collège de France with Pierre Janet. Several of his most important works were composed during his time in France, including String Quartet, Trio, Monologues for violin, and Dialogues for violin and cello. Later life and career Mathieu returned to Montreal in 1927, at which time he began teaching at the convent of the Sisters of Ste Anne at Lachine and at the Institut pédagogique of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre-Dame in addition to operating his own private studio. In 1929 he founded the Canadian Institute of Music, an organization whose aim was to enable \\"young artists and literary talents to perform before an elite audience\\". He directed the organization until its disbandment in 1956. From 1930-1952 he organized the \\"Soirées Mathieu\\", an intermittent concert series which featured concerts by himself, many of his pupils, and other notable musicians. After 1934 he composed few works, choosing instead to focus on his work as a teacher. Among his pupils during the 1920s-1950s were , Lydia Boucher, Pierre Brabant, and Raymond Lévesque. He also taught André Mathieu, the son of his marriage to the violinist Mimi Gagnon, who had a highly successful career as a concert pianist. In 1955 Mathieu joined the faculty of the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal where he taught music analysis through 1959. Of the few compositions he wrote during this time was the Quintet for piano and strings which is viewed as one of his best works. He began his last piece, Symphonie pour voix humaines for six-voice choir with brass accompaniment, in 1956 but never completed the work. He died in Montreal in 1962 at the age of 71. He was named an associate of the Canadian Music Centre posthumously and many of his papers and manuscripts are part of the collection at the Library and Archives Canada.

The capture of the fort gave Spain control of an important road through the Pyrenees. The siege took place during the War of the Pyrenees, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. Fort de Bellegarde is on a height overlooking the border town of Le Perthus, which lies on the modern A9 autoroute and Autovía A-7. Background King Louis XIV of France built Fort de Bellegarde after 1678 according to a plan drawn up by Sébastien de Vauban. This strong masonry fortress defended the Col de Le Perthus which crosses the Pyrenees at an altitude of . The pass is the most important route from Spain into France in the eastern Pyrenees. As Vauban noted, \\"Nothing overlooks this place\\", and the fortress is situated on the highest ground in the area.Goode, Bellegarde When Spain went to war with revolutionary France in mid-April 1793, Captain General Antonio Ricardos faced a strategic problem. With Bellegarde dominating the main road into France, the Spanish commander had to surround, besiege, and capture the place before he could use the main road as a supply route for his invading army. Accordingly, Ricardos crossed the Pyrenees 20 km to the southwest with 4,500 soldiers and descended on the village of Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans. In the first skirmish of the War of the Pyrenees, the Spanish evicted the 400 French defenders. Continuing his left hook, Ricardos' 4,400 troops fell upon a French force at the town of Céret on the Tech River. The French, 800 regulars and 1,000 National Guards with 4 cannon, panicked and fled. Between 100 and 200 Frenchmen became victims of Spanish musketry and steel, while another 200 drowned trying to cross the Tech. Ricardos reported only 17 men wounded.Smith, p 45 During the initial operations, the Spanish commander placed a detachment near Bellegarde to keep Boisbrulé and his garrison from raiding Spanish supply convoys.Rickard, Siege of Bellegarde With the seizure of Céret, Ricardos placed his army nearly in the rear of Bellegarde. After receiving some reinforcements, he advanced farther to the northeast to the vicinity of Trouillas. At this location, the 7,000 Spanish troops were confronted by the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees led by General of Division Louis-Charles de Flers. At the Battle of Mas Deu on 19 May, Ricardos defeated de Flers with the loss of 150 killed, 280 wounded, plus three cannons and six ammunition wagons captured. The Spanish lost 34 killed and an unknown number of wounded. The demoralized French soldiers retreated north to the department capital of Perpignan, where a battalion of National Guard mutinied and had to be disbanded. Rather than press on, Ricardos turned back to besiege Bellegarde, which overlooked his main supply route back to Barcelona.Smith (1998), 46 Siege Antonio Ricardos Concurrent with the siege of Bellegarde, Spanish General Antonio Ricardos attacked two French fortresses along the Tech River associated with Fort de Bellegarde, Fort les Bains at Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda 16 kilometers to the northwest and Fort de la Garde at Prats-de-Mollo-la- Preste 31 kilometers to the west. Fort les Bains was sieged on 23 May and the garrison of 350 men surrendered on 3 June after bombardment. The 200 man garrison of Fort de la Garde surrendered on 5 June after the fort's water supply was cut off.Smith (1998), 47 The siege of Bellegarde and its garrison of 1,536 French soldiers began on 23 May. The garrison's firepower included at least 41 cannon and seven mortars. For several weeks the Spanish siege guns pounded Fort de Bellegarde until a breach was made in the main wall. By this time, 42 of the 50 French artillery pieces were dismounted.Rickard, Siege of Bellegarde. Rickard and Smith differ over the total of French guns. Facing the prospect of an assault with his defenses compromised, Boisbrulé formally surrendered Bellegarde on 24 June. The remaining soldiers of the garrison marched into captivity. During the month-long siege, the French suffered losses of 30 killed, 56 wounded, and 1,450 captured. Spanish losses are not known.Smith (1998), 48 Results With the Fort de Bellegarde secured, the Spanish army became able to use the Col de La Pertus as a supply route. Ricardos lunged at the capital of Rousillon but suffered a stinging repulse at the Battle of Perpignan on 17 July 1793. De Flers' French suffered 800 casualties out of a total of 12,000 troops. The French also lost one cannon and had 600 desertions. Out of 15,000 soldiers,Smith (1998), 49 the Spanish lost approximately 1,000 casualties. De Flers had used the month in which Ricardos reduced Bellegarde to train his green recruits and surround Perpignan with field fortifications.Rickard, Battle of Perpignan The French turned back Ricardos again in the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September, but the Spanish turned the tables on their opponents in the Battle of Truillas five days later.Smith (1998), 56-57 Footnotes References  * Category:Conflicts in 1793 Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Sieges involving Spain Category:Sieges involving France Category:1793 in France Category:History of Pyrénées-Orientales Category:Battles in Occitanie Category:Sieges of the War of the First Coalition ","title":"Siege of Bellegarde (1793)"},{"id":"27085828","text":"Wheler's on Main is a residential development (subdivision) in the community of Stouffville and in the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville, in York Region, Ontario, Canada.

It concerned the Home Office's decision to maintain a store of CS gas and plastic baton rounds. In 1986, a Home Office circular, 40/1986, authorised the Home Secretary to release this store to a police force without the approval of the Chief Constable if Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary agreed that it was necessary. The Northumbria Police Authority brought a judicial review case against this decision, arguing that it was ultra vires. The Divisional Court which heard the case recognised a prerogative power to keep the peace, which authorised the Home Office's actions. On appeal to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the decision was confirmed, although several more grounds for allowing the distribution of the store were also given. Facts Following riots in the early 1980s, the Home Office created a store of CS gas and plastic baton rounds, which could be provided to police forces in situations of public disorder. A Home Office circular, 40/1986, authorised the Home Secretary to release this store to a police force without the approval of the Chief Constable if Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary agreed that it was necessary. The Northumbria Police Authority brought a judicial review case against the Home Secretary, arguing that the open-ended nature of this circular made it ultra vires.Ward (1988) p.155 Judgment The case was first heard by a Divisional Court, composed of Watkins LJ and Mann J. Mann, with Watkins concurring, rejected the Northumbria Police Authority's argument, saying that under the Royal Prerogative HM Government retained the right to do whatever \\"was necessary to meet either an actual or an apprehended threat to the peace\\", something that had not previously been recognised as a prerogative power.Beynon (1987) p.147 A stumbling block to this was the previous judgment in Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd, which confirmed that where statutory provisions and prerogative powers acted in the same area, the prerogative power could not be used contrary to the provisions.Loveland (2009) p.97 Section 4(4) of the Police Act 1964 stated that \\"police authorities are to provide for the supply of equipment to their local forces\\", something that conflicted with the exercise of the prerogative. To get around this, Mann stated that section 4(4) did not \\"confer a monopoly power so as to limit the prerogative by implication\\", and was not the \\"statutory equivalent\\" of the prerogative, something Conor Gearty describes as \\"rather mystifying\\".Gearty (1987) p.374 The case then went to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, where it was heard by Purchas, Croom-Johnson and Nourse LJJ, and judgment given on 18 November 1987. The Court of Appeal relied on section 41 of the 1964 act, which allows the Home Secretary to \\"provide ... such ... organisations and services as he considers necessary and expedient for promoting the efficiency of the police\\"; they found that this covered not only setting up the central store, but also providing the equipment to police forces. At the same time, they affirmed the Divisional Court's findings about the prerogative power to do whatever \\"was necessary to meet either an actual or an apprehended threat to the peace\\". For this, they relied on the fact that police officers, sworn to the Crown, had a duty to keep the peace, and that the Crown had a duty to protect its citizens.Ward (1988) p.156 Significance The case recognised a never-before discussed prerogative power; while creating prerogative powers violates precedent, it was found that this power had existed but had not been used. The court's decision was criticised; academic Robert Ward writes in the Cambridge Law Journal that it has \\"Full marks for creative thinking, but the result looks distinctly like that constitutional solecism, the recognition of a new prerogative ... the impact of the prerogative power to maintain the peace is potentially so far- reaching as to make the decision look rather like a Pandora's box – from which a host of evils were loosed upon the world.\\"Ward, \\"Baton rounds and circulars\\" [1988] 2 CLJ 155 pp. 156–157 References Bibliography  Category:1987 in case law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:Home Office litigation Category:1987 in British law Category:Royal prerogative ","title":"R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority"},{"id":"27085894","text":"George Almond Munger (June 24, 1909 – July 21, 1994) was an American athlete, coach and athletic director. He played college football and competed in track and field at the University of Pennsylvania from 1930 to 1933. He returned to Penn as head coach of the football team from 1938 to 1953 and as director of physical education from 1954 to 1974. His 1945 and 1947 teams finished ranked among the top ten college football teams in the United States, and he coached five players who were inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and three who received the Maxwell Award as the best player in college football. Munger was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976. The Maxwell Football Club has present the George Munger Award each year since 1989 to the national college football coach of the year. Biography =Early years= Munger was born in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania in 1909. His father, Herbert N. Munger, was the co-owner of the Munger & Long department store in Camden, New Jersey. Munger received his early education at the Friends School in Camden. He received his preparatory education at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and the Episcopal Academy in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia. He was the captain of the football team at Episcopal Academy in 1928 and 1929. He led Episcopal to two undefeated seasons in football and once scored eight touchdowns in a game. He also helped lead Episcopal to two basketball championships and a baseball championship. He also set school records in the pole vault, high jump, discus and javelin. =Athlete at Penn= He later attended the University of Pennsylvania where he played at the halfback for the Penn Quakers football team from 1930 to 1932. He also competed for Penn in track and field and won the decathlon at the 1932 Penn Relays. With the Penn Relays being comparable to the Olympic Trials, Munger should have been a lock for the 1932 Olympics. But citing a lack of depth in the 1932 Relays field, another Olympics Trials were held in Chicago. Munger failed to clear a starting 12-foot height in the pole vault, finished ninth, and was named an alternate to the squad.Column: Munger was more than just coach. The Daily Pennsylvanian, September 11, 1997.Richard Hymans (2008) The History of the United States Olympic trials – Track and Field . USA Track and Field. pp. 76–77 =Teacher and coach at Episcopal Academy= After graduating from Penn in 1933, Munger taught mathematics and religion and coached football at the Episcopal Academy. In September 1935, he married Louise Laycock Smith in the Chapel of the Episcopal Academy. =Coach and administrator at Penn= Munger was hired by Penn as the freshman football and track coach in 1936 and held that position during the 1936 and 1937 football seasons. In January 1938, the 28-year-old Munger took over as the head coach of the Penn football team. He also became an assistant professor in the Department of Physical Education effective July 1, 1938. He served as the head football coach at Penn for 16 years from 1938 to 1953, compiling a record of 82–42–10 for a .649 winning percentage. His Penn teams finished ranked among the top ten college football teams in the United States on three occasions, including a No. 7 ranking in 1947 and a No. 8 ranking in 1945. Munger's 1947 team finished with an undefeated 7–0–1 record and outscored opponents 219 to 35. The 1947 team shut out both Navy and Cornell by identical scores of 21–0, and its only setback was a 7–7 tie with Army. Munger coached 16 All-American football players at Penn, and three of his players, Robert H. Odell (1943), Chuck Bednarik (1948) and Reds Bagnell (1950), won the Maxwell Award as the best college football player in the United States. Five of his players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Odell, Bednarik, Bagnell, Skip Minisi, and George Savitsky. During the Munger era, Penn regularly drew crowds of 75,000 to home games at Franklin Field. Munger's teams led the nation in attendance between 1938 and 1942 with 1.78 million fans. The Daily Pennsylvanian later wrote, \\"The Munger era represented the heyday of Quaker football.\\" After resigning as the football coach, Munger served as the director of physical education at Penn from 1954 to 1974. He was also a vice-president of the National Football Foundation and the Maxwell Club, president of the American Football Coaches Association, and a member of the U.S. Olympic Equestrian Committee and physical fitness committees under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy. During the summers from 1952 to 1976, he was Director of Camp Tecumseh, a boy's camp in Center Harbor, N.H. founded by three former Olympians in 1903.The Letter's Author: Challenge to Bud Wilkinson, Sports Illustrated Vault July 31, 1961 =Honors and awards= Munger was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1976. Munger's biography at the Hall of Fame describes him as \\"a superb, relaxed athlete, an innovative coach, and a meticulous administrator.\\" The University of Pennsylvania also named its football training complex, the George Munger Training Complex, after him, and the Munger Award is given each year to the most valuable player on the Penn football team. In 1989, the Maxwell Football Club began awarding the George Munger Award to the college football coach of the year. In its description of the award, the Maxwell Club says of Munger, \\"His devotion to ethics in athletics, and his commitment to education is the standard for which all college coaches should strive.\\" Recipients of the award include Bo Schembechler, Joe Paterno, Lloyd Carr, Bob Stoops, Pete Carroll, and Urban Meyer. In March 2010, the club announced that the award would be renamed the Joseph V. Paterno Award. =Death= Munger died from heart failure in July 1994 at age 84. He was survived by his wife Viola, daughter Carol Ober and four grandchildren. At the time of Munger's death, Chuck Bednarik told The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"[Munger] taught me a secret – the secret of how to approach life. He was a jovial man who would always laugh and act young. When I saw him a few years ago, it was like he had never changed, like he was in his '40s.\\" Head coaching record References External links Category:1909 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American football halfbacks Category:American men's basketball players Category:Penn Quakers football coaches Category:Penn Quakers football players Category:College men's track and field athletes in the United States Category:High school football coaches in Pennsylvania Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Episcopal Academy alumni Category:The Hill School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania ","title":"George Munger (American football)"},{"id":"27085901","text":"Jules-Louis Bolé de Chamlay (1650–1719) was a French military and diplomat.

The first section of 52 km from Rupsa to Baripada was opened for traffic on 20 January 1905. Rupsa was the junction with Bengal Nagpur Railway's broad gaugeline. An agreement was signed on 2 December 1918, for extending the line to Talband, 61.5 km away. This section was opened on 15 July 1920. The line was managed through managing agents, Hoare Miller & Co. of Calcutta and was operated by the BNR. MSR chose 20 ton 0-6-4T locomotives, designated as 'ML' class. The first two of these (No-691, 692) were built by Kerr, Stuart and Company. Later in 1924, two more locomotives (No-693, 694) built by the same company were added. These locos were later transferred to Naupada shed of Parlakimedi Light Railway , renamed PL class and heavier 'CC' class 4-6-2 locos of Satpura Railway were introduced on MSR. These were built by North British Locomotive Company, Glasgow. Later ZE class locomotives built by M/S Corpet-Louvet, M/S Krauss Maffei and M/S Kawasaki were introduced. All locos were homed at Baripada loco shed.

Frames support the hull and give the ship its shape and strength. In wooden shipbuilding, each frame is composed of several sections, so that the grain of the wood can follow the curve of the frame. Starting from the keel, these are the floor (which crosses the keel and joins the frame to the keel), the first futtock, the second futtock, the top timber, and the rail stanchion. In steel shipbuilding, the entire frame can be formed in one piece by rivetting or welding sections; in this case the floor remains a separate piece, joining the frame on each side to the keel. Frame numbers are the numerical values given to the frames; they begin at 1 with the forward-most frame, and numbers increase sequentially towards the stern. The total number vary per the length of a ship. Frame numbers tell you where you are in relation to the bow of the ship; the numbers increase as you go aft. The frames support lengthwise members which run parallel to the keel, from the bow to the stern; these may variously be called stringers, strakes, or clamps. The clamp supports the transverse deck beams, on which the deck is laid.

Proportions of the body and the construction of scales most closely resemble V. melinus, which can be found on the islands of Mangole and Taliabu. Most often, V. obor occurs in coastal sago palm swamps - a habitat that is underused by other species of the V. indicus group, but is also frequently encountered in riparian habitats and rainforests. It can reach lengths of 0.8 to 1.5 m in length and weigh between 0.5 and 1.5 kg. The lizard was named obor (meaning \\"torch\\" in Indonesian) due to its unique coloration. The sago monitor was first seen in the wild by Valter Weijola, who in March and April 2009 visited Sanana.

History  Black Bloc demonstration tactics from extreme-leftist antifascist groups. The phenomenon of the Autonome Nationalisten can be traced to \\"Freie Nationaliste\\" (Free Nationalists), \\"Freie Kräfte\\" (Free Forces) and \\"Freie Kameradschaften\\" (Free Comradeships) movements, which developed in the shadow of the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) (National Democratic Party of Germany) since the late-1980s. The police crackdown on the far-right after re-unification and the wave of banning in the early 1990s (\\"Deutsche Alternative\\", \\"Nationalistische Front\\", \\"Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\", among others) forced most of the local extreme far- right militant groups to split into \\"autonomous nationalist cells\\" of 5-20 members without a formal membership. Instead of conducting regular meetings, they started to use phones and later Internet for communication and organizing.Jan Schedler. ‚Modernisierte Antimoderne‘: Entwicklung des organisierten Neonazismus 1990-2010. In: J. Schedler, A. Häusler (Hrsg.). Autonome Nationalisten Neonazismus in Bewegung. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2011, p. 17-35. Local cells formed loose umbrella networks in the regions to coordinate actions.Robert Grimm (Manchester Metropolitan University). The geographic distribution of the extreme right in Germany, September 25, 2012. In 2008, Germany's Autonomous Nationalists were estimated to number approximately 400 people, 1% of the country's neo-Nazis. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which provides domestic intelligence for the government, estimated the number of active participants of the far right movement in 2008 around 40,000.Rachel Nolan. Neo-Nazi Fashion: Thor Steinar and the Changing Look of the German Far Right, Spiegel Online International, November 20, 2008. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), in 2001 there were 75 extreme-right organizations in Germany with 50,000 members.Extremism Across Europe, Southern Poverty Law Center. Accessed on 17 May 2014. The emergence of the Autonome Nationalisten was controversial within the German far right milieu, both because some older activists of the German extreme right objected to their \\"leftist\\" image and because the NPD feared they would complicate its efforts to take part in mainstream politics. Also controversial was that Autonome Nationalisten had occasionally expressed sympathy for Islamic extremism, as well as Hezbollah and Hamas for their opposition to Zionism and what is deemed \\"American imperialism\\".Autonome neo-nazi’s op de linkse toer?, Gebladerte Archief (Dutch) The same controversies arose among the far right in Poland. The Autonomous Nationalists in Europe made themselves visible starting from 2003–2004 and are now considered more violent than other members of the European far right. However, as of 2010, according to Miroslav Mareš, their impact in these countries has been limited so far.  Message  Researchers view the syncretic political movement of the Autonomous Nationalists in Europe as a \\"strategic concept, organization and subculture – all three terms are possible for the designation of this phenomenon.\\" They emphasize that, The Autonomous Nationalists were ideologically inspired by Strasserism. The message of AN shifted to anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist ideas. It promotes complete organizational decentralization and autonomy inside the movement.Sommer, Bernd. Anti-capitalism in the name of ethno- nationalism: ideological shifts on the German extreme right, Patterns of Prejudice, V. 42, No. 3 (2008): 305-316. The adoption of codes and symbols of the far left \\"Autonome Antifa\\" by the \\"Autonome Nationalisten\\" coincided with the persistence of vibrant alternative subcultures of the radical left and rejection of traditional skinhead cultural-political templates of behavior of the extreme right.Von Rainer Brahms. Mehr als eine Randerscheinung: Moderner Style, alte Inhalte , Lotta, No. 31, Summer 2008. The AN thus see themselves as 'autonomous' from established neo-Nazi programs and structures, developing their own ideological discourse, street message, action repertoire, music scenes and fashion codes.Schedler, Jan. The Devil in Disguise: Action Repertoire, Visual Performance and Collective Identity of the Autonomous Nationalists, Nations and Nationalism, V. 20, No. 2: 239-258, (2014).

The ‘Autonomous Nationalists’: new developments and contradictions in the German neo-Nazi movement, Interface: A journal for and about social movements, Volume 5 (2): 295 - 318, (November 2013).

Maharaja Takhtasinhji accorded sanction for construction of a railway from Bhavnagar to Wadhwan in the north and Dhoraji in the west with the line from Dhasa to Dhoraji funded by Gondal State. During 1863, Maharaja Jaswantsinhji received a proposal to start a Narrow Gauge line like in parts of Gaekwad Railway in Baroda. Maharaja was not inclined, as by that time another company called Ghogha Kathiawad Light Railway Company had been formed and it could be easily joined at Vartej, a mere 10 km away. But nothing materialized. The Bhavnagar- Gondal Railway was a joint venture with funds from both states 1839. Bhavnagar contributed Rs. 86 lakhs and Rs.29 lakhs was Gondal's contribution. The Bhavnagar-Wadhwan line had a length of a 166 km; the Dhola-Dhasa-Dhoraji line had a length of 144 km. The work was carried out between 1878 and 1880. In March 1879, Mr. Alexander Izat was appointed as the Engineer-in-Chief. He was earlier the Chief Engineer of Daund-Manmad line (which had opened in 1878). Mr. R. Proctor Sims who was Bhavnagar's state Engineer had carried out the survey from Bhavnagar to Botad. The survey from Dhasa to Dhoraji was carried out under Mr. Ford who held analogous post in Gondal. An engineer from BB & CI, Mr. Hargreaves did the survey from Botad to Wadhwan. The earth-work was commenced as a famine work with all possible haste and finished within an astonishingly short time by May 1880. His Highness requested the Governor of Bombay Sir James Ferguson (who had succeeded Sir Richard Temple in March 1879) to inaugurate the line in December and declare it open for traffic. On 17 December 1880 the Governor and his entourage arrived at Bhavnagar by a special steamer from Bombay named May Frere. Many guests, both European and native, were invited. On approach of the May Frere at port of Bhavnagar, Colonel Barton (the political Agent), Major Woodhouse (the Assistant Political Agent) and Diwan Sahib Samaldas went in a steam launch and brought the Governor and his party ashore. Takhtsinhji received the Governor at the landing steps and welcomed him. The Governor was then taken to the town and the evening spent in sight seeing and visiting the Gaurishankar Lake. Early next morning on 18 December 1880, the governor drove the last spike of the permanent way at the city station (now Bhavnagar Terminus) in the presence of a large gathering and declared the railway line from Bhavnagar to Wadhwan open, then went to a welcome at Limdi station. The Bhavnagar State Railway along with other state railways of Kathiawar and Saurashtra were merged in April 1948 into Saurashtra Railway by the Government of India. Saurashtra Railway was merged with BB&CI; to form Western Railways.  Conversion to broad gauge  The BSR was converted to broad gauge in 2003.

He began his criminal career as a car thief in the state of Coahuila, and in 1990 at age 20, he was admitted to the Coahuila Judicial Police force. Several years later in 1993 , he was admitted to the Federal Police, which was led by the office National Security Commission and was stationed at Nuevo Laredo.

The Mexican government had been offering a $30 million pesos (US$1.7 million) bounty for information leading to Villarreal's capture. Villarreal Barragán was extradited to the United States on 23 May 2012, and may possibly serve as a \\"protected witness\\" for the DEA.

Rabbi Ilai ( or עילאי), also recorded as Rabbi Ela (אלעא, אילא), Hela, Ilaa, Ili, La, Leia, or Yela,Rabbi Il'ai (II) - רבי עילאי, sages of the talmud was an amora of the Land of Israel, of the third generation of Amoraim, who lived in the late 3rd-early 4th centuries. Biography He was a disciple of R. Yochanan bar Nafcha and R. Shimon ben Lakish. Among his disciples, one can find the leading figures of the fourth amoraic generation, such as Rav Jonah, Rav Zeira, Ravin and more. In one form or another, his name frequently appears in both Yerushalmi and Bavli, mostly in the field of the halakhah. He was so distinguished that his contemporary and friend Rabbi Zeira, admiring Ela's acumen, exclaimed, \\"The very air of Palestine imparts wisdom\\".Bava Batra 158b On two other occasions, the same Zeira entitled him \\"Bannaya d'Oraita\\" (Builder of the Law: establisher of fine legal points).Yerushalmi Yoma 3 40c; Yerushalmi Gittin 7 48d He carried his theoretical knowledge into actual life, so that the very appointments of his house afforded object-lessons in rabbinic rites.Yerushalmi Yoma 1 38c; Yerushalmi Megillah 4 75c It is related that when on a certain Friday his duties detained him at college until late at night, and, returning home, he found the entrance barred and the people asleep, rather than desecrate the Sabbath by knocking at the gate for admission, he spent the night on the steps of his house.Yerushalmi Beitzah 5 63a Teachings In halakhic exegesis Ela laid down the guiding rule, \\"[Every textual interpretation must respect the subject of the context\\".Yerushalmi Yoma 3 40c; Yerushalmi Megillah 1 72a Another and the most frequently cited of his exegetic rules is, \\"Wherever the Bible uses any of the terms 'beware,' 'lest,' or 'not,' a prohibitory injunction is involved\\".Menachot 99b, and parallels Quite a number of exegetical observations applied to halakhic deductions are preserved under Ela's name,Yerushalmi Shabbat 1 2b, etc. and he reports like interpretations by his predecessors.Yerushalmi Ma'aser Sheni 5 55d Ela also appears in aggadah,Yerushalmi Shabbat 2 5b, 6 8c; Yerushalmi Yoma 5 42b, etc. but only rarely transmits the aggadic teachings of others.Yerushalmi Peah 1 16a; Sanhedrin 44a That psychological test of human character as betrayed in the passions produced \\"by the cup, by cash, and by choler\\",Eruvin 65a; compare Derech Eretz Zutta 5 which some ascribe to this Ela (Ilai), others ascribe to Rabbi Ilai I.

They saw service throughout Ohio in the 1930s. After the failure of the C&LE; in 1939 they saw service with the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway (CRANDIC) and the Lehigh Valley Transit Company. Several have been preserved.  Design  The management of the 1929 newly formed interurban Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad wanted to replace its heavy and aging interurban coaches with new ones that would be lighter, lower, passenger comfortable, and power efficient. C&LE; staff worked with the Cincinnati Car Company to design what came to be called \\"The Red Devils.\\" These interurban cars were among the first to be constructed partially with aluminum. The frame was steel and the body panels aluminum. They had leather bucket seats, a luggage compartment, toilet, subdued lighting, and up to 44 seats depending upon format. This construction ultimately proved to have some weaknesses. The riveting of aluminum plates to a steel frame produced an electrolytic reaction that gave rise to corrosion in the side panels and the front and rear dashers. The C&LE; eventually replaced some of the aluminum panels with steel. The cars featured Art deco styling and a distinctive bright red paint scheme. Half of the cars were delivered as parlor cars with first class living room style lighting and seating in the rear.  Service  The Red Devil's top design speed was . but in scheduled operation with frequent stops, side of road track location, and rough track, it did not run this fast. Not only was it the fastest interurban car design of its time, it outpaced even the fastest conventional train in commercial traffic, the Cheltenham Spa Express and was almost as fast as the German Fliegender Hamburger, which was inaugurated in 1933. (see Land speed record for rail vehicles#Scheduled trains). The Red Devils ran Cincinnati to Dayton, then to Toledo, and finally to Detroit, a trip close to 270 miles in length. In 1930, a race was organized between a Red Devil and a plane. The publicity stunt's result was that the interurban car ran at – and won. Competition with the growing population of automobiles riding on a constantly expanding paved state highway system plus the devastating negative financial impact of the Depression led to a decline in C&LE; passenger business starting in the early 1930s and continuing through the rest of the decade. The C&LE;'s freight business, which eventually was supporting the C&LE;, collapsed when its last interchange partner, the Toledo to Cleveland Lake Shore Electric interurban, went out of business in 1938. The C&LE; ceased operation in 1939. and the innovative Red Devils were sold after abandonment: six to the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway (CRANDIC) and thirteen to the Lehigh Valley Transit Company.
