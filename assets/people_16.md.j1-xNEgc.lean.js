The area is part of the aspen parkland biome. Red Deer Hill used to have a gas station at the bottom of the hill going south. It would close down some years later and a house would be built. The Red Deer Hill post office was previously known as Aaskana, and was founded in 1888. At the time, it was part of the District of Saskatchewan in the Northwest Territories, a precursor to the province. It changed name in 1897, and was located at the legal land description of Section 32, Township 46, Range 26, West of the 2nd Meridian.

Since its establishment in 1945,\\"Seoul's best museums\\" CNN Go. 27 October 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-03 the museum has been committed to various studies and research activities in the fields of archaeology, history, and art, continuously developing a variety of exhibitions and education programs. In 2012, it was reported that since its relocation to Yongsan District in 2005, the museum had attracted an attendance of 20 million visitors, or over 3 million annually which makes it one of the most visited museums in the world and Asia and the most visited in South Korea.Visitor Figures 2013: Museum and exhibition attendance numbers compiled and analysed, The Art Newspaper, International Edition, April 2014. A poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors, conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, stated that visiting the museum is one of their favorite activities in Seoul. It is one of the largest museums in Asia. History Exterior of Museum Emperor Sunjong established Korea's first museum, the Imperial Household Museum, in 1909. The collections of the Imperial Household Museum at Changgyeonggung and the Japanese Government General Museum administered during Japanese rule of Korea became the nucleus of the National Museum's collection, which was established when South Korea regained independence in 1945. During the Korean War, the museum's 20,000 pieces were safely moved to Busan to avoid destruction. When the museum returned to Seoul after the war, it was housed at both Gyeongbokgung and Deoksugung Palace. In 1972, the museum moved again to a new building on the grounds of the Gyeonbokgung Palace. The museum was moved again in 1986 to the Jungangcheong, the former Japanese General Government Building, where it was housed (with some controversy and criticism) until the building's demolition in 1995. In December 1996, the museum was opened to the public in temporary accommodations in the renovated Social Education Hall, before officially reopening in its grand new building in Yongsan Family Park on October 28, 2005. In October 2005, the museum opened in a new building in Yongsan Family Park in Seoul, South Korea. The museum is situated on what used to be a golf course that was part of the Yongsan Garrison, the central command of the United States Forces stationed in Korea. The US Army returned a part of the land in 1992 to the Korean government, which went on to become the Yongsan Family Park. While the plans for the museum inside the park began in 1993, its opening was delayed repeatedly by a helipad, which was eventually relocated in 2005 by agreement. The museum contains over 310,000 pieces in its collection with about 15,000 pieces on display at one time. It displays relics and artifacts throughout six permanent exhibition galleries such as Prehistory and Ancient History Gallery, Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery, Donation Gallery, Calligraphy and Painting Gallery, Asian Art Gallery, and Sculpture and Crafts Gallery. It is the sixth largest museum in the world in terms of floor space, now covering a total of . In order to protect the artifacts inside the museum, the main building was built to withstand a magnitude 6.0 Richter Scale earthquake. The display cases are equipped with shock-absorbent platforms. There is also an imported natural lighting system which utilizes sunlight instead of artificial lights and a specially designed air- conditioning system. The museum is made from fire-resistant materials and has special exhibition halls, education facilities, a children's museum, huge outdoor exhibition areas, restaurants, cafes, and shops. Layout Special Exhibition Hall The museum is divided into three floors. Symbolically, the left of the museum is supposed to represent the past, while the right side of the museum represents the future. The ground floor contains parks; gardens of indigenous plants; waterfalls and pools; and a collection of pagodas, stupas, lanterns, and steles (including National Treasure of Korea No. 2, the Great Bell of Bosingak, the exemplar of Korean bells of the Joseon period). =First floor= On the first floor is the Prehistory and Ancient History Gallery, which contains approximately 4,500 artifacts from the Paleolithic to the Unified Silla era excavated from sites across Korea. The nine exhibition rooms in the gallery are the Palaeolithic Room, the Neolithic Room, the Bronze Age & Gojoseon Room, the Proto Three Kingdoms Room, the Goguryeo Room, the Baekje Room, the Gaya Room, and the Silla Room. Ranging from chipped stone handaxes to luxurious ancient royal ornaments, the relics displayed here show the long journey taken by early settlers on the Peninsula towards developing their unique culture. Artifacts from important prehistoric sites and settlements such the Bangudae Petroglyphs and Songgung-ni are found in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Rooms. Also on the first floor is the Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery, which showcases the cultural and historical heritage throughout the Unified Silla, Balhae, Goryeo, and Joseon periods. The eight rooms of the gallery include the Unified Silla Room, Balhae Room, Goryeo Room, and the Joseon Room. =Second floor= The second floor contains the Donation Gallery and the Calligraphy and Painting Gallery, which contains 890 pieces of art that showcase the traditional and religious arts of Korea in line and color. The Calligraphy and Painting Gallery is divided into four rooms: the Painting Room, the Calligraphy Room, the Buddhist Paintings Room, and the Sarangbang (Scholar's Studio). The Donation Gallery holds 800 pieces of art donated from the private collections of collectors. The gallery is divided into eleven rooms: the Lee Hong-kun Collection Room, the Kim Chong-hak Collection Room, the Yu Kang-yul Collection Room, the Park Young-sook Collection Room, the Choi Young-do Collection Room, the Park Byong-rae Collection Room, the Yoo Chang-jong Collection Room, the Kaneko Kazushige Collection Room, the Hachiuma Tadasu Collection Room, the Iuchi Isao Collection Room, and the Other Collection Room. =Third floor= The third floor contains the Sculpture and Crafts Gallery, with 630 pieces that represent Korean Buddhist sculpture and craftwork. Highlights of the gallery include Goryeo Celadon wares and National Treasure of Korea No. 83, Bangasayusang (or Pensive Bodhisattva). The five rooms of the gallery are the Metal Arts Room, the Celadon Room, the Buncheong Ware Room, the White Porcelain Room, and the Buddhist Sculpture Room. Also on the third floor is the Asian Arts Gallery, which contains 970 pieces that explore the similarities and divergences of Asian art and the confluence of Asian and Western art via the Silk Road. The five rooms are the Indian & Southeast Asian Art Room, the Central Asian Art Room, the Chinese Art Room, the Sinan Undersea Relics Room, and the Japanese Art Room. Collection =Gold Crown, National Treasure of Korea No. 191= Silla Golden Crown The Fifth-century Silla gold crown was excavated from the North tomb of Hwangnamdaechong in Gyeongju. More ornaments, including a silver belt ornament inscribed (Î≥¥Ïù∏ÎåÄ)'Buindae (\\"Madame's belt\\"), were found in the North tomb than in the South tomb, suggesting that the North tomb is a woman's. The gold crown reflects the owner's political and social class. =Pensive Bodhisattva (Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation) (National Treasure No. 83)= Pensive Bodhisattva This Bodhisattva, from the early Seventh-century, sits with one leg over the other, lost in thought with fingers on its cheeks. The pose is derived from that of the Buddha contemplating the life of human beings. This statue wears a flat crown called the 'Three Mountain Crown' or 'Lotus Crown.' The torso is naked, adorned by a simple necklace. There are remarkable similarities with the wooden Pensive Bodhisattva at the Koryuji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, which is believed to have been founded by a Silla monk. It is likely, then, that this statue was created in Silla. The well-balanced shape, however, and elegant and refined craftsmanship is typical of the Baekje period. =Incense Burner, Celadon with Openwork, National Treasure of Korea No. 95= Celadon Openwork Incense Burner This Twelfth-century incense burner represents some of the best quality Goryeo celadon. It is composed of a cover (with a central hole for releasing incense), a burner, and a support. Above the hole for incense is a curved knob with a Seven Treasure design incised to aid the release of scent. =Ten-Story Pagoda from Gyeongcheonsa Temple, National Treasure of Korea No. 86= Ten- Story Pagoda The \\"Gyeongcheonsa Ten-Story Pagoda\\" (Í≤ΩÏ≤úÏÇ¨ Ïã≠Ï∏µÏÑùÌÉë, Êï¨Â§©ÂØ∫ÂçÅÂ±§Áü≥Â°î) was originally erected at the monastery Gyeongcheonsa in the fourth year (1348) of King Chungmok of Goryeo. In 1907, it was illegally smuggled to Japan by a Japanese court official, but was returned in 1918 at the behest of British and American journalists, E. Bethell and H. Hulbert. In 1960, it was restored to Gyoengbokgung Palace, but proved difficult to conserve because of acid rain and weathering. So, it was dismantled again in 1995, to be housed inside in the National Museum of Korea's 'Path to History' when the museum reopened in 2005. =Album of Genre Painting by Danwon, Treasure of Korea No. 527= Dancing Boy by Danwon. The Eighteenth-century painter Kim Hong-do, also known as Danwon, is known for his humorous and candid paintings of the lives of common people. This album consists of twenty-five paintings, each focusing on figures without background features. Kim's paintings appear sketchy, yet show expressive brush strokes and balanced composition. It is presumed that this style arose in Kim's late 30s, the album being completed when he was about 40 years old. [100 Highlights of National Museum of Korea, book] =The Oegyujanggak Uigwe= Gyujanggak was a royal library established on the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace in the capital by order of King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon, in 1776. Over time, the library also developed into a state-sponsored research institution. In 1782, a royal library annex called Oegyujanggak was established on Gangwha Island to preserve important documents related to the royal family more systematically and securely than possible in the capital. Oegyujanggak housed copies of writings, calligraphy, and drawings by former kings as well as the royal genealogies, uigwe, and other such items. As such it was a repository of royal family culture. It includes records of the preparations for state-sponsored events and ceremonies involving key members of the Joseon royal family. The text explains every process in detail and is supported by illustrations elaborately drawn by hand. These served as references for later generations organizing similar ceremonies or events. The Uigwe began to be produced in the 15th century, during early Joseon, and the practice continued to the end of the kingdom in the early 20th century. They preserve core elements of Confucian culture, which revered ritual and propriety. These works also show the governing philosophy and systems by which the Joseon state was run. Their historical and cultural value has been recognized globally, as the ‚ÄúRoyal Protocols of Joseon Dynasty‚Äù* were inscribed into the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2007. Two hundred and ninety-seven volumes of the Protocols that were looted in 1866 during the French campaign against Korea were kept at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. They were repatriated in April and June 2011 in four separate installments.Lee, Claire \\"Ancient Korean royal books welcomed back home\\" Korea Herald. 6 December 2011. Retrieved 2012-04-23 A special exhibition, The Return of the Oegyujanggak Uigwe from France: Records of the State Rites of the Joseon Dynasty, was held from 19 July to 18 September 2011. In June 2011, before of the exhibition, the museum showcased five copies of the records to the media, along with the silk covers of other volumes.

In the late 1980s, he was a member of Hans Valen, which covered material by United States heavy rocker, Van Halen; and then he was in Gnomes of Zurich. As Jones, he auditioned as lead vocalist for a Melbourne-based rock, pop group, the State. The State had formed in 1987, with the line-up of Peter Bowman on lead guitar and backing vocals (ex-Cutters), Phil Buckle on guitar and lead vocals (Cutters), Geoff Cain on bass guitar and Virgil Donati on drums (Taste, Cutters).McFarlane (1999). Encyclopedia entry for 'Southern Sons'. Retrieved 8 February 2010. He was considered too young for that group. In mid-1990, Thomas, as Jones (on lead guitar), worked alongside Buckle in John Farnham's backing band to record that artist's album, Chain Reaction (September 1990). Jones, on lead vocals and lead guitar, was asked by Buckle to form the Southern Sons, with former the State members: Bowman, Cain and Donati. In April 1991, Buckle explained to Charles Miranda of The Canberra Times that Jones was recruited because \\"[The State] were going nowhere fast. At this stage [in late 1989] Buckle realised that his songs had potential but his voice didn't\\". Southern Sons' debut self- titled album was released on 1 June 1990, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Their first single, \\"Heart in Danger\\", was released in August, it also reached No. 5 on the related ARIA Singles Chart. Jones and Buckle toured Australia and Europe as members of Farnham's backing band to promote Chain Reaction. Southern Sons were a support act on Farnham's tours in 1990 and 1991. The group also undertook their own headlining national tours. Buckle disputed media criticism that Southern Sons \\"sounded too similar to John Farnham's music\\"; he felt that although \\"Jack Jones, has a similar voice, they are very different. He believes the Sons guitar work makes for a harder sound.\\" Bowman left the group as a four-piece in mid-1992. As a member of Southern Sons, Thomas co-wrote some of their later material, including three tracks on their second album, Nothing But the Truth (November 1992), and six of eleven tracks for their third album, Zone (1995).

In 1996, Thomas and Donati formed a trio, Hong Kong Meeting, with Steve Hunter on bass guitar. Late in the next year Thomas and Donati joined Tina Arena's backing band for her national tour in support of her third solo studio album, In Deep (August 1997). In the following year Thomas formed the Jack Jones Band with Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar (ex-INXS) and Alex Formosa on drums. In March 1998 they performed at the Good Vibrations benefit concert by various artists for Marc Hunter, the ailing lead singer of New Zealand-Australian band, Dragon, who had been diagnosed with throat cancer. Thomas covered the tracks \\"Are You Old Enough\\", \\"Voodoo Chile\\" and \\"Both of Me\\", he also performed a duet with Tommy Emmanuel on \\"Nothing to Lose\\".

Most common distinctive constructions What follows are examples of the most common distinctive constructions in Quebec French syntax. For comparison, a standard French used throughout la Francophonie (including Quebec and francophone Canada) is given in parentheses with the corresponding English translation given afterwards in italics. Note that some of the following constructions can also be found in other regional dialects of French such as Acadian French and dialects in Western France. One far-reaching difference is the weakening of the syntactic role of the specifiers (both verbal and nominal), which results in many syntactic changes: *Positioning of the subject in an isolated syntagm at the beginning (or at the end) of the sentence, with pronouns integrated with the verbal particule (see pronouns below): ::Mon fr√®re, y√© dans police. (Mon fr√®re est dans la police.) My brother is in the police. ::Y a l'air f√¢ch√©, le chien. (Le chien a l'air f√¢ch√©.) The dog looks angry. *Increased presence of complex sentences with main or dependent clauses using demonstratives: ::Mon r√™ve, c'est de partir en Afrique. (Mon r√™ve est de partir pour l'Afrique / en Afrique.) My dream is to leave for Africa. *Relative clauses (1) using \\"que\\" as an all-purpose relative pronoun, or (2) embedding interrogative pronouns instead of relative pronouns: ::(1) J'ai trouv√© le document que j'ai besoin. (J'ai trouv√© le document dont j'ai besoin.) I found / I've found the document (that) I need. ::(2) Je comprends qu'est-ce que tu veux dire. (Je comprends ce que tu veux dire.) I understand what you mean. *Loosening of the prepositions traditionally associated with certain verbs: ::J'ai un enfant √† m'occuper. (Standard correct French: s'occuper de; J'ai un enfant dont je dois m'occuper.) I have a child of which I must take care. *Plural conditioned by semantics: ::La plupart du monde sont tann√©s des taxes. (La plupart du monde est tann√© des taxes.) Most people are fed up with taxes. * The drop of the double negative (a feature observed throughout Francophonie) is accompanied by a change of word order(1), and (2)postcliticisation of direct pronouns (3)along with non-standard liaisons to avoid vowel hiatus: ::(1) Donne-mo√© l√© maintenant. (Donne-le-moi maintenant.) Give it to me now. ::(2) Dis-mo√© pas de m'en aller! (Ne me dis pas de m'en aller) Don't tell me to go away. ::(3) Donne-moi-z-en pas ! (Ne m'en donne pas!) Don't give me any! Other notable syntactic changes in Quebec French include the following: *In colloquial speech, the verb √™tre is often omitted between je and un(e), with a t inserted: J't'un gars patient. A t is also often inserted after the second person singular: T'es-t-un gars patient. * Use of non-standard verbal periphrasis: ::J'√©tais pour te le dire. (J'allais te le dire. / J'√©tais sur le point de te le dire.) I was going/about to tell you about it. ::Avoir su, j'aurais... (Si j'avais su, j'aurais...) Had I known, I would have... ::J'√©tais apr√®s travailler quand ils sont arriv√©s. (J'√©tais en train de travailler quand ils sont arriv√©s.) I was working when they came. ::M'as le faire. (Je vais le faire. / Je le ferai.); akin to \\"ahma\\" in Southern American English - I'm a do it. (I'm going to do it.) *Particle \\"-tu\\" used (1) to form tag questions ((2) and sometimes to express exclamatative sentences): ::C'est-tu loin, √ßa ? \\"Is it far?\\" ::Y'en a-tu d'autres ? \\"Are there any others?\\" ::√áa vous tente-tu vraiment d'y aller ? \\"Do you [formal or plural] really want to go?\\" ::Faut-tu √™tre cave pas √† peu pr√®s ! \\"How very stupid [that other person] is [to do such a thing]\\" :Although this construction strikingly resembles a formal question asked in the 2nd person singular, there is no evidence that the particle tu came from the pronoun tu in the first place: ::J'ai-tu l'air fatigu√© ? \\"Do I look tired?\\" :\\"Tu\\" is actually more likely to come from the 3rd person pronoun il with a euphonic -t-, as using a particle ti in exactly the same way is a feature found in the O√Øl languages (other than French) in France and Belgium. Still, its use is often seen as a redundancy in a question for those who defend a standardized French. In such case, either \\"Tu\\" (but not both) can be eliminated to form correct syntax. ::Tu le veux-tu? (Le veux-tu? / Tu le veux?) \\"Do you want it?\\" * Extensive use of litotes ::C'est pas chaud! (C'est frais!) It's not that warm! ::C'est pas laid pantoute! (Ce n'est pas laid du tout!) This is nice! (literally: This is not ugly at all).  Pronouns  In daily use, Quebec French speakers frequently use a substantially different set of subjective pronouns in the nominative case from those traditionally used in standardized French: ::je/ tu/ y [i], a/ on/ vous/ y [i] (instead of je/ tu/ il, elle/ nous/ vous/ il(s), elle(s)) :::with [a] --> […õ] when used with the verb and copula √™tre *In common with the rest of the Francophonie, there is a shift from nous to on in all registers. In post-Quiet Revolution Quebec, the use of informal tu has become widespread in many situations that normally call for semantically singular vous. While some schools are trying to re-introduce this use of vous, which is absent from most youths' speech, the shift from nous to on goes relatively unnoticed. *The traditional use of on, in turn, is usually replaced by different use of pronouns or paraphrases, like in the rest of the Francophonie. The second person (tu, t√©) is usually used by speakers when referring to experiences that can happen in one's life: ::Quand t√© ben tranquille chez vous, √† te m√™ler de tes affaires... When you're all alone at home, minding your own business... : Other paraphrases using le monde, les gens are more employed when referring to generalisations: ::Le monde aime pas voyager dans un autobus plein. People don't like getting on a full bus. *As in the rest of the Francophonie, the sound [l] is disappearing in il, ils among informal registers and rapid speech. More particular to Quebec is the transformation of elle to [a] and less often written a and √® or est in eye dialect. See more in Quebec French phonology. *Absence of elles - For a majority of Quebec French speakers, elles is not used for the 3rd person plural pronoun, at least in the nominative case; it is replaced with the subject pronoun ils[i] or the stress/tonic pronoun eux(-autres). However, elles is still used in other cases (ce sont elles qui vont payer le prix they [women] are going to pay the price). *-autres In informal registers, the stress/tonic pronouns for the plural subject pronouns have the suffix ‚Äìautres, pronounced [ouÃØt] and written ‚Äìaut‚Äô in eye dialect. Nous-autres, vous-autres, and eux-autres are comparable to the Spanish forms nos(otros/as) and vos(otros/as), yet the usage and meanings are different. Note that elles- autres does not exist.  Verbs  In their syntax and morphology, Quebec French verbs differ very little from the verbs of other regional dialects of French, both formal and informal. The distinctive characteristics of Quebec French verbs are restricted mainly to: * Regularization :1. In the present indicative, the forms of aller (to go) are regularized as in all singular persons: je vas, tu vas, il/elle va. Note that in 17th century French, what is today's international standard in je vais was considered substandard while je vas was the prestige form. :2. In the present subjunctive of aller, the root is regularized as all- /al/ for all persons. Examples: que j'alle, que tu alles, qu'ils allent, etc. The majority of French verbs, regardless of dialect or standardization, display the same regularization. They therefore use the same root for both the imperfect and the present subjunctive: que je finisse vs. je finissais. :3. Colloquially, in ha√Ør (to hate), in the present indicative singular forms, the hiatus is found between two different vowels instead of at the onset of the verb's first syllable. This results in the forms: j'ha√Øs, tu ha√Øs, il/elle ha√Øt, written with a diaeresis and all pronounced with two syllables: . The \\"h\\" in these forms is silent and does not indicate a hiatus; as a result, je elides with ha√Øs forming j'ha√Øs. All the other forms, tenses, and moods of ha√Ør contain the same hiatus regardless of register. However, in Metropolitan French and in more formal Quebec French, especially in the media, the present indicative singular forms are pronounced as one syllable and written without a diaraesis: je hais, tu hais, il/elle hait. * Differentiation :1. In the present indicative of both formal and informal Quebec French, (s')asseoir (to sit/seat) only uses the vowel /wa/ in stressed roots and /e/ in unstressed roots: je m'assois, tu t'assois, il s'assoit, ils s'assoient but nous nous asseyons, vous vous asseyez. In Metropolitain French, stressed /wa/ and /je/ are in free variation as are unstressed /wa/ and /e/. Note that in informal Quebec French, (s')asseoir is often said as (s')assire. :2. Quebec French has retained the ' ending for je/tu/il-elle/ils in the imperfect (the ending is written as -ais, -ait, -aient). In most other dialects, the ending is pronounced, instead, as a neutralized sound between /e/ and . :3. Informal ils jousent (they play) is often heard for ils jouent and is most likely due to an old analogy with ils cousent (they sew). *Some expressions that take the subjunctive in standard French take the indicative in Quebec French, or vice versa (bien qu'il est trop tard rather than bien qu'il soit trop tard). This is mostly colloquial spoken usage, since written usage tends to follow the usage of France more closely.  Number  On the other hand, many Quebecers in informal context will decide on the agreement with collective nouns based on semantics rather than morphology. That is to say, for instance, that a verb whose grammatical subject is le monde (people, folks) may appear in the 3rd person plural because le monde designates multiple people although it is singular: le monde l√†-dedans sont en train de chi√¢ler (the people in there are complaining).

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and worked for a Boston shipping house around the 1840s. The firm sent him to San Francisco, California in 1846, where he traded goods for furs, tallow, and hides. With the start of the Gold Rush six years later, he bought a great deal of real estate in what later became San Francisco. He also sketched a drawing of the village of which he would become mayor, called View of Place of Anchorage of Yerba Buena. Teschemacher joined the Vigilance Movement, serving in the vigilante-led trials of suspected criminals. Through his work with the vigilantes, he became known as a person who stood for law and order and was the choice of the People's Party for mayor in the 1859 election. He won due to divisions in the Democratic ranks over slavery. His first months in office were relatively calm. He kept tabs on city spending and made few public appearances save to dedicate the city's first streetcar line. He also doubled the size of San Francisco's police force. While Teschemacher was Mayor of San Francisco, the American Civil War erupted: San Francisco coped with disrupted trade with the East by buying stock in silver mines and establishing factories that sold goods not only within the city itself but also in Asia, beginning San Francisco's path to economic self-sufficiency. 1861 also saw the completion of the New York to San Francisco telegraph line, with Teschemacher sending a congratulatory telegram to New York's mayor. After leaving office, Teschemacher was a real estate agent until 1882. He retired to Europe, briefly appearing in San Francisco in 1892. He produced a lithograph entitled Life In California, by the Endicott Company. He died in Territet, Switzerland on November 26, 1904.

Setting The WWF defines the ecoregion as the mainland coast of British Columbia up to 150 km inland to the crest of the Coast Mountains, extending along the western front of the northern Cascade Range in northwestern Washington. Specific areas include the Pacific and Kitimat Ranges of the Coast Mountains, the Nass Ranges and the basin of the Nass River. An exclave of the ecoregion occupies the eastern slope of the Olympic Mountains on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. The landscape is a mixture of coastal lowland with many steep valleys, inlets, and fjords. The climate is drier on the inland mountains than right on the coast and the average annual temperature in the valleys is 6.5 ¬∞C. Flora There are three distinct types of vegetation on this coast: the forests of the coastal plain dominated by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western red cedar (Thuja plicata) and amabilis fir (Abies amabilis); mountain forest of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), amabilis fir and yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis); and alpine tundra with sedge (Carex) meadows and lichen-covered rocks. Fauna Mammals of the area include the Kermode bear a rare white subspecies of the American black bear (Ursus americanus) found on Princess Royal Island and elsewhere, grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), moose (Alces alces), migratory woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), grey wolf (canis lupus), red fox (vulpes vulpes), mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), American mink (mustela vision), marten (martes americana), North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), American beaver (castor canadensis) and snowshoe hare (lepus americanus). Birds include spotted owl, blue grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) and many waterbirds. Threats and preservation Intact forest in the Cascade Falls Regional Park, near Mission, British Columbia. This is a well-preserved ecoregion with about 40% of original forest intact. Most disturbance has occurred in the valleys rather than the mountain tops and logging is ongoing.

Life  Franck was born in Breslau, the capital of the Prussian province of Silesia. He was the fourth child of a wealthy and cultivated banker who exposed his children to the best and brightest that Germany had to offer. Frequenters of the Franck home included such luminaries as Heine, Humboldt, Heller, Mendelssohn, and Wagner. His family's financial position allowed Franck to study with Mendelssohn as a private student in D√ºsseldorf and later in Leipzig. As a talented pianist, he embarked upon a dual career as a concert artist and teacher for more than four decades during the course of which he held many positions. Although he was highly regarded as both a teacher and performer, he never achieved the public recognition of his better known contemporaries such as Mendelssohn, Schumann or Liszt. As fine a pianist as the first two and perhaps even a better teacher, the fact that he failed to publish very many of his compositions until toward the end of his life, in part, explains why he was not better known. Said to be a perfectionist, he continually delayed releasing his works until they were polished to his demanding standards. Schumann, among others, thought quite highly of the few works he did publish during the first part of his life. He was the father of Richard Franck. Music His chamber music is generally considered amongst his finest compositions. Of the works with opus numbers, there are 3 string quartets, 2 string quintets for 2 violins, 2 violas and cello, 2 string sextets, 4 piano trios, a piano quintet, 2 sonatas for cello & piano, and 4 sonatas for violin and piano.

It is also known as the Darling River rose, cotton rosebush and Australian cotton. The plant has a life span of about 10 years, growing from 1‚Äì2 m tall and 1‚Äì2 m wide. The colour of the petals can range from pale pink to dark purple to maroon. The five petals are arranged in a whorl and have a dark red centre. They can be seen for most of the year but peak in late winter. They are up to 12 cm in diameter. The leaves are different shades of green, round and strongly scented when crushed. Taxonomy Two varieties are often recognized. * G. sturtianum var. nandewarense (Derera) Fryxell is found only in north-eastern New South Wales (around Narrabri) and the Expedition Range in central Queensland. * G. sturtianum var. sturtianum is more common and is found everywhere else. G. sturtianum var. trilobum (F.Muell.) J.H.Willis is sometimes considered a synonym of Gossypium robinsonii. Ecology The Sturt's desert rose is found in sandy and gravelly soils, along dry creek beds, watercourses, gorges and rocky slopes. Adaptations for this plant include: * There are fewer stomata (the pores that release gas in the leaves) or they are protected. The stomata on the Sturt's desert rose are found on the underside of the leaf. This means reduced water loss. * They have internal water storage. * Deep root systems. They are able to reach the water deep under the ground. Sturt's desert rose contains gossypol, a chemical toxic to animals other than ruminants. The first European to see the flower was Charles Sturt in 1844‚Äì45, after whom it is named. In 1947, James Hamlyn Willis gave the shrub its current botanical name. It is not considered to be at risk in the wild. It is the floral emblem of the Northern Territory and appears in stylised form on the official flag with seven rather than five petals.Sturt's Desert Rose ‚Äì Floral Emblem of the Northern Territory References sturtianum Malvales of Australia Flora of New South Wales Flora of Queensland Flora of the Northern Territory Rosids of Western Australia Rare flora of Australia Charles Sturt ","title":"Gossypium sturtianum"},{"id":"5016732","title":"Ted Baillieu"},{"id":"5016733","text":"Brian Stuart Roberts (28 April 1945 ‚Äì 6 August 2016) was an Australian rules football player who played in the VFL between 1971 and 1975 for the Richmond Football Club (as well as a short stint with South Melbourne in 1975). Roberts was known as \\"The Whale\\" due to his enormous stature and played as a ruckman. He was the only player to have represented all three States, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Early life Roberts was born in the UK, and with his family emigrated to Millicent. In his late teens the 199 cm ruckman was attracting interest from VFL clubs but new South Adelaide coach Neil Kerley, persuaded Roberts to join the Club. SANFL Roberts joined South Adelaide in 1964 and debuted the following year. He learnt the craft of being a ruckman from his teammate and coach Neil Kerley. WAFL Robert spent four seasons with East Fremantle, it included being selected in the Western Australian state team in 1969. VFL enticed him to Victoria where he played from 1971-1975, and was a Premiership player in 1973 and 1974. He also represented Victoria in interstate games.. Roberts was part of the John Pitura trade in which Pitura went to Richmond in exchange for Roberts, Francis Jackson and Graham Teasdale. In the 15 games he played with the Swans he caught the umpire eye and was second in the Brownlow Medal. In the 1976 pre- season he had a disagreement with coach Ian Stewart and walked out on South Melbourne.

History Big Beat was recorded at Mediasound Studios, New York City in August 1976. The album was the group's first album after breaking away from their English backing band. Instead, the Mael Brothers used session musicians and hired former Milk 'N' Cookies bassist, and Roxy Music contributor (Viva!), Sal Maida on bass, Tuff Darts guitarist Jeffrey Salen and Hilly Boy Michaels on drums. The release was their first for Columbia Records in the US. The album employed a much heavier and harder rock sound. Initially, the Mael brothers had returned to work with the early Sparks member Earle Mankey. Together, they recorded the song \\"England\\", a song which bore much in common with the jaunty home-made and unusual sound that the three musicians had made together in the early 1970s. Conversely, Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser's production on the album was slicker and more direct and the resulting album displayed a more \\"American\\" AOR sound. This new \\"West Coast\\" sound was deemed a failure as Sparks felt the results were \\"bereft of personality\\". The final track on the album was a re-recording of \\"I Like Girls\\". The song had been a live favourite from their pre-1974 days. Versions of the song had previously been recorded in 1973 and again in 1974, but both takes were deemed unsatisfactory. The 1973 recording of \\"I Like Girls\\" was later included on the 1991 Rhino Entertainment compilation Profile: The Ultimate Sparks Collection. The lead single, \\"Big Boy\\", and its B-side, \\"Fill-er-up\\", were performed for a cameo appearance in the 1976 disaster film Rollercoaster, after Kiss turned down the role. Release Big Beat was not a success in terms of chart performance and failed to match the performance of the group's previous three albums. It did not chart in the UK or US. \\"Big Boy\\" and \\"I Like Girls\\" were released as singles but neither picked up any significant sales or radio play. Re-release Big Beat was reissued by Island in 1994 and remastered in 2006. The first issue by the Island Masters subsidiary added \\"Tearing The Place Apart\\" and Russell Mael's \\"Gone with the Wind\\", both of which were recorded during the sessions for the Indiscreet album but went unreleased until \\"The Best of Sparks\\" compilation LP in 1978. The '21st Century Edition' added the non-album single \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", its B-side, \\"England\\", and two previously unreleased tracks; \\"Looks Aren't Everything\\" and \\"Intrusion/Confusion\\". The latter is an early recording of \\"Confusion\\". The remastered edition is generally considered sonically superior to the earlier 1994 UK CD and the 1988 Japanese CD but accidentally extends the track \\"Throw Her Away (And Get A New One)\\" by about twenty seconds leading to a cold end, rather than the intended fade out present on every other edition.

The Kazakh Khanate, (, , ) was a successor of the Golden Horde existing from the 15th to 19th century, located roughly on the territory of the present-day Republic of Kazakhstan. At its height, the khanate ruled and expanded its territories to eastern Cumania (modern-day West Kazakhstan), to most of Uzbekistan, Karakalpakstan and the Syr Darya river with military confrontation as far as Astrakhan and Khorasan Province, which are now in Russia and Iran, respectively. The Khanate also engaged in slavery and raids in its neighboring countries of Russia and Central Asia, and was later weakened by a series of Oirat and Dzungar invasions. These resulted in a decline and further disintegration into three J√ºz-es, which gradually lost their sovereignty and were incorporated to the expanding Russian Empire. Its establishment marked the beginning of Kazakh statehood whose 550th anniversary was celebrated in 2015. History In 1227, a proto-Kazakh state was formed within the Golden Horde in the steppe, which was the White Horde. After its separation from the Golden Horde in 1361, the White Horde became an independent state for a certain period of time, sometimes uniting with the Blue Horde to reestablish the Golden Horde. However, after the death of Khan of the Golden Horde, Barak Khan in 1428 the Golden Horde became fragmented, and the White Horde itself was divided into the Uzbek Khanate and the Nogai Horde (descendants of ruling Mongol tribes), the remaining land was divided between Mustafa Khan in the south and Mohammed Khan in the north. The Uzbek Khanate, which dominated most of present-day Kazakhstan, was ruled by Abu'l-Khayr Khan who conspired in killing Barak Khan. Under Abu‚Äôl-Khayr Khan's leadership, the Uzbek Khanate became a corrupt, unstable, and weak state that often dealt internal problems. To make matters worse, the khanate itself was raided by Oirats who pillaged nomadic settlements and major cities where they were looted, damaged, and had civilians massacred. Peace was made in 1457 between the Uzbeks and the Oirats where Abu‚Äôl-Khayr Khan suffered a severe defeat which made him lose reputation among the Uzbeks. =Formation= A 2015 Kazakhstani stamp commemorating the 550th Anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate's establishment The formation of the Kazakh Khanate began in 1459, when several Uzbek tribes of Mongol origin dissatisfied with Abu‚Äôl-Khayr's rule, led by two sons of Barak Khan, Janibek and Kerei, fled the Uzbek Khanate in an event known as the Great Migration. The two brothers led the nomads towards Moghulistan, eventually settling and establishing an independent state. The Khan of Moghulistan united with them, offering them support against their opponents. Around 200,000 nomads joined Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan's movement, which had had a huge power and influence that it sparked fear in Abu'l-Khayr. The new khanate soon became a buffer state between the Moghulistan and the Uzbek Khanate. Although both Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan were considered the founding rulers of the Kazakh Khanate, it was Janibek Khan who initially wielded the most power. Eager to liberate his land from Abu‚Äôl Khayr Khan, Janibek invaded the Uzbek Khanate in 1468. Abu‚Äôl Khayr, in response, launched a campaign against the Kazakhs, but died on his way to Zhetysu. Upon the death of Kerei Khan in 1473/4 Janibek Khan became the sole ruler. The early years of the Kazakh Khanate were marked by struggles for control of the steppe against the Abu'l-Khayr's grandson, Muhammad Shaybani. In 1470, the Kazakhs defeated Shaybani at the city of Iasy (present-day Turkistan), forcing the Uzbeks to retreat south to Samarkand and Bukhara. In 1480 Kerei Khan's son Burunduk became khan. During his reign, the Kazakhs were able to muster an army of 50,000 men and to repeatedly defeat the forces of Muhammad Shaybani along the Syr Darya river. It was during his reign, that the Uzbeks concluded peace with the Kazakhs in 1500, thus giving all the former Uzbek Khanate lands in the north of Syr Darya to the Kazakh Khanate. Expansion of the Kazakh Khanate Greatest extent of Kazakh Khanate Kasym, son of Janibek, became the Khan in 1511. Under his rule, the Kazakh Khanate reached its greatest strength so much that the Nogai Horde, which occupied the territory of modern Western Kazakhstan, became its number one enemy. Kasym successfully captured the Nogai capital Saray-Juk in 1520, pushing the Nogai Horde to the Astrakhan Khanate. Under Kasym Khan, the borders of the Kazakh Khanate expanded, the population reached 1 million people. It was during the reign of Kasym Khan that the Kazakh Khanate gained fame and political weight in the modern Euro-Asian arena. The first major state to establish diplomatic relations with the Kazakh Khanate was the Tsardom of Russia. Since then, the Kazakh Khanate was seen as a new political entity to the Western Europe. The manuscript of \\"Tarikh-Safavi\\", written in Persian by Persian historians, wrote about Kasym Khan, bringing the Dasht-i- Kipchak under his absolute control. The manuscript also describes how a Kazakh squad of eight thousand soldiers helped Sheibani Khan of Bukhara annex the Iranian city of Khorasan. Kasym Khan also instituted the first Kazakh code of laws in 1520, called \\"“ö–∞—Å—ã–º —Ö–∞–Ω–Ω—ã“£ “õ–∞—Å“õ–∞ –∂–æ–ª—ã\\" (transliterated, \\"Qasƒ±m xannƒ±√± qasqa jolƒ±\\" ‚Äî \\"Bright Road of Kasym Khan\\"). Kasym Khan also ratified his alliance with the Timurid leader Babur, particularly after the fall of the Shaybanids, and was thus praised by the Mughals and the populace of Samarqand. =Turmoil and civil war= After the death of Kasym Khan, the Nogaiys restored their status quo by capturing the territory before in the west of the Turgai River. The Kazakh Khanate itself focused on the territory of Zhetysu and South Kazakhstan, where strife was starting to happen. The central territory of Kazakhstan, Sary-Arka, at that time was nominally part of the Kazakh Khanate. The Khanate of Sibir seized the northern regions of Sary-Arka. Under Taiyr Khan, the Oirats invaded and captured eastern parts of Sary Arka in the 1520s. In the early 1530s, a civil war began in the Kazakh Khanate between the grandsons of Janibek Khan. Haqnazar Khan emerged as victories and reunited the khanate under his control. =Haqnazar Khan (1537‚Äì1580)= Under Haqnazar Khan, also known as Haq-Nazar or Khaknazar Khan or Ak Nazar Khan,A History of the Moghuls of Central Asia: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi the Kazakh Khanate faced competition from several directions: the Nogai Horde in the west, the Khanate of Sibir in the north, Moghulistan in the east and the Khanate of Bukhara in the south. Haqnazar Khan began to liberate the occupied Kazakh lands. He returned the northern regions of Sary-Arka to the Kazakh Khanate. Having begun a campaign against the Nogai Horde, Haqnazar reconquered Saraishyk from the Nogai Horde and the surrounding Kazakh territories as well. In the fight against the Khivans, the Kazakhs conquered the Mangyshlak peninsula and successfully repelled the Oirats. Haqnazar began a campaign against Moghulistan with the aim of finally incorporating Zhetysu into the Kazakh Khanate. The campaign ended successfully and resulted in defeat for Moghulistan. However, in the north, there was a threat from the Khanate of Sibir, led by Khan Kuchum. In 1568, the Kazakhs successfully defeated the Nogai Horde at the Emba River and reached Astrakhan, but were repelled by Russian forces.A History of the Moghuls of Central Asi: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi By Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlt, N. Elias, Sir E Denison Ross page 121 =Shygai Khan (1580‚Äì1582)= =Tauekel Khan (1582‚Äì1598)= Tauekel Khan expanded control of the Kazakh Khanate over Tashkent, Fergana, Andijan and Samarkand. In 1598, Kazakh forces approached Bukhara and besieged it for 12 days, but afterwards the Bukharan leader Pir-Muhammad and reinforcements under the command of his brother Baki-Muhammad pushed back the Kazakhs. In that battle, Tauekel Khan was wounded and died during the retreat back to Tashkent. =Esim Khan (1598‚Äì1628)= After the death of Tauekel Khan came Esim Sultan, son of Sheehan Khan. His reign was the time of the next (third) strengthening of the Kazakh Khanate after Kasim Khan and Khak-Nazar Khan. Esim Khan moved the capital of the khanate to Sygnak in Turkestan and suppressed the revolts of the Karakalpaks. There followed a 15-year period of calm between the Kazakh Khanate and the Khanate of Bukhara. Esim Khan established peace with the Khanate of Bukhara and returned control of Samarkand to them. However, Bukhara was still bitter about the loss of Tashkent, which led to additional conflicts. Starting in 1607, the Khanate of Bukhara engaged in several battles and eventually obtained control of Tashkent. Esim Khan united the Kazakh army and began a campaign against the Tashkent Khan Tursun Muhammad and Khan of Bukhara. In 1627, he defeated the enemy. Esim Khan abolished the Tashkent Khanate and the war finally ended. =Salqam-Jangir Khan (1629‚Äì1680)= During Salqam-Jangir Khan's reign, a new and powerful rival of the Kazakhs appeared in the east, known as the Zunghar Khanate. The Zunghar had recently converted to Mahayana Buddhism and their Erdeni Batur believed he could reestablish the 13th-century empire of Genghis Khan. However, much had changed since the days of the Mongol Empire, and the Kazakhs, like the Kirghiz and the Tatars, had almost entirely converted to Islam under the authority of Emir Timur, who also reestablished new centers of power such as Samarqand and Bukhara, which had greatly influenced the founding of the Kazakh Khanate. In 1652, the Zunghar leader Erdeni Batur attempted to eliminate the Kazakh Khanate and its inhabitants; he dispatched more than 50,000 Zunghar warriors against the Kazakh Khanate, which refused to submit to him. The early stages of the Kazakh-Dzungar Wars took place in the Altai Mountains and later battles were fought on the vast steppes. Unable to halt the advance of the Zunghars, the Kazakh Ghazis and their leader Salqam-Jangir Khan's forces were defeated. Unfortunately in the year 1680, Salqam-Jangir Khan died in battle, protecting his people against the Zunghars. =Tauke Khan (1680‚Äì1718)= Tauke Khan was elected as the leader of the Kazakh Khanate immediately after the death of Salqam-Jangir Khan, and he led the battered Kazakh warriors across the steppes to resist the advance of the Zunghars. Unfortunately, the already weakened Kazakhs were once again faced with defeat at Sayram and soon lost many major cities to the Zunghars. Tauke Khan soon sought alliances with the Kirghiz in the southeast who were also facing a Zunghar invasion in their Issyk-Kul Lake region and even the Uyghurs of the Tarim Basin. In 1687, Zunghars besieged Hazrat-e Turkestan and were forced to retreat after the arrival of Subhan Quli Khan. In 1697, Tsewang Rabtan became the leader of the Zunghar Khanate, and he dispatched several of his commanders to subjugate Tauke Khan and many major wars between the Zunghars and the Kazakh Khanate continued into the following years: 1709, 1711‚Äî1712, 1714 and 1718. The Kazakh Khanate had indeed been weakened by the confrontation and nearly one-third of their population had been lost by the ensuing conflict. With Tauke Khan's death in 1718, the Kazakh Khanate splintered into three J√ºz ‚Äî the Great j√ºz, the Middle j√ºz and the Little j√ºz. Each J√ºz had its own Khan from this time onward. Tauke Khan is also known for refining the Kazakh code of laws, and reissuing it under the title \\"–ñ–µ—Ç—ñ –ñ–∞—Ä“ì—ã\\" (transliterated, \\"Jeti Jarƒüi\\"‚Äî\\"Seven Charters\\"). =Ablai Khan (1771‚Äì1781)= Ablai Khan was a khan of the Middle j√ºz or Horde who managed to extend his control over the other two j√ºzes to include all of the Kazakhs. Before he became khan, Ablai participated in Kazakh-Dzungar Wars and proved himself a talented organizer and commander. He led numerous campaigns against the Kokand Khanate and the Kyrgyz. In the latter campaign, his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured Tashkent. During his actual reign, Ablai Khan did his best to keep Kazakhstan as independent as possible from the encroaching Russian Empire and the Chinese Qing dynasty. He employed a multi-vector foreign policy to protect the tribes from Chinese and Dzungar aggressors. He also sheltered the Dzungar Oirat taishas Amursana and Dawachi from attacks by the Khoshut-Orait King of Tibet, Lha-bzang Khan, as the Dzungar Khanate fractured following the death of Galdan Tseren in 1745. However, once Amursana and Dawachi were no longer allies, Ablai Khan took the opportunity to capture herds and territory from the Dzungars. =Kenesary Khan (1841‚Äì1847)= Kenesary was the last Kazakh Khan, and the leader of national liberation movement that resisted the capture of Kazakh lands and segregation policies by the Russian Empire. He was the grandson of Ablai Khan and is largely regarded as the last ruler of the Kazakh Khanate. By the mid 19th century, the Kazakhs fell under the full control of the Russian Empire and were banned from electing their own leader or even given representation in the empire's legislative structures. All fiscal/tax collections were also taken away from local Kazakh representatives and given to Russian administrators. Kenesary Khan fought against the Russian imperial forces until his death in 1847. In 1841, at an all-Kazakh Kurultai, Kenesary was elected as Khan (supreme leader) by all Kazakh representatives. The ceremony of coronation followed all Kazakh traditions. As a freedom fighter and popular as a leading voice against the increasingly aggressive and forceful policies of the Russian Empire, Kenesary was ruthless in his actions and unpredictable as a military strategist. By 1846, however, his resistance movement had lost momentum as some of his rich associates had defected to the Russian Empire, having been bribed and been promised great riches. Betrayed, Kenesary Khan grew increasingly suspicious of the remaining members of the Resistance, possibly further alienating them. In 1847, the Khan of the Kazakhs met his death in Kyrgyz lands during his assault on northern Kyrgyz tribes. He was executed by Ormon Khan, the Kyrgyz khan who was subsequently rewarded by the Russians with a larger estate and an official administrative role. Kenesary Khan's head was cut off and sent to the Russians. Over the last decade, Kenesary Khan has been increasingly regarded as a hero in Kazakh literature and media. Kenesary Khan can be seen on the shore of the river Esil in the capital of Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan. = Disintegration of Khanate and Russian conquest = Approximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh J√ºzes in the early 20th century. Green represents the Junior J√ºz, orange represents the Middle j√ºz and red represents the Senior J√ºz. Gradual decline, disintegration and accession of Kazakh territories into the Russian Empire began in the mid-18th and ended in the second part of the 19th century. By the mid-18th century, as a result of long-lasting armed conflicts with Dzungars and Oirats, the Kazakh Khanate had started to decline and further disintegrate into three J√ºzes, which formerly constituted the Kazakh Khanate in a confederate form. By the mid-19th century some tribes of the Middle j√ºz started war with the Russian occupiers. However, the process was long and filled with many minor and major armed conflicts and resistance. Russian colonial policies/strategies brought military fortresses, many settlements, and externally imposed rules into Kazakh lands. A series of laws were introduced by the Russian Empire, abolishing local indigenous government in the form of Khan rule, instituting segregationist settlement policies, etc., resulting in numerous uprisings against colonial rule. Significant resistance movements were led by leaders such as Isatay Taymanuly (1836‚Äì1837), Makhambet Utemisuly (1836‚Äì1838) and Eset Kotibaruli (1847‚Äì1858). Meanwhile, the Senior J√ºz sided with the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Kokand from the south, and started opposing the expansion of the Russian Empire. Full Russian rule over all Kazakh lands was established in the second half of the 19th century, after the southern towns of Aq-Meshit, Shymkent, Aulie-Ata and others were taken by the Russian Imperial Army. Slavery By the mid 18th century, the Russian Empire had expanded into Siberia, and Russian settlements started to appear along the Volga and Yaik rivers. The Kazakh-Russian relationship at the border regions was tense, which often resulted in mutual raids by Russian Cossacks on Kazakh lands and Kazakhs on Russian settlements. = Kazakh Khanate slave trade on Russian settlement = During the 18th century, raids by Kazakhs on Russia's territory of Orenburg were common; the Kazakhs captured many Russians and sold them as slaves in the Central Asian market. The Volga Germans were also victims of Kazakh raids; they were ethnic Germans living along the River Volga in the region of southeastern European Russia around Saratov. In 1722, they stole cattle, robbed from Russian villages and people trapped in captivity and sold in the slave markets of Central Asia (in 1722 in Bukhara were over 5,000 Russian prisoners). In the middle of the 17th century, 500 Russians were annually sold to Khiva by Kazakhs. In 1730, the Kazakhs' frequent raids into Russian lands were a constant irritant and resulted in the enslavement of many of the Tsar's subjects, who were sold on the Kazakh steppe.Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific by G. Patrick March In 1736, urged on by Kirilov, the Kazakhs of the Lesser and Middle Hordes launched raids into Bashkir lands, killing or capturing many Bashkirs in the Siberian and Nogay districts.Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making Of A Colonial Empire 1500‚Äì1800 by Michael Khodarkovsky In 1743, an order was given by the senate in response to the failure to defend against the Kazakh attack on a Russian settlement, which resulted in 14 Russians killed, 24 wounded. In addition, 96 Cossacks were captured by Kazakhs. In 1755, Nepliuev tried to enlist Kazakh support by ending the reprisal raids and promising that the Kazakhs could keep the Bashkir women and children living among them (a long-standing point of contention between Nepliuev and Khan Nurali of the Junior J√ºz).The Kazakhs by Martha Brill Olcott Thousands of Bashkirs would be massacred or taken captive by Kazakhs over the course of the uprising, whether in an effort to demonstrate loyalty to the Tsarist state, or as a purely opportunistic maneuver.Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making Of A Colonial Empire, 1500‚Äì1800 By Michael Khodarkovsky, pp. 167‚Äì168M. K. Palat, \\"Tsarist Russian Imperialism,\\" Studies in History v. 4 (1988) In the period between 1764 and 1803, according to data collected by the Orenburg Commission, twenty Russian caravans were attacked and plundered. Kazakh raiders attacked even big caravans which were accompanied by numerous guards. In spring 1774, the Russians demanded the Khan return 256 Russians captured by a recent Kazakh raid.Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making Of A Colonial Empire, 1500‚Äì1800 By Michael Khodarkovsky In summer 1774, when Russian troops in the Kazan region were suppressing the rebellion led by the Cossack leader Pugachev, the Kazakhs launched more than 240 raids and captured many Russians and herds along the border of Orenburg. = Russian empire slave trade on Kazakh settlement = In 1737, Empress of Russia Anna Ioannovna issued an order that legalized slave trade in Siberia.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞  –†–∞–±–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–ª—è –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö–∞–º–∏ –≤ –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏ History Of Kazakhstan  Slave Trade in Siberia According to some artifacts, price of a Kazakh male was ten rubles, and Kazakh female was six rubles. There were many accounts of Russian Cossack raids that captured Kazakh families, which were then taken to Petropavlovsk and Omsk, where they were sold to wealthy Russian land owners into serfdom. By the end of 18th century, the lands of Kazakh Junior J√ºz (or Junior Horde) were incorporated into the Russian Empire, and raids by Kazakhs on Russian colonies has gradually declined and stopped. On May 23, 1808, Governor Peter Kaptzevich signed an order that freed all slave or serf Kazakhs of both genders who reached the age of 25. =Abolition of slavery= The Russian administration liberated the slaves of the Kazakhs in 1859. However, isolated abductions of Russians or Ukrainians by Kazakhs for the slave markets of Central Asia continued until the Tsars' conquest of Khiva and Bukhara in the 1860s.Commissar and Mullah: Soviet-Muslim Policy from 1917 To 1924 By Glenn L Roberts At major markets in Bukhara, Samarkand, Karakul, Karshi and Charju, slaves consisted mainly of Iranians and Russians, and some Kalmuks; they were brought there by Turkmen, Kazakh and Kyrgyz.Vol. VI: Towards Contemporary Civilization: From the Mid-Nineteenth Century ... edited by Chahryar Adle, Madhavan K.. Palat, Anara Tabyshalieva A notorious slave market for captured Russian and Persian slaves was centered in the Khanate of Khiva from the 17th to the 19th century. During the first half of the 19th century alone, some one million Persians, as well as an unknown number of Russians, were enslaved and transported to Central Asian khanates.Ichan-Kala, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica When Russian troops took Khiva in 1873 there were 29,300 Persian slaves, captured by Turkoman raiders. According to Josef Wolff (Report of 1843‚Äì1845) the population of the Khanate of Bukhara was 1,200,000, of whom 200,000 were Persian slaves.Report of Josef Wolff 1843‚Äì1845 See also *List of Turkic dynasties and countries *History of Kazakhstan *List of Kazakh khans *List of Sunni Muslim dynasties *Nomad (2006 film) References Turkic dynasties States and territories established in 1456 Former countries in Asia 1731 disestablishments in Asia Historical Turkic states Wars involving Kyrgyzstan Former monarchies of Asia Former monarchies of Europe ","title":"Kazakh Khanate"},{"id":"5016758","text":"Economic methodology is the study of methods, especially the scientific method, in relation to economics, including principles underlying economic reasoning.:Press + button to enlarge small-text links below. ‚Ä¢ Roger E.

In the collection of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid The Assumption of Mary (1735), oil on canvas. In the collection of the Louvre Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (also called Giambattista Piazzetta or Giambattista Valentino Piazzetta) (February 13, 1682 or 1683 ‚Äì April 28, 1754) was an Italian Rococo painter of religious subjects and genre scenes. Biography Piazzetta was born in Venice, the son of a sculptor Giacomo Piazzetta, from whom he had early training in wood carving. Starting in 1697 he studied with the painter Antonio Molinari. By Piazzetta's account, he studied under Giuseppe Maria Crespi while living in Bologna in 1703‚Äì05, although there is no record by Crespi of formal tutelage. Thanks to Crespi, Carlo Cignani's influence reached Piazzetta. Piazzetta did find inspiration in Crespi's art, in which the chiaroscuro of Caravaggio was transformed into an idiom of graceful charm in his pictures of common folk. He was also greatly impressed by the altarpieces created by another Bolognese painter of a half-century earlier, Guercino. Around 1710, he returned to Venice. There he won recognition as a leading artist despite his limited output and his unassuming nature, but he ultimately was less patronized, both in Venice and especially abroad, than two other eminent stars in Venetian late-Baroque/Rococo, Ricci and Tiepolo. yet Piazzeta's range of topics was broader than that of these artists; Tiepolo, for example, never painted genre paintings and restricted himself to grand history and religious altarpieces. Ricci and Tiepolo had a luminous palette and facile ease that allowed them to carpet meters of ceiling with frescoes, although with a superficiality and glamor that is absent from Piazzetta's darker and more intimate depictions. Nonetheless, Tiepolo, who collaborated with Piazzetta on some projects, was greatly influenced by the older artist; in turn, the luminosity and brilliance of Tiepolo's palette influenced Piazzetta in his later years. The Soothsayer, Accademia, Venice Piazzetta created an art of warm, rich color and a mysterious poetry. He often depicted peasantry, even if often in a grand fashion. He was highly original in the intensity of color he sometimes used in his shadows, and in the otherworldly quality he gave to the light which throws part of a composition into relief. The gestures and glances of his protagonists hint at unseen dramas, as in one of his best-known paintings, The Soothsayer (1740, now in Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). He brought similar elusiveness to works of a religious nature, such as the Sotto in su Glory of St. Dominic in the Church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo. Also notable are his many carefully rendered drawings of half-length figures or groups of heads. Usually in charcoal or black chalk with white heightening on gray paper, these are filled with the same spirit that animates his paintings, and were purchased by collectors as independent works. He also produced engravings. In 1750 Piazzetta became the first director of the newly founded Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, and he devoted the last few years of his life to teaching. He was elected a member of the Bolognese Accademia Clementina in 1727. Among the painters in his studio were Domenico Maggiotto, Francesco Dagiu (il Capella), Johann Heinrich Tischbein, Egidio Dall'Oglio, and Antonio Marinetti.Spike, JT. p181 The engraver Marco Pitteri was affiliated with his studio, and engraved many of his works.Carlo Goldoni e Venezia nel secolo XVIII.(1882) Ferdinando Galanti, page 400.

Enterprise portals provide a secure unified access point, often in the form of a web-based user interface, and are designed to aggregate and personalize information through application-specific portlets. One hallmark of enterprise portals is the de-centralized content contribution and content management, which keeps the information always updated. Another distinguishing characteristic is that they cater for customers, vendors and others beyond an organization's boundaries. This contrasts with a corporate portal which is structured for roles within an organization. History The mid-1990s saw the advent of public web portals. These sites provided a key set of features (e.g., news, e-mail, weather, stock quotes, and search) that were often presented in self-contained boxes or portlets. Before long, enterprises of all sizes began to see a need for a similar starting place for their variety of internal repositories and applications, many of which were migrating to Web- based technologies. By the late 1990s, software vendors began to produce prepackaged enterprise portals. These software packages would be toolkits for enterprises to quickly develop and deploy their own customized enterprise portal. The first commercial portal software vendor began to appear in 1998. By 2002, competing product offerings from application server vendors entered the market, who saw portals as an opportunity to stave off the commoditization of application server technology. In 2003, vendors of Java-based enterprise portals produced a standard known as JSR-168. It was to specify an API for interoperability between enterprise portals and portlets. Software vendors began producing JSR-168 compliant portlets that can be deployed onto any JSR-168 compliant enterprise portal. The second iteration of the standard, JSR-286, was final-released on 12 June 2008. Enterprises may choose to develop multiple enterprise portals based on business structure and strategic focus while reusing architectural frameworks, component libraries, or standardized project methods (e.g. B2E, B2C, B2B, B2G, etc.). Employee portal A study conducted in 2006 by Forrester Research, Inc. showed that 46 percent of large companies used a portal referred to as an employee portal. Employee portals can be described as a specific set of enterprise portals and are used to give an interface for employees to personalized information, resources, applications, and e-commerce options. Lean portal In 2009, Gartner introduced the concept of the portal-less portal or the ‚Äúlean portal‚Äù. Lean Portals offer an alternative to the traditional portals available for the last 15 years, which have become very difficult to deploy and maintain. Traditional portals are bloated with features that aren‚Äôt necessarily cost-effective to businesses. This leads to a lot of frustration for companies thinking of investing in a portal as the traditional model forces them to exceed their budgets for features they don't want or need, without being able to deliver the results they wanted. In contrast, a Lean Portal is lightweight and easy to deploy. It's built using modern Web 2.0 technologies, such as AJAX, widgets, representational state transfer (REST) and WOA/SOA approaches. According to Gartner, organizations who opted for a Lean Portal found that it delivered more than 80% of the required functionality within months of launching, without compromising security or advanced integration requirements.http://blog.backbase.com/2805/what-is-a-lean-portal/ Fundamental features An enterprise portal has two main functions; integration and presentation. It must be able to access information from multiple and varied sources and manipulate that information through the portal. Other common features include; * Single sign-on ‚Äî enterprise portals can provide single sign-on capabilities between their users and various other systems. This requires a user to authenticate only once. * Integration ‚Äî the connection of functions and data from multiple systems into new components/portlets/web parts with an integrated navigation between these components. * Federation ‚Äî the integration of content provided by other portals, typically through the use of WSRP or similar technologies. * Customization ‚Äî Users can customize the look and feel of their environment. Customers who are using EIPs can edit and design their own web sites which are full of their own personality and own style; they can also choose the specific content and services they prefer. Also refers to the ability to prioritize most appropriate content based on attributes of the user and metadata of the available content. * Personalization ‚Äî Personalization is more about matching content with the user. Based on a user profile, personalization uses rules to match the \\"services\\", or content, to the specific user. To some degree, you can think of the two like this: customization is in hands of the end user, personalization is not. Of course actual personalization is often based on your role or job function within the portal context. * Access control ‚Äî the ability for portal to limit specific types of content and services users have access to. For example, a company's proprietary information can be entitled for only company employee access. This access rights may be provided by a portal administrator or by a provisioning process. Access control lists manage the mapping between portal content and services over the portal user base. * Enterprise search ‚Äî search enterprise content using enterprise search. * Omni channel enablement ‚Äî present the pages optimally on all channels and devices. * Analytics ‚Äî track and monitor user behaviour on portal pages (such as navigation, clicks, downloads, page exits and such) and generate reports.

The film concerns the troubled life of a teenage boy and his relationship with his parents, including an incestuous relationship with his mother. Plot Joe (Matthew Barry) is the son of famous opera singer Caterina Silveri (Jill Clayburgh). While he believes that Caterina's husband, Douglas Winter (Fred Gwynne), is his biological father, the truth is that Joe was sired by Caterina's former lover, who is now living in Italy and working as a schoolteacher. Joe, moody and spoiled, needs a strong father figure to guide and discipline him, but Douglas is aloof and largely indifferent to parenting. When Joe witnesses the sudden death of Douglas in New York City, it leaves him angry and distraught. Caterina, unwilling to continue residing in Manhattan after Douglas' death, decides to move to Italy with her son. There, Joe begins associating with a dangerous crowd and becomes addicted to heroin. Caterina is heartbroken and hopes to lure her son back to a safer and more healthful lifestyle. She tries in many instances to get closer emotionally to her son hoping that increased contact will prevail over the allure of the drugs. She even contacts his drug dealer to ask for sympathy for her situation. At one point, when Joe is desperate for a fix, his mother masturbates him just to get his mind off drugs temporarily. Seeing no other alternative, she decides to drive to the location they originally lived, where her estranged lover lives with the hope that some sort of fatherly bond will cure her son. Along the way, tensions, some sexual, derail and prolong the trip. Eventually the son is dropped off at the ex's home, but Joe, rather than telling his father that he is his son, says that he is instead a friend of his son, and that his son overdosed on heroin after lifelong turmoil over the absence of his biological father. With some sort of closure achieved for the boy, he returns to his mother, who is preparing for an opera. Embracing, they reaffirm their love for each other, and together the son and his father, who has come to watch the performance, and who now knows Joe's true identity as his child, hear Caterina sing at her very best.

In the London Review of Books, Angela Carter wrote of Jill Clayburgh's performance \\"Jill Clayburgh, seizing by the throat the opportunity of working with a great European director, gives a bravura performance: she is like the life force in person\\". In an entry dated 7 September 1979, Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky wrote in his diary, \\"Saw Bertolucci's La luna. Monstrous, cheap, vulgar rubbish.\\" The movie was briefly banned in Ecuador in 1980 by Abdal√° Bucaram, then police intendent. Bucaram closed all the theatres that showed the film. The movie, however, was broadcast years later on national TV without any repercussions.

The film is based on the short story \\"The Siege\\" by James Lasdun and was supposed to be a 60-minute teleplay until Bertolucci chose to expand it. Plot The film opens in an unnamed African town where Shandurai (Thandie Newton) watches with distress as a school teacher is taken away by police. In Rome, Shandurai is now a housemaid for Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis), an eccentric English pianist and composer, and is also a promising medical student. Kinsky is in love with Shandurai, sending gifts down to her room via the dumbwaiter. One gift is a ring, which leads to an impassioned marriage proposal, which she rejects. Asked how he could make her love him, she shouts, ‚ÄúGet my husband out of jail!‚Äù Only then does Kinsky realize that Shandurai is married. Shandurai notices a tapestry and some figurines she had dusted are now missing. Later, Kinsky begins composing using Shandurai, vacuuming nearby, as his muse. Hearing his piano riffs, she begins to fall in love herself. Kinsky bargains with an African priest over an undisclosed transaction. Coming home from the school, Shandurai looks up to see Kinsky's piano being lowered into a truck; he has sold it. From a letter, she discovers that Kinsky has raised the money to secure her husband's release. He is coming to Rome. The night before his arrival, Shandurai unbuttons the sleeping Kinsky's shirt and curls up with him in bed. Morning arrives with her husband ringing the doorbell below. Shandurai at first doesn't react. Then she gets up, and the film ends with her husband still waiting by the door. Cast *Thandie Newton : Shandurai *David Thewlis : Jason Kinsky *Claudio Santamaria : Agostino *John C. Ojwang : Singer *Massimo De Rossi : Patient *Cyril Nri : Priest  Production  Clare Peploe first suggested adapting James Lasdun's short story \\"The Siege\\", which first appeared in the author's 1985 book The Silver Age (published in the United States as Delirium Eclipse and Other Stories). Bertolucci conceived the project as a one-hour television movie, but expanded it for theatrical release after seeing the rushes projected on a large screen. It nonetheless remained a low-budget film with a small crew and a brisk shooting schedule of 20-25 scenes each day, roughly four times the director's usual pace. By Peploe's and Bertolucci's own account, the project, Bertolucci's first love story, was a particularly apt one for them as a married couple. Peploe served as both screenwriter and, informally, as co-director. The short story differed from the screen play in three significant ways: it was set in London, not Rome; the woman came from Latin America, not Africa; and Kinsky was depicted as fat and much older than he was in the film. Peploe added a character, Shandurai's friend Agostino, as a way to contrast Shandurai's sociability with Kinsky's social awkwardness. In structuring the story, Bertolucci was intent on minimizing the exposition, leaving it to the audience to piece together the relationships between characters. Thewlis too had to guess about his character's origins and motivations: Kinsky's character was conceived as an \\"enigma\\" with no backstory, other than that he had inherited his villa from an aunt. Most of the action was filmed and setThe address is revealed on an envelope sent to Shandurai at 8 vicolo del Bottino in Rome. The villa, despite its location in the wealthy neighborhood of the Spanish Steps, had been abandoned, its owner diseased, her heirs neglecting it. As Bertolucci and Peploe first encountered it, the villa was as depicted at the end of the film, a largely unfurnished home with bare walls and an overgrown garden. But the home met the director's criteria for a spiral staircase, and Bertolucci liked the exterior for its two contrasting facades, one overlooking a narrow street leading to a subway station, the other adjacent to the Spanish Steps. The street scenes in both locations were filmed with a hidden camera, allowing the actors to interact with passersby. Throughout the film, a hand-held camera was used for about half the shots. The African sequences that open the film and appear occasionally thereafter were shot last, over four days in Naivasha, Kenya, with an aerial shot of Lake Turkana, although no specific African country was identified or implied. After viewing the African footage, Bertolucci re-cut the first half-hour of the adjoining sequences set in Rome.  Reception  The aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave Besieged a 64% rating among top critics. Stephen Holden in the New York Times found the film's minimal dialogue a refreshing departure in what he termed the age of television psychobabble. He called the Besieged \\"a purposefully romantic exploration of the nonverbal connections between people that can blossom into love. Filled with rich, glinting images of the world imagined as a confusingly lovely mosaic, the movie has one of the sparsest screenplays of any film released this year. For the feelings that this love story examines are built up more through music than through talking, and through mysterious deeds, carried out by one character and observed by the other, that don't seem to add up. Even after the story ends, a lurking sense of mystery hovers.\\" Roger Ebert's reaction was almost the polar opposite, calling the film \\"a movie about whether two people with nothing in common, who have no meaningful conversations, will have sex--even if that means dismissing everything we have learned about the woman. It is also about whether we will see her breasts. How can a director of such sophistication, in a film of such stylistic grace, tell such a shallow and evasive story? But wait. The film also involves race, politics and culture, and reduces them all to convenient plot points. The social values in this movie would not have been surprising in a film made 40 years ago, but to see them seriously proposed [in 1999] is astonishing.\\"  Influence  Despite dissimilar themes, the 2002 film City of God, which depicts gangs in Rio de Janeiro, drew inspiration from Besieged. Director Fernando Meirelles, who trained as an architect, liked Bertolucci's use of physical space, which served to show Shandurai's early sense of dislocation and eventual sense of place. Bertolucci achieved this by first using long focal length lenses, then shifting to shorter focal lengths as the movie progressed, thereby widening the view and deepening the focus. As a result, said Meirelles, the audience begins \\"to see where the stairs lead, and Bertolucci begins to explain the geography. In almost the last shot, the camera looks out from the roof of the house, which by now you really know; I could draw this house. Then it pans across the metro and the square behind the building and you see the house in the world. The story begins in a labyrinth and at the end you understand everything.\\" Meirelles took the reverse approach with City of God, transitioning from 32mm and 40mm shots of the skyline to longer focal-length shots of alleyways to convey a feeling of entrapment.

Special education In December 2013, the district administration reported that 393 pupils or 14.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 43.5% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, the district administration reported that 440 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 47% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 440 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. The district has offered all day kindergarten since 2005-06. Tunkhannock Area School District has seen an minimal decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Tunkhannock School District received a $1,679,655 supplement for special education services in 2010.

This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, ASD received an increase to $1,702,628 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 53 or 1.7% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.

These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, Tunkhannock Area School District applied for and received $461,589 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten.

Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11, Tunkhannock Area School District received $67,184. Other grants The Tunkhannock Area School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell); 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants (discontinued effective with 2011-12 budget) nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= Tunkhannock Area School District received an extra $3,569,062 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.

Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Tunkhannock Area School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2014-15 were set by the Tunkhannock Area School Board at 72.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 - 73.00 mills. *2012-13 - 70.10 mills *2011-12 - 66.10 mills. *2010-11 - 64.10 mills *2009-10 - 61.40 mills. *2008-09 - 61.4000 mills. *2007-08 - 59.9000 mills. *2006-07 - 59.9000 mills. *2005-06 - 57.9000 mills The average yearly property tax paid by Wyoming County residents amounts to about 3.73% of their yearly income. Wyoming County ranked 304th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty five percent of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Wyoming County, the highest tax relief went to Lackawanna Trail School District which was set at $222.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2012. The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, goes to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, February 23, 2010 In Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, the Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Extracurriculars Tunkhannock Area School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program.

Predominantly a back pocket or half-back flanker, Keane later showed his versatility by frequently playing as a ruck-rover. He was generally regarded as one of the most underrated players in the VFL, and did not poll a Brownlow Medal vote in his first ten seasons. Although Keane was in Richmond‚Äôs country zone, he mistakenly trained with Melbourne before joining the Tigers. Despite some trouble settling in, Keane became a vital member of the Tigers‚Äô 1973 premiership side and his solid defensive work was vital for the club as it declined in the period following the resignation of Tom Hafey at the end of the 1976 season. In 1980, Keane moved from defence to fill an on-ball position made vacant by Kevin Bartlett‚Äôs permanent move to the forward line and his drive from this position was a valuable part of perhaps the most potent attacking team in League history with over 3,000 points scored. In the Grand Final Keane had 27 possessions and kicked two fine goals, but his 1981 season was wiped out by a serious knee injury requiring a reconstruction.The Age, 9 May 1981 Nonetheless, back in defence, Keane was effective as ever in 1982, and he was still playing very well when he was approached by SANFL club Sturt as a playing coach to replace John Halbert. Keane coached the Double Blues for four consecutive seasons (retiring as a player after 1985) before the committee controversially sacked himLysikatos; True blue; pp. 302-303 after a season in which he had taken the club from ninth to fifth,Lysikatos; True blue; p. 328 feeling he had not done enough to sustain the traditions the club had developed under Jack Oatey. Most historians argue that Sturt did not recover from Keane‚Äôs sacking until under Phil Carman following an 0-22 season in 1995. Keane then served as an assistant to his old teammate Kevin Sheedy at Essendon for a few of years during the early 1990s, before taking the reins at TAC Cup side the Western Jets. At the Jets, Keane played a key role in the development of such players as Brad JohnsonSee Johnson, Brad and Weston, James; Johnno: Bulldog Through & Through; before being appointed to coach a Williamstown club that had finished with a winless record in the same season Sturt did in the SANFL. Keane rebuilt the club, if not to the same extent his former employers were by Carman, and coached Caulfield Grammarians Football Club in 2003 and 2004 before returning to assist Sheedy in his last days at Essendon.

Many defensive structures have been set up here throughout history, dating from the Warring States period when a checkpoint is set up here. The pass became fortified in the Tang Dynasty. The name Hulao, or \\"Tiger Cage\\", came to be when King Mu of Zhou trapped a tiger in this place. It also had the name of Wulao Pass () at one time in the Tang Dynasty, due to a naming taboo ‚Äî the grandfather of Emperor Gaozu of Tang was named Li Hu. The pass also held the name Sishui Pass () from time to time, which brought much confusion whether Hulao Pass and Sishui Pass are referring to the same pass. Luo Guanzhong, the author of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, apparently also got confused over the names and treated Sishui Pass and Hulao Pass as two places when they should be one. Numerous battles were said to have fought here. Among the most famous is the Battle of Hulao Pass, where a coalition of dissidents led by Yuan Shao clashed with Dong Zhuo's elite armies in the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Also here, in the Battle of Hulao of 621, Li Shimin defeated Dou Jiande and forced Wang Shichong to surrender, laying the foundation to the Tang Dynasty.

There were 156 students in the Class of 2006. The district's class of 2010 had 139 students. Enrollment is projected to decline to 1,500 students by 2020. In 2008, Westmont Hilltop School District administrative costs were $717.97 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school districts in Pennsylvania in 2007. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. Pennsylvania had 2,361 public school districts in 1959. The state compelled mergers reducing the number to 505 by 1980. Mergers slowed through the 1980s after a 1981 court order desegregated and combined the Edgewood, General Braddock, Swissvale, Churchill and Turtle Creek districts into the Woodland Hills district. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any school buildings. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. From 2000 through 2010, rural Pennsylvania public school district enrollment decreased by 8 percent. In 2010, there were 726,417 children in rural Pennsylvania, or 21 percent of the total rural population. From 2000 to 2010, the number of children in rural counties decreased 7 percent. The decline in the number of children impacted most rural counties with 42 of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties experiencing a decline. Cameron County, Elk County and Sullivan County experienced the greatest declines, with a decrease of more than 21 percent in all three counties. Cambria County's live birth rate was 1,897 births in 1990. Cambria County's live birth rate in 2000 was 1,567 births, while in 2011 it had declined to 1,374 babies.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Age County Reports 1990 and 2011, 2011 Over the past 50 years (1960 to 2010), rural Pennsylvania saw a steady decline in both the number and proportion of residents under 18 years old. In 1960, 1.06 million rural residents, or 35 percent of the rural population, were children. Pennsylvania's birth rate has been declining for two decades. According to data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in 1990, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's birth rate was 171,053.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 1990 In 2000, Pennsylvania's birth rate was 145,874.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2000 Finally in 2011, the State's birth rate declined further to 142,021.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2013 From 2000 to 2009, the number of babies born in rural counties declined 5 percent.Center for Rural Pennsylvania, Number of Children Decreasing, Number of Seniors Increasing in Rural Pennsylvania, July 2011 Special education In December 2013, the district administration reported that 123 pupils or 7.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 40% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 159 pupils or 9.1% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding was in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. The School District received a $779,961 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014-2015 school year, Westmont Hilltop School District received an increase to $789,614 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Gifted education= The Westmont Hilltop School District Administration reported that 63 or 3.63% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Westmont Hilltop School District was $60,654 a yearPDE, Investing in Pennsylvania Students, 2013 The district employed 159 teachers with a top salary of $111,475. Wetmont Hilltop School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, the district reported employing 130 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $62,473 and a top salary of 108,228. The teacher's work day was 7.5 hours, with 184 days in the contract year. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.PA Delaware County Times, Teachers need to know enough is enough, April 20, 2010. Administration spending Westmont Hilltop School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $717.97 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. According to PSBA, the median Pennsylvania public school superintendent salary rose to over $130,000 in 2011. Per-pupil spending In 2008, the Westmont Hilltop School District administration reported that per-pupil spending was $9,687 which ranked 489th among Pennsylvania's then 501 public school districts. In 2010, the district's per-pupil spending had increased to $11,951.34 In 2013, the per-pupil spending was reported as $13,802.17. In 2011, Pennsylvania's per-pupil spending was $13,467, ranking 6th in the United States.US Census Bureau, States Ranked According to Per Pupil Public Elementary-Secondary School System Finance Amounts: Fiscal Year 2011, May 2013 In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was reported as $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000-01. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was reported as $12,759. Among the fifty states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. Pennsylvania's total revenue per pupil rose to $16,186 ranking 9th in the nation in 2011. Reserves In 2008, the Westmont Hilltop School District reported a balance of $527,802 in its unreserved- designated reserve funds. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $1,691,500. In 2010, Westmont Hilltop School District Administration reported an increase to $2,120,294 in the unreserved- undesignated fund balance. The district also reported $2,363,067 in its unreserved-designated fund in 2010. In 2013 the district reported $3,361,329.00, in its reserve funds. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $3,459,084. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion. By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. Audit In November 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the School Board and the district's administration. The district was cited for having a teacher working outside their certification. District is subjected to a subsidy forfeiture. The district was also audited in 2010 and was found compliant with state regulations. Tuition Students who live in the Westmont HIlltop School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Westmont Hilltop School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2013 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,693.92, Middle and High School - $9,534.31. Westmont HIlltop School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 0.5%;, a Public Utility Tax; a per capita tax $5 per year; a property tax; a real estate transfer tax 0.5%; coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a small amount, generally 10% of its budget from the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In 2012 the districts reported $20,000 in interest earnings. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Westmont Hilltop School District receives 30.6% of its annual revenue from the state. This exceeds the goal of the state providing 50% of district funding. For the 2014-15 school year, Westmont Hilltop School District received $3,832,863 in State Basic Education funding. The district received $132,136 in the new Ready To Learn Block grant. The State's enacted Education Budget includes $5,526,129,000 for the 2014-2015 Basic Education Funding. The Education budget also includes Accountability Block Grant funding at $100 million and $241 million in new Ready to Learn funding for public schools that focus on student achievement and academic success. The State is paying $500.8 million to Social Security on the school employees behalf and another $1.16 billion to the state teachers pension system (PSERS). In total, Pennsylvania's Education budget for K-12 public schools is $10 billion. This was a $305 million increase over 2013-2014 state spending and the greatest amount ever allotted by the Commonwealth for its public schools.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-15 Enacted Education Budget Fast Facts, July 14, 2014 In the 2013-2014 school year, the Westmont Hilltop School District received a 2.5% increase or $3,836,242 in Pennsylvania state Basic Education Funding. This is $92,438 more than its 2012-13 state BEF to the district. Additionally, Westmont Hilltop School District received $48,681 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement and level funding for special education services. Among the public school districts in Cambria County, Westmont Hilltop School District received the highest percentage increase in BEF at 2.5%. The district had the option of applying for several other state and federal grants to increase revenues. The Commonwealth's budget increased Basic Education Funding statewide by $123 million to over $5.5 billion.

A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2014-15 - 86.2000 mills. *2013-14 - 86.2000 mills. *2012-13 - 86.2000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 86.2000 mills. *2010-11 - 83.9000 mills. *2009-10 - 81.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 77.1700 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 73.2200 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 70.3400 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 67.2500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Cambria County residents amounts to about 2.4% of their yearly income. Cambria County ranked 1048th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2015 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2014, 2015 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Pennsylvania's 2011 tax burden of 10.35% ranked 10th highest out of 50 states. The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania‚Äôs Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow the districts' voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either: 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index.

Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty five percent (35%) of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Cambria County, the highest tax relief went to Ferndale Area School District which was set at $219.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, goes to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The tax relief was started by Governor Edward G. Rendell with passage of the state gaming law in 2004. Rendell promised taxpayers substantial property tax relief from legalized gambling at casinos and horse racing tracks. In Cambria County, 54% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was among the lowest county-wide participation rates in Pennsylvania. Some Westmont Hilltop School District residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older, can qualify for the state's Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. Residents must apply annually to receive up to $650. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Wellness policy Westmont Hilltop School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Westmont Hilltop School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch.

Its highest peak Cvijiƒáev vrh, named after geologist and biologist Jovan Cvijiƒá, has an elevation of 1,132 meters above sea level. It has several other peaks over 1000 m: Srednji ≈†turac, Mali ≈†turac, Molitve, Paljevine and Marijanac. The name translates literally to mine, as the mountain is rich in mining resources. Name The word of the mountain Serbian Cyrillic: –†—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫ literally means a mine in Serbo-Croatian language. The name itself is probably a testament to a mining activity associated with this mountain throughout several millennia. History The archaeological site of Belovode on the Rudnik mountain in Serbia contains the world's oldest securely dated evidence of copper smelting at high temperature, from 5,000 BCE. A thousand years later, a farming population (I haplogroup) from the Taurus Mountains arrived to this location. The first outpost in Europe was in the 6004-5960 B.C. in the pass between the Danube and the Carpathians; before, the dominant haplogroup in Europe was the G, now in Georgia, mainly with R1b together. Before the arrival of the Romans, the area was inhabited by the Illyrians, followed by the Celts. The first Serbian dinar with Cyrillic inscription, the dinar of Stefan Dragutin of Serbia, was minted at Rudnik. The Saxons and the people of Dubrovnik had colonies in this region in the 14th century. After 1441, Runik gained special importance when the Ottoman Empire conquered Novo Brdo. ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, the revered Serbian despot, had a mint and summer villa here. The rich mineral resources of the mountain (silver, lead and copper) were an important source of wealth to the Serbian rulers. Besides mining, Rudnik was a settlement with developed handicrafts and a thriving trading post with a cosmopolitan population that influenced the whole of Serbia. Mining In connection with the mining process, an artificial lake was formed in the village of Majdan. In 1953 a tailings dam was built in order to accumulate the byproducts. It separates the flotation reservoir from the valley of the Despotovica river, which flows through the town of Gornji Milanovac ( downstream), and from the Ibar Highway. The dam was built on the small stream of Rudniƒçki potok. The lake is not open for public use.Flotation lake on Rudnik, Penzin, 18 December 2013 It is long, wide and covers an area of . The tailings is a result of 264,000 tons of ore which is being treated yearly in the mine: lead, zinc, copper and traces of silver. Considering the burst of the dam as a potential catastrophe, since the tailings would flood Gornji Milanovac, the dam has been upgraded in time. It is fit to survive the earthquake of the 9.0 magnitude on Richter scale. In 2013 devices for early notification in case of a quake were installed and are directly connected to the state seismology institute. During the major 2014 Southeast Europe floods, the lake accumulated additional of water, which would otherwise flood the town. The flood wave from the slopes of the Rudnik was slowed and effectively prolonged in 5 days instead of sweeping at once. The treating apparatus allows for the clean water to be let through the dam into the Despotovica river. Several projects are being developed. In 2018 a new system for evacuation of the water in case of emergency will be installed, while by 2023 a new plant will be built which will further treat the wastewaters. By 2017, the lead and zinc mine \\"Rudnik\\" became one of the most successful mining companies in Serbia. notable for exporting 100% of its products. In December 2017 it was announced that the largest ore body in the history of the mine was discovered. With 400.000 tons of the colored metals ore, it will be enough for the exploitation of 5 years and should begin in 2019. It is a high quality ore, with the content of 6-10% of zinc, lead and silver. Nature The hill is covered in deciduous forest mainly consisting of beech trees. Other hills Ostrvica Ostrvica or Ostrovica hill (758 m, ) is located on the northwest of the Rudnik massif, sharply rising above the surrounding terrain. It is of volcanic origin and made of magmatic rocks, chiefly andesite, suitable for masonry and road building. On the top of the hill lie the remains of a fortified city, whose exact origins are unknown. It was first mentioned in the fifth century CE, but is presumed to originate from the antic period. It was refortified by Serbian Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá around 1430, who used it as a summer retreat with his family. The popular legend attributed the city building to his wife Eirene Kantakouzene, already infamous for her role in building of the Smederevo Fortress, and it is also referred to as Jerinin grad (Eirene's city).

Members may be either Hindu or Muslim; Muslim Teli are called Roshandaar or Teli Malik.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII edited by A Hasan & J C DasThe Jewish community of Maharashtra (called Bene Israel) was also known to be a sub-group in the Teli caste called Shanivar Teli meaning Saturday oil pressers for their Jewish custom of abstention from work on Shabbat. History In the Early Medieval period in some parts of south India, Teli community used to work on their own oil presses to produce oil to be supplied to the temples. The emergence of \\"Temple towns\\" in various parts of south India was instrumental in the improvement of social status of some of the communities who were associated with the supply of essential items for cultural activities. The communities like Malakar (garland makers), and Telikars (oil pressers) thus became important for the functioning of such towns. Some of them even became prosperous enough to make donations to the temples. In the first decade of 20th century, upward mobilisation became the feature of Indian society when lower castes tried to move up in the socio- economic ladder by assuming the names and practices of \\"upper castes\\".Professor M.N. Srinivas notes the attempts of Teli community to claim different surnames in different censuses in a bid to improve their position in Varna system and Caste hierarchy. In 1911, the Teli community adopted the surname, Rathore and started calling themselves Rathore Teli; while in 1931 they claimed themselves to be Rathore-Vaishya. According to Shankaragouda Hanamantagouda Patil, this was done in order to climb the social ladder. Such practices were common amongst the lower castes in India.The Arya Samaj movement also attempted to improve the status of lower castes as in the case of Telis, Shri Satyavrat Sharma Dwivedi an Arya Samajist from Farrukhabad published a magazine \\"Telivarna Prakash\\" to prove the Teli caste to be of Vaishya varna. Despite of the later attempts to claim higher status Teli were initially considered as Shudra and were thought to be lower in status. According to Anand Yang, the Telis worked with beast of burden in the oil pressers and for the purpose of obtaining the desired results from the animals, they were often blinded. This made them ritually impure but later many of them as Yang notes took up the occupation of trading and branched off as Bania in order to conceal their impure origin. Subdivisions The Bene Israel community which inhabit some of the places in Maharashtra are also called as Shanivar Teli and are considered to be a subgroup of Teli community due to their association with the oil trade.This community though is not divided on the basis of caste but segregated on the basis of having marital relationship with people of other caste.These two sub-groups, one having relations in other castes and another with no such relations refrain from mixing with each other.The Telis of Bengal share their social position with trader communities like Suvarnabanik, Gandhabanik, Saha all of which are classified as Vaishya or Baniya.Further, the Ghanchi community of Gujarat have been described as a \\"counterpart\\" of the Telis.  Politics  =Bihar= In the post Mandal phase the growing differences between upper castes and OBC due to tussle between the two groups over political power culminated into replacement of upper castes by the OBCs in the political circle. The Telis along with Yadav, Kurmi, Koeri and Bania took over the erstwhile political elites namely Brahmin, Bhumihar, Rajput and Kayastha.The OBCs in Bihar are divided into upper and lower OBC on the basis of socio-economic mobility and political representation. Whilst the trio of Yadav, Kurmi and Koeri are considered as upper OBC, Teli along with Kanu, Dhanuk, Kahar, Kumhar and others are classified as lower OBC. In the late 2000s, some among the Teli community of Bihar, organised by the Teli Sena, were engaging in vote bank politics as they sought to achieve categorisation as a Most Backward Class in the state. Initially, they had failed to achieve this repositioning in India's official positive discrimination scheme, with opposition coming from other groups who considered the Teli to be too populous and socio-economically influential to justify the change. In April 2015, Bihar chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced a decision to include the Teli caste in the list of Extremely Backward Class in Bihar. =Jharkhand= In 2018 the Bharatiya Janata Party led government in Jharkhand tried to include castes like Teli and Kurmi in the category of Scheduled Tribes, which was welcomed by protests from tribals of Jharkhand under the banner of Jai Adivasi Yuvashakti (JAY) a local organisation which organised \\"Adivasi Akrosh Maharally\\", a gathering of all principal tribal groups of the state to protest against the same.

It is a member of the family Cottidae, a type of sculpin. It is also known as the miller's thumb, freshwater sculpin, and common bullhead. The European bullhead is a small demersal fish that lives both in cold, clear, fast-flowing small streams and in middle-sized rivers. It also occurs on gravelly shores of cold lakes. Further, it thrives in diluted brackish water of the Northern Baltic Sea. Description European bullhead on stamp The bullhead has a large broad head and tapering body, large fins and a rounded tail. The eyes are located near the top of the head. To the distinction from the other freshwater sculpin species found in Northern Europe, it can be told from the alpine bullhead Cottus poecilopus by the fact that the rays of its pelvic fins are of similar lengths while the first and last rays are longer in the alpine bullhead. It can be distinguished from the fourhorn sculpin by the fact that the dorsal and anal fins terminate close to the tail giving a short caudal peduncle. When it rests on the bottom, the pectoral fins flare out resembling wings. The bullhead is usually about long and is light brown mottled with darker colour. The pelvic fins are colourless and lack the stripes of the alpine bullhead. Biology Food items eaten by the bullhead include benthic insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates. It breeds in the spring. The male digs a shallow hollow in which batches of eggs are deposited by several females. He then guards the nest for the month or so that it takes for the eggs to hatch. Systematics and distribution Total distribution of the Cottus gobio complex The European bullhead, as treated above, is widespread over most of the subcontinent and in England, but absent from the southern peninsulae and from Northern Scandinavia. It is not a single uniform taxon, however, but composed of morphologically and genetically differentiated subunits. Some of those have been distinguished already long time ago as separate subspecies or species with their own names, while in practice they have still mostly been treated under the concept of Cottus gobio. In 2005, Freyhof et al. suggested subdivision of the European Cottus gobio into fourteen distinct species, of which six had been described earlier and eight were newly described and named.J√∂rg Freyhof, Maurice Kottelat, Arne Nolte (2005) Taxonomic diversity of European Cottus with description of eight new species (Teleostei: Cottidae) Ichthyol.

Early life Born in Burwood, New South Wales (a suburb of Sydney) as one of six children of Alec Dennis, a policeman who acted as a police prosecutor, Clare and her siblings were taught to swim by their father, himself an amateur swimmer, after their family relocated from Burwood to Clovelly Beach. Dennis' sister Thora developed quickly into a competent competitive swimmer, and joined the Sydney Ladies' Swimming Club and was later selected for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, but was prevented from going on the grounds of being too young to travel alone overseas. Dennis pleaded with her father to let her join, which he agreed to on the condition that she first swim the 33 yards (approximately 30 metres) across Clovelly Bay. She managed this by pushing off the bottom of the ocean, disguising this with extravagant stroking. Her first lesson and race at the club ended in her having to be fished out of the pool after her endurance failed and the bottom of the pool was too deep to push off. Dennis attended Randwick Primary School, where she acquired a reputation for being interested in sport rather than schoolwork. She spent large amounts of time playing cricket against the male students. Dennis initially swam as a freestyler, but converted to breaststroke at the age of 13. At her first New South Wales Championships in 1930, held at the Ramsgate Baths, she was disqualified after drifting out of her unmarked lane. The freestyle race was held four times due to multiple lane crossing. It was later discovered that the taps regulating the water flow had been accidentally left on. This created a current strong enough to push the swimmers towards one another. In the breaststroke event, held later, she set a State record, but was disqualified for a one-handed touch. Swimming career In 1931 she won her first state and national title in the 220-yard breaststroke. She repeated this in 1933, 1934 and 1935, with the championships not being held in 1932, remaining unbeaten until her retirement in 1936. After her 1931 victory, her father died from a leaking heart valve. Dennis considered retiring, but her mother convinced her to continue. In January 1932, Dennis broke the 110-yard Australian record and then the 200-metre world record, gaining automatic selection for the Olympic team at the age of 15. Due to financial difficulties caused by the Great Depression, Dennis managed to attend the Olympics only after assistance was rendered by the Police Department for travel and uniform costs. On arrival, Dennis was hit by illness and then contracted a toe infection after gashing it on the starting platform. Her chances took a boost when Lisa Rocke, who had claimed her 200 m breaststroke world record, was not sent to represent Germany. Dennis won her heat of the 200-metre breaststroke, setting an Olympic record. She narrowly escaped disqualification when a protest was lodged against her \\"inappropriate\\" costume on the grounds that it exposed too much of her shoulder blade. Dennis changed her swimming style after the heats on the advice of American swimmer Buster Crabbe, who recommended she swim three strokes underwater after her starting dive before surfacing. Using her new technique, she touched in first place at every turn to claim the gold medal, 0.1 of a second faster than Japan's Hideko Maehata, improving on her previous Olympic record. In 1933, Dennis beat her own Australian 220-yard breaststroke record, and in 1934 she captured gold in the 220-yard breaststroke at the 1934 British Empire Games in London. Though she successfully defended her national title in 1935, she was controversially omitted from the team for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and subsequently retired. Golding and Dennis in 1934  After swimming  Dennis met her future husband, George Golding, an Australian track and field athlete at the Olympics. He won gold at the 1930 British Empire Games and was the Australian 440-yard champion in 1934 and the 440-yard hurdles champion in 1932 and 1934. They were married in 1941. Dennis became a swimming coach and hairdresser, owning two salons. She died in 1971 in Manly, New South Wales at the age of 55 from cancer, and was posthumously inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1982.International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, Clare Dennis (AUS).

Recent scholarship consensus indicates that the statue is probably from Silla because of drapery fold studies although some believe that this was a Baekje piece. It is 93.5 centimeters tall or approximately 3 feet and one inch in height, and is therefore especially valuable because few large bronzes survive from that period.

Description A side profile of the sculpture The statue is seated on a round pedestal and posed with its right leg crossed over its left knee while the figure's right hand is touching its cheek and the left hand rests on the crossed leg. This contemplative pose was a popular subject of Buddhist art and the archetype spread from India to China and Korea and then to Japan. Other common similarities of the Maitreya statues of this style is the use of drapery on the seat on which the figure sits. Chinese depictions of the drapery that the Maitreya sits on are highly stylized, stiff, and formalized. However, the artists' depiction of the drapery on the Korean statue is flowing and realistic which gives the statue an illusion of animation. The slender, almost lithe body of the figure suggests Baekje influences. However, the bridgeline and sharp nose of the figure suggests a Silla provenance. Although the actual provenance of the statue is still unknown, the current art historian consensus is that the statue is from a Sillan caster because of the Silla-style of the drapery depicted over the pedestal. That the figure is perfectly proportional and the sensuality of the draping both suggest that the sculptor based this work on a real model. Other figures of the Maitreya-type are often distorted or stylized to fit the artistic tradition the sculptor was working from. The harmony between the lower half and upper half of the statue is example of the attention to detail and realistic proportionality. The figure has a tri-fold crown on its head which is very simple, unlike other works of this genre which have highly elaborate headdresses. The halo of the figure has long since been lost although a part of the halo construct remains attached to the figure. The statue is also bare-chested which adds to the simplicity of the figure. The figure gives a sense of calm meditation but still conveys a sense of moving dynamism because of its posture and the artistic styling of the bronze. Similar works Miroku bosatsu at the Koryu- ji Temple of Kyoto The Miroku bosatsu at the Koryu-ji Temple of Kyoto, which is one of the Japanese National Treasures, is the twin of the statue and is almost certainly of Korean origin. Holland Cotter. \\"Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret.\\" The New York Times. April 6, 2003. . The Miroku is carved from red pine and may be the statue the Nihon Shoki mentions that a King of Silla sent to the Yamato court. The statues both share the elegant contemplative pose, highly proportional figures, realistic draperies, slim bodies, and plain tri-fold crowns. The statue is often compared to Auguste Rodin's work, The Thinker because of its contemplative pose.

The cemetery stands atop a hillside overlooking the city and contains some very impressive Victorian funerary monuments in a variety of styles. It is a notable example of a Victorian cemetery where a number of rich and prominent local residents have been buried, notably mill owners and former mayors. Undercliffe Cemetery is grade II* listed by English Heritage in their Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.  History  In the early 1800s Bradford's textile industry underwent rapid growth and with it Bradford's population, consequently there was pressure on housing then on burial ground space and this eventually became a health hazard. As a result, many of the existing cemeteries were closed by an Order in Council. Partly in response to this situation the 'Bradford Cemetery Company' was set up and provisionally registered in 1849. Membership of the company included local notables Henry Brown, Robert Milligan, William Rand, Edward Ripley and Titus Salt. The land used for the cemetery had previously been agricultural land with a farmhouse on part of the Undercliffe Estate of the Hustler family. The plot was purchased in 1851 by John Horsfall with ¬£3,400 of monies from the Bradford Cemetery Company and the Bradford Cemetery Company properly founded in 1852. The cemetery was designed and laid out over the years 1851‚Äì1854 by park and cemetery designer William Gay (1814‚Äì1893) and architect John Dale for the sum of ¬£12,000 for landscaping, planting and building involving the building in 1854 of two chapels on the main promenade. The Anglican western section of the cemetery was consecrated by the Bishop of Ripon on 1 August 1854 and on the 21st the cemetery was opened. William Gay was appointed the first registrar for the cemetery and Joseph Smith (1800‚Äì1858) the first land agent. With its laid out gardens, lawns, shrubbery and few graves the cemetery became popular for promenading in an age before Bradford had its first public park. In 1876 the planned westward extension of the cemetery did not happen and the land instead went for housing. The two chapels built on the main promenade in the historic core of the cemetery were replaced in 1878 by two larger chapels designed by Lockwood and Mawson. = Recent history = The lodge at the southern entrance Following a decline in the number of burials the Undercliffe Cemetery Company was liquidated in 1977. Bradford Council at that stage could not justify the cost of adopting the cemetery. In 1980 the site was sold to a property developer then the chapels were demolished along with the lodges at the north and south entrances and some kerbstones were removed. It emerged that the registration of the cemetery to the property developer had been refused by the Land Registry under a clause that prohibits the sale of consecrated ground that has been used for burial. In 1984 after a local campaign, Bradford Council applied to compulsorily purchase the cemetery and the area was made a conservation area. A ¬£360,000 three year Community Programme Scheme funded by the Manpower Services Commission cleared up the results of previous years' neglect and a lodge from Bowling Cemetery, Bradford was moved to the site and rebuilt at the southern entrance. In 1987 the management of the cemetery was given over to 'The Undercliffe Cemetery Charity' and in 1988 English Heritage added the cemetery to its Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest as grade II listed and upgraded it to II star the next year.  Layout  The historic core The cemetery is at a height of 210 m above sea level with an area of 26 acres (10 hectares) accommodating some 124,000 burials and about 23,000 marked graves. A major feature of the cemetery is the long east west promenade with the western end having excellent views over Bradford. Also at the western end is a small bandstand. At the historic core the land to the north of the promenade is terraced down to the northern entrance on Otley Road. Both entrances have a car park but only the south entrance on Undercliffe Lane has a lodge used for administration. Quaker gravestones Most of the western half of the site is consecrated for Anglican burials while the eastern half is set aside for non- conformist burials such as Baptist, Methodist, and Quaker. The Quaker graves are characterised by their identical horizontal ground level memorial stones. The northern area of the cemetery was set aside for the un-baptised and those who had been excommunicated or committed suicide. Communal graves known as 'company plots' are to be found on the southern side of the site where up to thirty coffins at a time were interred in one grave.  Memorials  The cemetery contains the graves and memorials of the rich and famous, local industrialists, ex-mayors, businessmen, professionals, mill workers and their relatives. = Listed buildings = Six of the memorials in the cemetery have listed building status and all are in good condition except for the Swithin Anderton monument. * Joseph Smith Obelisk (mid/late 19th century), a prominent 30 ft tall grey granite obelisk to Joseph Smith, surveyor, businessman and land agent to the cemetery company. * Mawson Monument (1889), a monument to William Mawson, architect partner of Henry Lockwood ‚Äì a granite obelisk on a pedestal. * Swithin Anderton Monument (1860), a Scott Monument inspired memorial to Swithin Anderton, JP and family, signed I S L Thornton. * Illingworth Mausoleum (~1860), a grey granite mausoleum of the Illingworth family, owners of Whetley Mills on Thornton Road, in the style of an Egyptian mastaba. * Behrens Monument (1889), a monument in renaissance style to Sir Jacob Behrens and family. * Miles Moulson Monument (~1856) a monumental sculpture to the Moulson family of Horton by John Throp, sculptor. Miles Moulson himself was a monumental mason. = Other notable burials = * Sir Anthony Gadie (1868‚Äì1948) Military officer, Bradford Mayor and MP. * William Gay (1814‚Äì1893) Landscape gardener, surveyor and first registrar of Undercliffe Cemetery. * Stafford Heginbotham (1933‚Äì1995) Business owner and former Chairman of Bradford City A.F.C. * Sir Isaac Holden, bart (1807‚Äì1897) inventor and manufacturer. * Robert Milligan (1786‚Äì1862) Bradford's first mayor and Liberal MP. * Sir Henry Mitchell (1824‚Äì1898) Founder of the Technical School, Mayor and first Freeman of the city. * Sir Henry Ripley, bart. (1813‚Äì1882) Industrialist and MP. * Alfred Angas Scott (1875‚Äì1923) Motorcycle designer, inventor and founder of The Scott Motorcycle Company. = War Memorial = War memorial (Cross of Sacrifice) Close to the car park at the southern entrance onto Undercliffe Lane is a war memorial in the form of Cross of Sacrifice to those who died in the First and Second World Wars. Behind the Cross of Sacrifice a low kerb memorial lists Commonwealth service personnel buried in the cemetery whose graves could not be marked by headstones. In all 135 Commonwealth service personnel ‚Äì 92 from the First and 43 from the Second World War are buried here. Many of the former were burials from the Bradford War Hospital.  The Undercliffe Cemetery Conservation Area  Undercliffe Cemetery Conservation Area signage After the opening of Undercliffe cemetery several surrounding properties were built on a speculative basis; a row of houses on Undercliffe Lane known as Guy's Cliffe and properties on Undercliffe Old Road named Westfield Crescent and West View‚Äîall these properties now constitute the Undercliffe Cemetery Conservation Area (1984), one of nearly 60 such areas in Bradford.  The Undercliffe Cemetery Charity  The site is owned by the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council but is operated and maintained by the 'Undercliffe Cemetery Charity' and their volunteers, and it is still an operational cemetery with ongoing burials. Approximately 30 monuments are cleaned each year to remove dirt and graffiti.  Cultural references  The cemetery was used as a location in the films Billy Liar (1963), L.A. Without a Map (1998), and King Girl (TV 1998). It was also used as a location in the television series Peaky Blinders (2013). Undercliffe Cemetery was photographed by pioneering Victorian documentary photographer Samuel Smith and more recently has been a subject for anaglyph 3D photography.

She was a soprano in the Frankfurt Opera and performed dozens of roles at the Vienna Staatsoper.  Biography  Coelho began studying architecture at a college in Rio de Janeiro, but she soon decided she would develop her singing career in Europe. She was a pupil of Solange Petit-Renaux, a former star of the Paris Op√©ra. In 1971, she moved to Germany and studied at the Musikhochschule, in Hanover. In 1974, she was already singing roles like Nannetta, Gretel, Zdenka, Violetta, Li√π and Konstanze. In 1976, she concentrated her performances at the Stadttheater, in Bremen, where she stayed for six years and added roles like Fiorilla in Il turco in Italia, Norina in Don Pasquale, Hanna Glawari in The Merry Widow and Lulu in Berg's Lulu. After starting her career as a lyric coloratura soprano, her voice gradually gained heft and a darker color, tending to the lyric and lyric spinto repertoire. In 1984, she became a regular soprano in the Frankfurt Opera. She also appeared as a guest artist in several opera houses, as in the Teatro Regio di Torino, where she sang in Lulu, and also in Aachen and in the Vienna Volksoper. In 1988, she sang the roles of Giulietta, in The Tales of Hoffmann, at the Festival of Bregenz, and of Donna Elvira at the Theatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro. In the late 80's, she had already sung in many countries. However, her definitive breakthrough would happen some years later. In 1990, she sang Tosca in Heidelberg and, in 1991, Donna Anna in Rio de Janeiro. In that same year, she was hired by the Vienna Staatsoper, where she debuted with a major success as Salome, which would become her most acclaimed role. From 1991 to 2003, she sang the Straussian role about 140 times. At that house, she performed dozens of roles, including: Maria in Maria Stuarda, Giulietta in The Tales of Hoffmann, Elettra in Idomeneo, Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Salom√© in H√©rodiade, H√©l√®ne in Verdi's J√©rusalem, Elena in I Vespri Siciliani, Abigaille in Nabucco, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, Li√π in Turandot, Lady Macbeth, Lina in Stiffelio, Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier and many other roles. She also performed as a guest artist at the Vienna Volksoper as Tatiana in Eugene Onegin and as Abigaille, in 1992; at the Bavarian State Opera and at the Berlin Staatsoper as Salome, in 1995; at the La Scala, in Milan, as Madama Butterfly, in 1996; at the Op√©ra Bastille, in Paris, as Salome, in 1996; and in other important opera houses all around the world, from Manaus, in Brazil, to Tokyo. In 2003 she was Tosca in Luciano Pavarotti's Berlin farewell performance. Also in 2003, she sang her first Turandot in St. Gallen and Berlin and received much applause. In 1998, Eliane Coelho received the title of Kammers√§ngerin in Vienna. In 2005, Eliane Coelho came back from several months of rest and fight against cancer. She started her career again with a new role: Bellini's Norma. Other recent engagements include a return to Brazil where she sang La Gioconda at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, and in S√£o Paulo where she also sang Lady Macbeth from Mzensk for the first time in 2007. Coelho has interpreted operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Strauss (besides Salome, she has sung Arabella and often presents in her concerts Strauss's Four Last Songs) and Verismo composers. In 2008 she sang her first Manon Lescaut in Bucharest and her first Elektra in Budapest. She debuted as Amelia in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera and as Anna Bolena in Donizetti's opera of the same name. She also performed as Amelia in Simon Boccanegra, performed Verdi's Requiem in Bucharest and gave a song recital in Moscow.

It dates to the 1830s and includes a historic district of houses and commerce buildings. Overview Named for the graceful park at its center, Union Square is a diverse urban setting - home to art galleries, artist studios, H.L. Mencken‚Äôs lifelong residence, and spacious three-story Italianate and Victorian rowhouses. On the historic ground of Southwest Baltimore is known to locals as \\"Sowebo\\" (SouthWest Baltimore). Union Square is less than a mile from Camden Yards and within walking distance of the \\"Inner Harbor\\" (formerly known as \\"The Basin\\" of the harbor), the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River, the B&O; Railroad Museum, Ravens Stadium (later known as M. & T. Bank Stadium), and the University of Maryland at Baltimore, (the original and founding campus of the U. of M. system, from 1807). The state-of-the-art U.M.B. Biotech Park on West Baltimore Street is a recent addition, with portions still under construction. One of the several public golf courses is nearby in Carroll Park, also home to the historic Mount Clare Mansion of 1754 built by Charles Carroll, Barrister, (1723-1783), next to the newly renovated Montgomery Park office building, formerly the store and regional warehouse of the Montgomery Ward & Company, famous for their catalog orders and sales in the last century. Access to several transportation directions are minutes away with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard running in an arch around the west side of downtown with its connection to the Jones Falls Expressway, (Interstate 83) going north towards the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway, the main East Coast highway, north to south is Interstate 95 with its Fort McHenry Tunnel and the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel cutting under the harbor and port of the Patapsco River and the commuter rail service MARC Train beginning in the northeastern corner of the state at Havre de Grace at the head of the Chesapeake Bay down to Baltimore and onto Washington, D.C. 40 miles away. Surrounding the city is the encircling Baltimore Beltway which is also Interstate 695 and connects via four parallel highways, from east to west: Interstate 95, then the Baltimore-Washington Parkway which is also (Md. Route 295 and Interstate 295), and the old historic Washington Boulevard from colonial times now of U.S. Route 1, and further to the west is U.S. Route 29, all connecting to the Capital Beltway around the Nation's Capital, in Maryland and Virginia, Interstate 495. Attractions Hollins Market =Union Square Park= A public space at the west side of the neighborhood, Union Square Park dates from 1847 and contains the community's signature structure, a Greek Revival Pavilion (1850) with fluted iron columns. Other features include the H. L. Mencken Memorial Fountain (1976) and curved walkways with park benches. Throughout the year, there are many impromptu events in the Square, including neighborhood dinners, outdoor movies, tag sales, Easter egg hunts, Halloween pumpkin carvings, and various other parties. =Hollins Market= A vital part of the community, Hollins Market was built in the Italianate style in 1838 at the east side of the neighborhood and is Baltimore's oldest home to food merchants. H. L. Mencken HouseSowebohemian Arts Festival =Mencken House= The H. L. Mencken House is located at 1524 Hollins Street. Baltimore's famous son, Henry Louis Mencken, lived here from 1883 until his death in 1956. More details in History section (below). =Arts festival= An annual event - the Sowebohemian Arts Festival - is held in the streets around Hollins Market on the Sunday afternoon of the Memorial Day weekend. Other highlights Also in the Union Square Historic District, attractions include annual events such as the Union Square Christmas Cookie Tour plus the Black Cherry Puppet Theater, the Enoch Pratt Free Library No. 2 Branch (1886), and Sowebo Arts, Inc.

Historic district The Union Square-Hollins Market Historic District is a dense area of rowhouses and commercial structures located approximately 10 blocks west of the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. The district contains approximately 1,321 buildings with about 31 structures which do not contribute to the district. There are two major features in the district: Union Square Park, a speculative park and housing development of the 1840s, and Hollins Market, an Italianate style market house built in 1838 and 1864. The remainder of the district developed after 1830 mainly as housing for workers in nearby industries and consist of low scale, two and three story brick vernacular dwellings while larger, high-style rowhouses surround the park. The Union Square-Hollins Market Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Union Square Rowhouses Real estate On the Square and on nearby streets, spacious three- story rowhouses predominate. Most are pre- and post-Civil War Italianate in style, but there are many examples of Early Victorian Greek Revival and Late Victorian Romanesque Revival. A majority of the homes have ten- to fourteen- foot ceilings, tall distinctive windows, wood floors, and plaster walls. Exteriors are brick and mortar facades with attractive cornices and marble steps. On the side streets and alleys there are an additional variety of charming two-story and two-story-with-attic rows. House prices range from $40,000 to $400,000. =Schools= Southwest Baltimore Charter School Opened in August 2005, the Southwest Baltimore Charter School (SBCS) is located at 31 South Schroeder Street. Its K ‚Äì 4 enrollment serves a diverse population in southwest Baltimore City. SBCS accomplishments include increases in reading performance across all grade levels and student performances at Taste the Arts, a Young Audiences Gala and fundraiser. Steuart Hill Academy (Baltimore City School #4) Steuart Hill Academy is located at 30 South Gilmor Street directly across the street from Union Square Park. The school was originally named Steuart Hill Elementary as a pre-K ‚Äì6 school. The school's playground was torn down in 1999 and the school went without a playground for 4 years until awareness was brought to the attention of the city by a group of the students. In 2002 these students were presented a grant from the Department of Parks and Recreation for $1 million. This money was used to rebuild their playground and several other Baltimore City playgrounds as well. In 2002, Steuart Hill Academy enrolled as a pre-K ‚Äì 8 school. Boundaries Image:Union Square Map.gif The District is bounded by South Fulton Street to the west and South Schroeder Street to the east, with north and south borders of West Baltimore and West Pratt Streets. Union Square proper, just west of the Market, is bounded by S. Stricker and S. Gilmore Streets from the east and west respectively, and by Hollins and W. Lombard Streets to the north and south. The area is built on a grid street system which conforms to the original 1818 layout of the area. Zip Code: 21223. History =Origins= Begun during the influx of English, Irish and German immigration of the 1830s, the Union Square / Hollins Market Historic District is a dense area of rowhouses that includes Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate architectural styles. To the west, Union Square Park contains an ornate fountain and Greek Revival pavilion, and forms one of the two open spaces preserved in the neighborhood. Hollins Market, in the east, is an Italianate-style market house built in 1838 and expanded in 1864, and is the oldest city market still in operation. left A large part of the neighborhood is built on the former estate of merchant-shipper Thorowgood Smith (1744‚Äì1810). Smith was Baltimore's second mayor, from 1804 to 1808, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Calhoun (Calhoun Street passes through the Union Square neighborhood). In 1799, Smith built his summer home, Willow Brook, in the Palladian style popular in mid-18th century England and the United States. At the time, the property was on the outskirts of the city. Across town, next door to the Shot Tower (1828), Smith's principal residence is restored as the Circa 1790 Home, open to the public, and maintained by the Women's Civic League. Upon the death of the childless Smith, the villa with twenty-six acres passed to his wife, the former Mary Blaikley Stith (1750‚Äì1822) and then to a nephew, merchant and privateer John Donnell. Donnell was responsible for parceling out the first plots of land for the construction of homes. Three sons of John Donnell leased grounds around the park, laid out specifications for houses, and graded and paved streets bordering the Square in the 1840s. Dubbed ‚ÄúMillionaire‚Äôs Row,‚Äù the portion of Stricker Street facing the Square featured the Italianate residences of bankers, investors, and factory owners. Other variations of the Italianate style lined the blocks leading up to and surrounding the square. Less ornate homes were put up in groups on side and alley streets, but all shared many identical features such as cornices, marble steps, and iron work. Developers and homeowners attempted to build the most economic dwellings possible, so they crammed narrow rowhouses along every road, avenue and alley in the district. Common brick was often used on side walls, with hard surface English brick on the front. The largest rooms were typically the front parlors and master bedrooms ‚Äì smaller rooms were placed to the rear. Ceiling medallions, cornices, staircase millwork, and fireplace designs were individualized features, chosen from home order catalogs. Most of the wrought or cast ironwork in the neighborhood was made in the Hayward, Bartlett, and Co. Factory near the B&O; Yards to the south of the neighborhood. The buildings were brick and low-scale ‚Äì no more than three stories except for some commercial buildings. Evenly spaced doorsteps, windows, and doors, as well as continuous rooflines create the visual rhythms for which Baltimore rowhouses are noted. Although residential construction ended in the 1880s, commercial building continued into the early 20th century. The two-and-one-half acres for the park was approved for that use and donated by the Donnells in 1847. The park is one block square, bordered by Lombard, Stricker, Gilmor, and Hollins streets. The landscape of Union Square ‚Äì with its walkways, pavilion, fountain, and wrought iron lamps ‚Äì recalls Victorian Era Baltimore. Architect John F. Hoss designed the iron Greek-style pavilion with fluted columns in 1850 ‚Äì it covers a natural spring that was once accessible by steps and, at one time, supplied water to the B&O; Railroad. The source of the name ‚ÄúUnion Square‚Äù is uncertain but probably reflects the patriotic sentiment of this time before the Civil War. Fog scenes of the Square, lights agleam over wet pavements and barren limbs, were often featured in local landscape artistry. Willow Brook, the estate house, was acquired in 1864 by Emily Caton McTavish, granddaughter of Charles Carroll (a signer of the Declaration of Independence), and daughter of General Winfield ‚ÄúOld Fuss and Feathers‚Äù Scott (a hero in the War of 1812 and unsuccessful Whig presidential candidate in 1852). Within a year, she donated it to the Roman Catholic Church as a school for delinquent girls, under the administration of the Congregation of the Good Shepherd. Additions and renovations changed the original structure over the next 100 years until the school closed in 1965, the property was sold, and the buildings were dismantled. Willow Brook's interior oval drawing room had long enjoyed national acclaim and, still intact, it was moved to the Baltimore Museum of Art for public and permanent display. Steuart Hill Elementary School was constructed on the site. The area was designated a National Register Historic District in 1967, two years after Willow Brook was razed. The original iron urns in the park were smelted down during World War II for the war effort. Economic decline occurred in the mid-20th until extensive rehabilitation began during a renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s. The Square benefitted from new lighting, shrubs, pink sidewalks, and cast iron benches installed during the 1970s. =Hollins Market= left The city's oldest market structure still in use, Hollins Market is part of the Baltimore public market system that began in 1763. In 1835, the City granted a petition of piano manufacturer Joseph Newman and ‚Äúothers‚Äù to erect a market house at their own expense. Banker George T. Dunbar donated the land which, at that time, was on the western fringe of the city. The doors opened in September 1836 and the market soon became very successful, but the fragile structure blew down in a windstorm two years later. Newman organized the effort to quickly rebuild and re-open the market by the end of 1839. The market was named for John Smith Hollins (1786‚Äì1856), an estate owner in West Baltimore and one-term mayor of the city from 1852 to 1854. In 1863, the City Council appropriated $23,000 to erect the high-ceilinged Italianate red brick edifice as an addition to the old market house. As this was during the divisive time of the Civil War, the council refused to consider any bid for the market's construction that did not come from ‚Äúparties... known to be thoroughly and unconditionally Union Men.‚Äù By 1900, Hollins Market stretched from Poppleton to Carey Streets, with 160 inside and 180 outside stalls. Over the years, an assortment of West Baltimore butchers, various European and Asian immigrants with vendor traditions, and African-American merchants have all sold and purchased meats, farm-fresh produce, baked goods, and home- produced wares. Somewhat smaller today, the traditions and diversity of the market and the quality of goods still holds true. The 1990 Barry Levinson film ‚ÄúAvalon‚Äù depicts Hollins Market in its heyday. Hollins Market, at 26 South Arlington Street, is open Monday through Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. It is closed on Sunday. =Malachai Mills= At 1504 W. Baltimore Street is the residence of Malachai Mills, a free-born African-American businessman in the early and mid-19th century. Mr. Mills was a prominent cabinetmaker and carpenter, providing furnishings and carpentry for many of the early homes in the neighborhood. Bill Adler of the Union Square neighborhood is at the head of a preservation effort to revitalize this valuable structure as a ‚Äúhistoric life museum‚Äù and as a preservation, fine arts, or urban studies field site for local universities. =H. L. Mencken House= Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, this Italianate brick row house at 1524 Hollins Street was the home of one of Baltimore's most famous citizens ‚Äì noted Baltimore Sun journalist and author Henry Louis Mencken lived here from 1883 until his death in 1956. Mencken wrote of his home: ‚ÄúI have lived in one house in Baltimore for nearly 45 years. It has changed in that time, as I have ‚Äì but somehow it still remains the same.... It is as much a part of me as my two hands. If I had to leave it I‚Äôd be as certainly crippled as if I lost a leg.‚ÄùFecher, Charles A. Mencken: A Study of His Thought. (1978) p. 47. Alfred A. Knopf, New York After his death on January 26, 1956, his home was bequeathed to the University of Maryland. In 1983 the City of Baltimore acquired the H. L. Mencken House from the University, in exchange for the Old Pine Street Station. With period furniture, his restored second-floor office, and backyard gazebo, the H. L. Mencken House opened as part of the City Life Museums and a center for theatrical, literary and musical events. Although the City Life Museums closed in 1997, the landmark still displays a special commemorative plaque about its famous occupant. The house is currently not open to the public and now stands empty, a shuttered burden for the City of Baltimore, which plans to dispose of the property. The organization ‚ÄúFriends of the H. L. Mencken House‚Äù is leading efforts of several groups to redirect and expand the use of this neighborhood treasure. Celebrating History The park and fountain ‚Äì as well as parts of Stricker, Hollins and Lombard streets ‚Äì were transported back to the 1850s when Union Square played the title role in the lush 1997 movie adaptation of Henry James's biting novel Washington Square from acclaimed director Agnieszka Holland. The excitement continued in 1997 as the community celebrated the sesquicentennial of Union Square with a re- dedication of the park including the placement of a stone tablet commemorating the event at the foot of one of the pavilion columns. The celebration was highlighted with concerts and a marching band performance, and the dedication of a new park at Pratt and Gilmor streets. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 5,420 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Union Square was 30.2% White, 63.4% African American, 0.0% Native American, 3.0% Asian, 1.1% from other races, and 2.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.1% of the population. 38.0% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 34.9% of housing units were vacant. 49.5% of the population were employed, 7.4% were unemployed, and 43.7% were not in the labor force. The median household income was $30,765. About 14.9% of families and 27.5% of the population were below the poverty line.

Dermatoglyphics also refers to the making of naturally occurring ridges on certain body parts, namely palms, fingers, soles, and toes. These are areas where hair usually does not grow, and these ridges allow for increased leverage when picking up objects or walking barefoot. In a 2009 report, the scientific basis underlying dermatoglyphics was questioned by the National Academy of Sciences, for the discipline's reliance on subjective comparisons instead of conclusions drawn from the scientific method. History 1823 marks the beginning of the scientific study of papillary ridges of the hands and feet, with the work of Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ. By 1858, Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet, while in India, became the first European to realize the value of fingerprints for identification. Sir Francis Galton conducted extensive research on the importance of skin-ridge patterns, demonstrating their permanence and advancing the science of fingerprint identification with his 1892 book Fingerprints. In 1893, Sir Edward Henry published the book The classification and uses of fingerprints, which marked the beginning of the modern era of fingerprint identification and is the basis for other classification systems. In 1929, Harold Cummins and Charles Midlo M.D., together with others, published the influential book Fingerprints, Palms and Soles, a bible in the field of dermatoglyphics. In 1945, Lionel Penrose, inspired by the works of Cummins and Midlo, conducted his own dermatoglyphic investigations as a part of his research into Down syndrome and other congenital medical disorders. In 1976, Schaumann and Alter published the book Dermatoglyphics in Medical Disorders, which summarizes the findings of dermatoglyphic patterns under disease conditions. In 1982, Seltzer, et al., conducted a study on patients with breast cancer, and concluded that the presence of six or more whorls on a woman's fingertips indicated her being at high risk for breast cancer. Although the study of dermatoglyphics has some adjunctive value in the diagnosis of genetic syndromes (see examples below), there is insufficient evidence to indicate that there is any value in the examination of dermal ridge patterns for the diagnosis of disease or for identifying disease susceptibility. Dermatoglyphics and genetic conditions Dermatoglyphics, when correlated with genetic abnormalities, aids in the diagnosis of congenital malformations at birth or soon after. * Klinefelter syndrome: excess of arches on digit 1, more frequent ulnar loops on digit 2, overall fewer whorls, lower ridge counts for loops and whorls as compared with controls, and significant reduction of the total finger ridge count. * Cri du chat (5p-): abnormal dermatoglyphics, including single transverse palmar creases and triradii in the t' position on both hands, are associated with 92% of patients, according to a critical review of multiple studies. * Congenital blindness: Initial data points to abnormal triradius. and excess of arches on fingertips. * Naegeli‚ÄìFranceschetti‚ÄìJadassohn syndrome: patients lack dermatoglyphics of any kind. * Noonan syndrome: increased frequency of whorls on fingertips; and the axial triradius t, as in Turner syndrome, is more often in position t' or t\\" than in controls. Increased incidence of the single transverse palmar crease. * Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome): excess of arches on fingertips and single transverse palmar creases in 60% of patients. Additionally, the hallucal fibular arches tend to form \\"S\\" patterns. * Trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome): 6‚Äì10 arches on fingertips and single transverse palmar creases in 30% of patients. * Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome): people with Down syndrome have a fingerprint pattern with mainly ulnar loops, and a distinct angle between the triradia a, t, and d (the 'adt angle'). Other differences include a single transverse palmar crease (\\"Simian line\\") (in 50% of patients), patterns in the hypothenar and interdigital areas, and lower ridge counts along digital midlines, especially in little fingers, which corresponds to finger shortening in those with Down syndrome. There is less variation in dermatoglyphic patterns between people with Down syndrome than between controls, and dermatoglyphic patterns can be used to determine correlations with congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome by examining the left hand digit ridge count minus the right hand digit ridge count, and the number of ridges on the fifth digit of the left hand. * Turner syndrome: predominance of whorls, though the pattern frequency depends on the particular chromosomal abnormality. * Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome: preponderance of broad thumbs, low mean ridge count, and fingerprint patterns occurring on interdigital areas. * Schizophrenia: A-B ridge counts are generally lower than in controls.

In the 18th century, it merged power with the Tu ªi Kanokupolu dynasty, and became existent only esoterically by the end of the 18th century. #Mo ªungƒÅmotu ªa ‚Äì around 1470; might have been first installed as viceroy by his older brother Kau ªulufonua I the incumbent Tu ªi Tonga, as the latter remained in his residence on the high grounds of Olotele in Mu ªa, while he had to stay on the lowlaying lands of Fonuamotu, reclaimed from the lagoon. These two areas were separated by the Fonuamoa (dry land) road. As such his followers became known as the Kauhalalalo (low road people) while the chiefs associated with the Tu ªi Tonga line became known as Kauhala ªuta (inland road people). However considering what happened after, it seems that later (or sooner) Mo ªungƒÅmotu ªa seized all the power from his brother although he did not dare to wipe out completely the Tu ªi Tonga. Instead he sent Kau ªulufonua away to Samoa and reigned in his name until his new dynasty, the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua line had grown powerful to eclipse the Tu ªi Tonga. That took about a century. #Tanekinga ªotonga #Kau Vaka'uta - Tu'i 'Eua (Vaka'uta Title Holder of 'Eua) #Siulangap≈ç #Vakalahi-Mohe ªuli ‚Äì around 1550, he (or his father) allowed the Tu ªi Tonga to come back from exile in Samoa #Mo ªunga  ªo Tonga ‚Äì he had several sons whom he appointed governors. One of them, Ngata, was appointed to the Hihifo district and imperceptibly started the Tu ªi Kanokupolu line. A daughter married Fatafehi, the Tu ªi Tonga, starting a blood relationship between the two dynasties. #Fotofili - was met by Abel Tasman in 1643 #Vaea - discovered that the Tu ªi Kanokupolu had grown into a serious rival, and fought a civil war against Mataeleha ªamea. His daughter was the last one to marry a Tu ªi Tonga,  ªUluakimata II #Moeakiola - contemporary with Tu ªi Tonga Tu ªipulotu I, who preferred a Tu ªi Kanokupolu princess as wife #Tatafu - first one not to be a son of his predecessor, he was the son of Fotofili #Kafoamotalau - a son of Vaea, showing quick successions, troubles, and a decline with the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua line; contemporary with Tu ªi Tonga Fakana ªana ªa #Tu ªionukulave #Silivakaifanga #Fuatakifolaha - son of Tongatangataulupekifolaha, who was not a Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua (or perhaps was according to others); grandson (through his mother) of Mataeleha ªamea the Tu ªi Kanokupolu; therefore troubles and quick successions had still not ceased #Tupoulahi - gave up around 1771 his title as Tu ªi Kanokupolu because of old age and may have been offered the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua title instead. Generally, however, it is doubted whether he was ever formally installed. #Maealiuaki - was also a previous Tu ªi Kanokupolu, and also was offered the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua title as an old age gift. It is not sure whether he really accepted or considered himself as retired. Met in that state with Captain Cook in 1777; died shortly after. With him went the last real Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua. Any successor named by history after him is dubious at best. #Mumui - may or may not have been the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua, depending on whether his older brother Maealiuaki respectively was it not or was it #Toafunaki - was mentioned around 1790 as the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua by the missionaries, but seems never to have been officially installed. Died young in 1797 and his reburial in 1799 was an opportunity for the assassination of the Tu ªi Kanokupolu Tuku ªaho. #Mulikiha ªamea - even more unsure whether he ever was a real Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua or not. He also was Tu ªi Kanokupolu for a while. Some believe that he came after Maealiuaki, others see him instead of Toafunaki. Whatever the case, by this time the title had become defunct, but it would be his descendants who would claim to have been the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua otherwise. :His son was Fatukimotulalo, whose son was Tungƒ´ Halatuituia. By then the line had acquired a new title: Tungƒ´, which still is nowadays one of the highest noble titles in Tonga. Halatuituia's son was Tuku ªaho (of the lakalaka fame), who was on his turn the father of Viliami Tungƒ´ Mailefihi, who amalgamated with the Tu ªi Kanokupolu. 4 out of the current 33 hereditary noble titles in Tonga trace their authority from the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua. These are: Tungƒ´, Luani, Fotofili and FakafƒÅnua. Collectively they are known as the FƒÅa ªi hai (those four). The traditional burial grounds of the Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua is in 'Eua, and in Lapaha are: Fale pulemƒÅl≈ç, Fale fakau≈ç, Fale tuingapapai (or tuipapai), Fale lolo ªamanu (nowadays split up into (Fale) Lo ªƒÅmanu and Tauhakeleva). These 5 are considered to be traditional langi although not named so, as the real langi are for the Tu ªi Tonga only.

A similar practice, that continues to this present day, was already established in France since 1920, by conferring the M√©daille de la Famille fran√ßaise (Medal of the French Family), a tribute to the French mother who raised several children in an appropriate way. History In recognition of the substantial importance a woman's role and motherhood was in support of a strong Germany, the Cross of Honour of the German Mother was introduced by decree in Berlin on 16 December 1938 by F√ºhrer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor) Adolf Hitler. The preamble of the statutory decree declared: :As a visible sign of gratitude of the German nation to children-rich mothers I establish this Cross of Honour of the German Mother (Original text in German: \\"Als sichtbares Zeichen des Dankes des Deutschen Volkes an kinderreiche M√ºtter stifte ich das Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter\\"). The crosses were awarded annually on the second Sunday in May (Mothering Sunday or Mother's Day), but also extended to include other national annual occasions of celebration.There were sighted public exhibits of government issued deeds' of conferral (Besitzeugnis/Verleihungsurkunde) to recipient mothers for the Mother‚Äôs Cross on other national annual dates of celebration. So despite its institution in 1938, the first awards were rendered in May 1939.Angolia, John R. For F√ºhrer and Fatherland: Political & Civil Awards of the Third Reich, pp 67‚Äì69, . Decoration The Mother's Cross was composed of three classes, and conferred to mothers in accordance with its statutory legislation: Verordnung des F√ºhrers und Reichskanzlers √ºber die Stiftung des Ehrenkreuzes der Deutschen Mutter vom 16. Dezember 1938. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBI) Teil I, 1938, Nr. 224, Seite 1923 (In English: Statutory Order of the Leader and Chancellor on the establishment of the Cross of Honour of the German Mother of 16 December 1938.

Resting on the centre radiant starburst rays is a metal roundel decorated with the words \\"DER DEUTSCHEN MUTTER\\" (in English: TO THE GERMAN MOTHER) around an enamelled black straight centred \\"swastika\\" symbol, infilled white enamel. The cross design was the creation of the established Munich-based architect and sculptor Franz Berberich. The production of the cross involved several established Pr√§sidialkanzlei (Presidential Chancellery) approved medal makers from across the German Reich.Sighted production issue versions of the Mother‚Äôs Cross, including presentation cases and sachets by officially approved medal makers. A maker's mark was never applied to the crosses produced; though each official house of manufacture did apply their name to the dark-blue presentation case (inside cover) for the 1st Class Gold Cross and the presentation sachets (reverse side) for each of the 2nd and 3rd Class Cross. =Cross reverse side inscription= Inscribed on the reverse side of the cross, of which two official reverse-side styles exist, is the inscription Das Kind adelt die Mutter (The Child ennobles the Mother) found on the initial version produced on inception during the early part of 1939. On the succeeding version produced from 1939 to 1945 the initial former reverse inscription was replaced during production with the date of the decoration decree 16. Dezember 1938. Directly beneath each of the two styles is the inscribed facsimile signature of Adolf Hitler; a style variation in this signature exists between the initial and succeeding version produced. =Neck ribbon= The decoration is worn around the neck on its accompanying narrow blue and white ribbon of about 60‚Äì70 cm in length. No other format of wear or placement was permitted.Statutory Document of the Deutsches Reich: Official Identification Document (Ausweis) of the Cross of Honour of the German Mother ‚Äì Reverse-Side Instructions Protocol for the Wear of the Crosses of Honour (Merkblatt √ºber das Tragen der Ehrenkreuze). =Deed of Conferral and identification documents= Accompanying the decoration was a deed of conferral (Besitzzeugnis otherwise Verleihungsurkunde) sealed with the Hoheitszeichen des Deutschen Reiches (Great Seal of the German Reich)Statutory Legislation of the Deutsches Reich: Verordnung √ºber das Hoheitszeichen des Reichs vom 5. M√§rz 1936 (Reichsgestezbl. I S. 1287). and the facsimile signature of Adolf Hitler and facsimile countersignature of the Minister of State Otto Meissner, head of the Office of the President of Germany (Pr√§sidialkanzlei). An official pale-blue photo identification document (Ausweis) was also available, this identified the holder and attested the bestowal of the decoration to the recipient mother, as well as provided instructions on the reverse side for correct wearing of the decoration, permitted at all \\"formal\\" state, celebrative and family occasions only. =Miniature of the Mother's Cross= Illustration: Optional semi-official approved miniature version of the Mother's Cross measuring about 2 cm, with attached ribbon bow, as depicted in the original supply catalogue produced by LDO-approved medal maker Boerger & Co., (Beco) of Berlin. An optional semi-official approved miniature version of the Mother's Cross measuring about 2 cm with reverse-side inscription, attached to a blue- white ribbon bow, was also produced in each of its three classes; it was authorized for purposes of general everyday wear only. The wearing of the blue-white ribbon bow alone, without the miniature cross attached, was also authorized for same purpose. The miniature was an optional supplement, that could be purchased privately from relevant authorized supply stockists such as high-street jewellers or directly from the LDO (Leistungsgemeinschaft der Deutschen Ordenshersteller) approved medal makers responsible for manufacturing private retail supply. Other formats made available by those manufacturers to recipients of the honour, such as brooches, were simply unofficial merchandising embellishments. =Legacy= The Mother's Cross of Honour, upon the death of the honoured recipient mother, was permitted by statute to remain inheritable with the bereaved family as a keepsake remembrance. =Special Grade= There was a version of this award that had small diamonds placed in the swastika. The precise requisites is unknown, but a photograph of this variant (seen on page 75 in the book Political and Civil Award of the Third Reich ) stated that it had been awarded to a Dresden woman who was the mother of sixteen children. Nomination and conditions of conferral =Ideology= The Cross of Honour of the German Mother represented the fundamental ideologies of the role of the mother (the role of women under National Socialism) and ethnic-nationalism (the V√∂lkisch movement) of that time period in Germany. Its inception followed the earlier \\"Roaring Twenties\\" or \\"golden 1920s\\" as it was later referred in Europe and a period during Germany's Weimar Republic, which saw young women breaking with traditional \\"mores\\" or likewise step aside from \\"traditional\\" lifestyle patterns. =Nomination= A recommendation presented collectively at the beginning of each month to the Pr√§sidialkanzlei der Ordenskanzlei (Presidential Chancellery of the Chancellery of Honours) in Berlin for the Mother's Cross honour, could only be instigated by the local mayor's office, or on application from the Ortsgruppenleiter (local political party leader) of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), or the Kreiswart des Reichsbund der Kinderreichen (District Warden of the Reichs Union of Children- rich families). =Eligibility, criteria and bureaucratic process= The nomination involved a lengthy and exhaustive bureaucratic process. Not only were certain characteristics of the mother observed and eligibility studied thoroughly, but those too leading to the grandparents.Formal Document of the Deutsches Reich: Public exhibit ‚Äì official government issued document: ‚ÄúErkl√§rung zum Antrag auf Verleihung des Ehrenkreuzes f√ºr kinderreiche M√ºtter‚Äù (In English: Declaration to the Application for the bestow of the Cross of Honour for children-rich Mothers) The conferral of the Mother's Cross was so highly regarded by the government in Berlin, that additional bureaucratic resources assigned to lesser civil and military decorations were pulled for the exhaustive administrative procedures that this decoration alone required. Its precedence especially during Germany's wartime period saw all other civil honours and decorations but the Mother's Cross temporarily suspended since the original purpose for its establishment was now more significant. Local government agencies such as the Social Welfare Agency (Wohlfahrtsamt), Public Health Department (Gesundheitsamt), Youth Welfare Agency (Jugendamt), Police (Polizei) and other government agencies were all consulted in the eligibility investigation process. The decoration could and was only to be bestowed to the most honourable proven mothers. Accordingly, the following legislative prerequisites were to be strictly met: * a) that both parents of the children were deutschbl√ºtig (of German blood-heredity) and genetically fit, * b) that the mother of the decoration was indeed \\"worthy\\" of the decoration, and * c) that the children were live births. In some detail, these criteria required, for example: * I). Evidence to be provided by the mother in the form of a signed declaration \\"that the mother‚Äîand her husband‚Äîis/are deutschbl√ºtig (of German blood-heredity), that their four grandparents are not of Jewish or other foreign ethnic origin, nor have ever belonged or subscribed to the Jewish religion, and in circumstances where the husband or marriage is deceased‚Äîconfirms further that no contradictory facts are known in believing the Deutschbl√ºtigkeit (German bloodline) of the former husband\\". Unless doubts were cast to suggest otherwise in the validity of the declaration given, it was to be accepted as sufficient. * II). The mother was indeed \\"worthy\\" of the decoration (I.e. proven an honourable mother of reputable moral standing, genetically healthy and genetically fit. With no evidence of prior confinement to a state penitentiary (Zuchthaus), marital infidelity, unlawful abortion, or any other personal burdens of taboo or social offences such as prostitution or promiscuous behaviour, intimate interracial relationships (miscegenation) or otherwise exogamy, amongst other criteria that were required to be investigated and evidenced by government authorities). * III). Further conditions observed, involving the entire family, were that the children are clear of hereditary illnesses or genetic disorders, that a conscious responsibility exists without supervision in the parents being mindful of maintaining the family home to acceptable orderly standards and to nurturing their children towards being useful compatriots. The husband had not served a prison sentence, the family were not conceiving a great number of dependants (children) as a form of subsistence for the receipt of significant monetary disbursements of state child support (Kinderbeihilfe) and thereby feel entitled to avoid regular employment in exploiting such lifestyle, the family members were not chronic alcoholics, work-shy nor had conflicts with the law and police or presented other social delinquencies, and the family were not burdening private or public social welfare aid. In the event the authorities were to find such discrepancies during their investigations leading to non- eligibility, the family risked being regarded or stigmatised as \\"asozial\\" (anti-social) or dysfunctional, which at that time was viewed as a risk and threat for the wellbeing of the German nation. It was declared inconceivable and abhorrent to consider or recommend any mother of such a family background for the Mother's Cross honour. In a further extract from the official application screening protocol, the local mayor's office was also encouraged, if his office was recommending a mother, to consider whether the mother in question, who has gifted her children life, has borne children likely to bear sacrifices in the interest of preserving the German nation, or whether the children posed a burden and peril to the future of the German nation, and the children perhaps should have better remained unborn. =Benefits and privileges= Various privileges were bound to the honour, one example being preferential treatment, precedence and priority service within society and public services. As one recount recalls \\"...they were always given the best of everything: housing, food, clothing, and schooling for their children. Old people even had to give up their seats on the bus or streetcar. They were treated like royalty with the greatest respect. No standing in line for them. At the butchers shop the best cuts of meat would go into their baskets. A helper or nurse was assigned by the government to help them take care of the brood and arrived first thing in the morning\\". An annuity was also considered for a recipient mother of the decoration, but due to government budget constraints, this proved unworkable. Members of the Hitler Youth organization were also instructed; a wearer of the Mother's Cross was to be honourably greeted (saluted) when encountered. The V√∂lkischer Beobachter (People's Observer) national newspaper (1938 Issue No. 25) stated: \\"...the holder of the Mother's Cross of Honour will in future enjoy all types of privileges that we by nature have accustomed to our nation's honoured comrades and our injured war veterans.\\"V√∂lkischer Beobachter, Nr. 25, 1938. (Original German text: \\"die Tr√§gerinnen des M√ºtterehrenkreuzes werden in Zukunft alle jene Bevorzugungen genie√üen, die uns gegen√ºber den verdienten Volksgenossen und gegen√ºber Kriegsbesch√§digten bereits Selbstverst√§ndlichkeit geworden sind.\\") = Annulment of recognition = The receipt of the decoration was no guarantee of permanent recognition, it could be annulled on a case-by-case basis under certain circumstances on the advice of the Reichsminister des Innern (Reichs- Minister of Interior). For instance, it could be annulled if the mother ceased to be \\"worthy\\" by neglecting her children, marital infidelity, or exhibited other problematic behaviour. Recipients =Public presentation ceremonies= The first public presentation ceremonies, following inception of the Mother's Cross in December 1938, were held on Mother's Day 21 May 1939Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 8. Aufl., Bd. 8, Sp. 14 ‚Äì Muttertag (In English: 8th Edition, Book 8, Column 14 ‚Äì Mother‚Äôs Day) across Germany. However, due to the unexpected high number of mothers eligible for the decoration across all classes on its inception, despite a stringent nomination criteria, resulted in the initial presentations being restricted to mothers of age 60 and above due to various administrative and logistics limitations. The first year presentations were also extended to include 1 October 1939 \\"harvest festival\\" day (Erntedankfest), equivalent to thanksgiving, and 24 December 1939 Christmas Eve.Sighted public exhibits of government issued deeds' of conferral (Besitzeugnis/Verleihungsurkunde) to recipient mothers of the Mother‚Äôs Cross honour in year 1939. It was not until Mother's Day 1940 onwards that eligible mothers aged below 60 were finally presented with their Mother's Cross decoration and once again these presentations were deferred until a later date that same year. A recipient mother who could not attend her official invitation to a local public presentation ceremony received her decoration delivered through the postal service. Some presentation ceremonies were also recorded filmed events chronicled by the Die Deutsche Wochenschau (The German Weekly Newsreel).The Internet Archive, Short Format Films ‚Äì Die Deutsche Wochenschau (The German Weekly Newsreel), Archive ‚Äì 31 May 1944 Film No. 717, Mother‚Äôs Cross presentations by a Gauleiter in the region Steiermark (Styria), Austria. =Total decorations conferred= Exact total decorations bestowed throughout its existence are no longer traceable through the limited official records that survived the Second World War, the central application archives held at the Pr√§sidialkanzlei (Presidential Chancellery) in Berlin were lost or otherwise destroyed by closing war events; however, it's estimated that up until September 1941 there were a total of 4.7 million recipient mothers honoured with the Mother's Cross decoration. Miscellaneous After the end of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Mother's Cross was occasionally referred to as the M√ºtterverdienstkreuz (Mother's Cross of Merit). The Mother's Cross, however, belongs to the decorations and medals bestowed during the Third Reich era of Germany, and as such, incorporates by design the adopted swastika symbol; the wearing or display of which in public places, especially in Germany of such decorations since 26 July 1957, is restricted and regulated by German law (Ref. Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl) I, 1957, S. 844, ¬ß6) in accordance with the succeeding Law on Titles, Orders and Honours of the Federal Republic of Germany (Gesetz √ºber Titel, Orden und Ehrenzeichen).

It runs approximately from the Sierra Nevada Range to the San Joaquin River. Although called the 'Fresno' River, it is one of the largest and longest river systems in Madera County. Course Headwaters: The Fresno River forms in the Oakhurst valley, near the western border of city limits. The primary source of the Fresno River is Lewis Fork Creek, which gathers water far northeastward into the hills adjacent to Fish Camp. Lewis Fork Creek itself has a major tributary from Nelder Creek, coming from the lower-montane Nelder Grove area and Speckerman Mountain (7,600 ft). The other major tributary is China Creek, which acts as a drainage for the ridges around the Teaford Saddle. After Oakhurst, the Fresno River runs northwest until it reaches the end of the sloped valley at the calm topography of the Fresno Flats. There the valley and hills start to meet, and the Fresno crosses Potter Ridge at around 2,000 feet. Foothills: As the river carves its way through the ridge, it creates several windy canyons and gulches. This area was mildly popular during the Central Sierra era of the Gold Rush, throughout the early to mid-1850s. Past the ridge, the Fresno River descends the foothills mildly. The harsh canyons ease up and start to widen. It crosses Road 415 at around 1,000 feet elevation, an intersection known as the Fresno Crossing. Hensley Lake: Once the Fresno River gets out of the foothills, it creates a gently sloped river valley down to the border of the Central Valley. At one of the widest sections of the river, Hidden Dam was constructed and Hensley Lake created. Now a popular recreation spot, the lake covers a considerable area when full from late spring snow melts. Central Valley: Below the lake, the river flows southwest to Madera, then west to the Eastside Bypass. The river exits the bypass then flows generally northwest to its confluence with the San Joaquin River, just north of Highway 152. Lakes and dams Hidden Dam is the only major storage dam on the Fresno River. The dam forms Hensley Lake, a reservoir. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built the earth-fill dam, which was completed in 1974. Its primary purpose is flood control, but it is also used to regulate flows for irrigation and groundwater recharge. In 1978, the lake was opened to the public for recreation and is a popular boating and fishing destination for locals. Below Hidden Dam, the Fresno River provides water to Madera Lake via an unnamed distributary. Excess flow from the lake is returned to the Fresno River by the lake's dam. Further downstream, on the northeast edge of Madera, is the John Franchi Diversion Dam, a high, -wide earth and steel dam that is used to divert water into the Big Main Canal. The dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 1964 and is operated by the Madera Irrigation District. From this point, the river is normally dry. The only time water is released past here is when water levels are high enough to spill over the dam. Lower river A diagram of the Fresno River's flow through man-made channels where the original riverbed no longer exists.West of Road 17 in Madera County, the Fresno River's natural riverbed has been subject to much intervention by man and as a result, the natural riverbed has many gaps in it, which are now connected by man-made canals. At Road 17, the natural riverbed has been modified to divert most flows into a manmade canal, which leads to the Eastside Bypass. Water can also be allowed to continue flowing down the main river channel (north of the man-made canal), but that water now ends up in the bypass as well. Once in the bypass, water can exit via a small channel at a diversion dam and continue west along the natural riverbed the rest of the way to the San Joaquin River. Between the Eastside Bypass and the San Joaquin River, the riverbed (which is almost always dry) has been subject to straightening, but more or less follows its natural course. Tributaries In addition to many small unnamed streams, the Fresno River receives the water from the following streams: *Oak Creek, considered by some to be the headwater of the Fresno River beginning at Pierce Lake *China Creek *Miami Creek *Crooks Creek *Spangle Gold Creek *Willow Creek *Mud Spring Creek *China Slough *South Fork Fresno River **This is a distributary that branches off to form a small island, then returns to the mainline Fresno River. *Berenda Slough Towns Towns along the Fresno River include: *Oakhurst (unincorporated) *Madera Crossings Construction of the Fresno River Viaduct in January 2016.

Taxonomy Ranoidea barringtonensis may be conspecific to the Pearson's green tree frog (Ranoidea pearsoniana). Morphological differences have not been fully studied yet, but visible physical differences between frogs from Barrington Tops and Dorrigo, New South Wales, in comparison to frogs from south-eastern Queensland and northern NSW are discussed in a key on the leaf green tree frog page. These are representative of frogs described as L. barringtonensis and L. pearsoniana. Description The mountain stream tree frog is a relatively small tree frog growing up to 45 mm in length. It is light green to dark/olive green on the dorsal surface and sometimes brown morphs are encountered. The thighs are a mango-yellow colour and the belly is off-white. A pale brown (almost light yellow) stripe runs from the nostril, across the eye, over the tympanum, and down to the shoulder, where the line widens and dissipates. Randomly placed black dots are scattered over the dorsal surface. Metamorphs closely resemble the adults, although they are mostly brown in colour. The tadpoles of the R. phyllochroa complex (leaf green tree frog (R. phyllochroa), Pearson's green tree frog (R. pearsoniana), southern leaf green tree frog (R. nudidigitus) and the mountain stream tree frog (R. barringtonensis) are very similar in appearance and are very hard to tell apart. Range is best used to distinguish the species. Ecology and behaviour This species inhabits flowing creeks in mountainous areas, in rainforests and adjacent wet sclerophyll forests, as its name suggests. Males call from stream-side vegetation during spring and summer; the call is similar to that of the leaf green tree frog. This species is rarely described in field guides due to its similarity to the Pearson's green tree frog and due to the taxonomy being under review. As a pet It is kept as a pet; in Australia this animal may be kept in captivity with the appropriate permit. References *Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South-eastern Australia.

Description The yellow bullhead is a medium-sized member of the catfish family. It is typically yellow-olive to slatey-black on the back and sometimes mottled depending on habitat. The sides are lighter and more yellowish, while the underside of the head and body are bright yellow, yellow white, or bright white. The rear edge of its caudal fin is rounded. The anal fin is much larger than many fish having anywhere between 24 and 27 rays. The yellow bullhead, though less common, can be easily distinguished from the brown bullhead and black bullhead by its white barbels or \\"whiskers\\". Yellow bullheads are medium-sized bullheads rarely getting larger than but can reach up to four pounds. This species is often misidentified on social media and the Internet. Yellow bullheads range in size from six to 14 inches, and can live up to 12 years. Diet The yellow bullhead is a voracious scavenger that will almost eat anything. It locates prey by brushing the stream bottom with its barbels. Taste buds on the barbels tell the yellow bullhead whether or not contact is made with edible prey. They typically feed at night on a variety of plant and animal material, both live and dead, most commonly consisting of insects, snails, minnows, clams, crayfish, other small aquatic organisms, plant matter, and decaying animal matter. Habitat Yellow bullhead are bottom dwellers, living in areas with muck, rock, sand, or clay substrates. Its habitat includes river pools, backwaters, and sluggish current over soft or mildly rocky substrate in creeks, small to larger rivers, and shallow portions of lakes and ponds. Their habitat can vary from a slow current with poorly oxygenated, highly silted, and highly polluted water to a more swift current with clean and clear water that has aquatic vegetation. Fishermen often find them in sluggish creeks and rivers with a gravel bottom. Reproduction and life cycle Bullheads have a monogamous relationship with spawning beginning in mid-May or early-June, with both sexes participating in nest-building. Bullheads usually use a natural cavities or make saucer shaped depressions near submerged cover, such as a trees roots or a sunken log. The female will lay anywhere from 300 to 7,000 eggs in a gelatinous mass, and after fertilization the male protects and continually fans the nest of eggs. The eggs hatch within five to 10 days and young fry are herded into tight schools by the male and protected by both parents until they are approximately two inches long. They grow to about three inches by one year of age. Sexual maturity is reached between the ages of two and three years, when the fish are at least 140 mm in length. Distribution Yellow bullhead range throughout the central and eastern US from central Texas, north into North Dakota, and east through the Great Lakes region to the East Coast.. They have also been introduced to the West. Angling Yellow bullheads are considered a minor game fish, and their meat is considered sweet and has a good flavor, but the meat can become soft in summer. They are not as sought after as other catfish. They can be caught on natural baits such as worms, crickets or chicken liver fished on the bottom at night. Etymology Named both Ictalurus natalis and Ameiurus natalis.

In 1992 she published her book Women and Gender in Islam, which is regarded as a seminal historical analysis of the position of women in Arab Muslim societies. She became the first professor of women's studies in religion at Harvard Divinity School in 1999, and has held the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Divinity chair since 2003. In 2013, Ahmed received the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for her analysis of the \\"veiling\\" of Muslim women in the United States.  Biography  Born in the Heliopolis district of Cairo to a middle-class Egyptian father and an upper class Turkish mother in 1940, Ahmed's childhood was shaped both by Muslim Egyptian values and the liberal orientation of Egypt's aristocracy under the ancien r√©gime. The Ahmed family became politically ostracized following the Free Officers Movement in 1952. Her father, a civil engineer, was a vocal opponent of Gamal Abdel Nasser's construction of the Aswan High Dam on ecological principles. She earned her undergraduate and doctorate degrees from University of Cambridge during the 1960s before moving to the United States to teach and write, where she was appointed to professorship in Women's Studies and Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1981 followed by a professorship in Women's Studies and Religion at the Harvard Divinity School in 1999, where she currently teaches.The new voices of Islam: rethinking politics and modernity : a reader by Mehran Kamrava  Work  = A Border Passage (1999) = In her 1999 memoir A Border Passage, Ahmed describes her multicultural Cairene upbringing and her adult life as an expatriate and an immigrant in Europe and the United States. She tells of how she was introduced to Islam through her grandmother during her childhood, and she came to distinguish it from \\"official Islam\\" as practiced and preached by a largely male religious elite. This realization would later form the basis of her first acclaimed book, Women and Gender in Islam (1992), a seminal work on Islamic history, Muslim feminism, and the historical role of women in Islam. Ahmed speaks of her experience in Europe and the United States as one that was often fraught with tension and confusion as she tried to reconcile her Muslim Egyptian identity with Western values. Faced with racism and anti-Muslim prejudice, and after deconstructing traditionalist male-centered beliefs in her own culture, she set out to dispel equally damaging myths and misconceptions held by the West about Islam and Muslim women. Today, Ahmed is perhaps known most widely for her groundbreaking work on the Islamic view of women and their historical and social status in the Muslim world. Ahmed has been a strong critic of Arab nationalism in Egypt and the Middle East. She devotes an entire chapter in her autobiography to the question of Arab nationalism, and the political factors and efforts which went into constructing an Arab identity for Egypt after the army's coup d'√©tat. According to Ahmed's research, the idea that Egyptians were \\"Arab\\" was virtually unheard of well into the 20th century. She describes Arab nationalism, like many other forms of pan-nationalism, as a type of cultural imperialism. This cultural imperialism eats away at the diversity and cultural creativity of not only the Arabic-speaking national majorities (who often speak widely divergent vernaculars), but also the non-Arabic speaking minorities throughout the Middle East and North Africa. = Women and Gender in Islam (1992) = In her seminal work, Women and Gender in Islam (1992), Ahmed argues that the oppressive practices to which women in the Middle East are subjected are caused by the prevalence of patriarchal interpretations of Islam rather than Islam itself. She maintains that as Islam evolved, two divergent voices emerged in the religion: # An ethical structure that advocates the moral and spiritual equality of all human beings; # A hierarchical structure as the basis of male/female relations; a gender- based/sexual hierarchy.Ahmed, Leila. Women and Gender in Islam. Yale University Press, 1992, p. 66. Islamic doctrine developed within an androcentric, misogynist society, that of Abbasid Iraq, the customs of which were largely inherited from the Sasanian Empire after its conquest.Ahmed 1992, p. 79-83 This society emphasised and institutionalised the gendered hierarchical voice and silenced the voice of equity and justice. Islam as a religion therefore became a discourse of the politically dominant elite, i.e.; male society. There were early signs of resistance to establishment Islam. For example, the thoughts of Sufi and Qarmatians groups, philosophers such as Ibn al-Arabi and the liberal stance of powerful families and individuals towards their daughters in respect of marriage and education (e.g.; imposing a monogamy clause in marriage contracts or one for providing private education). Despite such resistance, establishment Islam experienced little serious challenge until early 19th-century colonial encroachment. European colonialisms' remit was essentially economic; however, female emancipation was used as an argument to legitimate geopolitical incursion. Colonial feminism was a Western discourse of dominance which, \\"introduced the notion that an intrinsic connection existed between the issue of culture and the status of women, and ‚Ä¶ that progress for women could be achieved only through abandoning the native culture.\\"Ahmed 1992, p. 244 Inevitably, the initial reaction to this was a rejection of Western values by political Islamists. This rejection saw the conflation of Islam and culture where Islamic authenticity became defined in terms of cultural authenticity and, specifically, the role of women within Islam. This led to a reaffirmation of indigenous customs relating to women and restoration of the customs and laws of past Islamic societies. The underlying assumption was that there is an authentic interpretation of Islam that is based on the texts and institutions developed in Abbasid Iraq. According to such assumptions, the meaning of gender and the position of women within Islam is \\"unambiguous and ascertainable in some precise and absolute sense.\\"op cit., p. 238 Since this initial reaction, Muslim women scholars have argued that the values of the Abbasid era in Iraq are not universal to Islam ‚Äî rather they were specific to a particular time, culture and people. Islamic texts and institutions need to be separated from patriarchal culture and reappraised in terms of merit, and listening to the voice of equality and justice. Ahmed concludes by exhorting feminists, both Muslim and Western, to undertake this task by critically engaging with, challenging and redefining the Middle East regions' diverse religious and cultural heritage.

The central bank was merged with its subsidiary Raiffeisen Bank International in 2017. It functions as the group centre for the entire RZB Group, of which the listed company Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) with its banking network in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is the largest member. It has subsidiaries in, amongst others: Ukraine, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Croatia, and Switzerland. The largest of these subsidiaries by far is Raiffeisenbank (Russia) which accounts for 74 percent of the company's pretax profit.https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/european-banks-expect- limited-impact-from-sanctions-on-russia The RZB Group is the third largest Austrian bank. As of end-2010, the balance sheet total of the RZB Group amounted to 136.5 billion euros. RZB has several specialised subsidiaries. Raiffeisen Zentralbank √ñsterreich AG is a member of (Austrian Raiffeisen Association), which amongst other things functions as the interest representation association for all Austrian Raiffeisen cooperatives.  History  The incorporation meeting of the shareholders of the giro centre of the Austrian Raiffeisen cooperatives was held on 16 August 1927. With this, a central institution was established for the Raiffeisen Banking Group, and since then this institution has functioned as the national and international representative and coordinator for the Group. The founding took place roughly four decades after the establishment of the first Austrian savings and loan cooperative to use the system devised by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen. The original company name was Girozentrale der √∂sterreichischen Genossenschaften. In 1939, after the German annexation of Austria, the new German owners changed the name to Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank der Ostmark Aktiengesellschaft, and then in 1942 to Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank Wien Aktiengesellschaft. From 1953 on, the new name was Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank Aktiengesellschaft, with the abbreviation GZB also being used for the company. Since 1989, the bank has been named Raiffeisen Zentralbank √ñsterreich Aktiengesellschaft, abbreviated as RZB. Founded primarily as a liquidity equalisation office for the Raiffeisen Banking Group, the company in its first ten years of operation significantly expanded its business activities through the 1930s to include fields such as foreign exchange and currency transactions, lending, acceptance of deposits and investment in securities. Along with this, the bank's staff also increased significantly, rising to 85 employees at the end of its first decade of existence. In 1938, one day after the German occupation of Austria, the bank was taken over by a provisional German administrator and subsequently nationalised. The bank was not returned to its pre-war owners until 1955. = Key developments since the 1950s = In the 1950s, GZB began to expand and transform its foreign operations. This was also clearly reflected in the bank's growth, with the number of staff rising to almost 200 by 1957. By the end of the 1950s, the bank began to found specialised companies or to invest in them. Working with the co-operatives also allowed the institution to offer each and every Raiffeisen bank and its customers a universal range of financial services. The product portfolio of the Raiffeisen Banking Group was further expanded with the founding of Raiffeisen Building Society,Raiffeisen Building Society Raiffeisen Insurance,Raiffeisen Insurance Raiffeisen LeasingRaiffeisen Leasing and other specialised companies. = Expansion in Central and Eastern Europe beginning in the 1980s = Along with its position as one of the largest commercial and investment banks in Austria, RZB started developing another main area of business already in the 1980s, founding the present-day Raiffeisen Bank in Budapest in 1986. This early strategic decision to expand into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) proved to be one of the most important decisions in RZB's history. Starting from 1989, with the collapse of the communist regimes, RZB focused intensely on CEE, initially founding numerous banks to build up a viable network, which was complemented with acquisitions starting from 2000. Along with Austria, RZB considers CEE to be its home market. The subsidiary bank Raiffeisen Bank International was formed, merging Raiffeisen International Bankholding AG and the corporate banking business and related subsidiaries from RZB. RZB currently holds a stake of approximately 78.5% (with the rest of the shares in free float) and operates one of the largest banking networks in CEE. = Since 2000 = In 2005, RZB bought Ukrainian Bank Aval, and renamed its subsidiary Raiffeisen Bank Aval.AFP: \\"US to press Ukraine to end crisis after Russia bailout warning\\", Ahram.org, 6 Feb 2014 In 2007, Raiffeisen made ‚Ç¨1.48 billion, 79% of it from operations abroad.

As local currencies tumbled, those loans became more expensive for borrowers to pay off. The bank asked the Austrian taxpayer to buy preferred shares of Raiffeisen valued at ‚Ç¨1.75 billion in a capital-raising measure. The coupons would pay 9.3% annual interest and must be repaid within five years, said an Austrian Finance Ministry spokesman. In 2015 the Raiffeisen Bank made a profit again (379 million euros / $420 million). The bank postponed the sale announced in 2014 of its Polish subsidiary, Raiffeisen Bank Polska SA. Another factor that affected the bank's decision to wait with the sale were the elaborate demands by Polish regulators for bank sales. In response to Poland's new bank levy, Raiffeisen Bank announced that \\"in principle, we still want to sell the bank, but not under all circumstances and at any price, and we can‚Äôt rule out that we won‚Äôt sell it in the coming months and years.\\" In 2016 the parent company Raiffeisen-Landesbanken-Holding GmbH was merged with Raiffeisen Zentralbank; the latter was the surviving entity.

History The monastery was erected by the boyar family of Dragomir, an army captain. The oldest known document relating to it is a donation deed, dated 6 May 1634. At the time, it was a monastery of monks. Because of the lack of monks, the monastery went deserted in 1752, and in 1760 was revived as community of nuns. As of 2006, about 75 nuns live there. Architecture The monastery church was built in a mixed neoclassical and local ecclesiastical style. It was painted in 1843-1844 by Nicolae Teodorescu and his nephew Gheorghe Tattarescu. The bell tower, erected by Dionisie Romano in 1854, was re-designed and reduced in height to 18 meters in 1894, when it was rebuilt after an earthquake. The museum The compound includes a museum, near the water-well (which dates from 1911). The museum was opened in 1975, in a wide hall painted in 1859 by a monk from the nearby Ciolanu Monastery. It exhibits a multi-language Bible printed in 1629 in Greek, Latin and Hebrew. The visitors can also see a fragment of the original 1688 Bucharest Bible, the first edition translated into Romanian, along with the anniversary reprint of the Bucharest Bible from 1988.

Several examples were made and it was also advertised. Steam plough Rickett was manager of the Castle Foundry in Buckingham, makers of agricultural implements, who in 1857 also started to make steam engines. In 1858 he combined the two to make a steam plough. The plough cost ¬£500 (about ¬£ today) and was manned by three men. Steam carriage The steam plough inspired the Marquess of Stafford to order a steam carriage - probably in 1859. This vehicle had three wheels, the single wheel at the front, and a rear-mounted coal-fired boiler and two-cylinder engine. The boiler pressure was 110 psi, and the cylinders had a bore of 76 mm and stroke of 178 mm. Transmission was by chain to the right-hand rear wheel. A maximum speed of 19 mph was claimed. A boilerman was seated at the rear, and three passengers could sit side by side at the front with the one on the right operating a tiller steering and the regulator, reversing lever and brake. The wheels had iron \\"tyres\\", with the brakes operating on the rear wheels. A second example was ordered by the Earl of Caithness, but this time the wheels were driven through a two-speed gearbox and spur gears. It was demonstrated to the Royal family at Windsor Castle in January 1860. The Earl used the car to drive 146 miles from Inverness to Barrogill Castle, 20 miles north of Wick in Scotland, accompanied by his wife, with Thomas Rickett acting as engine man. Encouraged by his success, Rickett placed an advertisement in The Engineer magazine advertising his carriages for sale at ¬£180 to ¬£200. He was, however, ahead of his time, and it is not thought that any more were sold. Steam Coach In 1861 Rickett's demonstrated a steam coach by taking it from Buckingham to Wolverton. He said that the coach was intended for use on roads in Switzerland. Road Train Rickett's next venture was a 12-ton road steam engine, which was designed to pull wagons along the road. This was built for and demonstrated to some Spanish gentlemen by driving it pulling three loaded wagons weighing 28 tons from Buckingham to Mixbury and back - about 6 miles. Another of the road trains was sold to Copenhagen in Denmark after it had been inspected by a Danish engineer, Mr Hjorth. Financial problems By 1865 the Foundry was in financial trouble. It was put up for letting in February that year. A possible reason was the passing of increasingly restrictive legislation, the Locomotive Acts, in 1861 and 1865 which made the use of steam propelled vehicles on roads impractical.

As the founder of the Traver Engineering Company, Traver was responsible for the production of gentle amusement rides like the Tumble Bug and Auto Ride. However, Traver's coasters became legendary for their unique twisted layouts and thrilling, swooped turns. At a time when most coasters were built from wood, Traver was the first coaster builder to utilize steel for the primary structural material. History Traver was born in Gardner, Illinois. In 1919, he founded the Traver Engineering Company in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, which created amusement rides, including the Tumble Bug, The Caterpillar, Laff in the Dark, Auto Ride, and the Circle-Swing, a ride similar in concept to the earlier Captive Flying Machines ride popularized in the United Kingdom by American- born inventor Sir Hiram Maxim. He died at New Rochelle, New York in 1961. Notable roller coasters Traver's \\"Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters\\" were what made him the most famous (or notorious) of all coaster designers. His most famous coasters were the \\"terrible trio\\", all built in 1927. They were: * \\"Cyclone\\" ‚Äì Built in Crystal Beach Park, Ontario, Canada. * \\"Lightning\\" ‚Äì Revere Beach, Massachusetts. * \\"Cyclone\\" ‚Äì Palisades Amusement Park, New Jersey. * While not part of the trio, \\"Zip\\" at Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon was a more compactly-designed Giant Cyclone. All three shared the same twisted layout and utilized trains based on a Prior and Church design: The Great Coasters International Millennium Flyers are patterned after this rolling stock. After leaving the station, the trains would turn 180 degrees and ascended the lift hill. Coming off the lift, the trains dived down to the right, climbing to a sharp jog to the left. A drop and hill followed, and then a severely pitched double helix. Coming out of the helix, the train entered a figure-eight banked at 89 degrees. After the figure-eight, a spiral hill led under the lift, where a jarring series of bunny-hops were placed, After those, the train turned 180 degrees into the \\"Jazz track\\", which consisted of the track pitching one way then the other fast and repeatedly. The \\"Jazz track\\" was an element of all Traver coasters. (Wood coaster company Custom Coasters International would later make a similar element to \\"Jazz track\\" called the \\"trick track\\", which would be featured on Shivering Timbers at Michigan's Adventure and the now-defunct Villain at Geauga Lake.) After the \\"Jazz track\\", a final spiral drop led to the brake-run. The entire ride lasted 40 seconds from the top of the lift; while Traver claimed that the force exerted on passengers was in excess of 4Gs, it is actually likely to have been significantly higher.http://cec.chebucto.org/ClosPark/Crystal.html The Cyclone at Crystal Beach survived the longest of the three, lasting until 1949. An urban legend holds that on the \\"Lightning\\", a passenger plunged to her death on the second night of the coaster's opening. On May 30, 1938, Amos Wiedrich was riding the Crystal Beach Cyclone, when at the top of the 90-foot lift hill he stood up to remove his jacket. The train plunged downwards, and he was thrown onto the tracks in front of him, only to be hit a moment later by the coaster's train.http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/history/designer/traver.shtml The Cyclone kept a nurse at the station whenever it operated ‚Äî though constant structural and mechanical failures prevented it from ever running an entire season ‚Äî rumored to be in order to rouse fainted passengers, treat wounds related to the violent nature of the coaster, or even for the purpose of lowering Crystal Beach's insurance policy. Most likely, a nurse was kept on staff for the sake of marketing and to attract more riders. One of his coasters was known as the Jazz Railway. The Jazz Railway was the forerunner of the modern Wild Mouse coasters that are built to this day. One such coaster existed from 1925-1927 at Rocky Glen Park in Moosic, Pennsylvania In 2001, Disney California Adventure opened, featuring Golden Zephyr, a modern-day replica of the Traver Circle-Swing.

It typically entails distributing political and institutional power proportionally among confessional communities. Debate Proponents of confessionalism cite it as an effective way to secure the peaceful co-existence of diverse religious and ethnic communities by empowering each according to its \\"weight\\" in the region. However, critics point out that such a system may actually deepen conflict between ethnic groups. They argue that whichever group holds the most political power may use government to favour itself at the expense of other groups, or even to oppress rival groups. Also, as demographics change, the positions and power held by a particular group may no longer appropriately reflect the size of that group. Debate over confessionalism raises similar issues to those facing consociationalism, of which confessionalism is one kind. Iraq Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the occupying administration introduced a system where power was shared between the three main ethno-religious groups: Shi'ite Arabs, Sunni Arabs and Kurds. The constitution of Iraq encouraged such power- sharing, due to the parliamentary system and the initial requirement for a super-majority to elect the President. Although not explicitly required in the constitution, political tradition has continued to date for the President to be a Kurd, the Speaker of Parliament a Sunni Arab and the Prime Minister a Shi'ite Arab.  Israel  In Israel, the Basic Law: The Knesset forbids political parties from taking part in elections if they deny Israel as the state of the Jewish people. Article 7A., Clause a., states: Lebanon The repartition of assembly seats on a confessional basis in the Middle East was invented by the Ottoman Empire (e.g. in the Ottoman Parliament) and continued in several post-Ottoman countries with reserved seats for non-Muslim, namely Christian, minorities (Syria, Jordan, Iraq), or for all religious communities including Muslim subgroups and Christian churches (Lebanon). A similar system prevails in Iran for the Armenian, Assyrian, Jewish and Zoroastrian minorities. Although it was meant to be a temporary solution \\"until such time as the Chamber enacts new electoral laws on a non-confessional basis\\",Lebanese constitution, article 24 more than eighty years later, confessionalism remains the system of government implemented in Lebanon. All posts in government and seats in the legislature are apportioned amongst different religious groups according to a political agreement, as the relative demographic weight of those groups is unknown. The constitution of 1926, amended after the Taif Agreement of 1990 and the Doha agreement of 2008 specified that there should be 54 Christian deputies and 54 Muslim deputies, even though in practice there are 64 deputies each.Lebanese constitution, article 24 subsection a In addition, within those two groups, seats should be shared according to the demographic weight of each community.Lebanese constitution, article 24 subsection b The Lebanese constitution also guarantees segmental autonomy to 18 recognized communities in the country in domains such as education.Lebanese constitution, articles 9 and 10 Lebanon also presents other characteristics of confessionalism. Since 2005 Lebanese politics has been polarized around two trans-religious coalitionsConfessionalism and electoral reform in Lebanon, section 3, Arda Arsenian Ekmekji, Ph.D. with the majority never able to govern alone. There is, however, another section of the constitution that addresses the development of outside parties not represented by popular support.

In September 2003, Karen and Matt after having patched up their marriage, left Charnham for Spain with Grace and Jim. The decision was partly based on the fact Jim was covering his own back after a scam with local dodgy dealer Gabriel Drummond went wrong. Reception A reporter from Soaplife branded Karen and Kelly's shared a \\"tangled relationship\\".

About Jim Jim first arrived in Charnham in December 2000, not long after his sister Karen and her boyfriend Matt Ellis arrived. Jim had lost his wife, Cathy several years earlier. Due to the cramped conditions at Number 12, where Matt and Karen were staying with Matt's Sister, Nikki Warrington and her family, Jim originally had intended to rent a room from Sadie Hargreaves across the street, but Sadie having a heart attack put paid to the idea. Jim remained with the Warringtons for the time being. As 2001 approached, Jim and Karen's 19-Year-old brother Paul arrived. Paul managed to wind up several residents and lied to Jim on occasion, but Jim refused to give up on him. Confession Later that year, Linda Renshaw an old flame of Jim's reappeared in his life. It transpired that Linda was Paul's biological mother and Jim was not Paul's brother at all; He was in fact his biological father. Jim had gotten Linda pregnant when they were teenagers and Jim and Karen's parents raised Paul as their own and Jim went to join the army. Complicated Romances That December, Jim began an affair with Nikki, despite him recently marrying Cat Matthews who was pregnant with Jim's child. Nikki decided to end it and told Jim to go back to Cat. After a series of arguments, Cat's constant drinking and smoking which led to her aborting Jim's baby, Jim decided to separate from her. Jim later put down roots in the area and bought Nikki's house after her husband Andrew decided to sell the house. In 2002, Jim got involved with Geri Evans Cat's niece, but in an almost ironic twist, Jim slept with Cat again. Exit In September 2003, after a bungled business venture with Gabriel Drummond, which involved stolen cars and resulted in Jake Walker driving into the sandwich shop during a high-speed police chase and killing Robert Davenport and Fern Farmer, Jim decided to move back Spain to join Paul who had recently settled out there after reuniting with his on-off girlfriend Gemma Craig. Matt, Karen and their daughter Grace followed him and sold Number 12 to The Costellos.

The Cycladic Cruises' ship was roughly 200 feet (60 m) long, and ran the regular 16 mile (26 km) trip between the two harbours every day, with a carrying capacity of 500 passengers. Four hours before the attack a car laden with explosives exploded on the pier prematurely, killing two Arab terrorists. On the evening of 11 July 1988, the ship was attacked by a Libyan-born Palestinian gunman who killed eight tourists before killing himself in a subsequent explosion. At the time of the attack, there were 471 people on board the ship. Pier explosion Earlier on the day of the attack, the pier that the City of Poros usually berthed at in Piraeus was rocked by the detonation of a large car bomb. Due to the isolated location of the pier and the lack of tourists waiting on it (as the ship was at sea), the only fatalities were the two occupants of the vehicle, both of whom were killed instantly. The bomb's intended target was almost certainly the ship, but the plan of attack will never be known, due to the premature detonation. It is possible that the attack which followed was a \\"Plan B\\" after the failure of the car bomb. Attack One gunman had boarded the ship as part of its normal intake of passengers at Aegina, and then had waited until the ship had left the port and was three miles into its journey before he attacked, at approximately 8.30pm. Using concealed automatic weapons and hand grenades, he opened fire on his fellow passengers, who scattered in panic, many jumping overboard, which inadvertently caused many casualties amongst people who became caught in the ship's propellers. The perpetrator died in the attack. The rescue operation was carried out by those unhurt on board the ship and by other ships which soon arrived upon the transmission of a distress signal from the City of Poros. Many of those in the water were rescued by these ships and taken to shore, where emergency services were waiting to transport the worst injuries to hospitals. A total of six bodies were found on the deck of the cruise ship, and another three people died in hospitals due to their injuries. This brought the total number of deaths to eleven, including the two people who died in the car bomb explosion earlier in the day. In addition, 98 people were left injured, including 15 seriously. The dead on the ship were mostly tourists, including four from France and one each from Denmark, Sweden and Hungary, as well as two Greeks. Investigation The subsequent investigation into the operation uncovered evidence which pointed at both the Abu Nidal Organisation (who claimed responsibility for both the bombing and the ferry attack), and their supposed sponsors, Libya. The weapons used in the attack were of Libyan origin, and at least one of the assailants entered Greece on a Libyan passport. There was also a strong motive for both the ANO and Libya. A case had been running in the Greek courts concerning the known ANO member Muhammed Rashid, who was fighting extradition to the United States for terrorist activities. The Greek justice Minister later arranged for his release and transport to Libya, which was at this time engaged in a terrorist campaign against Western Europe and the USA as part of their revenge for Operation El Dorado Canyon. A year later, two ANO members were arrested and convicted of involvement in the attack, and further charges were later brought against a Lebanese man arrested in Germany, but the men who planned this operation mostly escaped official justice.

His uncle and cousinHubert Pearson and Harold Pearsonwere also both professional players. Playing career Hibbs was born in Wilnecote, Staffordshire and, whilst training as a plumber, played for his local club sides Wilnecote Holy Trinity and Tamworth Castle, who had some torrid seasons in the Birmingham and District Football League (the club conceding a total 164 goals over the 1922 and 1923 seasons). Despite this, Hibbs came to the attention of Birmingham when he was 17 years of age, and impressed so much in trials that he was offered professional forms in May 1924. Among such club legends as Frank Womack and Joe Bradford, Hibbs became a regular feature of Billy Beer's side, but it was a barren period in the club's history. Leslie Knighton's arrival from Bournemouth in 1928 signalled an improvement in fortunes for both Hibbs and Birmingham. Hibbs was part of an FA tour to South Africa and made three appearances for the Football League XI. His form on the FA tour earned him a call up for England, and he was selected to play Wales at Stamford Bridge on 20 November 1929. England won the match 6‚Äì0, with a hat-trick from George Camsell He was selected for the \\"Professionals\\" in the 1929 FA Charity Shield, but missed the game due to an injury. Prior to Hibbs's debut, the England selectors had tried 21 different goalkeepers in the nine years since Sam Hardy's retirement in 1920. Hibbs was almost a \\"carbon copy\\" of Hardy, unspectacular but highly reliable, preferring to do everything in as simple a manner as possible, a style that was to see him become England's most capped goalkeeper up to that time, as he was selected 25 times for England (ten clean sheets), becoming a main-stay well into the mid-1930s. Birmingham reached the FA Cup final in 1931, in which they lost 2‚Äì1 to a strong West Bromwich Albion side. Hibbs' cousin, Harold Pearson, who played on the winning side in the Cup Final, was selected to play for England against Scotland on 9 April 1932 in what would be his only full international appearance. After over 389 games, his career with Birmingham came to an end a little while into the start of the Second World War. His testimonial came against cross-city rivals Aston Villa on 13 April 1940, in the first Wartime benefit game. Management career In August 1944 Hibbs became manager of Walsall for seven years. The highlight of this period was the club's appearance in the 1946 Third Division (South) final, in front of 20,000, at Stamford Bridge against Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic and by the team of Ron Crutchley, Doug Lishman, Reg Foulkes, \\"Nutty\\" Newman and goalkeeper Jackie Lewis. Hibbs went back to play in goal for Havillands F.C. between February 1953 and the following summer. He then left football altogether before coming back to carry out two managerial stints at Ware for the 1960‚Äì61 season and Welwyn Garden City for the 1962‚Äì63 season. After football He settled in Welwyn Garden City, where he died in April 1984 at the age of 77.

All share the idea that qualitative aspects can be captured by an underlying logic, while quantitative aspects of uncertainty can be accounted for by probabilistic measures.  Probabilistic argumentation labellings  The framework of \\"probabilistic labellings\\" refers to probability spaces where the sample space is a set of labellings of argumentation graphs . A labelling of an argumentation graph associates any argument of the graph with a label to reflect the acceptability of the argument within the graph. For example, an argument can be associated with a label \\"in\\" (the argument is accepted), \\"out\\" (the argument is rejected), or \\"und\\" (the status of the argument is undecided ‚Äî neither accepted nor rejected). Consequently, the approach of probabilistic labellings associates any argument with the probability of a label to reflect the probability of the argument to be labelled as such.  Probabilistic argumentation systems  The name \\"probabilistic argumentation\\" has been used to refer to a particular theory of reasoning that encompasses uncertainty and ignorance, combining probability theory and deductive logic . OpenPAS is an open-source implementation of such a probabilistic argumentation system. Probabilistic argumentation systems encounter a problem when used to determine the occurrence of Black Swan events since, by definition, those events are so improbable as to seem impossible. As such, probabilistic arguments should be considered fallacious arguments known as appeals to probability.  References   D.M.

The result is a richer and more expressive formalism with a broad range of possible application areas. Probabilistic logics attempt to find a natural extension of traditional logic truth tables: the results they define are derived through probabilistic expressions instead. A difficulty with probabilistic logics is that they tend to multiply the computational complexities of their probabilistic and logical components. Other difficulties include the possibility of counter-intuitive results, such as those of Dempster-Shafer theory in evidence-based subjective logic. The need to deal with a broad variety of contexts and issues has led to many different proposals. Historical context There are numerous proposals for probabilistic logics. Very roughly, they can be categorized into two different classes: those logics that attempt to make a probabilistic extension to logical entailment, such as Markov logic networks, and those that attempt to address the problems of uncertainty and lack of evidence (evidentiary logics). That probability and uncertainty are not quite the same thing may be understood by noting that, despite the mathematization of probability in the Enlightenment, mathematical probability theory remains, to this very day, entirely unused in criminal courtrooms, when evaluating the \\"probability\\" of the guilt of a suspected criminal.James Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal, 2001 The Johns Hopkins Press, More precisely, in evidentiary logic, there is a need to distinguish the truth of a statement from the confidence in its truth: thus, being uncertain of a suspect's guilt is not the same as assigning a numerical probability to the commission of the crime. A single suspect may be guilty or not guilty, just as a coin may be flipped heads or tails. Given a large collection of suspects, a certain percentage may be guilty, just as the probability of flipping \\"heads\\" is one-half. However, it is incorrect to take this law of averages with regard to a single criminal (or single coin-flip): the criminal is no more \\"a little bit guilty\\" than a single coin flip is \\"a little bit heads and a little bit tails\\": we are merely uncertain as to which it is. Conflating probability and uncertainty may be acceptable when making scientific measurements of physical quantities, but it is an error, in the context of \\"common sense\\" reasoning and logic. Just as in courtroom reasoning, the goal of employing uncertain inference is to gather evidence to strengthen the confidence of a proposition, as opposed to performing some sort of probabilistic entailment. Historically, attempts to quantify probabilistic reasoning date back to antiquity. There was a particularly strong interest starting in the 12th century, with the work of the Scholastics, with the invention of the half-proof (so that two half-proofs are sufficient to prove guilt), the elucidation of moral certainty (sufficient certainty to act upon, but short of absolute certainty), the development of Catholic probabilism (the idea that it is always safe to follow the established rules of doctrine or the opinion of experts, even when they are less probable), the case-based reasoning of casuistry, and the scandal of Laxism (whereby probabilism was used to give support to almost any statement at all, it being possible to find an expert opinion in support of almost any proposition.). Modern proposals Below is a list of proposals for probabilistic and evidentiary extensions to classical and predicate logic. * The term \\"probabilistic logic\\" was first used in a paper by Nils Nilsson published in 1986, where the truth values of sentences are probabilities.Nilsson, N. J., 1986, \\"Probabilistic logic,\\" Artificial Intelligence 28(1): 71-87. The proposed semantical generalization induces a probabilistic logical entailment, which reduces to ordinary logical entailment when the probabilities of all sentences are either 0 or 1. This generalization applies to any logical system for which the consistency of a finite set of sentences can be established. * The central concept in the theory of subjective logicJ√∏sang, A., 2001, \\"A logic for uncertain probabilities,\\" International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems 9(3):279-311. are opinions about some of the propositional variables involved in the given logical sentences. A binomial opinion applies to a single proposition and is represented as a 3-dimensional extension of a single probability value to express various degrees of ignorance about the truth of the proposition. For the computation of derived opinions based on a structure of argument opinions, the theory proposes respective operators for various logical connectives, such as e.g. multiplication (AND), comultiplication (OR), division (UN-AND) and co-division (UN-OR) of opinions J√∏sang, A. and McAnally, D., 2004, \\"Multiplication and Comultiplication of Beliefs,\\" International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 38(1), pp.19-51, 2004 as well as conditional deduction (MP) and abduction (MT).J√∏sang, A., 2008, \\"Conditional Reasoning with Subjective Logic,\\" Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing, 15(1), pp.5-38, 2008. * Approximate reasoning formalism proposed by fuzzy logic can be used to obtain a logic in which the models are the probability distributions and the theories are the lower envelopes.Gerla, G., 1994, \\"Inferences in Probability Logic,\\" Artificial Intelligence 70(1‚Äì2):33‚Äì52. In such a logic the question of the consistency of the available information is strictly related with the one of the coherence of partial probabilistic assignment and therefore with Dutch book phenomenon. * Markov logic networks implement a form of uncertain inference based on the maximum entropy principle‚Äîthe idea that probabilities should be assigned in such a way as to maximize entropy, in analogy with the way that Markov chains assign probabilities to finite state machine transitions. * Systems such as Pei Wang's Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) or Ben Goertzel's Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN) add an explicit confidence ranking, as well as a probability to atoms and sentences. The rules of deduction and induction incorporate this uncertainty, thus side-stepping difficulties in purely Bayesian approaches to logic (including Markov logic), while also avoiding the paradoxes of Dempster-Shafer theory. The implementation of PLN attempts to use and generalize algorithms from logic programming, subject to these extensions. * In the field of probabilistic argumentation, various formal frameworks have been put forward. The framework of \\"probabilistic labellings\\" Riveret, R.; Baroni, P.; Gao, Y.; Governatori, G.; Rotolo, A.; Sartor, G. (2018), \\"A Labelling Framework for Probabilistic Argumentation\\", Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, 83: 221‚Äì287., for example, refers to probability spaces where a sample space is a set of labellings of argumentation graphs.

Instead it is assumed that a particular subset W of the variables V involved in the sentences defines a probability space over the corresponding sub-œÉ-algebra. This induces two distinct probability measures with respect to V, which are called degree of support and degree of possibility, respectively. Degrees of support can be regarded as non-additive probabilities of provability, which generalizes the concepts of ordinary logical entailment (for V=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\}) and classical posterior probabilities (for V=W). Mathematically, this view is compatible with the Dempster-Shafer theory. * The theory of evidential reasoningRuspini, E.H., Lowrance, J., and Strat, T., 1992, \\"Understanding evidential reasoning,\\" International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 6(3): 401-424. also defines non-additive probabilities of probability (or epistemic probabilities) as a general notion for both logical entailment (provability) and probability. The idea is to augment standard propositional logic by considering an epistemic operator K that represents the state of knowledge that a rational agent has about the world. Probabilities are then defined over the resulting epistemic universe Kp of all propositional sentences p, and it is argued that this is the best information available to an analyst. From this view, Dempster-Shafer theory appears to be a generalized form of probabilistic reasoning.

It held a royal charter for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and the Crown assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a royal colony. Bermuda under the Virginia Company \\"The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles\\", by Captain John Smith Bermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the Virginia Company when its flagship, Sea Venture, was wrecked on the reefs to its east.A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain The Admiral of the company, Sir George Somers, was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart a relief fleet destined for Jamestown, the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.Woodward, Hobson. A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest. Viking (2009) pp. 32‚Äì50. The settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, Sea Venture's longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When Deliverance and Patience set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for England, some dead. Those aboard the two ships included Sir Thomas Gates, the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, William Strachey, whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest, and John Rolfe, who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the Powhatan princess Pocahontas. Jamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely arrival of another relief fleet under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on Patience, captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took Patience to Somers' hometown, Lyme Regis, and not to Virginia. When news reached England of the adventures of Sea Venture's survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia. The new colony was officially named Virgineola, although this was soon changed to The Somers Isles or The Somers Islands in honour of Sir George Somers. A Governor, Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard Plough, to join those left behind by Sea Venture and Patience. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and ambergris. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers. Free of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda. Formation of the Somers Isles Company The Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir William Wade et cetera in exchange for ¬£2,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly administered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to the Crown. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades. The original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir John Henry Lefroy, Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:J.

Most of Bermuda was subdivided into eight equally sized tribes, later called parishes. These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by tribe roads) into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the easternmost parish, was Saint George's, comprising Saint George's Island, Saint David's Island, part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around Castle Harbour (then known as Southampton Harbour) and Saint George's Harbour. This area was held as common, or King's land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, Saint George's Town was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by Sea Venture survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping. A surveyor, Richard Norwood, was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, Daniel Tucker, the Governor of Bermuda, appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself. Local government The Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the House of Assembly. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda. The immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of militias, was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by Captain John Smith. Immigration, slavery, and demographics Immigration of indentured servants continued throughout the company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained Anglo-Saxon at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in Florida and the West Indies, Spanish- speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from Spain. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by privateers, although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in New England expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various Algonquian peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the Pequot War and Metacomet's War. A great many Native American slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as Mexico. The third main minority group was composed of Irish prisoners- of-war (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following Cromwell's bloody adventure in Ireland in the 1650s (see Cromwellian conquest of Ireland). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on Scotland. Bermuda had tended towards the Royalist side in the English Civil War, perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily nobles, but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's republican element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the Puritan, anti-episcopalian demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the Eleutheran Adventurers who began England's settlement of the Bahamas in the 1640s. Economy and industry Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company Agriculture remained the mainstay of the economy under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was tobacco, but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The Bermuda cedar boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in alkaline and low in magnesium (used by plants to form chlorophyll), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports. Bermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the Bermuda sloop to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the Bermuda cedar, which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource. Civil War By the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as William Sayle, to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the House of Commons of England. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the gentry and anti- Episcopalian sects within the Church of England, and sided with the Parliamentarians during the 1642-1651 Civil War. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the Bahamas under the Cromwell-loyalist William Sayle as the Eleutheran Adventurers. The response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, Barbados, and Antigua) was the passage of An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego in October, 1650. This called for due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them. Parliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament. With the Restoration, Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company. Revocation of charter and dissolution It was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of Perient Trott and his heirs, but expanding to include the company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the company. This resulted in the company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.

Route description View eastbound from the western terminus of SR 116 SR 116 is a two-lane roadway that traverses through a combination of agricultural and desert terrain in the Lahontan Valley. The route begins at an intersection with US 50, approximately east of downtown Fallon. From there, the road travels in a northeasterly direction, stair-stepping easterly and northerly through farm plots. For a short distance, the route forms is part of the southern boundary of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Indian Reservation. After , the road reaches the small town of Stillwater. SR 116 reaches its eastern terminus on the eastern edge of the town, but Stillwater Road continues east towards the Stillwater Point Reservoir and the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge. History A paved road approximating the current alignment of Stillwater Road was constructed by 1939. At that time, the road had a western terminus in Fallon. By 1940, the road was assigned the designation of State Route 42 on the official state map. As of 1957, SR 42 was approximately long‚Äîits western terminus was at the intersection of Stillwater Avenue and Harrigan Road in Fallon, with the route extending eastward along the Stillwater Avenue alignment before shifting northward near Crook Road to the present-day US 50 alignment. By 1960, the western end of SR 42 was truncated to its current western terminus at present-day US 50, concurrent with the shift of US 50 to the current alignment which leaves downtown Fallon in an eastward direction. The highway did not see any further changes until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's state highway system on July 1, 1976. In that process, SR 42 was renumbered to State Route 116.

Life Walter Elliot was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1842, the son of Judge Robert Thomas Elliott, formerly of Tipperary. He was educated in the Christian Brothers schools and at the age of twelve was sent to Notre Dame. Upon graduation, he prospected for gold around Pikes Peak before returning east to Cincinnati, where he entered law school.McNamara, Par. \\"Father Walter Elliott, C.S.P. (1842-1928): Union Army Veteran\\". McNamara's Blog, May 25, 2011 Elliott was admitted to the bar shortly before the outbreak of hostilities, whereupon he enlisted in the 5th Ohio Infantry. In 1862, the regiment was sent into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. On June 9. 1862, he was captured at the Battle of Port Republic but was exchanged three months later and returned to his regiment. Elliot saw action at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Lookout Mountain and took part in the capture of Atlanta. After the death in combat of two of his brothers, he acceded to his mother's request and left the army some six months after his enlistment expired. Elliott returned to Cincinnati and resumed the practice of law. He first met Isaac Hecker in Detroit, during one of Hecker's lecture tours. In 1868 he joined the Missionary Society of Saint Paul the Apostle and was ordained in 1872. He then set sail for California via Cape Horn, along with four other Paulist missioners.

This drew the attention of Rome and prompted a letter from Pope Leo XIII to Cardinal Gibbons expressing concern that the Church in America should be cautious of adapting too much to American culture.

In the , Woorabinda had a population of 962 people. It is an Aboriginal community. Geography Woorabinda is in Central Queensland, inland about two hours' drive west of Rockhampton. The seasonal Mimosa Creek is nearby and is a source of local water. During rainy season, the town can be isolated due to road flooding. Access is via the Fitzroy Developmental Road, which is sealed north towards Duaringa and where it meets the Capricorn Highway to Rockhampton. To the south, it is gravel road to Bauhinia Downs, where it meets the Dawson Highway and access to Gladstone. East is the sealed Baralaba-Woorabinda Road, seasonally cut off by flooding. West has a number of cattle properties until the base of the Blackdown Tablelands, serviced by gravel roads. There is also a sealed airstrip along the north road into town, used by chartered flights and aeromedical retrieval services. No commercial flights operate to the airstrip.  History  Wadja (also known as Wadjigu, Wadya, Wadjainngo, Mandalgu, and Wadjigun) is an Australian Aboriginal language in Central Queensland. The language region includes the local government areas of the Aboriginal Shire of Woorabinda and Central Highlands Region, including the Blackdown Tablelands. the Comet River, and the Expedition Range, and the towns of Woorabinda, Springsure and Rolleston. The town's name was chosen by Herbert Cecil Colledge, the superintendent of the settlement in 1927 using Aboriginal words, woora meaning kangaroo and binda meaning camp. Woorabinda was first established in 1927, with land gazetted from the County of Waroona, as a replacement for the Taroom Aboriginal Settlement. The land at Taroom was repossessed for the development of proposed Nathan Dam for the Dawson River Irrigation Scheme, which was ultimately never built. Central Queensland had a high level of frontier violence and Aboriginal deaths, such as at Cullin-La-Ringo at nearby Springsure and Hornet Bank along the Dawson River. There was a forcible relocation of dispossessed survivors into government-controlled settlements starting from 1897, with the introduction of the Aboriginals Protection Act‚Äîinitially at Taroom, and then Woorabinda. Peoples from at least 17 different language groups were placed within the camp, some from as far as Mornington Island,Woorabinda, (18 August 1927).

DOGIT communities have a special type of land tenure which applies only to former Aboriginal reserves. The land title is a system of community level land trusts, owned and administered by the local council. At the 2006 census, Woorabinda had a population of 851.  Education  Woorabinda State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Carbine Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 144 students with 16 teachers and 19 non-teaching staff (13 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 77 students with 4 teachers and 12 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent). Cape Bedford relocation In May 1942, during World War II, a Lutheran Aboriginal mission at Cape Bedford on Cape York in far North Queensland was closed to become used as an army camp. The relocation has also been attributed to governmental fears of Aboriginal loyalty to the German Lutheran pastor and possibly against non- Aboriginal Australian interests in favour of the Japanese. The 254 Aboriginal residents, of Guugu Yimithirr identity, were forcibly relocated; initially to Townsville via road and boat, and then via train to the ironback dormitory at Woorabinda. This trip was poorly provisioned and people arrived at their end destination having been deprived of food and blankets during the winter overland trip. There was tension between the Cape Bedford evacuees and the residents of Woorabinda, partially due to the strong Lutheran Christian beliefs held by those from Cape Bedford. However, the evacuees also experienced many cultural experiences previously unavailable to them because of the strong church presence, such as corroborees. During this time, informal Lutheran church services and ministering were maintained by the evacuees to hold onto their Christian beliefs, creating a core strength of spiritual leadership within this group. Choral singing started during this time within the Guugu Yimithirr language from translated hymns as part of their services, which became a core part of their future church identity. They maintained a separate identity to the Woorabinda residents during the seven years they spent within the community. Many died from sickness and exposure due to the poor sanitation and inadequate shelter from the frost and cold winter nights of the inland climate, which the Guugu Yimithirr peoples would not have previously experienced, as they were from a warm, humid coastal climate. The official number of deaths during this period was 33, but could have been up to 48. There were 13 recorded births during that time. During their time at Woorabinda, the Cape Bedford peoples experienced paid labour and schooling for the first time. The survivors were allowed to return to Cape Bedford in 1949, after the war, to what is now known as Hopevale. Most returned north, however, a small contingent remained, which maintained a presence and link to the north which remains to this day. Economy Council building.Unemployment is at 70%; the nearby townships include Baralaba, 40 km away, and Taroom, which are mining towns with a hundredth of the rate of unemployment. Woorabinda has also been identified as amongst Queensland's most disadvantaged suburbs, the others of which are also Indigenous townships. Government service providers are the main source of employment, with local industry in the form of the takeaway cafe and Woorabinda Pastoral Company, owned by the council. The satellite Foleyvale Station is just north of Duaringa, and is included in the Woorabinda lands used pastorally.

It was incorporated in 1995 and maintains offices in New York City and Tirana. It is located in \\"Ibrahim Rugova\\" str, ‚ÄúGreen Park‚Äù Complex, Tower 2, 12th Floor, Postal Code 1019, Tirana, Albania. Background The AAEF was established as part of a United States initiative to promote the private sector development in formerly Communist countries in Europe and Central Asia. It invests solely in Albania. To accomplish its mission, the AAEF invests and lends in a wide array of private enterprises, disseminates western business know-how, and, when appropriate, proposes changes to government policies affecting business. In addition, AAEF provides its portfolio investments with training to establish best business practices that incorporate acceptable financial reporting standards, as well as guidance in enhancing management capabilities and recruiting skilled personnel. The AAEF also provides its portfolio investments with corporate finance and strategic planning advice. The United States Government provided AAEF's initial capital through a grant from the United States Agency for International Development. The original Board members were appointed by the President of the United States. The AAEF operates independently from the U.S. Government, and is managed by professional investment managers under the guidance of the Board of Directors. Activities Although incorporated as a not-for-profit organization, the AAEF is managed as a private investment fund to maximize risk-adjusted returns. Investments can include loans, leases, guarantees, and equity ownership. Profits generated from AAEF investments are reinvested in new projects in Albania. In addition to recycling its profits to promote private enterprise creation and expansion, it is the AAEF's intent to demonstrate to other potential investors that investment in Albania can be successful and profitable. The AAEF strives to be a catalyst for additional private investment in Albania. The AAEF endeavors to identify and invest in enterprises that have good prospects of being commercially viable and are filling an under-served sector of the Albanian economy. Such investments should be capable of meeting international standards of ‚Äúbest business practices‚Äù, promote local manufacturing, create jobs and exports, and be environmentally safe. Since its inception the AAEF has invested in or lent to over 40 Albanian companies. As of September 30, 2008, net assets of the AAEF amounted to $178 million or 6 times the original capital. Companies financed by AAEF have contributed more than $1 billion to the country's GDP and created more than 5,000 jobs. Among the AAEF's notable investments are the modernizing of Tirana International Airport \\"Mother Teresa\\" and establishing the American Bank of Albania (ABA). In 2009 the AAEF created its legacy organization The Albanian - American Development Foundation (AADF) The AADF's mission is to facilitate the development of a sustainable private sector economy and a democratic society in Albania, and to contribute to stability in Southeastern Europe.

It was nominated for the 1985 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel and is listed as an ALA Notable Children's Book, an ALA Best Book for Young Adults, and a Boston Globe-Horn Book Award Honor Book. Plot summary Thirteen-year-old Howard Sykes lives in an English town with his parents, Quentin, an author and professor, and Catriona, a music teacher; his sister Anthea, always called \\"Awful\\" because of her constant screaming; and Fifi, the family's au pair. Their life is interrupted one afternoon when an unnamed huge person, \\"somebody's Goon\\" as Fifi describes him, comes into their home and announces that he has come to collect the two thousand words that Quentin owes somebody called Archer. It transpires that thirteen years ago, Quentin was suffering dreadfully from writer's block and hadn't been able to write anything for nearly a year after his last book was published, and so Mountjoy, a town official, came up with the idea that Quentin should undertake to write two thousand words of nonsense quarterly and deliver them to him at the town hall. In return, Quentin was promised an exemption from city taxes. The Goon says that the latest two thousand didn't get to Archer. Quentin irritably writes a replacement set and gives them to the Goon, who goes away ‚Äî but the next afternoon, he is back, as the words were a repeat of what had been done previously, and the agreement specified that they must not be a copy or paraphrase of anything Quentin had done before. The Goon takes Howard to see Mountjoy, who reveals that the town is secretly run by seven wizard siblings: Archer, Shine, Dillian, Hathaway, Torquil, Erskine, and Venturus. Each one \\"farms\\" (i.e. collects a portion of taxes from) some aspects of the town's life and industry (for a list, see below). Mountjoy has instructions from an unknown superior to post the words but does not know who the actual recipient is. Mountjoy's revelation starts the Sykes family on a quest for the sibling who is the actual user of Quentin's words. Fifi revels to Howard that she did not deliver the two thousand words as she was busy and gave them to one of Quentin's students at the college, Maisie Potter, to deliver. Howard, Awful and Fifi go to Maisie Potter's house to find out what she did with them. She tries to fob them off with excuses as to why the words were not delivered but they finally get the truth out of her: that she gave them to one of the wizard siblings, Dillian. The trio force her to take them to see Dillian. Dillian admits that she did ask Maisie Potter to steal the words as she believes, just like the other siblings, that the two thousand words have for the past thirteen years prevented them from leaving the town. Howard informs her that the words have been delivered to Archer for the past thirteen years and this makes Dillian believe that Archer is behind them all being stuck there. She gives back the words to Howard, but as he, Fifi and Awful are walking home they find that the words have magically vanished. When they try to go back to Dillian's house, it too has magically vanished. The Goon takes the family to meet Archer, who also believes that Quentin's words are restricting him and his siblings from leaving town. His aim is to acquire a sample of the writing so that he can figure out how to lift the restriction, in order to take over the world. On learning of Archer's ambitions, Quentin becomes convinced that the restrictions are a thoroughly good thing, and stubbornly refuses to write them anymore. Other siblings also want to acquire samples of Quentin's words for the same purpose as Archer and they all start putting pressure on the Sykes family. Gas and electricity are cut off, the shops are closed to them (e.g. when Quentin goes to the supermarket, although there are customers inside shopping, when he tries to enter the doors won't open and the CLOSED sign is up), their bank accounts are frozen, and all of Catriona's musical instruments play themselves, full blast, as do the radio and TV. Torquil, who farms music and therefore is Catriona's effective boss, threatens that she will lose her job if she does not get Quentin to write him the two thousand words; Fifi, who has fallen in love with Archer, attempts to get the words for him; Shine sends a group of boys known as Hind's Gang, led by one Ginger Hind, to follow Howard and Awful and briefly kidnaps the two to use them as leverage, though the Goon and Torquil quickly come to the rescue. Hathaway (roads and transport, archives and records) sends a messenger to collect the words, but Quentin locks up his typewriter with a length of chain and a padlock and gives it to the messenger, telling him to have Hathaway write the words himself; the street outside the Sykes' house is subsequently dug up and re-paved over and over again as a form of punishment. When Quentin receives a letter from the town demanding payment of a huge amount in back taxes, Howard and Awful decide that they have to seek help from Hathaway who, they discover, lives 400 years in the past. The children visit Hathaway in his Elizabethan household by going through a white door marked CURATOR at the back of the museum. Hathaway proves to be very reasonable, stops the street digging, and promises to help about the taxes. Howard suggests that Hathaway could bury some money at the site where their garden will be, so he (Howard) can dig it up tomorrow. However, Hathaway points out that this wouldn't work; he (Hathaway) can't stop someone else from finding the money during the 400 years in between. He also tells Howard that Catriona and Quentin found him (Howard) as an infant and adopted him, which proves only to add more to the boy's troubles. With Hathaway out of the running, Erskine is the next most likely candidate as the \\"user of the words\\". The Goon takes Quentin and the two children through the sewers to Erskine's sewage installation outside the city limits. It would have been only a short walk above ground, and when asked why he took them through the sewers, the Goon admits that he can only leave the town through the sewer or by a rubbish truck. Quentin realizes the Goon is, in fact, Erskine. Erskine has the three locked up as a way of exerting even more pressure on Quentin, but they manage to escape with the help of the aforementioned Ginger Hind, who insists that he needs Howard's help to be free from Shine. Howard now must find the seventh brother, Venturus, who lives in the future. Howard identifies Venturus's hiding place by going to a half- constructed building, i.e. a place that will exist in the future. As he runs from Erskine's men, he frantically wishes to Hathaway to send him a bus, and lo and behold ‚Äî one appears. He asks Archer for money for the fare, Shine to cause a distraction, and Dillian for a police car to stop Shine's \\"distraction\\", which goes a little over the top; all of these things miraculously appear. Having asked Catriona where she would live if she lived in the future and told \\"some house that hasn't been built yet\\", Howard acts on this suggestion and makes for what he guesses is Venturus's hideout ‚Äî a half- finished building near the Polytechnic where Quentin works (bearing in mind that as well as housing, Venturus also farms education). Howard's guess is correct, and as he climbs up the stairs of the unfinished building, he discovers that each step ages him and the building completes itself around him as he moves forward in time. On a mirror is scrawled the foreboding message, \\"THIS IS THE SECOND TIME\\". Howard eventually realizes that he himself is Venturus, who has been building a fantastic spaceship inside his home in the future. Venturus had twice, to get himself out of design problems with his spaceship, sent the whole town back thirteen years through time, accidentally transforming himself into a small child in the process. That small child was adopted (twice) by Quentin and Catriona, who named him Howard. The six siblings could not leave the town all that time not because of Quentin's words, but because their parents laid it on them to protect Venturus, and as long as Venturus‚ÄìHoward was too young to realize his magical powers, they had to be close by to protect him. Torquil, Hathaway, Erskine, and Venturus, who understand that civilization would likely crumble if one of the seven gained ultimate control, evolve a plan to send the other three, eldest siblings (Archer, Shine, and Dillian) off into deep space, never to return, in Venturus's newly constructed spaceship. They do this by convincing each of the three that the rest had plotted against each other and would put their final plan into action that night in Venturus's spaceship. They all board the ship, which Howard‚ÄìVenturus has programmed to allow them to come aboard but not disembark, for a one-way trip to Alpha Centauri, and the ship takes off. The remaining siblings have no plans to rule the world ‚Äì but Howard, now Venturus, still worries about what Erskine and Awful may get up to in the future. He decides he will stay with the Sykes family so he can help keep Awful in check and Erskine decides to travel the world, making for a pleasant ending.

The raise borer is set up on the upper level of the two levels to be connected, on an evenly laid platform (typically a concrete pad). A small-diameter hole (pilot hole) is drilled to the level required; the diameter of this hole is typically 230mm - 445mm (9\\" - 17.5\\"), large enough to accommodate the drill string. Once the drill has broken into the opening on the target level, the bit is removed and a reamer head, of the required diameter of the excavation, is attached to the drill string and raised back towards the machine. The drill cuttings from the reamer head fall to the floor of the lower level. The finished raise has smooth walls and may not require rock bolting or other forms of ground support. One impressive use of raise boring is the 7.1 m diameter shafts for Sasol's Middelbult and Bosjesspruit Mines in South Africa. The boxhole borer (or machine roger) is a variant of a raise borer that is used when there is not enough space on the higher of the two levels to be connected. The boxhole borer is set up on the lower level, drills a pilot hole as a guide, then drives the reamer bit along the pilot hole from the lower level to the upper.

The degree itself is largely equivalent to a Bachelor of Science and many institutions conferring degrees in the fields of biomedical engineering and bioengineering do not append the field to the degree itself. Courses of study in BME are also extremely diverse as the field itself is relatively new and developing. In general, an undergraduate course of study in BME is likened to a cross between engineering and biological science with varying degrees of proportionality between the two. Professional status Engineers typically require a type of professional certification, such as satisfying certain education requirements and passing an examination to become a professional engineer. These certifications are usually nationally regulated and registered, but there are also cases where a self-governing body, such as the Canadian Association of Professional Engineers. In many cases, carrying the title of \\"Professional Engineer\\" is legally protected. As BME is an emerging field, professional certifications are not as standard and uniform as they are for other engineering fields. For example, the Fundamentals of Engineering exam in the U.S. does not include a biomedical engineering section, though it does cover biology. Biomedical engineers often simply possess a university degree as their qualification. However, some countries do regulate biomedical engineers, such as Australia, however registration is typically recommended, but not always a requirement.National Engineering Registration Board - Areas Of Practice - NPER Areas As with many engineering fields, a bachelor's degree is usually the minimum and often most common degree for a profession in BME, though it is not uncommon for the bachelor's degree to serve as a launching pad into graduate studies. ABET does accredit undergraduate programs in the field. ABET Accredited Bioengineering/Biomedical Engineering Programs However, even this is not a strict requirement since it is an emerging field and due to the young age of many programs. Curriculum The curriculum for BME programs varies significantly from institution to institution and often within a single program. In general, a basic engineering curriculum, including mathematics through differential equations, statistics, and a basic understanding of biology and other basic sciences are hallmarks of a BME program. Many BME programs have a series of tracks that focus on a particular area of study within BME. Often, the tracks also coincide with a particular engineering or science field. Examples of tracks include: *Biomechanics: Focus includes medical devices, modeling of biological systems and mechanics of organisms. This track interfaces with mechanical engineering and often physiology. *Bioinstrumentation/Bioelectrical Systems: Focus includes medical devices, modeling of biological systems, in particular circuit analogies to the nervous system, bioelectric phenomena and signal processing. This track interfaces with electrical engineering. *Cell, Tissue and Biomolecular Engineering: This track is often quite diverse, with focus ranging from artificial tissues, modeling of biological systems, drug delivery, genetic engineering, biochemical engineering and protein production. This track can interface with chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, molecular biology, physiology, genetics, materials science and other fields. *Medical Optics: Focus on medical diagnostics and medical optical technology. This track interfaces with optics, physics and electrical engineering. Many other tracks may exist within specific programs as well as combinations of multiple tracks. Another common feature of many BME programs is a capstone design project where students become involved in researching and developing technology in the field. At some schools, this culminates in the creation of medical devices and prototypes. Capstone design projects also often include exposure to issues like funding, regulatory issues and other topics that are related to careers in the field. Research and Industry Experience An important feature of many programs is the inclusion of research and/or industry experience into either the curricular or extracurricular work done by students. Since BME careers often focuses on research or industrial applications of the field, many programs have seen fit to either encourage or sometimes require experience outside of the standard curricular requirements. Many research universities offer chances for students to participate in faculty research at the undergraduate level. Other schools have an industry practicum or co-ops to give students relevant work experience before graduation. Students that participate in either research or industry during the course of study often see advantages when they enter the job market, as many employers prefer experienced candidates or offer higher pay to those with prior experience. Also, research or industry experience is often a factor in graduate school admission. Value of the degree Recently, many universities, such as Case Western Reserve University have been implementing new initiatives to either create or expand upon undergraduate programs in BME. This is in part due to rising demand in the biotechnology sector and the increasing interest in biological research. A degree in BME instantly identifies a candidate as having training in both traditional engineering as well as biological science, which has become an increasingly desirable qualification as aspects of biology are permeating into other industries. Since BME is a diverse field, many programs have a broad curriculum with students usually choosing to specialize in a particular aspect of BME. However, due to the diversity, some degree holders may find their education lacking in deep emphasis, which may prompt continuing studies in graduate school or by learning through experience. Numerous rankings of undergraduate BME programs exist with highly varying basis for each ranking. As with many degrees, the reputation of a program may factor into the desirability of a degree holder for either employment or graduate admission.U.S. News and World Report Rankings for Biomedical/Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Programs The reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the institution's graduate or research programs, which have more tangible factors for rating, such as research funding and volume, publications and citations.

It flows for from the western side of the Sierra Nevada Range to the San Joaquin River system in the San Joaquin Valley. Most of the lower half of the river forms the border between Merced and Madera County. Course The river begins as three separate forks in southern Mariposa County. =West Fork= The West Fork (officially known as West Fork Chowchilla River) is formed by the confluence of Jones Creek and Snow Creek, north of the town of Bootjack, California. It flows roughly south from Bootjack, receiving Pegleg Creek, Humbug Creek, Italian Creek and Blade Creek before converging with the Middle Fork. =Middle Fork= The Middle Fork (officially known as Middle Fork Chowchilla River) is formed by the confluence of Magoon Creek and Fox Creek, on the east side of Magoon Hill in the Sierra Nevadas. It flows roughly south along the west side of Stumpfield Mountain, receiving a few unnamed tributaries, before converging with the West Fork. =East Fork= The East Fork (officially known as East Fork Chowchilla River) is the longest of the three forks and is formed by the confluence of several small, unnamed streams on the south side of Chowchilla Mountain, in the Sierra National Forest. It flows roughly south past the locality of Harris Ranch, receiving Oliver Creek and several other small, unnamed tributaries along the way. It converges with the West Fork south of Bailey Flats, and a few miles south of where the Middle and West Forks converge. =Main river= The Chowchilla River begins in name at the point where the West and East forks converge and flows southwest to Eastman Lake. The lake, which holds of water from the Chowchilla, was created in 1975 by the construction of Buchanan Dam, an earth and rockfill structure which is . The lake and dam's primary purpose is flood control and irrigation. In the summer months, Eastman Lake is a popular boating, fishing, camping and hiking destination for residents of the Madera and Chowchilla areas. Below Eastman Lake, the river continues roughly west, past the City of Chowchilla, to the San Joaquin River System. Lower river Seven miles downstream of Eastman Lake, the Chowchilla's water is diverted into both the Berenda and Ash sloughs, with excess water continuing down the main river channel. The river flows west-southwest for most of the rest of the journey before flowing west in the last few miles. The last of the river doubles as an irrigation canal for farms located along its banks. The main river channel ends abruptly about east of the San Joaquin River. The river has never had a defined natural outlet to the San Joaquin, as evidenced by the fact that the riverbed shrinks considerably in size as it travels west. A natural outlet never existed because the river only has a seasonal flow, and natural water flow would normally dry up before it had a chance to reach the San Joaquin. In rare years of torrential rains, there would still be water in the river at the end of the riverbed, at which point the water would simply flood the area past the end of the riverbed. Those floodwaters would eventually find their way into the San Joaquin River. As part of the Lower San Joaquin River Flood Control Project, a diversion canal was built to connect the end of the riverbed with the Eastside Bypass, allowing the Chowchilla's water a controlled outlet to the San Joaquin River during years of heavy rains. The Chowchilla River serves at the outlet of the Madera Canal. Tributaries In addition to many small unnamed streams, the Chowchilla River receives the water from the following streams: *Rock Creek *Willow Creek *Split Rock Creek *Cow Creek Towns Towns along the Chowchilla River include: *Harris Ranch (Unincorporated) *Bootjack (Unincorporated) *Raymond (Unincorporated) *Chowchilla Crossings There are numerous crossings over the Chowchilla River in Madera and Merced Counties.

The devices are deployed on roadsides like regular traffic signs in various countries. They are intended to help drivers by alerting them and drawing attention to danger or other undesirable situation. Sign types =Speed enforcing= These signs activate if an approaching vehicle is detected to be exceeding a preset speed threshold. The speed limit and/or a warning message will illuminate on the sign to remind the driver/rider to slow down. At some locations in the UK these devices are used for speed limit enforcement. Another variation of VAS displays the speed of any passing vehicle. If the vehicle is moving faster than the speed limit the number will flash, or be displayed in an alternate colour. Other signs also flash alternately between a number indicating the speed and an emoticon. A Smiley face is displayed if the vehicle is moving below the speed limit, while a sad face is displayed when the limit is being exceeded. This kind of VAS is widely deployed in the Netherlands and Belgium. =Hazard warning= These signs are installed on the approaches to hazards such as bends and junctions. If triggered they may display a warning message and/or an image of the appropriate road sign (sharp bend, junction, Overheight Warning, etc.). Sydney, Australia has implemented a unique low-clearance hazard warning using a curtain of water directly in the path of the vehicle. \\"When a truck gets too close, ..., a curtain of water starts flowing and a stop sign is projected onto it. The result is a warning that's so in-your-face that not only do the trucks stop, but so do all of the cars around it.\\" =Sign Design= Vehicle activated signs used on the public highways are normally designed to mirror the standard road traffic signs and in the UK to the TSR&GD; standards, these signs should also be design to EN12966:2014 to ensure the signs are fit for use on the public highways.  Sign effectiveness  In a 2002 study conducted by TRL for the UK Department for Transport one of the conclusions was that vehicle activated signs appear to be very effective in reducing speeds; in particular, they are capable of reducing the number of drivers who exceed the speed limit and who contribute disproportionately to the accident risk, without the need for enforcement such as safety cameras.

With respect to the direction of the oscillation relative to the propagation direction, we can distinguish between longitudinal wave and transverse waves. For electromagnetic waves, propagation may occur in a vacuum as well as in a material medium. Other wave types cannot propagate through a vacuum and need a transmission medium to exist .  Reflection of plane waves in a half-space  The propagation and reflection of plane waves-- e.g. Pressure waves (P-wave) or Shear waves (SH or SV-waves) are phenomena that were first characterized within the field of classical seismology, and are now considered fundamental concepts in modern seismic tomography. The analytical solution to this problem exists and is well known. The frequency domain solution can be obtained by first finding the Helmholtz decomposition of the displacement field, which is then substituted into the wave equation. From here, the plane wave eigenmodes can be calculated. = SV wave propagation = The propagation of SV-wave in a homogeneous half-space (The horizontal displacement field) The propagation of SV-wave in a homogeneous half-space (The vertical displacement field) The analytical solution of SV-wave in a half-space indicates that the plane SV wave reflects back to the domain as a P and SV waves, leaving out special cases. The angle of the reflected SV wave is identical to the incidence wave, while the angle of the reflected P wave is greater than the SV wave. For the same wave frequency, the SV wavelength is smaller than the P wavelength. This fact has been depicted in this animated picture. The animations are taken from = P wave propagation = Similar to the SV wave, the P incidence, in general, reflects as the P and SV wave. There are some special cases where the regime is different.  Wave velocity  Seismic wave propagation in 2D modelled using FDTD method in the presence of a landmine Wave velocity is a general concept, of various kinds of wave velocities, for a wave's phase and speed concerning energy (and information) propagation. The phase velocity is given as: :v_p = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{k}, where: *vp is the phase velocity (in meters per second, m/s), *œâ is the angular frequency (in radians per second, rad/s), *k is the wavenumber (in radians per meter, rad/m). The phase speed gives you the speed at which a point of constant phase of the wave will travel for a discrete frequency. The angular frequency œâ cannot be chosen independently from the wavenumber k, but both are related through the dispersion relationship: :\\\\omega = \\\\Omega(k).\\\\, In the special case , with c a constant, the waves are called non-dispersive, since all frequencies travel at the same phase speed c. For instance electromagnetic waves in vacuum are non- dispersive. In case of other forms of the dispersion relation, we have dispersive waves. The dispersion relationship depends on the medium through which the waves propagate and on the type of waves (for instance electromagnetic, sound or water waves). The speed at which a resultant wave packet from a narrow range of frequencies will travel is called the group velocity and is determined from the gradient of the dispersion relation: :v_g = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\omega}{\\\\partial k} In almost all cases, a wave is mainly a movement of energy through a medium. Most often, the group velocity is the velocity at which the energy moves through this medium.

The Korea Independent Commission Against Corruption (KICAC) was established on 25 January 2002, under the Anti-Corruption Act of Korea, which was enacted by the Korean National Assembly on 24 July 2001, which sought to prevent corruption and promote transparency in Korean society. In a coordinated effort with other monitoring agencies, also known proverbially as watchdogs, the KICAC is involved in producing policies, orchestrating preventive activities such as institutional improvement and educational programs, works to detect corruption by investigative processes and receiving complaints from the public, and also evaluates the anti-corruption activities of other national, and international, organizations. The KICAC was integrated into a larger agency entitled the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC), which was formally launched on 29 February 2008. This integration involved not only the KICAC, but also the Ombudsman of Korea and the Administrative Appeals Commission.  Organization History  Amongst other stimuli, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis resulted in the bankruptcy of major Korean companies, provoking not only corporation, but also government officials towards corruption. Korean companies received preferential treatment from the government, resulting in poor financial structure, excessive corporate debt, and an enervated competition between businesses both nationally and abroad. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Korean government realized that it must reanimate its economic competitiveness in the global market. In light of such, the government implemented regulatory reforms, improving the transparency of business, and invested great efforts in anti-corruption legislation and practices. In February 1998, Kim Dae-jung was inaugurated as the President of South Korea. In the following months, the president-elect directed anti- corruption legislation, particularly the protection of whistleblowers and the establishment of investigative bodies that would exercise searches of government offices. However, this development was stunted by various factors, such as rescinding opinions of government authorities. During the 16th National Assembly, which was formed in May 2000, civic groups came together to form the Citizens' Coalition for Anti-Corruption Legislation in order to file a petition for the legislation of anti-corruption policies during the National Assembly. The public responded favorably to this audacious move by the civic groups, whose subsequent outcome was the passing of the Anti-Corruption Act (ACA) on 28 June 2001. The ACA was roughly sketched, lacking substantive provisions and measures against corruption. It was through the ACA, however, that KICAC was born. In spite of the KICAC's debut, corruption in South Korea wasn't pointedly affected, raising feelings of doubt and skepticism about the necessity of an anti-corruption agency. Roh Moo Hyun's presidency, however, prioritized the fight against corruption, which led not only to the evolution of the KICAC but other corruption-resisting bodies as well. This positive move towards anti-corruption led to the creation of the Minister-Level Meeting on Corruption (MLMC) in 2004, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), along with the issuance of such programs such as the Act on the Election of Public Officials and the Prevention of Election Malpractices and the Korean Pact on Anti-Corruption and Transparency (K-PACT). The KICAC was integrated into the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) in February 2008 to provide a consolidated service for the public. The ACRC is currently located in the Seodaemoon district of Seoul, South Korea.  Structure of the KICAC  The decision-making body of the KICAC consists of nine commissioners: three commissioners recommended by the national assembly, three by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and three by the president. These commissioners are in office for three year cycles and may be reappointed for additional terms. They are granted full independence while fulfilling their duties as public figures. As of February 2007, the KICAC employed 210 public servants.  Chairmen of the Commission  * Lee Jong Baek (August 2007 - March 2008) * Chung Soung-jin (August 2005 - August 2007) * Lee Nam-joo (March 2003 - August 2004) * Kang Chul-kyu (January 2002 - March 2003)  Main functions  The KICAC engages in nine major functions: #Establishing and coordinating anti-corruption policies #Evaluating the levels of integrity and assessing the anti-corruption practices of public-sector organizations #Improving the legal and institutional framework #Handling reports on allegations of corrupt conduct #Offering protection and rewards to whistleblowers #Promoting ethics in public services #Raising public awareness on the risks of corruption #Promoting public and private partnership against corruption #Engaging in the global fight against corruption The KICAC guides the Korean government in the elimination of corruption by ensuring its anti- corruption policies are implemented by the government and its agencies. The KICAC also refers cases of corruption, reported by general citizens and by public officials, to the relevant authorities for further action.  Recent Accomplishments  *Corruption Impact Assessment (April 2006): A shift from penalty-based anti-corruption methods to the analysis of the factors that cause corruption. Upon analysis, there can be a more direct and systemic response to corruption. Through this systematic assessment, the KICAC identified 358 corruption-causing factors from 113 government proposals in December 2006. These identified factors. *KICAC forged alliances with other anti-corruption agencies around the world, such as the Komisi Pemberantasan Korrupsi (KPK), also known as the Corruption Eradication Commission of Indonesia (CEC), in December 2006. Another important cooperative effort established was with the United Nations Development Program, with which KICAC is conducting a two-year program to provide technical support to four Asian- Pacific countries in their respective battles against corruption. *Amplified democratic systems by acting as a loudspeaker for citizens to speak out against government officials that are suspected of being corrupt. The Citizen Recall Act (May 2006), for instance, allowed voters to oust governors, mayors or local council members who engaged in corrupt practices, negligence of duties, or power abuse. *Blind Trust System (November 2005): financial accounts of senior officials are put into bank trust accounts, which help them carry out their public duties in a transparent manner by preventing possible financial incentives that may compromise their public service ethic. *Expansion of the Korean Pact on Anti-Corruption and Transparency (K-PACT) to include endorsements by 10 central government agencies, 18 public corporations, and 11 local government as of December 2006. Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) The ACRC has a total of 15 commissioners, which include one minister-level chairman, three vice-chairmen, three standing commissioners, and 8 non-standing commissioners. The ACRC has four departments: the Bureau of the Ombudsman, the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, the Bureau of Administrative Appeals, and the Office of Planning and Coordination, which acts as the secretariat. The ACRC follows three policy directions: #Developing an efficient and integrated system designed to reinforce civil rights #Improving the laws and regulations aimed at protecting the population's rights and interests #Cultivating a sense of integrity in society The main functions of the ACRC include: #Responding to public complaints against ineffectual public systems #Preventing and deterring corruption in the public center #Protecting people from illegal and unfair administrative practices through a system of appeals See also *Political corruption *Politics of South Korea *List of government agencies of South Korea References *\\"2006 Annual Report.\\" Korea Independent Commission Against Corruption. *\\"Act Number 8878.\\" Act on Anti-Corruption and the Establishment and Operation of the ACRC. *\\"Taking a Big Stride Forward on Transparency and Civil Rights.\\" Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission. *\\"Transparent Korea: Towards a Brighter Future.\\" Korean Independent Commission Against Corruption.

In the golden era of the 1930s, Titus was one of the great forwards who regularly thrilled the crowds with spectacular goalkicking feats. A lightly built player who seemed at first glance to be too frail for the robust game of Australian football, Titus proved to be one of the great survivors of the game as he set the record for durability that remained unbeaten for a century. Titus continued to serve Richmond for decades after his retirement, a fact acknowledged by the Australian Football League (AFL), which annually presents the \\"Jack Titus Service Award\\" for outstanding service to the game. Playing career Titus was originally recruited to Richmond from Victorian country club Castlemaine competing in the Bendigo Football League. He was noticed by the Tigers' brilliant secretary Percy Page and in 1925 at age 17 invited to play with the Richmond reserves, then known as 'The Cubs'. However, Titus' build caused concern. At just 175 cm and a bit more than 60 kg, Titus would not be considered a potential talent in the modern AFL, let alone play a key forward position as he did then. The Tigers persevered with Titus because of his excellent ball-winning ability and innate goal sense, and hoped that he would gain size as he got older. Titus' early career was a battle for recognition at a powerful club with a number of excellent forwards. He played a single senior game in 1926, and a handful the following year but missed selection in the finals as the team finished runner-up. He attracted notice by winning the reserves best and fairest in 1928, a performance that won him a place in the Tigers' semi-final team. He booted six goals in a match-winning performance, but was more subdued in the Grand Final when Richmond went down to Collingwood for the second consecutive time. By 1929, Titus had established himself in the senior side's forward line, playing alongside Jack Baggott. He won the best and fairest and led the club's goalkicking for the first time, but was held goalless in the Grand Final as the Tigers lost yet again. The Tigers used him as a flanker or in the pocket during the next few years as they desperately sought a combination that could break the jinx caused a succession of Grand Final losses. Finally, Richmond broke through for a premiership in 1932 and Titus was a member of the team. In 1933 and 1934, Richmond faced South Melbourne in two Grand Finals billed as a battle of the best defence (Richmond) against the best attack (South Melbourne). The glamorous Swans triumphed the first time, but Titus was instrumental in his team gaining revenge the following year when he booted six goals to eclipse his rival Bob Pratt, the highest scoring full-forward in the game. In direct contrast to the spectacular Pratt, Titus was a hard working player, solid in the air and getting a lot of goals through opportunism and adept ground play. For the remainder of his career, Titus was a consistent goalkicker and the team's full-forward, even though he regularly conceded several inches to taller opponents and his weight never exceeded 66 kg. His record emphasises consistency rather than big \\"bags\\" of goals, although he did have a number of notable individual performances. As Richmond's success rate slowed, he maintained his output, booting 83 goals in 1935, 84 in 1936, 65 in 1937, 72 in 1938 and 48 in 1939. By now a veteran of the team, he provided leadership to the younger players and a cool head during the big games. He earned a reputation as feisty customer who would deliberately antagonise opponents if he thought they could be distracted. Although protected by the bigger players in the team, such as Jack Dyer, Titus could handle himself and always seemed to emerge from incidents unscathed. Indeed, his ability to front up to play every week became central to his legend as a player. Titus' golden season came in 1940. He led the VFL goalkicking for the first time as Richmond headed into the Grand Final for the first time in six years. Needing three goals to become the first Tiger to boot one hundred in a season, he duly got them, but it was little consolation as his team was thrashed by Melbourne. The next season, he dazzled by twice kicking ten goals in a match (equalling his best personal effort) and winning the best and fairest, but the Tigers were bundled out in the semi-final. A similar story unfolded in 1942 when Richmond lost the Grand Final and Titus set a record (still unbeaten) of playing in his sixth losing Grand Final team. Season 1943 loomed as a record-breaking year for the veteran forward. He was poised to become the second player to reach 300 games and 1000 goals, and break the record streak of 191 consecutive appearances. He did the latter, but sustained serious injury for the first time causing him to miss playing in Richmond's fifth premiership. The club then decided that, at 35, his career was over. Without Titus, the Tigers stumbled to a Grand Final loss against Fitzroy, when Titus could have offered experience and another forward option. Titus accepted the decision gracefully, even though he was left stranded five games short of 300 and 26 goals from 1000. Titus proved a point when he joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Coburg in 1945. He kicked 119 goals for Coburg and then retired in the middle of the next season. In all, he held the following Richmond records at his retirement: * Most games (since broken) * Most goals * Most finals games (since broken) * Most Grand Finals * Most finals goals * Most consecutive games * Most goalkicking awards (since broken) * Most Grand Final losses Titus averaged 3.3 goals per game and just five players in VFL/AFL history have kicked more goals, four of those players competing in an era when more games were played in a season. Titus' record in finals, where he kicked 74 goals, has been bettered by only two men, Gordon Coventry (Collingwood) and Jason Dunstall (Hawthorn). Later career and recognition Following his retirement, Titus served on the Richmond committee from 1944 onwards. Mid-season in 1947 the seconds were caught short and needed an extra player. Aged 39, Titus stepped up and scored 12 goals then retired from playing for the last time. He continued to serve the club loyally as a selector, vice president and VFL delegate for the next three decades until his untimely death. In an emergency during 1965, Titus coached the team from Round 4 onwards after the incumbent, Len Smith, suffered a heart attack. He guided the team to fifth place, an important contribution to the Richmond renaissance of the late 1960s. It was his only coaching effort at any level. A dapper man never seen without a bow tie, Titus maintained his lean physique and always looked younger than his years. Among the recognition for his 50 years service to the Tigers was VFL life membership in 1970 and when the VFL decided to inaugurate an annual award for long and outstanding service to the game, Titus was the first winner. A non-smoker and teetotaller, Titus spent virtually his entire working life running various pubs around Melbourne. He died in 1978 after intervening in an altercation at his pub the Limerick Castle in North Melbourne. (The pub was run by another Richmond player Kevin Morris during the 1980s). The VFL immediately named the recognition of service award after him. Also named in his honour is Richmond's runner-up best and fairest award, the \\"Jack Titus Medal\\". In 1995, much interest centred on Jim Stynes' effort to finally break Titus' mark of 202 [originally thought to be 204] consecutive matches. Some had believed the record invincible, but Stynes eventually extended the mark to 244. Titus' playing number 12 was inherited by Matthew Richardson in the 1990s, who eventually broke Titus' record of eleven club goalkicking awards, another record thought to be safe. Titus was elected to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, and in 1998 he was named as full-forward in the Richmond Team of the Century. He was an inaugural inductee into the Richmond Hall of Fame in 2002, where in 2019 he was elevated to 'Immortal' status.

It was founded in 1903 by a group of ministers and laymen of the Free Methodist Church. The college ceased to exist as an independent accredited entity in 1965 and was merged with another college to eventually form Azusa Pacific University. History The founders of the college were the original founders of the community of Hermon. Initially called Los Angeles Free Methodist Seminary, it was not a seminary for the education of ministers, but a school in which children of the community could be raised in a Christian atmosphere. The Seminary (grades 1-12) opened in the fall of 1904 with 70 students. In 1911 the seminary added a junior college to its school, the first junior college in the state of California. As the community of Hermon continued to expand, a four-year college course was added in 1934 and the school came to be called Los Angeles Pacific College (LAPC). Following a Chicago school fire in the late 1950s, the city of Los Angeles' Department of Building and Safety began the inspection of schools. Many of the aging LAPC buildings were found to be not up to code. Due to a serious lack of funds and the need for safety corrections, the Free Methodist Church divested itself of its interest in the college. Many of the original records and transcripts were lost due to mismanagement, and the proposed merger with Azusa Pacific University. LAPC was merged with a college located in the small town of Azusa outside of Los Angeles in 1965. The college was renamed Azusa Pacific College.

Born in Brandon, County Durham, he played as a goalkeeper for Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Liverpool and Hartlepool United in a career spanning 20 years. Career Stephen Pears started his career at Manchester United as an understudy to Gary Bailey. However, Pears struggled to displace him and break into the first team. During the 1983‚Äì84 season, in order to gain match practice, he was sent to Middlesbrough on loan where he became a fan favourite. Middlesbrough attempted to sign him permanently but the club failed to raise the ¬£80,000 fee. However, Middlesbrough made a second attempt to sign Pears and he transferred to the club permanently in 1985. The following season saw the club get relegated. Despite this, his performances gained him critical acclaim from the fans. In 1987‚Äì88, Pears helped the club win promotion. In this season, Pears also set a club record of seven consecutive clean sheets. Some of his most notable performances this year came against Everton in the FA Cup and against Leicester City in a performance which he dedicated to his late father. Pears went to make over 400 appearances for Middlesbrough from 1983 to 1995. During this time in 1992 he was called up to the England squad but had to pull out of the squad after breaking his cheekbone after a collision with Dion Dublin. He was released in 1995 after a sell out testimonial match, which also became the last ever match at Ayresome Park before Middlesbrough moved to the Riverside Stadium. In this match, Pears was allowed to take a penalty which gave him the prestige of being the last ever person to score a goal at Ayresome Park. Pears then moved on to Liverpool to provide goalkeeping cover for David James, and was issued with the number 27 shirt. However, after making no appearances he moved on to Hartlepool shortly after where he played 19 times before retiring at the age of 35. Coaching career Pears was the Middlesbrough Academy goalkeeping coach where he helped to bring through the likes of Ross Turnbull and David Knight. He moved up from his Academy coach role to become the club's goalkeeping coach in 2007 when Paul Barron left for Newcastle United in 2007. Pears position of goalkeeping coach for the Middlesbrough first team was terminated on 21 November 2013 after Middlesbrough appointed their new manager, Aitor Karanka and he has since been replaced by Leo Percovich. On 4 July 2014, Pears was announced as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach at Hartlepool United. On 5 October, Pears was named caretaker-manager alongside Sam Collins following the departure of Colin Cooper and was kept on as goalkeeping coach following the appointment of Paul Murray as manager on 23 October. On 19 July 2015, Pears was announced as goalkeeping coach at National League side Gateshead.

The crimes were committed over a period of 59 days from February to April 1991 in the children's ward at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital, Lincolnshire, where Allitt was employed as a State Enrolled Nurse. She is supposed to have administered large doses of insulin to at least two of her victims, and a large air bubble was found in the body of another, but police were unable to establish how all the attacks were carried out. In May 1993, at Nottingham Crown Court, she received thirteen life sentences for the crimes. Mr Justice Latham, sentencing, told Allitt that she was \\"a serious danger\\" to others and was unlikely ever to be considered safe enough to be released. She is detained at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire. Early life Beverley Allitt was born on 4 October 1968 and grew up in the village of Corby Glen, near the town of Grantham. She had two sisters and a brother. Her father, Richard, worked in an off-licence, and her mother as a school cleaner. Allitt attended Charles Read Secondary Modern School, having failed the test to enter Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. She would often volunteer for baby-sitting jobs and left school at the age of 16, taking a course in nursing at Grantham College. Victims =Died= *Liam Taylor (seven weeks old)‚Äì was admitted to the ward for a chest infection and was murdered on 22 February 1991. *Timothy Hardwick (eleven years old) ‚Äì a boy with cerebral palsy who was admitted to the ward after having an epileptic seizure. He was murdered on 5 March 1991. *Becky Phillips (two months old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward for gastroenteritis on 1 April 1991. She was administered an insulin overdose by Allitt and died at home two days later; her death was originally believed to have been cot death. *Claire Peck (fifteen months old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward following an asthma attack on 22 April 1991. After being put on a ventilator, she was left alone in Allitt's care for a short interval during which time she went into cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated but died after a second episode of cardiac arrest, again following a period when she was left alone with Allitt. =Recovered= *Kayley Desmond (then one year old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward for a chest infection. Allitt attempted to murder her on 8 March 1991 but the child was resuscitated and transferred to another hospital, where she recovered. *Paul Crampton (then five months old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward for a chest infection on 20 March 1991. Allitt attempted to murder him with an insulin overdose on three occasions the day before he was transferred to another hospital, where he recovered. *Bradley Gibson (then five years old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward for pneumonia. He suffered two cardiac arrests on 21 March 1991, due to Allitt administering insulin overdoses, before he was transferred to another hospital, where he recovered. * Michael Davidson (then six years old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward for post-operative care following an operation to remove an air rifle pellet that he had been injured with in an accident. After being injected with insulin multiple times through a cannula on his hand, he suffered from cyanosis and fell unconscious before being stabilised by other doctors on the ward. He later made a full recovery. *Yik Hung Chan (also known as Henry, then two years old) ‚Äì admitted to the ward following a fall on 21 March 1991. He suffered an oxygen desaturation attack before he was transferred to another hospital, where he recovered. *Katie Phillips (then two months old) ‚Äì Becky's twin was admitted to the ward as a precaution following the death of her sister. She had to be resuscitated twice after unexplained apnoeic episodes (which were later found to be caused by insulin and potassium overdoses). Following the second time that she stopped breathing, she was transferred to another hospital but, by this time, had suffered permanent brain damage, partial paralysis and partial blindness due to oxygen deprivation. Her parents had been so grateful for Allitt's care of Becky that they had asked her to be Katie's godmother. In 1999 Katie was awarded ¬£2.125 million, by Lincolnshire Health Authority, to pay for treatment and equipment for the rest of her life. Lincolnshire Health Authority did not accept liability, but did acknowledge that Katie was entitled to compensation. Trial and imprisonment Allitt had attacked thirteen children, four fatally, over a 59-day period before she was brought up on charges for her crimes. It was only following the death of Peck that medical staff became suspicious of the number of cardiac arrests on the children's ward and police were called in. It was found that Allitt was the only nurse on duty for all the attacks on the children and she also had access to the drugs. Four of Allitt's victims had died. She was charged with four counts of murder, eleven counts of attempted murder and eleven counts of causing grievous bodily harm. Allitt entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. On 28 May 1993, she was found guilty on each charge and sentenced to thirteen concurrent terms of life imprisonment, which she is serving at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire. In the 2018 documentary Trevor McDonald and the Killer Nurse, Allitt reportedly told close friends before her trial that she would never go to prison. After one week in prison she refused to eat or drink and was moved to Rampton Secure Hospital. Two leading experts, forensic psychologist Jeremy Coid and criminologist Elizabeth Yardley examined Allitt's mental state when she was arrested and concluded she was not mentally ill and should be in prison, not hospital. Allitt reportedly admitted to all 13 of her crimes in a failed application to remain at Rampton Secure Hospital and permanently avoid prison. None of the families of Allitt's victims had been told of her full confession in the failed application.Trevor McDonald and the Killer Nurse on IMDB.com On 6 December 2007, Mr Justice Stanley Burnton, sitting in the High Court of Justice, London, confirmed that Allitt must serve the original minimum sentence of thirty years. It was reported that some families of Allitt's victims had previously mistakenly believed that her minimum tariff had been set at forty years. Allitt's motives have never been fully explained. According to one theory, she showed symptoms of factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome or Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This disorder is described as involving a pattern of abuse in which a perpetrator ascribes to, or physically falsifies illnesses in, someone under their care to attract attention to themselves. In popular culture Allitt was the subject of a book called Murder on Ward Four by Nick Davies. A BBC dramatisation of the case, Angel of Death (2005), featured Charlie Brooks as Allitt. Allitt's story was depicted in episodes of the true crime documentaries Crimes That Shook Great Britain, Deadly Women, Born To Kill?, Evil Up Close, and Nurses Who Kill. and Martina Cole's Lady Killers. The song \\"Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" on Black Sabbath's 1994 album Cross Purposes is about the case.

Country singer Frank Ifield immortalised the event with his song ‚ÄúYerranderie‚Äù. The Yerranderie Post Office opened on 1 November 1899 and closed in 1958. The town is now divided into two sections, the residential township adjacent to a private airstrip and the historic site one kilometre further west. The area is surrounded by abandoned mine shafts and mining relics. Accessible mainly by dirt road from Oberon, New South Wales 70 km to the west; another route passes through Oakdale, New South Wales to the east, but that road is closed to public access as it passes through a water catchment area.Gregory's New South Wales State Map Aircraft also occasionally fly out from Camden Airport. The township was established on the slopes north of Yerranderrie Peak, which is the remains of a volcanic dyke and the source of the mineral wealth of the area. The name of Yerranderrie is taken from two local Aboriginal words meaning slope and summit. Yerranderie was caught up in what was, at the time, the world's longest strike, lasting for eighteen months in 1919‚Äì20. The workers of this small mine belonged to the same union as those at Broken Hill. When the Broken Hill mine went on strike, the workers at Yerranderie were required to join that strike by their union. The strike, however, was not about any issue at Yerranderie. The town was eventually bought by Valerie Anne Lhuede, who developed it as a tourist centre and total environment project. The old post office is now known as The Lodge and serves as a guest house. Other restored buildings include two miners cottages as well as several shops. The caretakers live in Krubi Cottage nearby.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, pp.316-318 In March 2011, Lhuede announced, \\"I am donating Yerranderie to the National Parks and Wildlife Service with a list of my wishes for Yerranderie‚Äôs future.\\" Gallery Image:yerranderrie-air.jpgYerranderie from the air Image:(1)Yerranderie_church.jpgOld church, Yerranderie Image:(1)Yerranderie_ruins_of_home.jpgRuins at Yerranderie Image:(1)Yerranderie_ruins.jpgRuins at Yerranderie Image:(1)Yerranderie_Peak.jpgYerranderie Peak See also *Blue Mountains External links * National Parks and Wildlife Service - Yerranderie Private Town References Towns in New South Wales Ghost towns in New South Wales Wollondilly Shire Mining towns in New South Wales ","title":"Yerranderie"},{"id":"5018073","text":"\\"Cross Road Blues\\" (also known as \\"Crossroads\\") is a blues song written and recorded by American blues artist Robert Johnson in 1936. Johnson performed it as a solo piece with his vocal and acoustic slide guitar in the Delta blues- style. The song has become part of the Robert Johnson mythology as referring to the place where he supposedly sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical talents, although the lyrics do not contain any specific references. Bluesman Elmore James revived the song with recordings in 1954 and 1960‚Äì1961. English guitarist Eric Clapton with Cream popularized the song as \\"Crossroads\\" in the late 1960s. Their blues rock interpretation inspired many cover versions and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". Rolling Stone placed it at number three on the magazine's list of the \\"Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\" in recognition of Clapton's guitar work. Recording In October 1936, Johnson auditioned for music store owner and sometime talent scout H. C. Speir in Jackson, Mississippi; Speir passed on Johnson's contact information to Ernie Oertle, who was a representative for ARC Records. After a second audition, Oertle arranged for Johnson to travel to San Antonio, Texas, for a recording session. Johnson recorded 22 songs for ARC over three days from November 23 to 27, 1936. During the first session, he recorded his most commercially appealing songs. They mostly represented his original pieces and reflected current, piano-influenced musical trends. The songs include \\"Terraplane Blues\\" (his first single and most popular record) along with \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" and \\"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\\", which became blues standards after others recorded them. A second and third recording date took place in San Antonio after a two-day break. The material Johnson chose shows more variety than that for his first date and he reached back into his long-standing repertoire for songs to record. The material reflects the styles of country blues performers Charley Patton and Son House, who influenced Johnson in his youth and are among Johnson's most heartfelt and forceful. \\"Cross Road Blues\\" was recorded during Johnson's third session in San Antonio, on Friday, November 27, 1936. The sessions continued at an improvised studio in Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel. ARC producer Don Law supervised the recording and used a portable disc cutting machine. It is unknown what input, if any, Law had into Johnson's selection of material to record or how to present it. Two similar takes of the song were recorded. Lyrics and interpretation Tourism marker at intersection of historical Highways 61 and 49 in Clarksdale, Mississippi (one of several purported crossroads sites) A crossroads or an intersection of rural roads is one of the few landmarks in the Mississippi Delta, a flat featureless plain between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers. It is part of the local iconography and various businesses use the name, such as gas stations, banks, and retail shops. A crossroads is also where cars are more likely to slow down or stop, thus presenting the best opportunity for a hitchiker. In the simplest reading, Johnson describes his grief at being unable to catch a ride at an intersection before the sun sets. However, many see different levels of meaning and some have attached a supernatural significance to the song. Both versions of the song open with the protagonist kneeling at a crossroads to ask God's mercy, while the second sections tells of his failed attempts to hitch a ride. In the third and fourth sections, he expresses apprehension at being stranded as darkness approaches and asks that his friend Willie Brown be advised that \\"I'm sinkin' down\\". The first take of the song, which was used for the single, includes a fifth verse that is not included in the second take. In it he laments not having a \\"sweet woman\\" in his distress. The song has been used to perpetuate the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability. The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). Music historians believe that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. However, Johnson later recorded two songs that include Satanic references: in \\"Hellhound on My Trail\\" tells of trying to stay ahead of the demon hound which is pursuing him and in \\"Me and the Devil Blues\\" he sings, \\"Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my door, and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'\\". These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree \\"the 'devil angle' made for good marketing\\". Blues historian Samuel Charters sees the song as having elements of protest and social commentary. The second verse includes \\"the sun goin' down now boy, dark gon' catch me here\\", a reference to the \\"sundown laws\\" or curfew during racial segregation in the United States. Signs in the rural South advised \\"Nigger, don't let the sun set on you here\\". Johnson may be expressing a real fear of trumped up vagrancy charges or even lynchings that still took place. Others suggest that the song is about a deeper and more personal loneliness. Writers Barry Lee Pearson and Bill McCulloch argue that the fifth verse in the single version captures the essence of the song: \\"left alone, abandoned, or mistreated, he stands at the crossroad, looking this way or that for his woman\\". Composition \\"Cross Road Blues\\" reflects Johnson's Delta blues roots and may have been in his repertoire since 1932. It is the first recording to show his mastery of his mentor Son House's style, particularly in his slide guitar work. Music historian Edward Komara identifies parts of \\"Straight Alky Blues\\" by Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell (1929) along with Roosevelt Sykes' subsequent adaptation as \\"Black River Blues\\" (1930) as melodic precedents. However, Johnson infuses their relaxed urban approach with a more forceful rural one. Komara terms Johnson's guitar playing a \\"blues harp style\\". It contrasts with Johnson's finger-picking \\"piano style\\", which uses a boogie-style accompaniment on the bass strings while playing melody and harmonies on the higher strings. Harp-style playing employs sharp percussive accents on the bass strings (an imitation of the sharp draw used by harmonica players) and allows Johnson to explore different chordings and fills. Johnson uses this technique for \\"Terraplane Blues\\", which shares many common elements with \\"Cross Road Blues\\". The song's structure differs from a well-defined twelve-bar blues. The verses are not consistent and range from fourteen to fifteen bars in length. Additionally, the harmonic progression is often implied rather than stated (full IV and V chords are not used). Johnson uses a Spanish or open G tuning with the guitar tuned up to the key of B. This facilitates Johnson's use of a slide, which features as prominently in the song as the vocal. The slide parts function more as a second \\"answer\\" vocal than accompaniment, with the tension underscoring the dark turmoil of the lyrics. Charters characterizes the song's rhythm as ambiguous, imparting both a 4/4 time and 8/8 feel. Music writer Dave Headlam elaborates on Johnson's rhythm: The two takes of the song are performed at moderate, but somewhat different tempos. Both begin slower and speed up; the first is about 106 beats per minute (bpm), while the second is about 96 bpm. Johnson prepares to go into the fifth section for the slower second take, but the engineer apparently cut him off because of the time limits of ten-inch 78 rpm records. In addition to the slower tempo, Johnson sings the verses at a lower pitch, although both takes are in the same key. This allows for greater variation and nuance in the vocal. Together with refinements to some guitar parts, the differences serve to help further distinguish the second take from \\"Terraplane Blues\\" and give it more of its own character. Releases ARC and Vocalion Records issued the first take of \\"Cross Road Blues\\" in May 1937 on the then standard 78 rpm record. With the flip side \\"Ramblin' on My Mind\\", it was the third of eleven singles released during Johnson's lifetime. Vocalion's budget labels Perfect Records and Romeo Records also released the single for sale by dime stores. Although sales figures are not available, the record was \\"widely heard in the Delta\\" and Johnson's tunes were found in jukeboxes in the region. As with most of Johnson's recordings, \\"Cross Road Blues\\" remained out of print after its initial release until The Complete Recordings box set in 1990. The second take was released in 1961, when producer Frank Driggs substituted it for the original on Johnson's first long-playing record album compilation King of the Delta Blues Singers. This take was also included on the 1990 Complete Recordings (at 2:29, it is 10 seconds shorter than the original 2:39 single version). Elmore James versions American blues singer and guitarist Elmore James, who popularized Robert Johnson's \\"Dust My Broom\\", recorded two variations on \\"Cross Road Blues\\". Both titled \\"Standing at the Crossroads\\", they feature James' trademark \\"Dust My Broom\\" amplified slide- guitar figure and a backing ensemble. James' lyrics focus on the lost-love aspect of the song: James first recorded the song in August 1954 at Modern Records' new studio in Culver City, California. Maxwell Davis supervised the session and a group of professional studio musicians provided the backup. The song was produced in a newer style that Modern used successfully for B.B. King and James' slide guitar was placed further back in the mix. Flair Records, another of the Bihari brothers' Modern labels, released the single, backed with \\"Sunny Land\\". The song became a regional hit, but did not reach the national charts. Labels associated with Modern included \\"Standing at the Crossroads\\" on several James compilation albums, such as Blues After Hours (Crown), The Blues in My Heart ‚Äì The Rhythm in My Soul (Custom Records), and Original Folk Blues (Kent Records). In 1959, producer Bobby Robinson signed James to his Fury/Fire/Enjoy group of labels. In addition to new material, Robinson had James revisit several of his older songs, including \\"Standing at the Crossroads\\". James re-recorded it at Beltone Studios in New York City in late 1960 or early 1961 during one of his last sessions. Studio musicians again provided the backup and the horn section included baritone saxophone by Paul Williams. Bell Records' subsidiary labels released the song after James' death in 1965 ‚Äì Flashback Records released a single with a reissue of \\"The Sky Is Crying\\" and Sphere Sound Records included it on a James compilation album also titled The Sky Is Crying. Both the 1954 and 1960‚Äì1961 versions appear on numerous later James compilations. Homesick James, who recorded and toured with his cousin Elmore, also recorded a rendition titled \\"Crossroads\\". Homesick derived his guitar style from Elmore, which music critic Bill Dahl describes as \\"aggressive, sometimes chaotic slide work\\". Unlike Elmore, however, he uses most of the lyrics from Johnson's second take, which had been first issued in 1961. The July 23, 1963, recording session produced Homesick's only single for Chicago-based USA Records, \\"Crossroads\\" backed with \\"My Baby's Sweet\\". Eric Clapton/Cream interpretation =Background= In early 1966, while still with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton adapted the song for a recording session with an ad hoc studio group, dubbed Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. Elektra Records producer Joe Boyd brought together Steve Winwood on vocals, Clapton on guitar, Jack Bruce on bass guitar, Paul Jones on harmonica, Ben Palmer on piano, and Pete York on drums for the project. Boyd recalled that he and Clapton reviewed potential songs; Clapton wanted to record Albert King's \\"Crosscut Saw\\", but Boyd preferred to adapt an older country blues. Their attention turned to Robert Johnson songs and Boyd proposed \\"Crossroads\\" and Clapton chose \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\". For the recording, Clapton developed an arrangement using lyrics from both songs with an adaption of the guitar line from the latter. Biographer Michael Schumacher describes the Powerhouse's performance as slower and more blues-based than Cream's. Winwood sings and Jones plays the riff on harmonica similar to what Clapton later used with Cream (Jones also provides the instrumental solo; Clapton plays rhythm guitar throughout the song). Elektra released the 2:32 recording, titled \\"Crossroads\\", on the compilation album What's Shakin' in June 1966. After the Powerhouse session, Clapton continued playing with Mayall. Author Marc Roberty lists \\"Crossroads\\" in a typical set for the Bluesbreakers in the spring of 1966. =Cream version= \\"Crossroads\\" became a part of Cream's repertoire when Clapton began performing with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker in July 1966. Their version features a prominent guitar riff with hard-driving, upbeat instrumental backing and soloing. Clapton previously recorded \\"Ramblin' on My Mind\\" with Mayall and \\"From Four Until Late\\" with Cream using arrangements that followed Johnson's original songs more closely. However, he envisioned \\"Crossroads\\" as a rock song: Clapton simplifies Johnson's guitar line and sets it to a straight eighth-note or rock rhythm. He and Bruce on bass continuously emphasize the riff throughout the song to give it a strong and regular metric drive combined with Baker's drumming. Johnson's irregular measures are also standardized to typical twelve-bar sections in which the I‚ÄìIV‚ÄìV blues progression is clearly stated. Clapton does not adapt Johnson's slide guitar technique or open tuning; instead he follows the electric guitar soloing approach of B.B. King and Albert King. However, he employs a Johnson guitar innovation, the duple shuffle pattern or boogie bass line, while singing (Johnson only used it for two bars in \\"Cross Road Blues\\"). Clapton also simplifies and standardizes Johnson's vocal lines. Schumacher calls Clapton's vocal on \\"Crossroads\\" his best and most assured with Cream. In addition to Johnson's opening and closing lyrics, he twice adds the same section from \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\": During the instrumental break, Cream takes an improvisational approach characteristic of their later live performances. Bruce's bass lines blend rhythm and harmony and Baker adds fills and more complex techniques typical of drummers in jazz trios. However, the momentum is never allowed to dissipate and is constantly reinforced. =Recording and releases= Cream recorded the song on November 28, 1966, for broadcast on the BBC Guitar Club radio program. At less than two minutes in length, Clapton only sings the first and last sections, with his guitar solo replacing the middle \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" verse. It appeared on bootleg albums before finally being released in 2003 on BBC Sessions. On March 10, 1968, Cream recorded it again during a concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. The song became the opening number on the live half of Cream's Wheels of Fire double album, released in August 1968 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US. After the group's breakup, Atco issued the song as a single in January 1969, which reached number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 pop chart and 17 on Cashbox. Both the original album and single credit the songwriter as Robert Johnson or R. Johnson, although Clapton and Cream extensively reworked the song. Cream played \\"Crossroads\\" during their final concert at the Royal Albert Hall on November 26, 1968. The expanded version of Cream's Farewell Concert film released in 1977 contains the performance. During their 2005 reunion, Cream revisited the song at the Royal Albert Hall and it is included on the Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005 album and video. After Cream's breakup in 1968, Clapton continued to perform \\"Crossroads\\" in a variety of settings. Live recordings appear on Live at the Fillmore (with Derek and the Dominos), Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies, The Secret Policeman's Other Ball, and other albums. Clapton has also used the name for the Crossroads Centre, a drug rehabilitation facility he founded, and for the Crossroads Guitar Festivals to benefit it. Editing on album version Clapton biographer Schumacher notes \\"Given the passion of the solo performances on 'Crossroads,' it seems almost miraculous that Cream is able to return to the song itself.\\" Several music writers have explained that Cream's recording for Wheels of Fire was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for the trioin the notes for Clapton's Crossroads box set, Anthony DeCurtis credits the trimming to engineer Tom Dowd, while critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the editing to producer Felix Pappalardi, who \\"cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes\\", to allow the song's drive more continuity. In a 1985 interview, Clapton was asked if the song had been edited. He replied: However, Barry Levenson, who produced Cream's 1997 box set Those Were the Days, asserts: Recognition and influence In 1986, Robert Johnson's \\"Cross Road Blues\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. Writing for the foundation, Jim O'Neal noted that \\"regardless of mythology and rock 'n' roll renditions, Johnson's record was indeed a powerful one, a song that would stand the test of time on its own\\". In 1998, it received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award to acknowledge its quality and place in recording history. In 1995, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed Cream's \\"Crossroads\\" as one of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number three on its \\"Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\\". AllMusic's Richard Gilliam identifies Cream's \\"Crossroads\\" as the first recording to bring Robert Johnson to the attention of popular music audiences and allow reissues of his original recordings to sell over a million copies. By combining elements of hard rock and blues, he adds it inspired \\"a new generation of blues-influenced artists\\". Rock musicians have recorded numerous renditions based on Cream's arrangement.

The brigade was part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, and for most of its wartime existence consisted of three battalions of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI) the 6th, 8th and 9th. History =Order of Battle= 151st Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 6th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry * 8th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry * 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (until 30 November 1944) * 151st Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 7 December 1939, disbanded 1 January 1941) * 151st Infantry Brigade Special Company (from 7 July until 31 December 1943) * 1/7th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) (from 4 December 1944)Orders of Battle.com - 151 Infantry Brigade =Commanders= The following officers commanded 151st Brigade during the war: * Brigadier J. A. Churchill * Brigadier H. Redman * Lieutenant Colonel C. W. Beart (acting) * Brigadier J. S. Nichols * Lieutenant Colonel M. K. Jackson (acting) * Lieutenant Colonel M. N. Dewing (acting) * Brigadier J. E. S. Percy * Brigadier D. M. W. Beak * Brigadier R. H. Senior * Lieutenant Colonel R. P. Lidwill (acting) * Brigadier B. B. Walton * Lieutenant Colonel R. P. Lidwill (acting) * Brigadier D. S. Gordon * Brigadier J. F. Walker =Battle of France= Arras counter-attack 21 May 1940 50th Division with the Brigade was deployed to France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in January 1940. The BEF was deployed on the border of Belgium, around the city of Lille. In May 1940, German armoured forces broke through French positions east of the BEF, and moved rapidly across its rear, separating it from the main French armies. Arras counterattack To close this gap, General Weygand ordered a counterattack by British forces around the city of Arras. \\"Frankforce\\" was to include the 5th and 50th Divisions and the 1st Army Tank Brigade. The attack was actually made by just two battalions of the 151st Brigade, the 6th and 8th DLI, with the 4th and 7th Royal Tank Regiments. The attack made significant progress before it was stopped, and the shocked Germans estimated that five divisions had attacked. It may have been one of the factors for the surprise German halt on 24 May that let the BEF begin evacuation from Dunkirk. Evacuation After the failure of the Arras attack, the BEF had to get out of France. Most of 151st Brigade and 50th Division were fortunate enough to be evacuated from Dunkirk, but had to leave all equipment behind. On returning home, 151st Infantry Brigade and 150th Infantry Brigade were joined by the 69th Infantry Brigade, from the now disbanded 23rd (Northumbrian) Division (formed as a duplicate of the 50th Division), to complete 50th Division and bring it up to standard infantry division establishment. The 151st Brigade was brought up to strength, largely with drafts of men from other regiments, with the 9th DLI receiving men from the King's Shropshire Light Infantry, the 6th from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and only the 8th receiving from the DLI. Together with the rest of the 50th Division, the brigade prepared to repel an expected German invasion. The 50th Division remained in Britain until 22 April 1941, when it was sent to the Middle East. =North Africa= In April 1941, 50th Division with the Brigade was dispatched to the Middle East. The Brigade was first deployed in Cyprus, then in Iraq, Syria, and Egypt. In May 1942, 50th Division was deployed in Libya as part of XIII Corps in Eighth Army. Battle of Gazala Battle of Gazala in May 1942, in the vicinity of Tobruk On 27 May 1942, General Erwin Rommel, commander of the German-Italian Afrika Korps, attacked the Allied position at Gazala, leading the Afrika Korps in a flanking march around the left (southern) end of the Allied line. The 50th (Northumbrian) Division held the centre of the Allied line, with 151st Brigade on its right (see map at right-151st Brigade's \\"box\\" is due south of the town of Gazala). During the battle, the 151st Brigade, commanded by Brigadier John S. Nichols since late January 1942, remained facing east against a feigned Axis attack, and did repulse a feinting attack by Italian troops. By 14 June, Rommel had achieved a decisive victory, and the Eighth Army ordered the evacuation of the Gazala line. The 50th Division was cut off from the coast road to Tobruk, so Major-General William Ramsden, the divisional commander, ordered 151st Brigade (and 69th Brigade) to break through the Italian forces to their front, then circle south before turning east. This remarkable manoeuvre succeeded completely. On the evening of 14 June, 8th Battalion, DLI made 151st Brigade's breakthrough, and the rest of the Brigade followed, except for the 9th Battalion, DLI. 9th DLI was cut off to the west, went north, and joined 1st South African Division's retreat along the coast. The rest of 151st Brigade continued east into Egypt, where the 9th DLI rejoined them. Mersa Matruh 50th Division was transferred to X Corps on 24 June.Orders of Battle.com - 50 (Northumbrian) Infantry Division Eighth Army ordered X Corps and XIII Corps to make a rear-guard stand at Mersa Matruh. 151st Brigade was deployed about 17 miles south of Mersa Matruh. On 27 June, the German 90th Light Division attacked 151st Brigade, striking 9th DLI which lost 300 prisoners. On 28 June, British forces abandoned the Mersa Matruh position. On 1 July, 50th Division was withdrawn into Eighth Army reserve in Egypt. =Private Adam Wakenshaw VC= Adam Herbert Wakenshaw, 28-year-old private in the 9th DLI, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valiant actions in the face of the enemy on 27 June 1942 south of Mersa Matruh. El Alamein Deployment of forces on the eve of battle On 5 October, 50th Division rejoined XIII Corps in preparation for the Second Battle of El Alamein. During the opening phase of the battle (24‚Äì25 October), 50th Division attacked the Italian 185th Parachute Division Folgore in the southern part of the line with little success. On 29 October, 151st Brigade was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division for Operation Supercharge, a new attack at \\"Kidney Ridge\\" on 2 November. 151st Brigade was on the right for the initial drive through the German minefields, which started at 1 AM and was a success. The next afternoon, while the tank forces battled, 151st Brigade pressed on to \\"SKINFLINT\\", a position about two miles west-south-west of Kidney Ridge. That evening, 151st Brigade was withdrawn to XXX Corps reserve, and took no further part in the battle. On 11 November it was returned to 50th Division. Tunisia Tunisia campaign By March 1943, Eighth Army had driven Axis forces all the way across Libya and into Tunisia. Here the Axis forces made a stand, occupying the old French fortifications of the Mareth Line. 50th Division, now part of XXX Corps, was part of the initial assault on 19 March 1943 (Operation Pugilist). After the collapse of the Mareth Line, Axis forces retreated north, shortening the front. On 24 April, 50th Division was withdrawn to Eighth Army reserve. =Invasion of Sicily= Allied landings in Sicily on 10 July 1943 50th Division, with the Brigade, was again assigned to XIII Corps for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 10 July, the 151st Brigade landed in the Gulf of Noto, at Avola; its objective was the hills above the landing beaches. The Brigade fought in eastern Sicily until 13 August, a few days before the fall of Messina. =Northwest Europe= D-Day Routes taken by the D-Day invasion After Sicily, 50th Division, including the Brigade, did not participate in the Allied invasion of Italy. Instead, by request of General Bernard Law Montgomery, on 19 October 1943, 50th Division was withdrawn to Britain for reforming and training, in preparation for the invasion of northwest Europe. The Division and Brigade were under XXX Corps in the British Second Army. =Assignment= 50th Division was designated to land on Gold Beach, in company with the 8th Armoured Brigade. The 151st Brigade was part of the second wave, to land after the beach was secure and push inland. The Brigade was to move southwest from Gold Beach toward Route Nationale 13. Troops take shelter near an M10 tank destroyer,6 June 1944 Officers inspect a German Mk IV tank knocked out by the Durham Light Infantry ‚Äì 11 June 1944. =Action= The 151st Brigade came ashore as planned, and got to the outskirts of Bayeux. During the next week the Brigade advanced past Bayeux. On 14 June, the Brigade fought in Operation Perch against the Panzer Lehr Division. The Brigade made the initial assault on the villages of Ling√®vres and Les Verri√®res, which were captured by the 9th DLI. Later that day the Brigade and the 231st Brigade, also of the 50th Division, were cut off south of the villages, formed a \\"brigade box\\" and repulsed heavy German counterattacks before withdrawing. The Brigade continued to fight in Normandy until the German rout in August. Operation Market Garden 151st Brigade was part of Garden, the ground component of Operation Market-Garden. The Garden force was XXX Corps, spearheaded by the Guards Armoured Division, with the 43rd Wessex and 50th Division in reserve. On 23 September, 151st Brigade was ordered to move north and east of Eindhoven with 231st Brigade to guard the right flank. On 30 September, all of 50th Division was tasked with guarding the bridge and bridgehead north of Nijmegen, called \\"the Island\\". The first German counterattack was by seventy tanks and the equivalent of an infantry division. There were several more strong German attacks, and 50th Division and the Brigade took substantial losses. =Training service= After this very heavy fighting, 50th Division and the Brigade were pulled out of action. On 2 December, the Division and Brigade were withdrawn to Britain, and converted to training formations. The 9th DLI was removed from the Brigade, and replaced by 1st/7th Battalion of the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment. Postwar When 50th (Northumbrian) Division was reconstituted in the Territorial Army in 1947, 151st Brigade was reformed as 151 (Yorkshire & Durham) Infantry Brigade (the subtitle had originally been that of the 150th Brigade of World War I).

Pogor (Francized Basile Pogor; August 20, 1833 ‚Äì March 20, 1906) was a Moldavian, later Romanian poet, philosopher, translator and liberal conservative politician, one of the founders of Junimea literary society. Raised in the aristocratic circle of Ia»ôi, and educated in the French Empire, he had a career in law. He was a civil servant during the United Principalities regime, held seats and commissions in the Assembly of Deputies, and, after the proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania, was Mayor of Ia»ôi City. Although he had a major role in creating the Conservative Party, by fusing together the various \\"White\\" political clubs and Masonic Lodges, Pogor was more loyal to the Junimist inner faction, and stood by it when it split with the other Conservatives. An irreligious evolutionist, and taking an interest in Buddhist studies, Pogor represented the Positivist cell at Junimea. He was also one of the first locals to study the work of Henry Thomas Buckle, integrating Bucklean concepts into Junimeas critique of nation building. He supported Romania's Westernization within a conservative framework, tempering nationalist presumptions and valuing a culturally pluralistic society. The notoriously indolent and improvident Pogor had a preference for orality, and was sought after for his Voltairian wit. He left few written works, and many unfulfilled projects, but influenced Romanian literature as a cultural promoter, sponsor, and the first local expert on Charles Baudelaire. He was known to his Junimea colleagues as a one-man \\"contemporary library\\". Pogor's final decades were spent away from the national scene, although he still took on assignments in the Conservative and Junimist chapters of Ia»ôi County. Casa Pogor, his main residence, is closely associated with Junimist history. Although sold by its debt-stricken owner in 1901, it was revived in the 1970s as a literary history museum, theater venue and concert hall. Married to the Russian aristocrat Elena Hartingh, Pogor left an illegitimate son, Vasile Panopol. Biography =Origins and childhood= According to various accounts, the Pogors were a clan of yeomen from the eponymous PogorƒÉ»ôti, raised into boyar nobility ca. 1820.Bezviconi, pp. 58‚Äì59; Vianu, p. 79 The family's own pedigree claimed otherwise, namely that its members had been \\"enjoying native privileges\\" since ancient times.CƒÉlinescu, p. 92 On the basis of such claims, Vasile Pogor Sr had a steady climb through the Moldavian civilian and military bureaucracy: he began his career as a Serdar (1819), before being made a Comis for life. During his 1816‚Äì1823 mission into the Bessarabian Governorate, Russian Empire, Pogor kidnapped Zoi»õa Cerchez, granddaughter of a local Clucer.Bezviconi, p. 59 From this marriage, he had three daughters‚ÄîAntonia, Eleonora, Smaranda‚Äîand a son, the future poet.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 92, 437. See also Bezviconi, pp. 59, 87 By the time of his birth, the family owned large boyar estates in both Vaslui County (including BuhƒÉie»ôti and R√¢»ôe»ôti) and Bessarabia. As a political poet in the Age of Revolution, Comis Pogor looked back with disgust on the late Phanariote period and the Eterist invasion, satirizing the ambitions of Greek immigrants to Moldavia. In the late 1830s, he would be equally opposed to the Moldavian status quo, criticizing the heavy-handed Moldavian sovereign Mihail Sturdza. His rhyming pamphlets envisaged equality before the law, their author having signed up to the \\"Confederative Conspiracy\\", planned by Moldavia's proto- liberal boyardom.Vianu, p. 80 He still held several high political-judicial offices in the last quarter of Sturdza, including the Agie and the Justice Department chairmanship.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 91, 92 Pogor Sr's worldview also owed much to his familiarity with French literature. He corresponded with Chateaubriand, wishing to publish his poetry in a Moldavian edition,CƒÉlinescu, p. 91 but is probably best known as Voltaire's first Romanian-language translator. His version of the Henriade was published in neighboring Wallachia by the liberal intellectual Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu.CƒÉlinescu, p. 91; Vianu, p. 80 It and other translations by the Comis (Za√Øre, D√©sastre de Lisbonne) may prove that Pogor the younger was already familiar with Voltaire and Voltarianism from early childhood.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 91, 436 Teodor Veisa's drawing of the 1849 departure for Krak√≥w Born in Ia»ôi, the Moldavian capital, Vasile Jr was selected for the most modern forms of education available to Moldavians living in the 1840s. He first attended the liberal arts' school of Frenchman Malgovern√©, and, in addition to discovering an interest in literature, became a skilled amateur draftsman.CƒÉlinescu, p. 437; Vianu, pp. 80, 82 In October 1849, young Pogor took the stagecoach ride to Krak√≥w, and then the train to Paris, accompanied by the boyar heirs Heraclide, Porfiriu, Miclescu and Teodor Veisa, and chaperoned by Malgovern√© himself. The scene of their departure from Ia»ôi is preserved in a sketch drawing by Veisa, which shows the enthusiastic adolescents leaning out the carriage doors.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 437, 440 =French and German education= Pogor completed his education in France. He is widely seen as formed by French education, but, according to cultural sociologist Zigu Ornea, this is only part of the story: Pogor did not graduate from a lyc√©e, but was actually trained at a Germanophone boarding school; was not introduced to Bonapartism, but to \\"the ideological principles of Restoration\\".Ornea (I), p. 143 As argued by author Gheorghe Manolache, Pogor was one of those who saw French culture as \\"speculative\\", and sought to amend its influence with German or Anglophone borrowings. Gheorghe Manolache, \\"Sub patronajul Junimii din Ia»ôi (1863‚Äì1874). Literaritate »ôi literalitate sau arta de a traduce pe Schiller\\" in Transilvania, Nr. 10‚Äì11/2005, p. 24 In late 1851, he took an extended study trip through the German Confederation, in lieu of service in the Moldavian military forces. The Moldavian state granted him dispensation, and awarded him the rank of Cadet.CƒÉlinescu, p. 437 Pogor was subsequently enlisted at the University of Paris Law School, where he took his doctorate in law. Lucian Vasiliu, \\"Vasile Pogor-fiul\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2003CƒÉlinescu, p. 419 His contact with the Parisian salons was of major formative importance: he was an avid reader and, as literary historian Tudor Vianu notes, \\"always open to new things, ready to defeat prejudice\\", if rather indiscriminate.Vianu, pp. 80‚Äì81 Pogor's one constant was the study of the classics: he reread Homer's Iliad and Odyssey once every year.CƒÉlinescu, p. 437; Vianu, p. 81 His other known pursuits were non-academic. Pogor discovered com√©die en vaudeville theater, kept company with mature women, and began fantasizing about writing his own novels and short stories. The Pogors enjoyed high political profiles during and after the Crimean War, when the Moldavian and Wallachian principalities became a condominium of the Great Powers. Before his death in 1857, Pogor Sr was head of the appellate court (Divanul de apel, later Curtea de apel), and one of the boyars tasked with welcoming in the foreign overseers. Upon his return to Moldavia, the young lawyer became sole owner of a palatial residence, Casa Pogor, built by his father in 1850, on land previously owned by the Cerchez and Coroi boyars. Constantin Coroiu, \\"Casele scriitorilor (IV)\\", in Cultura, Nr. 247, October 2009 He also took assignments in the judicial apparatus. He was a judge in Ia»ôi from 1857 to 1858, and a member of the appellate court after March 1859. Although cutting the figure of an eccentric among the stern bureaucrats, he managed to impress Costache Negruzzi, his hierarchical superior and celebrated novelist. In his account, Pogor displayed \\"something rare in our folk\\": \\"a great feeling for justice\\". Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Un loc gol pe afi»ô\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 41/2006 The Pogors still maintained close links with the areas on the other side of the Prut River: Antonia Pogor became the wife of Bessarabian boyar Dumitru Bant√Æ»ô.Bezviconi, p. 87; CƒÉlinescu, p. 437 When he married the Bessarabian heiress Elena Hartingh, Vasile established a connection with Russian nobility. His father-in-law was a Karl \\"Scarlat\\" Hartingh (or Garting), owner of an estate in Pohrebeni.Bezviconi, pp. 59, 116; CƒÉlinescu, p. 437 Elena's grandfather was Ivan Markovich Garting, an ethnic Finn who had served as Bessarabian Governor; her grandmother, \\"Elenco\\" Hartinga, was closely related to the high-ranking boyardom of Moldavia.Bezviconi, p. 116; Nicolae Iorga, \\"Testamentul unei nepoate de fiicƒÉ, mame »ôi surori de Domni moldoveni\\", in Revista IstoricƒÉ, Nr. 7‚Äì9/1931, pp. 153‚Äì163 =Junimea creation= Casa Pogor in 2009 From early 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia formed a single Romanian state, known as the \\"United Principalities\\" and ruled upon by Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Still employed by the Moldavian appellate court under Cuza's regime, Pogor objected to the fiscal policies of Premier Nicolae Cre»õulescu, and resigned in September 1863, shortly followed by his colleague Alexandru Papadopol-Calimah.X., \\"NƒÉpƒÉstiile Uniriƒ≠. IV. Suferin»õele Moldoveƒ≠\\", in RomƒÉnul≈≠, September 25, 1863, p. 848 By then, he had resumed his literary projects. The first achievement of Pogor's work as a translator was his retelling of Goethe's Faust I, with Nicolai Skelitti as co-author, saw print in 1862.Vianu, p. 81 Corina Jiva, \\"Suntem √ÆncƒÉ √Æn anul Noica\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 50/2009 Dan MƒÉnucƒÉ, \\"Modelul junimist\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 48/2008 Samples of his own poetry were published by the pro-Cuza magazine Din Moldova, whose editor was a future enemy, the Romantic novelist and scholar Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. Teodor V√¢rgolici, \\"Revistele lui B. P. Hasdeu\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 30/2009 The United Principalities era saw Pogor's activity blending into the cultural projects of Junimea literary society. Founded in stages ca. 1863, that club was originally focused on literary debates and popular education. Its founders were five young graduates, all but one of them boyars. Pogor and Theodor Rosetti were French-trained; Petre P. Carp and Iacob Negruzzi (Costache's son) had studied in the German Confederation. The fifth was Titu Maiorescu, an upper-middle-class intellectual trained in both French and German schools, generally seen as the leading voice of Junimism, the cultural and political concept.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 397, 399, 419; Ornea (I), pp. 1‚Äì42; Vianu, pp. 6‚Äì7 Little is known about the first years of Junimism. The five founders left only a handful of notes on the subject, and discouraged others from investigating the topic. Pogor himself mystified on the subject: he laughed off the historiographic attempts and, playfully reusing a literary clich√©, informed newer members of the club that \\"Junimeas origin is lost in the mist of time\\". Mihai Dim. Sturdza, \\"Junimea, societate secretƒÉ (II)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, July 2004Ornea (I), p. 13 His version of events subverted other accounts, including the vague memoirs of Iacob Negruzzi. Pogor thus claimed that Junimea existed in large part because of him. In Pogor's account, the first manifestation of what would become Junimea was a study group comprising himself, Skelitti, Papadopol-Calimah, Theodor Aslan, Iorgu Gane, Ioan Ianov, and some other prominent Ia»ôi intellectuals; to the irritation of other Junimists, he constantly backdated Junimeas existence to 1862.Ornea (I), pp. 14‚Äì15 His account is not validated by the written records, and other sources (themselves scanty) suggest that, although invited by Maiorescu, Pogor did not in fact attend the so-called \\"first Junimea meeting\\" (February 9, 1864).Ornea (I), pp. 15‚Äì16 Pogor was nonetheless present at other (possibly earlier) gatherings, which gave a more formal status to the reunions. In his half- mythical narrative of events, presented at later Junimea banquets, Pogor insisted that the first day of Junimism was a Friday (vineri), and that, as such, the club was under the divine patronage of Venus.Ornea (I), pp. 34‚Äì35 Based on the available reconstructions of events, the club's name seems to have been selected by Rosetti, and ceremoniously validated by Pogor‚Äîwhom the other founders already recognized as their enfant terrible.Ornea (I), pp. 17‚Äì18, 30, 36‚Äì37; Vianu, pp. 18, 81 The resulting society had little in the way of a published program, but the generic lines, including efforts to rationalize the spelling of Romanian and to provide affordable education, survive in one of I. Negruzzi's letters.Ornea (I), pp. 19‚Äì21 Pogor's large townhouse is popularly understood as the Junimea headquarters, but, at least initially, the club also met at Maiorescu's place, and occasionally at Negruzzi's.Ornea (I), p. 34 Indirectly, the young boyar helped found the club's own printing press, which was donated to Maiorescu by Pogor's Bessarabian cousin, the philanthropist Nicolae »òtefan Casso, and, after 1867, the literary sheet Convorbiri Literare.Ornea (I), pp. 27‚Äì28, 43; Vianu, p. 8 The latter's mailing address was Casa Pogor. \\"Vasile Pogor, spiritul Junimii √Æn Palatul Roznovanu\\", in Curierul de Ia»ôi, September 13, 2011 Pogor himself managed the publishing firm, but did a notoriously poor job. Described by Ornea as \\"a man for all the hasty projects\\" and as an \\"absent-minded\\" individual, Pogor ran heavy debts and frequently changed managers (Ioan Mire Melik, Al. Farra etc.).Ornea (I), p. 28 The Junimist publishing house was barely keeping afloat once Pogor took money out of the budget to create a book store‚Äîone of such niche appeal as to make Pogor the only buyer of his books. =Provocateur, anthologist, lecturer= At Junimea, Pogor was a picturesque figure. Ornea suggests that, despite being a respectable boyar and the oldest among the founders, Pogor was also the most \\"child-like\\" in his reactions.Ornea (I), p. 30 Witnesses recall that he was always amused by the literary works presented for analysis, laughing \\"till his new teeth jumped out of his mouth\\", and casually reclining on a sofa as the debates were taking place.CƒÉlinescu, p. 436 Negruzzi recalled that, in defiance for \\"any social habit\\", Pogor left his guests unattended to read his books; he writes that, on first impression, Pogor appeared \\"cheeky and missing something upstairs\\". Moreover, Pogor embarrassed his friends with his obscene anecdotes, his name- calling, and his occasional outbursts, during which he would hurl his cape at them. Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Mai avem azi un Maiorescu? (III)\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 21/2009 However, Pogor's lolling habit and thundering laughter soon became fashionable, and his yawning during the others' recitations was intentionally loud, provocative and contagious.Ornea (I), pp. 36, 38‚Äì41 He justified such heckling with the expression Entre qui veut, reste qui peut (French for \\"enters who wishes, stays on who can stand it\\"), later a Junimea motto.Ornea (I), p. 39; Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"La √Ænceput a fost deviza...\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 38/2006 The slogan resonated with the caracudƒÉ (\\"small game\\") wing of Junimea‚Äîmostly passive youngsters who came in for entertainment, and who, Ornea notes, were \\"apparently immune to beauty and ignorant\\".Ornea (I), p. 41 For all his unorthodox stances, Pogor was regarded by all his colleagues as a towering intellect, and referred to as \\"the contemporary library\\". The Junimist colleagues repeatedly noted that he was the man to bring in not just irreverence, but also genuine innovation. Vianu describes his \\"merciless gibes\\" as stemming from a conviction that the others were too uptight, and in general from a rejection of \\"dogmatism\\"; Pogor, he writes, would \\"embrace in turn all sorts of attitudes\\".Vianu, p. 18 Another scholar, »òerban Cioculescu, describes Pogor as by character \\"a free, unambitious, spirit, an epicurean of intelligence\\".Cioculescu, p. 6 Similarly, Ornea cautions: \\"If Maiorescu has conferred a consistent substance to Junimea, then Pogor gave it a pinch of salt, wit, humor and‚Äîan essential element‚Äîskepticism, that is to say a sense of relativity.\\"Ornea (I), p. 40 Encouraged by the other club members, Pogor became the anthologist of bad journalism and literature, scouring anti-Junimist periodicals and picking out the most amusing enormities and the most embarrassing platitudes. These he then pasted into his Dosar (\\"Dossier\\"), which is for most part a subtle political attack on the \\"Red\\" ideology of Romanian liberalism and Romantic nationalism.Ornea (I), pp. 35‚Äì36 Ornea notes: \\"those who have discussed the Junimea Dossier as politics in disguise, practiced by a literary circle that had denied itself‚Äîunder pain of sanction‚Äîany politically derived conversation, they were not at all in the wrong.\\"Ornea (I), p. 36 Already in 1863, the Junimists had engaged in battle the literary representatives of Romanian liberalism, including Din Moldovas B. P. Hasdeu. The latter dedicated his activity as a journalist to deriding or condemning the Junimea group, Pogor included, accusing it of standing for values not complementary with the Romanian way: cosmopolitanism and Germanophilia, elitism and philosemitism.Vianu, p. 239 While these debates gathered in notoriety, Pogor was also joining in the yearly cycle of Junimea conferences, or prelec»õiuni. He, Maiorescu, and Carp were the core group of lecturers during the first age of the prelec»õiuni. The subjects were broad and the inspiration spontaneous,Ornea (I), pp. 22‚Äì23; Vianu, pp. 7, 32‚Äì33 but the speakers still followed Maiorescu's elaborate ceremonial, which reduced direct contact with the listeners. Liviu Papuc, \\"Masoneria junimistƒÉ\\", in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 4/2006 In 1864, Pogor discussed the French Revolution, and specifically its \\"impact on modern ideas\\". There was a break in the following year, with Maiorescu having been involved in a sex scandal, but the lecturers returned in 1866, when the common theme was \\"factors of national life throughout history\\".Ornea (I), p. 23 Pogor was also contributing to the Junimea who's who of Romanian poetry, selecting for reading pieces by the 18th-century boyar IenƒÉchi»õƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu.Ornea (I), pp. 73‚Äì74 At the prelec»õiuni, Pogor spoke about Ancient Greek art; in 1867, about Shakespearean tragedy; during later cycles, he discovered and introduced for the general public the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Still focused on national identity constructs and the philosophy of history, he promoted at Junimea the evolutionist treatise History of Civilization in England, by Henry Thomas Buckle. Alexandru Ruja, \\"Ideologia junimistƒÉ\\", in Orizont, Nr. 6/2011, p. 13Ornea (I), pp. 49, 60, 157, 167‚Äì168; Vianu, p. 81 =Masonic conspirator and \\"White\\" organizer= Meanwhile, Pogor the politician was drawn into secretive, then conspiratorial, work. Pogor in Ia»ôi, and Carp in Bucharest, helped organize the February 1866 putsch against the authoritarian Cuza, and supported the interim government presided upon by both liberal \\"Reds\\" and conservative \\"Whites\\".Ornea (I), p. 252 On February 15, the Romanian Regency appointed Pogor Prefect of Ia»ôi County, and he was also a regional representative in the Assembly of Deputies (quickly elected for the drafting of a new constitution). On April 28, he was elected as one of its secretaries.Nicolescu, pp. 5‚Äì6 For most of the year, he had a noted role in persuading his colleagues to accept bicameralism, and thus contributed to the establishment of the Senate of Romania.Xenopol, pp. 522‚Äì523 In March, he was also sent back to the appellate court, as section president, serving until January 1868. According to scholar George CƒÉlinescu, he began supplementing his revenue with \\"multiple and ephemeral\\" special commissions, including that of teacher certification examiner (October 1866). Pogor was received into the Freemasonry (Oriental Rite of Memphis, Grand Orient de France) on March 14, 1866, and, only a year later, reached the 90th Masonic Degree. Within the divided Romanian Freemasonry, he sided with the Moldavian Lodge called \\"Star of Romania\\": he was the Orator under Venerable Master Iorgu Sutzu. Joined by most of the Junimist personalities, this institution would open up a new front against the \\"Reds\\", challenging their xenophobia and antisemitism. The Lodge opened its ranks to people of various backgrounds, including Romanian Jews, but was off-limits to the Moldavian liberals. The Lodge members, Pogor and Maiorescu included, set up and helped edit a \\"White\\" political sheet, Constitu»õiunea (\\"Constitution\\"), later Gazeta de Iassi. Initially, the paper joined the ranks of Moldavian regionalists, complaining about Ia»ôi's social, cultural, and demographic decline under Romanian rule; however, by March 30, Pogor and Maiorescu had also affiliated with the centralizing National Party, where they talked of finding other roles for the declining former capital.Xenopol, pp. 487‚Äì488, 498‚Äì499, 502‚Äì504, 506 Against separatists such as Constantin Moruzi and the Free and Independent Faction, they sought a cemented union, proposing the selection of a foreign ruler from Romance- speaking Europe.Xenopol, pp. 503‚Äì504, 506 With the arrival on the throne of a German prince, Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, the anti-Cuza coalition was again divided into competing factions. However, Ornea writes, just two Junimist leaders had openly engaged in party politics: \\"Petre Carp and‚Äîunbelievably so!‚Äîthe freaky V. Pogor.\\"Ornea (I), p. 63 This despite the fact that Ia»ôi's Masonic Lodge had become a junior wing of the \\"White\\" party, and was portrayed by the local \\"Red\\" polemicists as an anti-Christian fraternity.Ornea (I), p. 253 No longer committed to the principle of a \\"Latin\\" prince, Pogor openly supported the new Domnitor‚Äîhe was one of 109 deputies (from a total 115) to ratify the April plebiscite.Xenopol, p. 506 The \\"Star of Romania\\" Lodge invited Carol to join its ranks and become leader of the unified Freemasonry. Around 1867, against antisemitic agitation by the Free and Independent Faction, the Junimist core, Pogor included, signed up to a proposal for Jewish emancipation, meaning the Jewish minority's effective naturalization. Probably initiated by the \\"Star of Romania\\", their petition asked Domnitor Carol to \\"establish legal order\\" in front of \\"anarchy\\", noting that the liberals worked to \\"kidnap hundreds of Jews\\".William Evans-Gordon, The Alien Immigrant, pp. 167‚Äì168. London: W. Heinemann, 1903 By 1869, Pogor and Carp had also rallied with the Society of Young Dynasticists, which conspired with dissident liberals such as Gheorghe M√¢rzescu to elect only monarchists into office‚Äîfor instance, during 1869.Ioan Dafin, Ia»ôii, cultural »ôi social: Amintiri »ôi √ÆnsemnƒÉri, Vol. II, pp. 80‚Äì83. Ia»ôi: Via»õa Rom√ÆneascƒÉ, 1929 The early 1870s transformed Junimea into a moderate conservative political movement, annexed to the \\"White\\" wing of the political spectrum. For Maiorescu, theirs was the cause of restoration and order in front of \\"Red\\" agitation (the Republic of Ploie»ôti episode), but also adverse to the \\"arch- conservatives\\" who wanted a return of boyar privileges.Ornea (I), pp. 256‚Äì257 Within this setting, Pogor found that his political status progressed quickly: from January 1869 to May 1870, he was president of the appellate court. Yet, as Tudor Vianu notes, he still treated political assignments \\"with a certain indifference.\\"Vianu, p. 83 At the beginning of that decade, \\"White\\" Premier Manolache Costache Epureanu opened his cabinet to Junimist experts, and Pogor was expected to take over a top administrative position. Carp, who negotiated the deal, vouched for Pogor's competence.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 400; Ornea (I), pp. 63‚Äì64, 80, 254‚Äì255 Pogor resigned before the so-called \\"Hen and Fledgling\\" cabinet was even sworn in.CƒÉlinescu, p. 400; Ornea (I), p. 254; Vianu, p. 83 Reportedly, he complained of dorsopathy, leaving Maiorescu worried that he had developed neurosyphilis. Pogor declared himself cured within a few days, announcing that he was ready to take over as Romania's Minister of Education.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 400‚Äì401 According to various sources, he actually held the office, if only briefly.Bacalba»ôa, pp. 19‚Äì20; »òu»õu, p. 239 His unexpected renunciation cleared the path for Maiorescu's own political ascent, moving him from a position in the background to the \\"Fledgling\\" Education portfolio.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 400‚Äì401; Ornea (I), pp. 254‚Äì256 =Convorbiri Literare editor and 1871 mandate= Pogor in 1873 Pogor still was a notable participant in polemics, taking Maiorescu's side. One such case was that of disputes between the Junimists and an ultra-\\"White\\" group headed by Epureanu. The latter wanted to institute an authoritarian regime favoring the upper class and favored some exotic policies‚Äîgeneralizing the death penalty or opening the country to massive German colonization. Probably wishing to maintain \\"White\\" unity, the Junimists, including Pogor, gave reluctant backing to the Epureanu program, and became targets for \\"Red\\" sarcasm, and were even chided by the dominant conservative club, that of LascƒÉr Catargiu.Ornea (I), pp. 258‚Äì262. See also Bacalba»ôa, pp. 25‚Äì35 Pogor was also chairman of the Junimist \\"Society for Sending Young Romanians on Study Trips\\", noted for discovering and sponsoring the future atheistic philosopher Vasile Conta. Sorin Lavric, \\"Plectrul fatalitƒÉ»õii\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 13/2012 In parallel with his political chores, Pogor took up the task of translating some of Charles Baudelaire's Flowers of Evil. \\"Don Juan in Hell\\" and \\"Gipsies on the Road\\" were both published by Convorbiri in March 1870.CƒÉlinescu, p. 437; Paul Cernat, Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi complexul periferiei: primul val, p. 8. Bucharest: Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, 2007. Before this moment, Baudelaire's work had been entirely unknown to Romanians, and casually ignored by Maiorescu, who preferred German Romanticism.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 412‚Äì413, 437, 685 Later, Pogor published adapted samples from other modern French figures (Victor Hugo, Th√©ophile Gautier, Leconte de Lisle, Sully Prudhomme, Jean Richepin) alternating them with classical works by Horace (Ode III.26, in 1871) Nicolae Laslo, \\"Hora»õiu √Æn literatura rom√¢nƒÉ\\", in G√¢nd Rom√¢nesc, Nr. 11‚Äì12/1935, p. 537 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) and Virgil (Copa, in 1873). M. Strajan, \\"Virgiliu\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 2/1904, p. 70 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) He and other Convorbiri Literare writers pioneered translations from American literature, most notably from the stories of Edgar Allan Poe. Paul Cernat, \\"E. Lovinescu sub presiunea posteritƒÉ»õii. Inconsecven»õƒÉ? Mai degrabƒÉ sim»õ al independen»õei\\", in Cultura, Nr. 8/2009 This was still just a fraction of Pogor's activity in the field. His papers reveal that he had also tried, but failed, to translate, among others, Rameau's Nephew by Diderot, Ludwig Uhland's \\"The Minstrel's Curse\\", and Volney's Les Ruines. In addition to his translation projects, Convorbiri Literare hosted his original works, beginning with the autobiographical piece \\"A Marquise's Pastel\\" (September 1868). In January 1871, still independent of party politics, the journal was reorganized as a cultural monthly. Pogor was assigned to the editorial committee, a triumvirate also grouping Maiorescu and Negruzzi.Ornea (I), pp. 65‚Äì66 He and Maiorescu resigned soon after, alleging that Negruzzi had failed to consult them about the editorial policy, possibly because of a polemical review inserted by »òtefan V√¢rgolici.Ornea (I), p. 66 This did not imply that they would cease to write for Convorbiri. Also that year, the magazine published a poem by Pogor's deceased father, newly discovered in the family archive. In October, when Junimea finally liquidated its publishing venture, Pogor was asked to take care of the debts and return the debit. Without Negruzzi's knowledge, the enterprise was purchased by the Jewish businessman Her»ôcu Goldner. Meanwhile, Hasdeu's Columna lui Traian paper had made it its mission to host samples from Pogor's poetry, to show its readers how one was not supposed to versify. Gheorghe Mocu»õa, \\"Centenar Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu\\", in the Vasile Goldi»ô West University of Arad Studii de »òtiin»õƒÉ »ôi CulturƒÉ, Nr. 4 (11), December 2007, p. 99; Ornea (II), p. 287 Hasdeu registered a moral victory when a short poem by an \\"M. I. Ellias\\" saw print in the July 15 issue of Convorbiri Literare. With Maiorescu in Bucharest, the piece had earned the approval of both Pogor and his rival, Mihai Eminescu.Ornea (II), p. 289 It was, in fact, a prank. Hasdeu had improvised the poem himself (calling it \\"a rhyming frivolity\\") so as to prove that Junimea writers lacked taste and patriotic feeling‚Äî\\"there is not a galimatias [...] that Convorbiri Literare won't rush in to grab and hold by its bosom, provided one essential condition is met: that it does not include anything Romanian.\\"Ornea (II), pp. 288‚Äì289 The Junimist faction made its formal entry into Parliament after the 1871 election. As a result of these, the nation's Assembly of Deputies included five Junimist members, voting with the \\"White\\" group: Pogor, Maiorescu, Negruzzi, N. Gane, Gheorghe Racovi»õƒÉ.Ornea (I), p. 258 After the partial elections of 1874, they were joined by two others: Carp (previously serving Domnitor Carol as a diplomat) and Th. Rosetti. As noted by his contemporaries, Pogor, even though selected as Vice President of the Assembly, was not an asset for the Junimist faction. George Panu, the Junimea memoirist, noted that Pogor was an incompetent public speaker, rarely present at the rostrum. When he did address the Assembly, Pogor was unrecognizable and \\"embarrassing\\", turning \\"pale as a cadaver\\", his voice \\"shaking\\" with timidity.CƒÉlinescu, p. 441 =Bucharest relocation and 1875 mandate= Pogor's own prolonged absences, like the political passions of other Junimist founders, were a cause for concern in Ia»ôi. Those who had stayed behind, Negruzzi included, complained that the club was dying out, with the reunions turning into glorified tea parties.Ornea (I), pp. 85‚Äì95 As such, all the Junimea founders except Negruzzi were absent from the club's meeting on February 25, 1872.Ornea (I), p. 31 In the end, when Negruzzi also accepted a government job, the club was reestablished to the national capital, Bucharest. The small Ia»ôi section survived for a while as a caracudƒÉ hotspot, experiencing what Ornea called \\"a slow and embarrassing ending\\".Ornea (I), pp. 95‚Äì97 Pogor paid the occasional visit and, according to caracudƒÉ leader Nicolae Gane, behaved with restraint (\\"against his nature\\").Ornea (I), p. 96 This was the time of Pogor's polemics with Eminescu. The latter, a voice of national conservatism, and recognized by posterity as the Romanian national poet, read out his fantasy novella SƒÉrmanul Dionis. As Junimea minutes will attest, Pogor and Maiorescu found the work to be all to cryptic, but still gave approval for its publishing.Valentin Co»ôereanu, \\"Jurnalul Junimii\\"], in Caiete Critice, Nr. 6/2010, p. 23 For a few months in 1874, Pogor allowed the penniless poet to lodge with him. Sources diverge on whether Eminescu lived at Casa Pogor or another one of the politician's townhouses, which has since been demolished. Valeriu Gherghel, \\"A locuit cu adevƒÉrat Eminescu √Æn Casa Pogor?\\", in Ziarul de Ia»ôi, August 26, 2008 By the close of his mandate in the Assembly, Pogor had involved himself in the Strousberg Affair dispute, suggesting (unsuccessfully) that ministers found guilty of misdeeds should have their revenue retained by the state.Nicolescu, p. 129 The Catargiu cabinet was facing a motion of no confidence over its stamp act proposal, with Pogor and Carp working to keep the two debates separate.Nicolescu, pp. 143‚Äì144 He was again sent to the Assembly in the 1875 election, during which the \\"Red\\" opposition ran as a consolidated National Liberal Party (PNL). During this term, Pogor supported the establishment of a public railways authority, with compensation for other shareholders.Nicolescu, p. 181 Despite the looming PNL threat, Pogor, who had also been reelected chairman of the Ia»ôi appellate court, and N. Gane were absentee deputies, and were probably convinced that the Catargiu cabinet was about to crumble. Maiorescu, the acting Minister of Education and proponent of an unpopular education reform, was perplexed by their decision: \\"Gane and Pogor should present themselves in Bucharest immediately [Maiorescu's italics]! Are we going to engage in politics or not? Is there any solidarity between those of you in Ia»ôi and me?\\"Ornea (I), p. 267. See also CƒÉlinescu, p. 431 Their effective abandon contributed to Maiorescu's resignation in January 1876, then to the arrival in power of a PNL ministry, surprisingly headed by the formerly ultra-\\"White\\" Epureanu.Ornea (I), pp. 267‚Äì269 The Junimists were soundly defeated in the subsequent elections of July 1876.Ornea (I), p. 270 Pogor managed to preserve his seat in the new legislature, which voted on Romanian independence during the War of '77. He was thus involved in parliamentary discussions about the thorny issue of antisemitic discrimination favored by the PNL: in early 1878, he was one of the few deputies who questioned the law preventing Romanian Jews from trading in distilled beverages. \\"Bijvoegsel. Nationale vergadering van Rumeni√´\\", in Nieuw Isra√´lietisch Weekblad, April 4, 1878 (digitized by the National Library of the Netherlands) Alongside Carp, Gane, and Maiorescu, he enlisted as a member of the reserve militia (or Civic Guard) in Ia»ôi, thus serving alongside some members of the Free and Independent Faction.Maria Totu, Garda civicƒÉ din Rom√¢nia 1848‚Äî1884, p. 251. Bucharest: Editura MilitarƒÉ, 1976. In 1878, Pogor, who headed the Ia»ôi credit union, was also elected to the City Council. These was a time of great disorder among the \\"Whites\\", who were hard pressed to come up with an answer to the PNL's success. When it seemed that the \\"White\\" daily, Timpul, was about to go under, Pogor joined up with the other Junimists in making peace with Catargiu, and in gathering funds for the newspaper‚Äîtheir assembly was the first step toward fusing together the major \\"White\\" factions. Silvia Bocancea, \\"Tribula»õiile unui partid de cadre. Partidul Conservator (1880)\\", in Sfera Politicii, Nr. 162 =Conservative Party man, Buddhist scholar, and Ia»ôi Mayor= Pogor was again a prelec»õiuni guest in 1875, by which time the younger Junimists (A. D. Xenopol, Vasile BurlƒÉ etc.) had taken over the task of popular education. Pogor and I. Negruzzi tacitly accepted their supremacy, and, like them, lectured on topics exclusively linked to the concept of national identity.Ornea (I), pp. 23‚Äì24 Each speaker was to concentrate on one aspect of historical acculturation, from the Romanian contact with Byzantine Greeks to the reception of German influences, but the schedule was only partly respected. Leonidas Rados, \\"Influen»õa greacƒÉ √Æn disputele istoriografice din spa»õiul rom√¢nesc √Æn a doua jumƒÉtate a secolului XIX\\", in Anuarul Institutului de Istorie George Bari»õiu, Series Historica, 2008, Romanian Academy, George Bari»õiu Institute of History, p. 123 Pogor's handwritten program for the prelec»õiuni program of 1879 and 1880. He sets aside for himself lectures on Buddhism (Bud'ha√Øsmul) and Christianity Pursuing his interest in Schopenhauer's work, Pogor discovered the Buddhist worldview. By the early 1880s, his study of Buddhist concepts had become more systematic: he read the scholarly works of Eug√®ne Burnouf, then popularized Buddhist principles in a Convorbiri Literare series (1883‚Äì1884). With Maiorescu, and using German intermediaries, Pogor helped Romanians become acquainted with Classical Chinese poetry. While Maiorescu gave his touch to Zhuangzi, Pogor rendered an anonymous (and possibly irretrievable) piece, called \\"Lover Submitting\\". Constantin Lupeanu, \\"Interferen»õe culturale\\", in Ramuri, Nr. 10/2010 In tandem, he looked into Sanskrit literature, translating translations from Amaru. On February 3, 1880, Pogor was one of 88 \\"White\\" spokesmen who signed the founding document of Romania's Conservative Party. The Kingdom of Romania, proclaimed in 1881, was thus effectively ruled by a two-party system. For three non-consecutive terms, Pogor was the Conservative and Junimist Mayor of Ia»ôi: February 10, 1880 to April 26, 1881; June 7, 1888 to June 7, 1890; May 30, 1892 to November 11, 1894. He entered history for his creative approach to the Romanianization measures, specifically those which required all shops to have Romanian-language signs. Although this resonated with the Junimist idea of standardizing the language, and even though the Moldavian retailers were on the verge of rebelling, Pogor is said to have had \\"great fun\\" dealing with the consequences. Liviu Papuc, \\"V. Pogor »ôi legea Pruteanu\\", in Convorbiri Literare, October 2002 He proposed that all shops still carrying non-essential foreign words be taxed at three times the official rate. Reporter, \\"√ént√¢lnirile Rom√¢niei Literare: √én jurul unei legi\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 44/2002 Cultural history preserves his dialogue with a Jewish merchant, who told him that Romanian had no assimilated word for \\"liqueurs\\"; Pogor spontaneously approximated an equivalent, licheruri (or even its current form, lichioruri). Instead of the French term parfumerie (\\"perfume retailer\\"), he suggested parfumeraie or parfumƒÉraie. Chaos followed, and the Romanianization campaign was abandoned. In the end, only one firm was touched the experiment, adopting the willingly absurd title of »òateaucs aucs fleurs‚Äîa macaronic rendition of the French Ch√¢teaux aux fleurs (\\"Flower Castles\\"). Pogor also took care of various other projects, ensuring that the city was compensated by the central government for having lost its status of state capital: 10 million lei entered the city budget (6 of which were compensation from the Romanian state),»òu»õu, p. 239 and 8 neighboring estates were merged into the metropolitan area. He moved the City Hall into Roznovanu Palace, ordering works to begin on the Ia»ôi National Theatre, public bathing facilities, ten primary schools, and a new Abattoir. Under Pogor, the streets of Ia»ôi were paved with macadam, gas lighting was extended, and sanitation works were started. Casa Pogor was the city's first electrically-lit building. His mandates saw the erection of statues honoring the pioneer Moldavian historian Miron Costin (1888) Radu Mo»õoc, \\"Statuia lui Miron Costin (1633‚Äì1691), din Ia»ôi\\", in the V. A. Urechia Library Axis Libri, Nr. 6, March 2010, p. 73 and the Junimist poet Vasile Alecsandri (1890). Laura Bejenaru, \\"Statuia lui Vasile Alecsandri din Ia»ôi\\", in Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ (ASTRA), Nr. 4/2007, pp. 29‚Äì31; »òu»õu, pp. 236‚Äì237 =Later assignments= Pogor was also a factor in the rapprochement between the Maiorescu Junimists, who had again divorced the Catargiu Conservatives, and the moderate core of the PNL. Although Maiorescu himself rejected a ministerial appointment in the Ion BrƒÉtianu administration, he and the other self-styled \\"moderate conservatives\\" backed BrƒÉtianu's practical foreign policy. In February 1884, he promised that Pogor and other disgruntled Conservatives (Menelas Ghermani, Gheorghe Manu, Anastasie Triandafil etc.) would follow him in proclaiming conditional support for BrƒÉtianu.Ornea (I), p. 294 Maiorescu thus saved the government from a likely recall, and was embraced by an enthusiastic BrƒÉtianu while the Assembly looked on.Ornea (I), p. 295 The Junimist realignment gave the club a permanent representation at the epicenter of Romanian politics. Maiorescu received accolades from the cabinet and, in the November 1884 election, his men received nine seats in the Assembly, negotiated upon with the PNL, and three more for \\"independent\\" members; Pogor, Iacob Negruzzi, Ioan Mire Melik and Ioan Ianov were the Junimist deputies from Ia»ôi.Ornea (I), pp. 297‚Äì300. See also Bacalba»ôa, p. 370 As noted by Maiorescu, Pogor was somewhat harder to win over by the PNL's cartel: \\"Even Pogor, who had favored the reunified opposition, has grown tired of their parties and feels that he should stand with us\\".Ornea (I), p. 298 The Junimists ambitions were frustrated by BrƒÉtianu only months after the election, when he still refused to include members of the club into his administration. Junimea reverted to independent politics, its conflict with the PNL exacerbated by a personal dispute between Maiorescu and National Liberal politico Eugeniu StƒÉtescu.Ornea (I), pp. 300‚Äì302 In December 1887, Pogor became a leading member of the Ia»ôi League of Resistance, which also included the former Factionalists such as Alecu D. Holban and Gheorghe M√¢rzescu.\\"Comitetul central al opozi»õiuneƒ≠ din Ia»ôƒ≠\\", in Epoca, December 9 (21), 1881, p. 1 Pogor continued to suggest that Junimea should back the anti-PNL \\"United Opposition\\", betting Maiorescu that the latter would be called into power by the monarch. Maiorescu won: in early 1888, after a bloody incident in the Assembly sabotaged all communication between the two main parties, Carol appointed Th. Rosetti as Romanian Premier, and an all- Junimist cabinet was in power for just under a year.Ornea (I), pp. 309‚Äì312 In September 1888, alongside Dimitrie Ghica-ComƒÉne»ôti and Ilariu R. Isvoranu, Pogor negotiated an alliance with the mainline Conservatives, allowing Rosetti to secure his office.\\"O paginƒÉ de istorie\\", in Epoca, February 8 (20), 1889, p. 1 In the election of October, Pogor did not rally with the Conservative‚ÄìJunimist caucus, and joined the dissident Liberals of Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu, winning at ballotage for Ia»ôi County, Second College.\\"Resultatul alegerii colegiului II din Ia»ôi\\", in Epoca, October 15 (27), 1888, p. 2 He also continued to be listed as a Junimist, and took another seat in the race for the First College.\\"Rezultatul scrutinului de balotagiu. Colegiul I-u al Camerei\\", in Epoca, October 21 (November 2), 1888, p. 1 Rosetti's cabinet was by then supported by the Conservatives, but fell when a Conservative deputy, Nicolae Moret Blaremberg, stirred political conflicts by proposing to indict the PNL's former governing team‚Äîsuch a project was regarded by Rosetti and the Junimists as entirely demagogic.Ornea (I), p. 315 Both Pogor and Maiorescu were also partly responsible for the PNL's return to power: they abstained form voting against the motion of no confidence which toppled Rosetti.\\"Votul de ierƒ≠\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, April 1 (13), 1888, p. 1 From 1889 to 1890, during the Junimists reestablishment as an independent party, and again after the 1891 election, Pogor was Vice President of the Assembly.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 436, 437, 441 As Panu recalls, he was making a mockery of this assignment: he doodled caricatures of his colleagues, pulled pranks on them \\"just like in school\\", and satirized parliamentary procedures with parody statements (such as \\"the motion has been defeated with a crushing minority\\"). In the early 1890s, he was firmly committed to the Conservative Party, and served on its Ia»ôi committee‚Äîalongside Holban, Ianov, Grigore Sturdza, A. C. Cuza, Nicolae Culianu, and Petru Th. Missir.»òu»õu, pp. 1‚Äì3 Pogor was also drafted into the panel which negotiated an alliance with the Radical Party before the county elections of September 1895, and then into the nomination committee for the general election.»òu»õu, pp. 4‚Äì6 In December 1897, Pogor and his Junimist colleagues again withdrew from the Conservative caucus, only to return before the 1899 county election, in which Pogor and Missir stood as candidates.»òu»õu, pp. 13‚Äì14 By November 1900, when the Conservatives and Junimists finally merged into one party, Pogor was again the chairman of the credit union. He also became a member of Ia»ôi's Conservative Party steering committee, involving himself in strategy planning ahead of the 1901 general election.»òu»õu, pp. 18‚Äì20, 113 Having poorly invested his own sizable fortune, he found himself pestered by his many creditors. One of his biographers, Liviu Papuc, noted that, overall, the first Junimist generation ran into financial trouble, and that Pogor ended his career on an \\"even score\\" with life. Liviu Papuc, \\"Ioan M. Melik sau sim»õul practic la Junimea\\", in Convorbiri Literare, December 2006 In 1901, he sold Casa Pogor to socialite Maria Moruzi.Sorin Iftimi, \\"HeraldicƒÉ »ôi arhitecturƒÉ\\", in Monumentul, Vol. VII, 2006, pp. 502‚Äì504 The Junimist co-founder died on March 20, 1906, at his other address‚Äîa vineyard in the Ia»ôi suburb of Bucium; according to his fellow Conservative Rudolf »òu»õu, he \\"passed on among his family, placid and smiling, as he had lived\\". His tomb is located in Eternitatea cemetery. Felix Guzga, \\"PrimƒÉria a fƒÉcut recensam√Æntul personalitƒÉ»õilor de la Eternitatea\\", in Ziarul de Ia»ôi, August 18, 2006 Work =Anti-dogmatic Junimism and Parnassian poetry= Pogor's anti-dogmatism precluded his engagement on the more serious side of Junimism. When approving of Junimeas name, he staged a fake baptism, asking those present to pledge that they would \\"renounce pedantry\\".Ornea (I), p. 18; Vianu, p. 18 His philosophical dilettantism was still influential at Junimea: I. Negruzzi recalled that, during the club's sessions, Pogor systematically prevented historians and philologists from reporting on their concrete finds, and only listened to the generic conclusions.Vianu, p. 12 As Vianu notes, Pogor himself was virtually incapable of \\"choosing\\" between the many subjects that interested him at any one time. It is possible that Pogor is the author of an anonymous poem celebrating his own idleness and contrariness: While the caracudƒÉ rejoiced, the club's more idealistic visitors were disturbed by Pogor's antics. On these grounds, Pogor fully supported only the most subversive and eccentric manifestations of Junimist literature. He was the only one in the group not to approve of poet laureate Vasile Alecsandri. Although he later helped build the Alecsandri monument, he once shouted out that Alecsandri had \\"a grocer's taste\\" in art.Cioculescu, p. 278 Instead, Pogor loved the work of peasant storyteller Ion CreangƒÉ, and, to the indignation of some other club members, encouraged him to read aloud from his erotic literature series, \\"the corrosives\\".Ornea (II), pp. 230, 231, 236; Vianu, p. 211 Later, Pogor welcomed in and shed a spotlight on the cynical, streetwise, humorist Ion Luca Caragiale, who was a passing guest at Junimea. According to »òerban Cioculescu, Pogor differed from Eminescu in that he \\"freely enjoyed [Caragiale's] charming spontaneity and temperamental zigzags.\\"Cioculescu, pp. 5‚Äì6 Pogor's nonconformism could target even the group's doyen, Maiorescu. He coined the disparaging nickname Muierescu (from muiere, \\"broad\\", in reference to his colleague's alleged sexual misconduct). Eugen Lungu, \\"Istorie »ôi intimitate\\", in Revista Sud-Est, Nr. 4/2006 His own work in poetry was reviewed with little sympathy by later critics and historians. They dismiss his original pieces as \\"anodyne\\"Ornea (I), p. 42 and not up to the test of time,CƒÉlinescu, pp. 397, 437 although, as Rudolf »òu»õu argues, they too helped engineer a literary language.»òu»õu, pp. 239‚Äì240 Pogor was a Romanian Parnassian, reworking classical themes and seeking formal purity,Vianu, p. 82 and was especially influenced by Baudelaire and by Th√©ophile Gautier. His verse includes an homage to Melencolia I, the famous engraving by Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äîsimilarly titled Melancolie. George CƒÉlinescu focuses his comments on the poem's atmospheric quality, noting that its \\"French structure\\" is exceptional in the Junimist context. The other Junimea bards, he suggests, still favored \\"accessible\\" poetry of the Young Germany kind. Beyond the Parnassian poems, Pogor applied his wit (or, as critic Cosmin Ciotlo»ô calls it, \\"unbelievably malicious spirit\\") to the realm of parody. His joke poem, Vedenia (\\"The Apparition\\"), managed to impress rival Eminescu, who made the effort of transcribing it in his records of Junimea meetings. Cosmin Ciotlo»ô, \\"Vremuri parodice\\", in Ziarul Financiar, October 14, 2008 Pogor's translation also produced mixed results. Scholar Dan MƒÉnucƒÉ believes that the Romanian author found Baudelaire to be \\"more of a picturesque eccentric and, certainly, not at all a literary innovator\\"; for this reason, he only looked to Baudelaire's tamer writings, that excluded \\"scandal\\". Pogor's version of Hugo's \\"Conscience\\" made a positive impression, and was quoted by Grigore Pletosu in his propaedeutics to philosophy (1899). Nicu, \\"»òciin»õƒÉ literaturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ. Bibliografie. Literatura didacticƒÉ\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 9/1899, p. 305 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Pogor's other projects were often panned by experts. Classicist Nicolae Laslo sees Pogor's version of Horatian verse as mostly failed, \\"with lots of gaucheries and naivetes.\\" The Pogor‚ÄìSkelitti rendition of Goethe, although verified by the two Junimists through previous French versions (G√©rard de Nerval, Henri Blaze), is also considered problematic. Germanist Corina Jiva indicates that they had only a vague understanding of the German words they translated into Romanian. Pogor may have been aware of the shortcomings, since, after Skelitti died, Convorbiri issued a second version of Faust I. It modified the first edition, and only credited one author: Pogor. =Pogor on religion and nationality= Vasile Pogor's roots were in Romanian Orthodoxy: his father was ktitor of the Mise»ôti Church. Pogor Jr was himself a student of Christian history, but his main focus was on Judaism, the Hebrew Bible, and the Christian Old Testament. He kept detailed notes on the minutiae of biblical lore, making notes about Gog and Magog, the Kinnor, the Purim etc.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 437, 1000 Albeit fascinated by Jewish and Buddhist practices, the poet was mainly a Freethinker, seen by Vianu as \\"of a Voltairian and Positivist extraction.\\" The theories of Auguste Comte and positivist language in general were welcomed by Pogor and the other core Junimists even though, as Zigu Ornea notes, the leading exponents of Positivist discourse were secondary Junimists (Nicolae Xenopol, George Panu).Ornea (I), p. 5 Pogor attacked religion as a lifeless institution, as seen in his poem Magnitudo parri, credited by some as his masterpiece. For Pogor, a swallow's effort to raise its offspring is more worthy of attention than the Byzantine church looming over its nest: Historian Bal√°zs Trencs√©nyi argues that Vasile Pogor, like the other Junimist doyens, engineered \\"an epistemological break\\" with the predominating school of Romantic nationalism, as well as with the 18th-century philosophes, introducing instead Positivist and naturalistic approaches to social science.Trencs√©nyi, pp. 156‚Äì157 Taking his inspiration from Buckle, Pogor leaned toward environmental determinism as an explanation of historical processes. \\"Warmer\\" areas, he claimed, were predisposed to despotism, no matter how advanced there were materially. Trencs√©nyi focuses on Pogor's proposal to separate the material and spiritual growth of a nation, thus contextualizing the Junimist critique of Romania's Westernization: \\"[Pogor's views] served as a critical perspective to judge societies which reached a certain level of socio-economic modernity without an overall mental adaptation to the Western patterns.\\"Trencs√©nyi, p. 157 Although not explicitly extended to the Romanian paradigm, Pogor's introduction to Buckle formed an integral part of the Junimist discourse about nation building. As Ornea notes, Pogor struck the typical Junimist note with his critique of revolutionary doctrines, in pronouncements such as: \\"had politicians not been meddling in to prevent the natural flow of things, progress would have occurred at a quicker pace\\".Ornea (I), pp. 167‚Äì168 Also according to Ornea, the study endures as both a relevant contribution to Junimism and a facet of Romanian philosophy in the 1870s.Ornea (I), pp. 60, 157, 167‚Äì168 Trencs√©nyi sees a direct link between the survival of \\"despotism\\" in post-modernization, as surveyed by Buckle and Pogor, and the Junimists rejection of Romania's top-to-bottom Westernization by the liberals. Pogor's vague critique is expanded upon by Th. Rosetti. Rosetti's essays postulate the unrelenting \\"primitivism\\" of Romanian society. The liberals stand accused of not having promoted a gradual, \\"authentic\\", modernization of Romanian institutions, and of having imposed their \\"hybrid forms\\" on the Romanian psyche.Trencs√©nyi, pp. 157‚Äì158 Maiorescu himself suggested that Pogor's Bucklean discovery facilitated Junimisms transformation into a socio-political movement. Other such influences came from Schopenhauer, and from John Stuart Mill's Subjection of Women.Ornea (I), p. 157 Buckle influenced the main Junimist historical narratives, from Maiorescu's historical lectures to A. D. Xenopol's own History of Civilizations. Pogor's own belief, namely that Romania was essentially peripheral to European civilization, was not readily welcomed by the national conservative faction at Junimea. A glimpse of this is provided by a maverick Junimist, George Panu, as a purported clash between Pogor and the autochthonist Eminescu. According to Panu, Pogor openly ridiculed national historians: \\"What's all this about the history of the Romanians? Can't you see that we have no history? A people which has no literature, art, or past civilization‚Äîsuch a people is not worth the attention of historians... At a time when France could produce Moli√®re and Racine the Romanians were in a state of utter barbarism.\\"Lucian Boia, History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness, p. 39. Budapest & New York City: Central European University Press, 2001. Eminescu retorted, promptly and (Panu notes) violently: \\"What you call barbarism, I call the settled wisdom of a people that develops in conformity with its own genius and shuns any mixing with foreigners\\" (alternatively translated as: \\"the wisdom of a nation, which progresses according to the rhythm of its own genius, away from any foreign interference\\").Ana Maria Dobre, \\"Revisiting Historical and Cultural Myths and Clich√©s. The Romanian Case of Nation State Building\\", in Raymond Detrez, Barbara Segaert (eds.), Europe and the Historical Legacies in the Balkans. Europe Plurielle ‚Äì Multiple Europes, 40, p. 106. Brussels etc.: Peter Lang, 2008. Factual or merely symbolic, this showdown has been interpreted by later historians as a good introduction to the conflicting perspectives on Romanian nationhood. In 1997, scholar Lucian Boia suggested: \\"What we find summarized in these few lines is the great dilemma which has divided Romanian society for the last two centuries.\\" Political scientist Ana Maria Dobre, who connects Pogor's supposed comments with Maiorescu's dismissal of early Romanian history as \\"oriental barbarism\\", introduces the Pogor‚ÄìEminescu exchange as \\"a profound dichotomy opposing the defenders of the traditional, specific national values of organization and the supporters of an unconditional modernisation and adaptation to the occidental model in order to depart from a rudimentary type of society.\\" Legacy Visual portrayals of Pogor include a sketch by Eugen N. Ghika-Bude»ôti, first published in 1895. It shows the Junimist relaxing among lewd devadasis, \\"leaving behind him the boredom that is the Vice President's chair\\".

Valentin CiucƒÉ, \\"Resursele vitale ale sculpturii...\\", in √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene, Nr. 2/2009, p. 52 In literature, Eminescu's 1878 parody of the Odyssey, referencing a moment of Junimist crisis, portrays Pogor as \\"the swineherd Pogoros\\" (the club's own Eumaeus).Traian Diaconescu, \\"Antropomorfism. Discurs parodic »ôi func»õii ludice\\", in Viorica S. Constantinescu, Cornelia Viziteu, Lucia Cifor (eds.), Studii Eminescologice, 13, p. 28. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Clusium, 2011 In addition to his affectionate memoirs, Iacob Negruzzi also made Pogor the subject of an 1872 poem: Pogor's work as poet and theorist was largely forgotten by later generations. This was noted by Junimea anthologist Eugen Lovinescu, who made the conscious effort of reviving the deterministic Parnassian, alongside other \\"minor Junimists\\", to evidence \\"what they still have that's viable.\\" Pogor left one son, Vasile Panopol, a once-famous historiographer of Ia»ôi. Ioana Ciofl√¢ncƒÉ, \\"StrƒÉlucirea pierdutƒÉ a StrƒÉzii LƒÉpu»ôneanu\\", in Ie»ôeanul, May 5, 2008 Born out of wedlock, Panopol had a similar taste for pranks, and belonged to the infamous \\"black gang\\" of rebellious aristocrats.

The new owners made structural changes, and replaced the Pogor family monograms with Moruzi arms. In the late 1930s, BrƒÉtianu rented Casa Pogor to the Ia»ôi's Royal Commissioner, and, during World War II, it was confiscated by Soviet representatives. Nationalized during the first decades of Communist Romania, it was refurbished by the state only after 1968. It was ultimately created a museum in 1972 or 1973, and is a regional center of the Museum of Romanian Literature network (supervising other monuments, including, as of 1995, the Negruzzi Memorial House of Trife»ôti).

During the period of Soviet rule in Bessarabia (the Moldavian SSR), references to Romanian cultural assets were usually shunned; this changed in the late 1980s, when Bessarabian cultural magazines were allowed to republish samples of classical Romanian literature. Nistru journal inaugurated the trend in 1988, choosing Pogor as the first contributor to revive.

Three haulage companies that operated from the village also provided a source of employment. There was for many years a junior football team that played in the village, known as Douglas Water Thistle, but they became defunct some time ago. Several of their players have gone on to enjoy careers as professional footballers. There was also a train station servicing Douglas Water, but it stopped being a working station around the time of the Beeching cuts. The station platform still exists. When the last coal mine in the village closed in 1967 the village lost much of its population, as people left for other areas in search of employment. This was the beginning of the decline for Douglas Water as after then the local amenities, football club, train station and much of the other services in the village closed. The village today is a shadow of its former self, with many streets lying totally empty where the houses that once stood there having long since been demolished.

Life and career Marmontel was born in Clermont-Ferrand. He entered the Paris Conservatory in 1827. His teachers were Pierre Zimmerman in pianoforte, Victor Dourlen in harmony, Jacques Fromental Hal√©vy in fugue and Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur in composition. He achieved first prizes in theory of music and piano. In 1837, he became an assistant in theory of music at the Conservatory. In 1848 he succeeded Zimmerman as Professor of Keyboard at the Conservatory, beating his former teacher Charles-Valentin Alkan, and as a consequence derailing the latter's career. His memoir of his sometime colleague in his book 'Les pianistes c√©l√®bres' is nonetheless one of the most valuable sources for Alkan's biography. Marmontel achieved renown as an effective and imaginative teacher. He had many pupils including Antoine Simon, Georges Bizet, Vincent d'Indy, Th√©odore Dubois, Dominique Ducharme, Gustave Gagnon, Ernest Guiraud, √âmile Paladilhe, Edward MacDowell, Gabriel Piern√©, Paul Rougnon, Paul Wachs, Louis Di√©mer, Francis Plant√©, Andr√© Wormser, Marguerite Long, Zulema Garcia Olsen and Claude Debussy. Marmontel's career is marked by a great number of pedagogical works (more than 200 opus numbers) as well as nocturnes, romances and many other pieces. Notably, he published L'Art de d√©chiffrer (cent √©tudes faciles) (\\"The Art of Sight-Reading\\" (100 Easy Studies); √âcole √©l√©mentaire de m√©canisme et de style (\\"Basic School of Fingering and Style\\") (24 studies) in 1847 ; √âtude de m√©canisme (\\"Fingering Study\\"); Cinq √©tudes de salon (\\"Five Salon Music Studies\\"); L'Art de d√©chiffrer √† quatre mains (\\"The Art of Sight-Reading for Four Hands\\") in 1847 ; and Enseignement progressif et rationnel du piano (\\"Progressive and Rational Piano Teaching\\") in 1887. Marmontel's musicographical works number among the best sources for the history of piano and pianists, particularly for the 19th century. They include his Symphonistes et virtuoses (\\"Symphonists and Virtuosi\\") in 1880; Les Pianistes c√©l√®bres (\\"Famous Pianists\\") in 1878; Virtuoses contemporains (\\"Contemporary Virtuosi\\") in 1882; √âl√©ments d'esth√©tique musicale et consid√©rations sur le beau dans les arts (\\"Fundamentals of Musical Aesthetics and Thoughts on Beauty in the Fine Arts\\") in 1884; and Histoire du piano et de ses origines (\\"History of the Piano and Its Origins\\") in 1885.

The brigade was included in the \\"order of battle\\" of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, together with the 150th Infantry Brigade and the 151st Infantry Brigade, and became part of XII Corps, British home forces. It went on to fight in the North African Campaign, Operation Husky, the D-Day landings and the North West Europe Campaigns.

Stanier North Africa In April 1941 the 69th Brigade, as part of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, was dispatched to the Middle East first via Cyprus, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and then into Libya as part of XIII Corps in the British Eighth Army which was one of the best-known formations in the Second World War. =Battle of Gazala= The Battle of Ghazala in May 1942, in vicinity of Tobruk The \\"Gazala Line\\" was a series of occupied \\"boxes\\" each of brigade strength set out across the desert with minefields and wire watched by regular patrols between the boxes. The Free French were to the south at the Bir Hakeim box. The line was not equally staffed with a greater number of troops covering the coast leaving the south less protected. By late May Rommel was ready. Facing him on the Gazala defences were 1st South African Division, nearest the coast, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (on their left) and 1st Free French Brigade furthest left at Bir Hakeim. The British 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions waited behind the main line as a mobile counter-attacking force while 2nd South African Division formed a garrison at Tobruk and 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had arrived in April to relieve 4th Indian Infantry Division) were held in reserve. The 69th Brigade position at the start of the battle can be seen in the map (right), it was during this battle that their sister brigade the 150th Infantry Brigade was destroyed in its isolated brigade box by the Afrika Corps and never reformed. The 69th Brigade and the remaining units of 50th Northumbrian Division had to escape by attacking west through the enemy lines then sweeping back east to the south of the enemy forces, eventually they reached the El Alamein line by 1 July. =El Alamein= Deployment of forces on the eve of battle The Battle of El Alamein is usually divided into five phases, consisting of the break-in (23‚Äì24 October), the crumbling (24‚Äì25 October), the counter (26‚Äì28 October), Operation Supercharge (1‚Äì2 November) and the breakout (3‚Äì7 November). No name is given to the period from 29 to 30 October when the battle was at a standstill. In the 2nd Battle of El Alamein, 69th Infantry Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division were initially deployed in the south (see map), where it was to attack the Italian 185th Parachute Division Folgore, supported by elements of the British 7th Armoured Division. Since the Division was understrength, owing to the loss of the 150th infantry Brigade, the 1st Free French Brigade and 1st Greek Brigade were attached to it for the battle. It was then transferred north to take part in Operation Supercharge.  Tunisia  =Mareth Line= Tunisia campaign The division fought in Tunisia, where Montgomery launched his major attack, Operation Pugilist, against the Mareth Line in the night of 19 March 1943 ‚Äì 20 March 1943. The 69th Infantry Brigade part of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, with difficulty, penetrated the Italian held line near Zarat. The terrain and heavy rain, however, prevented deployment of tanks and anti-tank guns and the 15th Panzer Division's counter-attack on 22 March recaptured much of the bridgehead. =Lieutenant Colonel Derek Anthony Seagrim, VC 20/21 March 1943= On 20/21 March 1943 at the Mareth Line, Tunisia, Lieutenant-Colonel Seagrim's courage and leadership led directly to the capture of an important objective. When it appeared that the attack on the position would fail owing to the intensity of the enemy fire, he placed himself at the head of his battalion and led them forward. He personally helped to place a scaling ladder over an anti-tank ditch and was the first across. Leading an attack on two machine-gun posts, he accounted for twenty of the enemy and when a counter- attack was launched next day he moved from post to post quite unperturbed, until it was defeated. Lieutenant-Colonel Seagrim was killed in action shortly afterwards, on 6 April 1943. Soon after, XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf. The 4th Indian Infantry Division was detailed to make a night attack on 23 March around the left-hand end of the Line. This would coincide with the wide \\"left hook\\" manoeuver Montgomery was planning. Operation Supercharge II, \\"left hook\\" outflanking maneuver via the Tebaga Gap. Montgomery reinforced the flanking attack, which on 26 March forced an Axis retreat that was completed by 31 March with the Eighth Army in pursuit. Gabes Both the Eighth Army and the U.S. II Corps continued their attacks over the next week, and eventually the Eighth Army broke the lines and the DAK was forced to abandon Gabes and retreat to join the other Axis forces far to the north. On the night of 5 April, Wadi Akarit, was attacked and the \\"Tobruk\\" Battalion of the Italian San Marco Marines, was destroyed, although casualties among the 6th Green Howards had been severe; two senior officers, six senior NCO's and junior officers and one hundred and eighteen other ranks killed. \\"When we were about ten yards away we had reached the top of the slit trench and we killed any of the survivors,\\" recalled British infantryman Bill Cheall of the 6th Green Howards, who had just seen his section leader shot down by a San Marco Marine. \\"It was no time for pussy footing, we were intoxicated with rage and had to kill them to pay for our fallen pal.\\" German General Hans-J√ºrgen von Arnim later said of the San Marco Marines fighting abilities in Tunisia in 1943, that they were \\"the best soldiers I ever commanded\\". The Eighth Army's attack along the eastern coast of Tunisia, lead eventually to the surrender of Axis forces in Africa. 250,000 men were taken prisoner, a number equal to that at Stalingrad. Operation Husky , Sicily Invasion Map of the Allied landings in Sicily on 10 July 1943 After Tunisia the Brigade was still part of 50th Northumbrian Infantry Division and was involved in the Sicily landings of July 1943. The latter was to operate in the eastern sector, and had as its objectives the port of Syracuse and the airfield at Pachino. Its XIII Corps, (which included 50th (Northumbrian) Division), was to land south of Cap Murro Di Porco with 5th British Infantry Division on a two-brigade front, 50th (Northumbrian) Division on a one-brigade front. XXX Corps, would operate on three sides of Passero, where the 231st Infantry Brigade, who had joined the 50th Division to replace the destroyed 150th Infantry Brigade, would advance on a one brigade front. When it landed at Avola their objective was the hills above the landing beaches. After Sicily the Brigade and Division was then recalled from the 8th Army in Italy, on the wishes of the British Eighth Army's old Commander, General Bernard Law Montgomery, together with 7th Armoured Division and 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, to prepare for the invasion of North-West Europe. Operation Overlord , D-Day Routes taken by the D-Day invasion On 19 October 1943 the 69th Infantry Brigade as part of 50 Northumbrian Division was withdrawn to Britain for reforming and training before landing on Gold Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944, together with the 151st Brigade,the 231st Infantry Brigade (previously an independent unit formed from regular troops stationed on Malta) permanently attached to the 50th Division, and the 56th Infantry Brigade temporarily attached. =Objectives= The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was to establish a beachhead between Arromanches and Ver-sur-Mer and then head south towards Route Nationale 13 linking Caen with Bayeux. The first wave is made of the 231st Infantry and 69th Infantry Brigades. Once the initial assault is over and the beachhead established, the follow-up brigades the 56th and 151st will push inland to the south-west towards RN 13 supported by the tanks of the 8th Armoured Brigade. To the west, the 47 Royal Marine Commando's mission is to capture Port-en-Bessin and link-up with U.S. forces landed on Omaha Beach. The 50th Infantry Division was also meet up with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division coming from Juno Beach. Troops take shelter near an M10 tank destroyer, 6 June 1944 Members of the Green Howards Talking to French Cilivians, 23 August 1944. = Gold Beach = Gold Beach was the Allied codename for the centre invasion beach during the Second World War Allied Invasion of Normandy, 6 June 1944. It lay between Omaha Beach and Juno Beach, was 8 km wide and divided into four sectors. From West to East they were How, Item, Jig, and King. The beach was assaulted in multiple brigades of the 50th Northumbrian Division, on the West was the 231st Brigade, followed by the 56th Brigade, attached to this was a regiment of DD tanks from the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers), the infantry assault battalions that attacked in the West were; the 1st Battalion Hampshire Regiment, and the 1st Battalion Dorset Regiment. On the East 69th Brigade, followed by 151st Brigade, again a regiment of DD tanks was attached, they were from the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards, the infantry assault battalions that attacked in the East were; the 5th Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment, and the 6th Battalion Green Howards. Their primary objective was to seize the town of Bayeux, the Caen-Bayeux road, and the port of Arromanches with the secondary objectives being to make contact with the Americans landing at Omaha Beach to the West and the Canadians landing at Juno Beach to the East. The 716th Static Infantry Division commanded by Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, and elements of the 1st Battalion of the German 352nd Infantry Division commanded by Generalleutnant Dietrich Kraiss, defended the Channel coast for the Germans. H-Hour for the Gold beach landing was set for 0725 hours, Company Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis of the Green Howards was already a seasoned veteran when he landed on Gold Beach. His first action was the single handed capture of a pill box which had been bypassed by the first waves of troops. Later that day he led an assault to destroy German gun positions. For his action he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was the only soldier to earn that medal on D-Day. =Stanley Elton Hollis VC= Stanley Elton Hollis, VC (21 September 1912 ‚Äì 8 February 1972) He has the unique distinction of being awarded the only Victoria Cross awarded on D-Day (6 June 1944). On 6 June 1944 in Normandy, France, Stanley Hollis 6th Battalion Green Howards, went with his company commander to investigate two German pill-boxes which had been by-passed as the company moved inland from the beaches. He rushed forward to the first pill- box, taking all but five of the occupants prisoner and then dealt with the second, taking 26 prisoners. Then he cleared a neighbouring trench. Later that day, he led an attack on an enemy position which contained a field gun and Spandau machine guns. After withdrawing he learned that two of his men had been left behind and told Major Lofthouse, his commanding officer, \\" I took them in. I will try to get them out.\\" Taking a grenade from one of his men Hollis carefully observed the enemy's pattern of behaviour and threw it at the most opportune moment. Unfortunately, he had forgotten to prime the grenade but the enemy didn't know this and kept their heads down waiting for it to explode. By the time they realised their mistake Hollis was on top of them and had shot them. Operation Market Garden Operation Market Garden (17 September 1944 ‚Äì 25 September 1944) was an Allied military operation in the Second World War in the Netherlands and Germany. =Market= Market would employ three Airborne Divisions. The U.S. 101st Airborne Division, would drop in two locations just north of XXX Corps to take the bridges northwest of Eindhoven at Son and Veghel. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division,would drop northeast of them to take the bridges at Grave and Nijmegen, and the 1st British Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade would drop at the extreme north end of the route, to take the road bridge at Arnhem and rail bridge at Oosterbeek. = Garden = Garden consisted primarily of XXX Corps and was spearheaded by the Guards Armoured Division, with the 43rd Wessex and 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division including 69th Infantry Brigade, in reserve. 17 September 1944 at 13.30 hrs the 50th Division watched as one of the largest air armadas of the war pass overhead. The division's field artillery 74th, 90th and 124th Fd Regts RA and the Mortars of Cheshire Regiment took part in the opening barrage. At 14:35 hrs the Shermans of the Irish Guards crossed the start line and despite heavy fighting reached Valkenswaard five miles (8 km) south of Eindhoven by dusk. 22 September, 69th Brigade was in trouble when two battalions of infantry and a regiment of tanks cut the main Corps centre-line near Uden, eight miles (13 km) south of the bridge at Grave. The brigade was cut in half with East Yorkshires in the north while the Green Howards where in the south. Rations were short because of the road congestion.69th Brigade were forced to eat captured German rations which were terrible the jam tasted like rubber, the margarine was rancid and the medical officers confirmed that the meat was all bad. 23 September 69th Brigade, with 124th Field Regiment Royal Artillery continued onward towards Nijmegen. They then came under the command of the Guards Armoured Division with the task of capturing Bemmel, north of the river. The 5th East Yorks achieved on 25 September, but the Germans kept them under heavy artillery fire for days. 26 September the 6th Green Howards were ordered to occupy Haalderen, but ran into opposition, and failed to capture their objective. The 69th Brigade now attacked in the direction of Haalderen continued throughout 27 September. During the day the East Yorks gained some ground as they were supported by a quick barrage. The airborne troops farther north at Arnhem had by now been withdrawn. The attempt to reach them by land had clearly failed, and attempts to supply them by air had been only partially successful. Thus the final objective of Operation \\"Market Garden\\" Arnhem and the crossing of the Rhine defences had not been achieved. 30 September All of 50th Division was tasked with guarding the bridge and bridgehead north of Nijmegen called the Island. The first German counterattack came when seventy tanks and the equivalent of an infantry division was unleashed on the division. 69th Brigade and the 5th Guards Brigade were holding the line, while another attack was put in against 43rd Division across the Nederrijn. The intensity of the attack on the 69th Brigade and their defence can be judged by the fact that 124th Field Regiment RA fired a total of 12,500 25-pound shells during the action and 'B' Company of 2nd Cheshires fired 95,000 rounds of medium-machine-gun fire.

This occurs when two or more interacting characteristics undergo natural selection together in response to the same selective pressure or when selective pressures alter one characteristic and consecutively alter the interactive characteristic. These interacting characteristics are only beneficial when together, sometimes leading to increased interdependence. Co-adaptation and coevolution, although similar in process, are not the same; co-adaptation refers to the interactions between two units, whereas co-evolution refers to their evolutionary history. Co-adaptation and its examples are often seen as evidence for co-evolution.  Genes and Protein Complexes  At genetic level, co-adaptation is the accumulation of interacting genes in the gene pool of a population by selection. Selection pressures on one of the genes will affect its interacting proteins, after which compensatory changes occur. Proteins often act in complex interactions with other proteins and functionally related proteins often show a similar evolutionary path. A possible explanation is co- adaptation. An example of this is the interaction between proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA). MtDNA has a higher rate of evolution/mutation than nDNA, especially in specific coding regions. However, in order to maintain physiological functionality, selection for functionally interacting proteins, and therefore co-adapted nDNA will be favourable. Co- adaptation between mtDNA and nDNA sequences has been studied in the copepod Tigriopus californicus. The mtDNA of COII coding sequences among conspecific populations of this species diverges extensively. When mtDNA of one population was placed in a nuclear background of another population, cytochrome c oxidase activity is significantly decreased, suggesting co-adaptation. Results show an unlikely relationship between the variation in mtDNA and environmental factors. A more likely explanation is the neutral evolution of mtDNA with compensatory changes by the nDNA driven by neutral evolution of mtDNA (random mutations over time in isolated populations). =Bacteria and bacteriophage= Gene blocks in bacterial genomes are sequences of genes, co-located on the chromosome, that are evolutionarily conserved across numerous taxa.Ream DC, Bankapur AR, Friedberg I. An event-driven approach for studying gene block evolution in bacteria. Bioinformatics. 2015 Jul 1;31(13):2075-83. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv128. Epub 2015 Feb 25. PMID: 25717195; PMCID: PMC4481853 Some conserved blocks are operons, where the genes are cotranscribed to polycistonic mRNA, and such operons are often associated with a single function such as a metabolic pathway or a protein complex. The co- location of genes with related function and the preservation of these relationships over evolutionary time indicates that natural selection has been operating to maintain a co-adaptive benefit. As the early mapping of genes on the bacteriophage T4 chromosome progressed, it became evident that the arrangement of the genes is far from random.Edgar RS, Epstein RH. The genetics of a bacterial virus. Sci Am. 1965 Feb;212:70-8. doi: 10.1038/scientificamerican0265-70. PMID: 14272117 Genes with like functions tend to fall into clusters and appear to be co-adapted to each other. For instance genes that specify proteins employed in bacteriophage head morphogenesis are tightly clustered.Kutter E, T Stidham, B Guttman, E Kutter, D Batts, S Peterson, T Djavakhishvili, F Arisaka, V Mesyanzhinov, W Ruger, G Mosig. 1994. Genomic map of bacteriophage T4, p. 491‚Äì519. In J Karam, JW Drake, KN Kreuzer, G Mosig, DH Hall, FA Eiserling, LW Black, EK Spicer, E Kutter, K Carlson, ES Miller (ed.), Molecular biology of bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C. Other examples of apparently co-adapted clusters are the genes that determine the baseplate wedge, the tail fibers, and DNA polymerase accessory proteins. In other cases where the structural relationship of the gene products is not as evident, a co-adapted clustering based on functional interaction may also occur. Thus ObringerObringer JW. The functions of the phage T4 immunity and spackle genes in genetic exclusion. Genet Res. 1988 Oct;52(2):81-90. doi: 10.1017/s0016672300027440. PMID: 3209067 proposed that a specific cluster of genes, centered around the imm and spackle genes encodes proteins adapted for competition and defense at the DNA level.  Organs  Similar to traits on a genetic level, aspects of organs can also be subject to co-adaptation. For example, slender bones can have similar performance in regards to bearing daily loads as thicker bones, due to slender bones having more mineralized tissue. This means that slenderness and the level of mineralization have probably been co-adapted. However, due to being harder than thick bones, slender bones are generally less pliant and more prone to breakage, especially when subjected to more extreme load conditions. Weakly electric fish are capable of creating a weak electric field using an electric organ. These electric fields can be used to communicate between individuals through electric organ discharges (EOD), which can be further modulated to create context-specific signals called ‚Äòchirps‚Äô. Fish can sense these electric fields and signals using electroreceptors. Research on ghost knifefish indicates that the signals produced by electric fish and the way they are received might be co-adapted, as the environment in which the fish resides (both physical and social) influences selection for the chirps, EODs, and detection. Interactions between territorial fish favour different signal parameters than interactions within social groups of fish.  Behaviour  The behaviour of parents and their offspring during feeding is influenced by one another. Parents feed depending on how much their offspring begs, while the offspring begs depending on how hungry it is. This would normally lead to a conflict of interest between parent and offspring, as the offspring will want to be fed as much as possible, whereas the parent can only invest a limited amount of energy into parental care. As such, selection would occur for the combination of begging and feeding behaviours that leads to the highest fitness, resulting in co- adaptation. Parent-offspring co-adaption can be further influenced by information asymmetry, such as female blue tits being exposed more to begging behaviour in nature, resulting in them responding more than males to similar levels of stimuli.  Partial and antagonistic co-adaptation  It is also possible for related traits to only partially co-adapt due to traits not developing at the same speed, or contradict each other entirely. Research on Australian skinksHuey, R. B., and A. F. Bennett. 1987. Phylogenetic studies of coadaptation: preferred temperatures versus optimal performance temperatures of lizards. Evolution 41:1098‚Äì1115. revealed that diurnal skinks have a high temperature preference and can sprint optimally at higher temperatures, while nocturnal skinks have a low preferred temperature and optimum temperature. However, the differences between high and low optimal temperatures were much smaller than between preferred temperatures, which means that nocturnal skinks sprint slower compared to their diurnal counterparts. In the case of Eremiascincus, the optimum temperature and preferred temperature diverged from one another in opposite directions, creating antagonistic co-adaptation.

It holds its Annual Exhibition of portraiture at Mall Galleries, and runs a commissions service to help those wanting a portrait. It also hosts Prizes, Awards, demonstrations, workshops, debates and talks. The Society is a member of the Federation of British Artists. History The Royal Society of Portrait Painters was founded in 1891 by the leading portrait painters of the day. Being dissatisfied with the selection policies of the Royal Academy for its annual exhibition in London, they formed a new body to be concerned solely with portrait painting. Centenary Catalogue Cover - The Royal Society of Portrait Painters The first exhibition of the Society was held in 1891. The catalogue of that exhibition shows that its committee then consisted of Archibald Stuart-Wortley (Chairman), Hon. John Collier, Arthur Hacker, G. P. Jacomb-Hood, S.J. Solomon, James Jebusa Shannon and Hubert Vos. The other members listed were Percy Bigland, C. A. Furse, Glazebrook, John McLure Hamilton, Heywood Hardy, Hubert von Herkomer, Henry J. Hudson, Louise Jopling, T. B. Kennington, W. Llewellyn, W. M. Loudan, Arthur Melville, Anna Lea Merritt, F. M. Skipworth, Mrs Annie Swynnerton, W. R. Symonds, Mary Waller, Edwin A. Ward, Leslie Ward (better known as \\"Spy\\"), and T. Blake Wirgman. Other early members included Sir John Everett Millais, George Frederick Watts, John Singer Sargent, Augustus John and James McNeill Whistler. Women were eligible for membership from the start. At the Coronation Exhibition of 1911, which marked its 20th anniversary, it was announced that King George V had conferred on the Society the status of a Royal Society, and it has been known as the Royal Society of Portrait Painters since then. The Times said on 22 April 2006: Activities Portrait Commissions Service To encourage the genre of portrait painting, they offer a portrait commissions service helping people to commission portraits from the initial thought, through finding the right artist, to the final work. They hold portfolios of portrait painters' work available to view by appointment throughout the year. = Annual Exhibition = Entrance to Mall Galleries The Society holds an Annual Exhibition, which takes place every year at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, by Trafalgar Square, London. IT forms a major showcase for recent portraits and is the largest contemporary portrait exhibition in the UK. It is formed of about 220 works and is in two parts: a cohort of work by distinguished members and works by non-member artists who have successfully competed to be included in the show. Unlike other shows, the works are entirely selected by portrait painters. The exhibition aims to include the best of a wide variety of styles in painted and drawn media. Prizes and Awards Many prizes are awarded via the Annual Exhibition. These include the Ondaatje Prize for Portraiture, the Prince of Wales Award for Portrait Drawing, the Burke's Peerage Foundation Prize and the de Laszlo Foundation Prize, and the Smallwood Architects Prize. Learning The Society also holds portrait demonstrations, workshops, talks and tours. Collections =The People's Portrait Collection= The People‚Äôs Portraits Collection owned by the Society was founded in 2000 as a millennial exhibition. The idea was to represent ordinary people from all walks of life, and thereby offer a picture of the United Kingdom as it moved from the 20th century into the 21st. Each portrait is donated by a Member and Members continue to add to this collection. The Collection has been housed at Girton College (one of the 31 constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge) since 2002 as a long-term loan, and is open to the public every day.

Printed in Dublin by John Daly, 1862 Life He was the fourth son of Edmond O'Donovan and Eleanor Hoberlin of Rochestown. His early career may have been inspired by his uncle Parick O'Donovan. He worked for antiquarian James Hardiman researching state papers and traditional sources at the Public Records Office. Hardiman had secured O'Donovan a place in Maynooth College which he turned down. He also taught Irish to Thomas Larcom for a short period in 1828 and worked for Myles John O'Reilly, a collector of Irish manuscripts. Following the death of Edward O'Reilly in August 1830, he was recruited to the Topographical Department of the first Ordnance Survey of Ireland under George Petrie in October 1830. Apart from a brief period in 1833, he worked steadily for the Survey on place-name researches until 1842, unearthing and preserving many manuscripts. After that date, O'Donovan's work with the Survey tailed off, although he was called upon from time to time to undertake place-name research on a day-to-day basis. He researched maps and manuscripts at many libraries and archives in Ireland and England, with a view to establishing the correct origin of as many of Ireland's 63,000 townland names as possible. His letters to Larcom are regarded as an important record of the ancient lore of Ireland for those counties he documented during his years of travel throughout much of Ireland. By 1845, O'Donovan was corresponding with the younger scholar William Reeves, and much of their correspondence to 1860 survives. O'Donovan became professor of Celtic Languages at Queen's University, Belfast, and was called to the Bar in 1847. His work on linguistics was recognised in 1848 by the Royal Irish Academy, who awarded him their prestigious Cunningham Medal. On the recommendation of Jacob Grimm, he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Prussia in 1856. Never in great health, he died shortly after midnight on 10 December 1861 at his residence, 36 Upper Buckingham Street, Dublin. He was buried on 13 December 1861 in Glasnevin Cemetery, where his tombstone inscription has slightly wrong dates of both birth and death. He married Mary Anne Broughton, sister-in-law of Eugene O'Curry and was father of nine children (all but one of whom died without issue). His wife received a small state pension after his death. Personal genealogy In a letter to Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa of 29 May 1856 John O'Donovan gave his lineage as follows: * From the senior branch of Clann-Cahill, descended from the elder son Donnell II O'Donovan, married Joanna MacCarthy Reagh of Castle Donovan and who died 1638 * Edmond, married Catherine de Burgo, killed 1643. * Conor, married Rose Kavanagh. * William, married Mary Oberlin, a Puritan, died 1749. * Edmond, married to Mary Archdeacon, died 1798. * Edmond, married Eleanor Oberlin, died 1817. * John O'Donovan, L.L.D. married to Mary Ann Broughton, a descendant of Cromwellian settlers. * Edmond 1840 d. 1842, John 1842, Edmond 1844 later War Correspondent (died in Sudan) 1882, William 1846, Richard 1846, Henry dead 1850, Henry 1852, Daniel 1856, Morgan Kavanaugh O'C 1859 d.1860.

The island forms part of the Commune of Cabo de Hornos, the southernmost commune in Chile and in the world, belonging to Ant√°rtica Chilena Province in the XII Region of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica. Its population is concentrated primarily in the communal capital, Puerto Williams, and in small settlements like Puerto Navarino, R√≠o Guanaco and Puerto Toro. The highest point of the island is Pico Navarino at . The island is a popular destination for fly-fishers.  History History and archaeology may be the most valuable resource of Navarino Island and its adjacent sectors. It is considered to have one of the most dense concentrations of archeological sites in the world. The Yahgan were nomadic people, and moved their settlements on a seasonal basis. Their middens show their dependence of fish and shellfish for food, as well as some vegetables that they gathered. There is a Megalithic Yaghan archaeological site dating to about 10,000 years ago near Wulaia Bay, which C. Michael Hogan terms the Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens. Numerous remains of huts surrounded by ring middens have been found on the lowland terraces.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham Interest in the Yahgan culture attracts tourists. At the regional museum, the Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum, exhibits of the Yaghan culture: their dwellings, fish traps, and crafts; and the remains of the 19th- century English missions can be seen. Aquatic birds, and the geology and botany of the island, also attract tourists. The waters around Navarino Island were the location of the Snipe incident a military incident that took place between Chile and Argentina in 1958 as a result of a disputed border line in the Beagle Channel. The Snipe Incident was part of the wider Beagle Conflict between Chile and Argentina which brought both countries to the brink of war in 1978. Both countries disagreed about the sovereign rights over the zone and Snipe, an uninhabitable islet between Picton Island and Navarino Island, claimed by both. Chileans call the waterway around the islet Beagle Channel, but in Argentina they called it Moat channel on the grounds that the Beagle Channel, allegedly, went south around Navarino Islandhttp://www.argentina- rree.com/13/13-023.htm.  Name  Jacques l'Hermite's Nassau Fleet were the first Europeans to disembark at the Navarino Island, in 1624. They recorded the native name of the island as Wulla. HMS Beagle visited the island under the command of Phillip Parker King and Robert FitzRoy as part of a survey started in 1829. They named the island after then-recent Battle of Navarino (1827) which was a turning point of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire.  Features  The coast of Navarino Island offers opportunities for sea kayaking among small barren islands and channels surrounded by native vegetation and populated by a rich variety of birds. There is fishing in the Murray Channel. Boat trips can also be taken to visit the glaciers of the northwest arm of the Beagle Channel (located in the Alberto de Agostini National Park), and towards Cape Horn and Chilean Antarctica. There is a hiking circuit around the jagged pinnacles known as the Dientes de Navarino. The trail passes peaks known as Cerro Clem and Montes Lindenmayer, named in 2001 by the Chilean Ministry of Natural Resources for the author of the Lonely Planet guide.Lindenmayer, C.(2003) Trekking in the Patagonian Andes Lonely Planet p.257 There are also areas for rock climbing. Several ranches have been established on the island. The northern section of the island is suitable for horseback riding. Salmon trout are found in abundance in Navarino Lake, and on the north coast of the island, the sea enters deep coves suitable for fishing snook.  Climate  The island has a polar tundra climate (K√∂ppen: ET). On the northern coastal strip, where Puerto Williams is located, the annual average precipitation is , with an average temperature of . The average temperature in the warmest month is , and in the coldest month . Further south, annual precipitation increases to about , with a slight diminution in temperatures. Precipitation is distributed more or less uniformly across the year, and some falls as snow. In the extensive southernmost part of the island, including Lakes Navarino and Windhond, there is an increase in precipitation, a diminution of summer temperatures, and an increase in the winter temperatures through  Flora  In the North end of the island the vegetation is characterized by the deciduous Magellanic forest, whose characteristic species are Lenga Beech (Nothofagus pumilio), with √ëirre Beech (Nothofagus antarctica) in the driest areas, Coihue of Magallanes (Nothofagus betuloides) in the wettest areas and some shrublands and Magellanic moorland in areas of poor drainage. Immediately to the south is the evergreen Magellanic rainforest, probably associated with the increased precipitation, the greater altitude and an improvement in the drainage. The characteristic species is Nothofagus betuloides (Coihue of Magallanes), forming pure communities in sectors of greater altitude or coasts exposed to the wind. The south portion of the island, surrounding Lakes Navarino and Windhond, and the territories of the southern coast, have a vegetation of Magellanic moorland. This includes a series of vegetal communities, the Esfagnosa Tundra (Sphagnum magellanicum) and the Pulvinada Tundra (Donatia fascicularis - Astelia pumila). At higher altitudes, the terrain is Andean Desert, which lacks trees or tall shrubs and is less than 30% covered by vegetation.  Fauna  Like much of surrounding Tierra del Fuego, Navarino Island has been severely affected by invasive beavers. The Canadian beavers were introduced to Tierra del Fuego in the 1940s by the Argentinian government in an effort to kickstart a fur trade in the area. With no natural predators, the beavers quickly spread to neighbouring islandshttps://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and- conservation/2019/07/argentina-brought-beavers-tierra-del-fuego-it-was-not- good. Because the trees in Tierra del Fuego and Isla Navarino do not have any natural defences, they are unable to recover once felled by beavers. Researchers from the University of North Texas, when studying Navarino Island found that the slow-moving water behind beaver dams has attracted two further invasive species to the Island, muskrat and mink. While the mink prey on the muskrats, they also feed on native geese and duck, leading to what they term an \\"invasive meltdown process\\"http://www.umag.cl/facultades/williams/wp- content/uploads/2017/05/Crego-Jimenez-Rozzi-2016-Biological-Invasions.pdf.  Natural and cultural features  Yahgan Cemetery at Mejillones Cultural historical sites are Bahia Wulaia and the English Mission of Douglas Creek. The large Stirling House, an iron Meccano construction brought in 1869 from England by the Anglican English missionaries, used to be in Ushuaia. It was moved to Tekenika Bay, and then was installed for mission use at Douglas Creek. In the Yahgan cemetery at Mejillones Bay, tombs dating from the first half of the 20th century show elements of religious syncretism. Villa Ukika is a district of Puerto Williams where the last few Yaghan people live. Puerto Navarino, a fishing port for king crabs, has wooden buildings, constructed mainly in the 1930s. Puerto Toro is the world's southernmost settlement. Skiing is available in Cerro La Bandera, near Puerto Williams. Whales and orcas can be seen in Windhond Bay. The area of Isla Navarino and the surrounding islands have been declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in June 2005, called Cabo de Hornos Biosphere Reserve.  Access  Puerto Williams can be reached by air from Punta Arenas, by DAP through the Guardiamarina Za√±artu Airport, daily except Sundays. In addition there is a weekly ferry, crossing the Strait of Magellan and the Brecknock, Cockburn and Beagle Channels. The boat trip takes between 30 and 36 hours. As of January 2011, there was also a commercial connection by motorboat between Ushuaia and Isla Navarino.

It was located between the Strand and the River Thames. Formerly extra-parochial, it was a civil parish between 1866 and 1922. It now forms part of the City of Westminster in Greater London. Geography The area was occupied by Savoy Palace, the Savoy Hospital and the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy. To the south it had a boundary with the River Thames, to the east with the parish of St Mary le Strand, to the west and north with the parish of St Clement Danes. The boundary in the north was formed by the Strand. It was within the Savoy ward of the Liberty of the Savoy. thumb Governance The precinct of the Savoy formed part of the Liberty of the Savoy and was part of the Duchy of Lancaster.

He is currently the manager of Hvidovre IF. He won the 1995 Danish Cup with F.C. Copenhagen, and played 265 league games as a midfielder for Bolton Wanderers in England. Frandsen played 23 matches for the Denmark national football team between 1990 and 2003, and he represented his country at the 1992 Summer Olympics and 1998 FIFA World Cup tournaments. Biography Born in Copenhagen, Frandsen started playing football with local clubs BK Skjold and B 93. He made his senior debut with top-flight club B 1903, debuted for the Danish under-21 national team in April 1989. He was the third best goalscorer of the 1990 Danish 1st Division, and made his national team debut in May 1990. He played three national team games under national manager Richard M√∏ller Nielsen, until his national team career went on a hiatus in September 1991. In November 1990, he was sold to French club Lille OSC, in a Lille club record transfer deal. Frandsen joined fellow Danish international Jakob Friis-Hansen at Lille, and played four years at the club. While at Lille, he represented Denmark at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where he played full-time in Denmark's three games before elimination. When Lille faced economical difficulties in the summer 1994, Frandsen returned home to Denmark to play for F.C. Copenhagen (FCK). Frandsen stated his intention to only play in Denmark temporarily, and having won the 1995 Danish Cup with FCK, he moved abroad once again in August 1996. He was sold to English club Bolton Wanderers for ¬£1.25million. Playing in the second tier of English football, he made his debut for the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Port Vale before scoring his first goal for Bolton in the following game against Manchester City. He soon earned a reputation as one of the best players in English football playing outside the top-flight FA Premier League championship, and it was assumed that it would only be a matter of time before one of the bigger clubs came in for him. Instead, he helped Bolton win promotion back to the Premier League in the 1996‚Äì97 season. Frandsen's national team career was revived in November 1996, when he was recalled by new national manager Bo Johansson, after more than five years of absence from the Danish national team. He was one of the few bright spots of Bolton's second Premier League campaign, which ended in swift relegation back into the Football League. He was included in the Danish squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he was used as a substitute in two games. In September 1999, Frandsen joined Bolton's league rivals Blackburn Rovers for ¬£1.75 million. The decision was against the wishes of Bolton manager Colin Todd, who subsequently resigned. Frandsen's stay at Ewood Park for Blackburn was far from happy. He failed to settle at the club, and at the end of the season he returned to Bolton for ¬£1.6m. In his final year at Bolton, the club reached the 2004 League Cup final, though they were beaten 1‚Äì2 by Middlesbrough. He played 304 first team games for the club in all competitions, scoring 38 goals in the process. Frandsen left Bolton Wanderers to join Wigan Athletic on a free transfer in June 2004, helping them get promoted to the Premiership, scoring once in the process against Brighton. After playing well in his first time at the club, he received a severe cruciate ligament injury and he decided to retire in January 2005. After his retirement Frandsen worked as a football agent in Denmark, until he was named new assistant manager at HB K√∏ge in June 2009. Following the sacking of Tommy M√∏ller Nielsen in the autumn of 2012, he was promoted to manager of the club. He managed the club until June 2014, when he was hired as youth coach of Br√∏ndby IF. On 22 June 2015, Frandsen was appointed as the new manager of AB. In his first season, he led the club to promotion to the Danish 1st Division. His second season, however, saw the club struggling, and in December 2016 he was sacked, with the club in bottom place in the league. On 18 June 2017 he was named new manager of Hvidovre IF in the Danish 2nd Divisions.

The Savoy formed part of the Duchy of Lancaster, and was also known as the Liberty of the Duchy of Lancaster. The duchy continues to have land holdings within the area. The manor and liberty included parts of the parishes of St Clement Danes, St Mary le Strand and the whole of the precinct of the Savoy. History =Toponymy= Savoy is derived from Peter II, Count of Savoy who was granted land by Henry III in 1246. =Palace and hospital= In 1245 a palace was built by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Following his death, the palace was granted by Henry III to Peter of Savoy, uncle of his queen, Eleanor of Provence, and was renamed Savoy Palace. Peter in turn gave the palace to the Congregation of Canons of the Great Saint Bernard, and it became the \\"Great Hospital of St Bernard de Monte Jovis in Savoy\\". The hospital was purchased by Queen Eleanor who gave the site to her second son, Edmund, Earl of Lancaster. When Edward I became king, he confirmed the ownership of the Savoy area to Edmund with letters patent. =Duchy liberty= In 1351 Henry of Grosmont, a great-grandson of Henry III, was created the 1st Duke of Lancaster for services in the Hundred Years War. The seat of Lancaster in Lancashire was raised to a county palatine.Palatine is an adjective used in conjunction with the noun county; Palatinate is a noun used alone: Collins Dictionary, op.cit. This meant the area was ruled by hereditary noblemen possessing special authority and autonomy from the rest of the Kingdom of England. Although the noblemen swore allegiance to the king, they had the power to rule the county and its contiguous land largely independently of the king. All other properties attached to the Duchy of Lancaster, including the Savoy became subject to the laws of the duke. As a consequence, someone being pursued for a debt in London could reside in the Savoy without fear of arrest by people acting under the authority of The Crown. Royal writs were not enforceable within the County of Lancashire until the 19th century. Lancaster had its own Court of Chancery until the 1970s. These circumstances have been used in historical fiction, such as the Aubrey-Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian. Governance The area was a parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster. It was divided into four wards, Church, Middle, Royal and Savoy. It was governed by a court leet. The liberty of the Savoy was part of the county of Middlesex, and those connected with it who were eligible to vote at parliamentary elections were electors for Westminster. The Liberty of the Savoy was a franchise coroner's district until 1930, when it became part of the Central district of the County of London.http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33660/pages/7174/page.pdf The practice of beating the bounds was abandoned by the Duchy of Lancaster in 1969 and revived in 2010. Geography The Savoy had the River Thames as its southern boundary and was located primarily to the south of the Strand. It was made up of the following parishes and extra-parochial places (from west to east): *Part of the parish of St Clement Danes (south of the Strand, now location of Savoy Hotel) *All of the Precinct of the Savoy *Part of the parish of St Clement Danes (north of the Strand, around Burleigh House/Lyceum Theatre) *Part of the parish of St Mary le Strand (now mostly taken up by Somerset House) *Part of the parish of St Clement Danes (south of the Strand) The boundaries of the manor and liberty are indicated with a series of markers.

Signs and symptoms It is characterised by skin that is loose, hanging, wrinkled, and lacking in elasticity. The loose skin can be either generalised or localised. Biopsies have shown reduction and degeneration of dermal elastic fibres in the affected areas of skin. The loose skin is often most noticeable on the face, resulting in a prematurely aged appearance. The affected areas of skin may be thickened and dark. In addition, the joints may be loose (hypermobile) because of lax ligaments and tendons. When cutis laxa is severe, it can also affect the internal organs. The lungs, heart (supravalvular pulmonary stenosis), intestines, or arteries may be affected with a variety of severe impairments. In some cases, hernias and outpouching of the bladder can be observed. Patients can also present with whites of the eyes that are blue. Causes In many cases, cutis laxa is inherited. Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked recessive forms have been described, but acquired forms also occur. Cutis laxa is associated with deficient or absent elastin fibers in the extracellular matrix. This can be related to decreased elastin synthesis or structural defects in the extracellular matrix. Cutis laxa may be caused by mutations in the genes: ELN, ATP6V0A2, ATP7A, FBLN4, FBLN5, and PYCR1. A related neurocutaneous syndrome may be caused by mutations in the gene ALDH18A1 (P5CS). Cutis laxa may also be seen in association with inherited connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndromes. Another syndrome associated with cutis laxa is Lenz-Majewski syndrome which is due to a mutation in the phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PTDSS1) gene. In contrast, acquired cutis laxa often has a triggering event such as urticaria, drugs (such as penicillin) or neoplasms. Acquired cutis laxa may also be immunologically mediated, as it can involve dermal deposit of immunoglobulins and it can occur with autoimmune diseases. Acquired cutis laxa has been associated with granular immunoglobulin A deposits as well as abundant neutrophils. One hypothesis for the cause is excessive elastase release from neutrophils and macrophages. It has also been considered that mutations in elastin (ELN) and fibulin-5 (FBLN5) genes can increase susceptibility of elastic fibres to inflammatory degradation in acquired cutis laxa. Acquired cutis laxa has also been seen in conjunction with a number of conditions including: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, and monoclonal gammopathies. It can also occur as a postinflammatory response after urticaria. Urticarial skin fibroblasts have shown a 2- to 3- fold increase in elastase activity in a patient with acquired cutis laxa. Treatment As of 2019, there is no treatment for cutis laxa. Procedures aimed at mitigating symptoms and identifying subsequent conditions are often advised. No pharmacological agent has been able to stop the progression of the disease. However, cosmetic surgeries are potentially an option as cutis laxa does not generally involve vascular fragility.

His first employment was in Mainz, where he restored and refurbished government buildings for the state of Hesse as a Grossherzoglicher Regierungsbaumeister (Grand Ducal Governmental Architect in Chief, documented as early as 2 December 1905). Following serious funding problems and the subsequent collapse of Hesse's building program, and possibly also due to him being Jewish, Beer could not find promotion in this position.

One of his descendants would later be World War I Medal of Honor recipient John Cantey Villepigue. Early career Villepigue (pronounced VIL-uh-PIG) was born in Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina, of French descent; one of no less than six Confederate generals who came from Kershaw County. Admitted to The South Carolina Military Academy at the Arsenal 1 Jan 1846, transferred The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina on 1 Jan 1847, a pay cadet and not eligible for a Beneficiary Cadet scholarship, he left to enter the United States Military Academy. He graduated from the United States Military Academy, in 1854, as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. His initial service was out on the frontiers of Kansas and Nebraska and he was involved in the Sioux expedition of 1855, the march to Fort Lookout, Dakota in 1856, and the Utah campaign of 1857-58. By now a first lieutenant, Villepigue spent time at the Carlisle Cavalry School and was on duty in Utah at the time of the secession, whereupon he resigned his commission on March 31, 1861, to enter the service of the Confederacy. Defense of Fort McRee Villepigue was initially commissioned as a captain of artillery but was quickly promoted to the rank of colonel in the provisional army and assigned to the 36th Georgia Infantry Regiment. His first notable action was to command the defense of Fort McRee, guarding Pensacola harbor, during the bombardment of November 22, 1861. At the time, his commanding officer, General Braxton Bragg, suggested that for the number and caliber of guns involved, this would surely rank as the heaviest bombardment in the world to date. Bragg praised Villepigue's coolness under fire, even while grievously wounded, and noted that his example caused the troops he was leading--for the most part raw volunteers from Georgia and Mississippi--to fight with the courage of veterans. General Bragg wrote of Colonel Villepigue that he was, \\"an educated soldier, possessing in an eminent degree the love and confidence of his officers and men, he had been specially selected for this important and perilous post. The result fully vindicates the fortunate choice, and presents for our admiration, blended in perfect harmony, the modest but heroic soldier with the humble but confiding Christian.\\" Defense of Fort Pillow Villepigue was promoted to the staff of General Bragg as chief of engineers and artillery. He moved to Mobile, Alabama, and was appointed a brigadier general early in 1862. General P.G.T. Beauregard, who also held him in high esteem, then moved him to command Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Villepigue recognized the weaknesses of the fort‚Äôs location, and made efforts to reduce them, however, they were under fairly constant bombardment by Union gunboats. Ordered to retire by General Beauregard, and to destroy all government property including guns, cannon and ammunition, his men blew up his fortifications and retreated to safety. Nineteen pieces of artillery were left behind. The Second Battle of Corinth Brigade commander Villepigue commanded a brigade at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862, in the division of Major General Mansfield Lovell, under the overall command of Maj. Gen. Earl van Dorn. He distinguished himself in both the successful opening attack and the covering of the eventual retreat. The arduous nature of the campaign laid him low with a fever, however, and, with the promise of a major general's commission, he was sent to Port Hudson, Louisiana, to recuperate. Unfortunately, no sooner had he arrived there than his condition worsened and he died of pneumonia. Brigadier General Villepigue is buried in the \\"Old Quaker Cemetery\\" in his home town of Camden, South Carolina. John Cantey Villepigue was buried there also after his death in World War I. That cemetery also maintains the grave of World War I Medal of Honor recipient Richmond Hobson Hilton, the graves of Civil War Confederate Generals Joseph B. Kershaw and John Doby Kennedy, and that of Confederate soldier and hero from the Battle of Fredericksburg, Richard Rowland Kirkland.

It's up to Ronaan, Farrg and Chaz to prevent the destruction of their world as they travel through Las Vegas, a junkyard, a desert and the heart of the Machine Empire. Gameplay At the beginning of each level, the player can choose his partner: the magic apprentice Chaz or the mercenary Farrg. Reception The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 6.5 out of 10, deeming it \\"a poor man's Gauntlet\\". They commented that the variety of weapons and spells is good but that the game is hard to the point where it's impossible to derive enjoyment out of it, particularly criticizing that the backgrounds make it hard to see enemies and other hazards. Ove Kaufeldt reviewed Technoclash for Swedish magazine Datormagazin in 1994. Kaufeldt felt that neither the graphics nor sound were great, the game was still really fun, and enjoyed the assortment of weapons.

What was originally described as Ornithoptera akakeae, is a supposed natural hybrid between Ornithoptera rothschildi and Ornithoptera priamus poseidon. History This species was first recognized by entomologist Charles Edgar Pratt and described by George Kenrick in 1911. It was named in honour of Lord Walter Rothschild who financed most of the expeditions of the naturalist Antwerp Edgar Pratt (1850-1924) and his two sons, Carl Brenders Pratt and Felix Biet Pratt, to British New Guinea from 1902‚Äì1903 and to the Arfak Mountains of Dutch New Guinea from 1909‚Äì1910. Description The females can reach a wingspan up to . The forewings are dark brown to blackish brown with creamy white to greyish spots. The hindwings rimmed with black scales and have a central patch of golden with black tips. The abdomen has hairy black rings. The wingspan of the males is approximately and the body length up to . The forewings of the males are surrounded with black scales and in the central area with blackish, yellowish-green and yellow scales. The hindwings have black scales on the edge. The central patch is yellow with black tips abutting with smaller spots which are coloured lime green. The abdomen is golden. Rothschild's Birdwing has the most restricted distribution of all birdwings. Its habitat are flowering meadows in an altitude of above sea level. References * *D'Abrera, B.

Blinn‚ÄìPhong is the default shading model used in OpenGL and Direct3D's fixed- function pipeline (before Direct3D 10 and OpenGL 3.1), and is carried out on each vertex as it passes down the graphics pipeline; pixel values between vertices are interpolated by Gouraud shading by default, rather than the more computationally-expensive Phong shading. Description Vectors for calculating Phong and Blinn‚ÄìPhong shading In Phong shading, one must continually recalculate the dot product R \\\\cdot V between a viewer (V) and the beam from a light-source (L) reflected (R) on a surface. If, instead, one calculates a halfway vector between the viewer and light-source vectors, : H = \\\\frac{L + V}{\\\\left\\\\ L + V \\\\right\\\\} R \\\\cdot V can be replaced with N \\\\cdot H, where N is the normalized surface normal. In the above equation, L and V are both normalized vectors, and H is a solution to the equation V=P_H(-L), where P_H is the Householder matrix that reflects a point in the hyperplane that contains the origin and has the normal H. This dot product represents the cosine of an angle that is half of the angle represented by Phong's dot product if V, L, N and R all lie in the same plane. This relation between the angles remains approximately true when the vectors don't lie in the same plane, especially when the angles are small. The angle between N and H is therefore sometimes called the halfway angle. Considering that the angle between the halfway vector and the surface normal is likely to be smaller than the angle between R and V used in Phong's model (unless the surface is viewed from a very steep angle for which it is likely to be larger), and since Phong is using \\\\left( R \\\\cdot V \\\\right)^{\\\\alpha}, an exponent can be set \\\\alpha^\\\\prime > \\\\alpha such that \\\\left(N \\\\cdot H \\\\right)^{\\\\alpha^\\\\prime} is closer to the former expression. For front-lit surfaces (specular reflections on surfaces facing the viewer), \\\\alpha^\\\\prime = 4\\\\,\\\\alpha will result in specular highlights that very closely match the corresponding Phong reflections. However, while the Phong reflections are always round for a flat surface, the Blinn‚ÄìPhong reflections become elliptical when the surface is viewed from a steep angle. This can be compared to the case where the sun is reflected in the sea close to the horizon, or where a far away street light is reflected in wet pavement, where the reflection will always be much more extended vertically than horizontally. Visual comparison: Blinn‚ÄìPhong highlights are larger than Phong with the same exponent, but by lowering the exponent, they can become nearly equivalent. Additionally, while it can be seen as an approximation to the Phong model, it produces more accurate models of empirically determined bidirectional reflectance distribution functions than Phong for many types of surfaces. Efficiency Blinn-Phong will be faster than Phong in the case where the viewer and light are treated to be very remote, such as approaching or at infinity. This is the case for directional lights and orthographic/isometric cameras. In this case, the halfway vector is independent of position and surface curvature simply because the halfway vector is dependent on the direction to viewer's position and the direction to the light's position, which individually converge at this remote distance, hence the halfway vector can be thought of as constant in this case. H therefore can be computed once for each light and then used for the entire frame, or indeed while light and viewpoint remain in the same relative position. The same is not true with Phong's method of using the reflection vector which depends on the surface curvature and must be recalculated for each pixel of the image (or for each vertex of the model in the case of vertex lighting). In 3D scenes with perspective cameras, this optimization is not possible. Code samples =High-Level Shading Language code sample= This sample in High-Level Shading Language is a method of determining the diffuse and specular light from a point light. The light structure, position in space of the surface, view direction vector and the normal of the surface are passed through. A Lighting structure is returned; The below also needs to clamp certain dot products to zero in the case of negative answers. Without that, light heading away from the camera is treated the same way as light heading towards it. For the specular calculation, an incorrect \\"halo\\" of light glancing off the edges of an object and away from the camera might appear as bright as the light directly being reflected towards the camera. struct Lighting { float3 Diffuse; float3 Specular; }; struct PointLight { float3 position; float3 diffuseColor; float diffusePower; float3 specularColor; float specularPower; }; Lighting GetPointLight(PointLight light, float3 pos3D, float3 viewDir, float3 normal) { Lighting OUT; if (light.diffusePower > 0) { float3 lightDir = light.position - pos3D; //3D position in space of the surface float distance = length(lightDir); lightDir = lightDir / distance; // = normalize(lightDir); distance = distance * distance; //This line may be optimised using Inverse square root //Intensity of the diffuse light.

Early life He was born in Kilrush, County Clare and educated at St. Flannan's College in Ennis, at University College Galway, and at University College Dublin (UCD) where he received a doctorate in veterinary medicine. He then worked as a lecturer. Political career Upton was first elected to public office as a Labour Party member of Dublin County Council for Terenure at the 1991 local elections, where he served until the Council's abolition in 1994, and then as a member of South Dublin County Council until 1999. He had unsuccessfully contested the Dublin South-Central constituency at the 1989 general election. However, he was then elected to the 19th Seanad on the Agricultural Panel, and became the Labour Party's leader in Seanad √âireann. At the 1992 general election, he stood again in Dublin South- Central, and in Labour's \\"Spring Tide\\" surge at that election, Upton topped the poll with nearly 12,000 first-preference votes, a remarkable 1.48 quotas. He was re-elected at the 1997 general election with a considerably reduced vote. In the 28th D√°il he was appointed as Labour's spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A leading critic of Labour's 1999 merger with the Democratic Left, he nonetheless became the party's spokesman on communications and sport after the merger. He was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 1994‚Äì1995. Death He died suddenly of a heart attack on 22 February 1999 at the UCD veterinary school, where he was still an occasional lecturer, and was survived by his wife and their four children. Politicians of all parties paid glowing tributes to him an outspoken but \\"erudite and incisive\\" contributions to politics and to Irish culture. The by- election for his D√°il seat in Dublin South-Central was held on 27 October 1999, and won for the Labour Party by his sister Mary Upton. Honours Following his death, the University College Dublin branch of the Labour party was named in his honour due to his involvement with the college.

He previously played with Barnsley, Sheffield United, Wigan Athletic and Oldham Athletic and Rotherham United. Career =Early career= Born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, Liddell started his league career at Barnsley, making his d√©but as a substitute against Portsmouth in 1992. He helped his team achieve promotion to the Premiership in 1997. Liddell played a part in a significant moment during Barnsley's Premier League season. On the Reds' visit to Anfield to play Liverpool, Liddell created Barnsley's match-winning goal. After being brought down by David James in the penalty area, Liddell could have won a penalty kick but persisted and set up Ashley Ward, who scored via a deflection off Patrick Berger. He fell out of favour in subsequent years, making most of his appearances from the substitute's bench. =Wigan Athletic= In October 1998, Liddell moved to Wigan Athletic for ¬£350,000, netting ten league goals in his first season at the club. After helping his team to Associate Members Cup success in 1999, he went on to become Wigan Athletic's Player of the Year for the 1999‚Äì2000 season. In the 2001‚Äì2002 campaign, Liddell finished as the club's leading scorer, an instrumental part of the team that would reach the play-offs for the second time in succession. During the course of the season, he scored the club's 1,500th league goal and his first career hat-trick against Brighton, following this up with another in a 4‚Äì1 defeat of Cambridge United. He received a call- up from Scotland coach Berti Vogts and attended an end-of-season training camp. Liddell was Wigan Athletic's longest-serving player when he left to join Sheffield United in 2004. He played just under 250 games for Wigan, finishing as the club's leading scorer with a tally of 70 goals, four more than that of David Lowe, the club's previous all-time leading goal-getter. In his final season for Wigan Athletic he played 38 games and scored 9 goals. When informed his place in the first team for the following season was uncertain, he transferred to Sheffield United. =Sheffield United= Liddell made his debut against Burnley on 7 August 2004, and his first goal followed against Nottingham Forest. Some of Liddell's most memorable appearances for United came in the FA Cup; in the third round they played Premier League side Aston Villa and beat them 3-1, with Liddell scoring twice. In the following round United faced fellow Championship club West Ham United. The tie went to a replay, in which Liddell scored as the game finished 1-1. In the subsequent penalty shootout he scored the winning penalty to send United through to the fifth round where they faced Arsenal. =Oldham Athletic= Liddell made his 100th league appearance for Oldham on 20 September 2008 in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Hartlepool United. Oldham terminated his contract on 7 April 2009, effectively ending his career with the club after a four-year stint in which he made 144 appearances. =Rotherham United= Liddell dropped into non-League football at the age of 36 when he signed for Northern Premier League club Bradford Park Avenue in July 2009. Chief executive Bob Blackburn described it as a \\"huge signing\\" for Avenue. On 30 July, however, Liddell signed a one-month contract with Rotherham United after impressing whilst on trial. This was later extended to a year but, after only two appearances. because of injury he called time on his playing career. On 22 March 2011, Liddell became Rotherham's caretaker manager for the remainder of the 2010‚Äì11 season, after manager Ronnie Moore left the club, to be assisted by Paul Warne and Andy Dibble.

Trying to stop one of these clashes, she is captured by the sight of a gargoyle on the rooftop of the school's main entrance which appears to be watching over her. After this incident, Miss Peters start to notice some changes in her behavior. For example, she pins one of the gang members in the classroom against a wall after a small class insubordination. Moments later, she spots another member of a gang vandalizing his locker. She violently confronts him, knocking him against the locker several times, chiding him that the school is older than his grandmother and if he respects his grandmother, then he should respect the school. Later that night, her dog starts barking at her for no apparent reason which leads her to believe there must be something very wrong with her.

The coat of arms of San Marino adorns among other things the flag of the country and the logo of the San Marino Football Federation. Description The official description of the coat of arms is: The components of the coat of arms are in detail: *In the blue shield there are three green mountains with three silver towers, each decorated with a weather vane consisting of a silver ostrich feather. The towers symbolize the three citadels of San Marino (La Guaita, La Cesta and La Montale), while the hills represent the three summits of Monte Titano. *The motto \\"LIBERTAS\\" (Lat. freedom). It possibly refers to the taking in of victims of political persecution in the earlier years of San Marino, and to the amazing maintenance of independence in the midst of many larger states. The motto could also have developed from the alleged last words of the founder Marinus: \\"Relinquo vos liberos ab utroque homine\\" (Lat. \\"I leave you free from both men\\").This somewhat mysterious phrase is most likely to refer to the two \\"men\\" from whose oppressive power Saint Marinus had decided to separate himself, becoming a hermit on Mount Titano: respectively, the Emperor and the Pope. This affirmation of freedom (first and foremost fiscal franchise) from both the State and the Church, however legendary, has always been the inspiration of the tiny republic.

The three main markets for this selling are the stock, bond, and foreign exchange market. It is a general term that indicates a firm that sells investment services to asset management firms, typically referred to as the buy side, or corporate entities. One important note, the sell side and the buy side work hand in hand and each side could not exist without the other. These services encompass a broad range of activities, including broking/dealing, investment banking, advisory functions, and investment research. Use In the capacity of a broker-dealer, \\"sell side\\" refers to firms that take orders from buy side firms and then \\"work\\" the orders. This is typically achieved by splitting them into smaller orders which are then sent directly to an exchange or to other firms. Sell side firms are intermediaries whose task is to sell securities to investors (usually the buy side i.e. investing institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds and insurance firms). Sell side firms are paid through commissions charged on the sales price of the stock to its customers because the firm handles all the details of the trade on the customer's behalf. Another source of money would be the idea of a spread. A spread is the difference when one sell side firm sells to a client and then goes on to sell the security to another client. Clients on the sell side can be high-net-worth individuals or institutions that include retirement funds for cities or states, as well as mutual funds. Sell side firms employ research analysts, traders and salespeople who collectively strive to generate ideas and execute trades for buy side firms, enticing them to do business. Roles of sell side analysts Sell side analysts have many roles. Sell side analysts rank stocks on a regular basis with three main options: buy, sell and hold. Part of the research analyst's job includes publishing research reports on public companies; these reports analyze their business and provide recommendations on the purchase or sale of the stock. Often, research analysts on the sell side cover an entire fund with a specific purpose or devoted to a specific sector. Sometimes a different approach is taken whereby multiple committees are in charge of different parts of the investment making process. Sell side analysts generally get their information for their reports from a variety of sources including public and private sources. The research reports ultimately published contain earnings forecasts, future prospects and recommendations as previously mentioned. In addition to the aforementioned, sell side analysts have the responsibility to take time and develop relationships with their clients as well as the companies they are researching. There has been research into the relationship between the quality of the research and the amount of capital that the firm collectively raises for its many clients. Many research analysts focus on one particular sector or industry such as telecom, technology, or healthcare, among many others. Sell side analysts are responsible for creating a pitch, usually in the form of a book, that is then presented to prospective clients usually for new stock. In 1975, the structure of sales commissions underwent significant reform when the US Congress ended the SEC's requirement of having a minimum commission, also known as deregulation. One recent trend in the industry has been the unbundling of commission rates; simply put, this is the process of separating the cost of trading the stock (e.g. trader's salaries) from the cost of research (e.g. research analyst salaries). This process allows buy side firms to purchase research from the best research firms and trade through the best trading firms, which often are not one and the same. Tracking analyst performance Analyst performance is ranked by a range of services such as StarMine owned by Thomson Reuters, Institutional Investor magazine, or TipRanks. In particular the Institutional Investor categorizes by many subdivisions including leading analysts, global rankings, and leading executives. Analyst accuracy has been measured as well in studies involving forecast information. Generally analyst forecasting is measured by absolute forecast error. Generally absolute forecast error and overall inaccuracy are smallest when institutional investors are present. This also applies to future performance because when analysts have reasonably small forecast errors they will tend to have smaller forecast errors in their future predictions as well. It has been proven that higher analyst ranking and reputation leads to more trading volume, and when analysts are accurate in predictions they end up with better reputations at the end of the set period being measured by the ranking system. In addition to the above, Analyst Performance is housed in Financial/Nelson Information Directory of Fund Managers. This is a bit different, as it contains information on fund structure, investment style, and performance, as well as the decision making process behind the investment choices. Conflict of interest After the bursting of the dot-com bubble, many US sell side firms were accused of self-dealing in a lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The charges were formally brought against several Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts. In addition to the business done with buy side firms as described above, sell side firms also performed investment banking services for corporations, such as stock and debt offerings, loans, etc. These corporate clients generally did not like to see negative press put out about their own companies. To try to prevent the publishing of negative research, corporate clients would pressure the sell side firms by threatening to withhold lucrative banking business or equally lucrative shares in IPOs - essentially bribing the sell side firm. While the $1.4 billion settlement of this lawsuit made significant progress in cleaning up the industry in the US, it is notable that the lawsuit only went after sell side firms, leaving the arguably equally culpable corporations relatively unscathed. In the past few years the role of a research analyst has changed. After the dot-com bubble, more research has been completed to see the actual roles and duties of a research analyst to get a better idea behind their decision making process. Other provisions such as the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act (2002) and other regulations were enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to public outcry following the legal concerns. The Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act (2002) limits the relationship between investment banking and research analysts and prohibits promises of favorable research, as well as restricting and inciting pre- clearance requirements for traders' personal trading. Sell side analysts can also have conflicting duties. One issue that has been brought up has been the idea of sell side stock rankings and maintaining a positive rating for an extended period of time. This was addressed in the New York Attorney General's case against Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It also has been proven that the longer an analyst has been following and researching a stock, the more and more favorable the recommendations become. The idea behind this is that the sell side analyst may become too comfortable and lose objectivity, something known as the capture hypothesis. Other conflicts of interest include opposing incentives for sell side analysts. Sell side analysts generally have a personal need for a good reputation, and if an analyst cares about their reputation he or she will try to report truthful information. However, analysts also have the desire to receive incentives to make positive recommendations because brokerage firms in and of themselves have internal conflicts of interest between differing departments such as trading, underwriting and sales. One conflict of interest would be the need for an analyst to provide this research mentioned above, i.e. research that is unbiased and reliable, which could lead to higher trading business for the firms for which the analysts work. Hence the trade-off or conflict of interest for an analyst would be the need for generating their firm business and their own personal career goals. Under Chinese wall restrictions there is a threat of litigation, leading analysts to have less of an issue with bias in their research. A Chinese wall restriction is used to make sure important and private information is not inadvertently shared or \\"leaked\\" and that all clients within large multinational firms are protected. The actual idea stems back decades to the Great Depression, and has allowed the financial services industry to maintain one entity between investment banks and brokerages as opposed to requiring firms to have those two departments be separate entities. Another conflict of interest is the idea of performance rankings. The Institutional Investor All Star Poll, one of the most popular ranking systems, facilitates a conflict of interest in that a high ranking on their platform can influence analyst career paths and their compensation. However, it also forces analysts to produce the best research and ensure it is timely as well. Another conflict of interest would be the presence of institutional investors. Sell side analysts taking the larger institutional investors into account leads to the issue of giving the larger investors more influence over stock recommendations. Potential conflicts of interest in terms of biased research by sell side analysts are an issue on the sell side. There are recommendations that brokers use to help curb conflicts of interest. Suggestions include putting client commitments first, disclosing information as to how the broker is paid to clients, and providing the proper help so clients understand the level of risk they are undertaking with their investments.

Plot This drama features a romance between two different teenagers: a young atheist girl, Judith Craig, and the male head of a Christian youth organization, Bob Hathaway. The two leaders and their groups attack each other, starting a riot that kills a young girl. Followed by a goofy boy, Bozo, the three are thrown into a juvenile prison with a cruel head guard and bad living conditions. The film maker makes a point of talking about the truth of prison cruelty in the middle of the movie. Bob, who is in love with Judy, eventually rescues her and takes shelter in an old farm where Judy, breath-taken by the romance and beauty of the forest, realizes there must be a God. They are found and taken back to prison and held in solitary confinement until a fire breaks out. Mame is Judy's new friend who is trying to get her out before she burns. But the rest of the prison girls escape. Bob, who is trusting in God to help them, finally rescues Judy with the help of Mame and Bozo; they also rescue the cruel head guard who pleads for his life and, as he is dying, sets them free for their kind act and rescue. At the very end, Bozo and Mame seem to end up together while Bob and Judy and their rekindled faith ride off together as the movie ends. Cast *Lina Basquette...

Inmate Production background The UCLA Film and Television Archive later restored the film's sound version, in which dialogue scenes were added to the final reel, a film that was one of DeMille's first part-sound efforts. Actor Fritz Feld filmed the sound sequences without DeMille's supervision since DeMille had already broken his contract with Path√©, and signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.The Crank Film Series, UCLA, film notes The title character is based on Queen Silver, a child prodigy and socialist orator who was accused of leaving atheist pamphlets in student lockers at Hollywood High School in 1927.Queen Silver: The Godless Girl by Wendy McElroy, Prometheus Books The lead actress, Lina Basquette, named her autobiography, Lina: DeMille's Godless Girl, after the film. Reception The film was very popular in the U.S.S.R. and in Germany. The film's popularity in the Soviet Union is believed in part to be due to the fact that the USSR's film censors edited out the main character's conversion to Christianity near the end of the movie.Ben Mankiewicz in Turner Classic Movies discussion of the film It was a box office disaster in the US. When released in August 1928 in its silent film version, it was not a success. DeMille attributed the film's failure to its already outmoded position in the transition from silent to sound cinema. Nor did it recover more than two-thirds of its production costs when released in a so-called \\"goat gland\\" version with the addition of a final talkie reel in 1929. Preservation status In 2007, a version was released by Photoplay Productions and George Eastman House, in association with the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation and Film4, restored from deMille's own nitrate print, with a new music score by Carl Davis. Inspiration for the film The film was inspired by a real-life incident at Hollywood High School when a student Queen Silver started an atheist society.The Godless Girl: Introduction to the 1928 classic by Cecil B.

The island is situated north of the Australian mainland and south of the island of New Guinea. The island is a locality within the Torres Strait Island Region local government area. The town of Saibai is located on the north-west coast of the island. In the , Saibai Island had a population of 465 people. Most of the island is held under native title, apart from some government infrastructure and historic buildings. Geography The island was formed by alluvial deposits from Papua New Guinean rivers. Saibai Island is a fairly large low-lying island located south of the Papua New Guinea mainland. Close to the north of Saibai is the uninhabited Kauamag Island, separated from Saibai by a channel that is long, between wide, and nearly blocked at its east end. The island is about in length by in width, and is flat, predominantly mangrove swamplands, with the highest point being above mean sea level, and prone to flooding during the wet season, which coincides with king tides. A bitumen airstrip allows year-round access. Saibai is part of the north-western island group of Torres Strait, which consists of Saibai, Dauan and Boigu islands. Saibai lies approximately 5 km off the coast of New Guinea and is approximately 20 km long and 6 km wide. The island is an average of 1 m above sea level and consists largely of mangrove fringe, flood plain and brackish swamps. The island is vulnerable to flooding and rising sea levels, particularly during the wet season when around 2 m of water regularly falls onto the island. During the dry season however, the island experiences drought-like conditions. The main village of Saibai, in the northwest, has a population of 171. The second village, Churum [Surum White Sand], in the southwest, numbers 128. Islanders Only a small proportion of the island is inhabited. In the 2016 Census, there were 465 people in Saibai Island. 84.0% of people were born in Australia. Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal people made up 85.6% of the population, with 70% of the population claiming Torres Strait Islander ancestry. The most common response for religion was Anglican at 44.9%. The language spoken on Saibai is Kalaw Kawaw Ya (KKY). Saibai Islanders have always traded and had good relations with neighbouring Papuans. The Saibai Islanders converted to Christianity in 1871 with the arrival of the London Missionary Society. Saibai, Boigu and Dauan society is Buwai \\"clan/moiety\\" based, there being two major Buwai (moieties), the Koei Buwai \\"Great Moiety\\" and the Moegina Buwai \\"Lesser Moiety\\"; each moiety is divided into totemic subclans, such as the Samu Augadh \\"Cassowary Totem\\" (Koei Buwai), Koedal Augadh \\"Crocodile Totem\\" (Moegina Buwai) and others. All social, food gathering, family business and traditional religion circles around clan relationships. The Saibaians have been legally acknowledged as being the Traditional Owners of Saibai.In the case of Saibai People v Queensland (1999) FCA 158, the courts found that ‚Äò(n)ative title exists in relation to the determination area, that is, the land and inland waters of Saibai, Mawalmay Thoera Island, Thawpay Kawamag Island and Kuykuthal Kawamag Island on the landward side of the high water mark.' See also Victor Nona, John Whop, Pili Waigana, Nelson Gibuma and Phillip Bigie on behalf of the Saibai, Dauan, Mabuiag, Badu and Boigu Peoples v The State of Queensland and Ors (2000) FCA 1118. They are of Melanesian origin and lived in village communities following traditional patterns of hunting, fishing, agriculture and trade for many thousands of years before contact was made with the first European, Asian and Pacific Island visitors to the region. Strong kinship and trade ties exist between the people of Saibai, Mt Cornwallis and Boigu Islands, with less strong but still important ties with the neighbouring Papuan communities.R E Johannes & J W MacFarlane, Traditional Fishing in the Torres Strait Islands(CSIRO; 1991) 157-162, 168-170J Singe, The Torres Strait, People and History (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia; 1979) 174-179. History =European contact= In 1606, Lu√≠s Vaz de Torres sailed through Torres Strait islands, navigating them, along New Guinea's southern coast. In the 1860s, beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) and pearling boats began working the reefs of Torres Strait. The first European to visit Saibai was probably a beche-de-mer operator named John Delargy, who visited the island with his South Sea Islander crew in 1869 while searching for a lost whaleboat. Delargy established friendly relations with the people of Saibai, trading goods and sharing a feast with the Islanders. Pearling bases were never established on Saibai but in the 1870s European pearl and beche-de-mer operators began recruiting men from Saibai to work on their luggers.S Mullins, Torres Strait, A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994) 65 Torres Strait Islanders refer to the arrival of London Missionary Society (LMS) missionaries at Erub in July 1871 as \\"the Coming of the Light\\". After visiting Darnley Island and Tudu, the LMS missionaries led by Rev. Samuel McFarlane and Reverend A.W. Murray travelled to Mt Cornwallis Island (now Dauan Island) and Saibai islands. Two South Sea Islander lay pastors named Josaia and Sivene were appointed to work as missionary teachers at Mt Cornwallis and Saibai. LMS missionaries revisited Mt Cornwallis and Saibai in 1872 and found that Josaia and Sivene had been accepted by the Islanders and given land by the local chiefs.S Mullins, Torres Strait, A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994) 121J Singe, The Torres Strait, People and History (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia; 1979), 179-182. However, increased contact with the outside world brought new diseases to the islands and, during the 1870s, a measles epidemic significantly reduced the population of Saibai. In 1872, the Queensland Government sought to extend its jurisdiction and requested the support of the British Government.S B Kaye, Jurisdictional Patchwork: Law of the Sea and Native Title Issues in the Torres Strait (2001) 2, Melbourne Journal of International Law. Letters Patent were issued by the British government in 1872 creating a new boundary for the colony which encompassed all islands within a 60 nautical mile radius of the coast of Queensland.Queensland, Queensland Statutes (1963) vol.2, 712. This boundary was further extended to 96 km by the Queensland Coast Islands Act 1879 (Qld)See also Colonial Boundaries Act 1895 (Imp)Wacando v Commonwealth(1981) 148 CLR 1. and included the islands of Boigu, Darnley, Murray and Saibai, which lay beyond the previous 60 nautical mile limit. The new legislation enabled the Queensland Government to control and regulate bases for the beche- de-mer and pearling industries, which previously had operated outside its jurisdiction.S Mullins, Torres Strait, A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994), 139-161. From the late 1870s onwards, the coastal communities of Papua and the islands of Saibai, Boigu and Mt Cornwallis were raided by warriors of the Marind-Anim or Tugeri people from Dutch-controlled West Papua. A retaliatory expedition led by British officials based in Daru in 1896 diminished the threat of the Marind-Anim but sporadic raids on Saibai, Boigu and Mt Cornwallis islands and Papua continued well into the 1920s.S Mullins, Torres Strait, A History of Colonial Occupation and Culture Contact 1864-1897 (Central Queensland University Press, Rockhampton; 1994) , 146-148J Singe, The Torres Strait, People and History (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia; 1979), 74-76, 83. The English scientist and anthropologist Alfred Cort Haddon first visited the Torres Straits in 1888. Haddon originally came to the Torres Straits to study the coral reefs but soon became fascinated by the traditional culture and way of life of the Torres Strait Islander people. Haddon returned to the Torres Straits in 1898 with the Cambridge University anthropological expedition. The Cambridge expedition spent 7 months in the Torres Straits including a stay at Saibai, documenting the Torres Strait Islander people and their culture. The expedition collected artefacts, took down genealogies, re- created ceremonies and used wax cylinders and early movie cameras to make the first sound recordings and films in the Torres Strait.D Moore, The Torres Strait Collections of A. C. Haddon (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1984) 10-12. Over time, the Queensland Government began to exert more influence on the lives of Torres Strait Islander people. John Douglas, the government Resident at Thursday Island, initially shielded Torres Strait Islanders from the controlling provisions of the Aboriginal Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897. After Douglas died in 1904, the administration that followed began to assert control over Torres Strait Islander labour and savings accounts and imposed restrictions on Islander movement to and from the mainland.J Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987) 45-47. In November 1912, an area of 35,000 acres of land on Saibai was officially gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve by the Queensland Government. Many other Torres Strait Islands were gazetted as Aboriginal reserves at the same time.Queensland, Queensland Government Gazette, vol.99, no.138 (1912) 1330. Shortages of food on Saibai were mentioned in a government report dating from 1912.Queensland, Annual Report of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals for 1912 (193) 26. Between 1914 and 1918, a religious movement known as \\"German Wislin\\" emerged on Saibai. The Wislin believers predicted that the Germans would win World War One and reward the people of Saibai with a cargo of gifts which would be brought to the island by steamer. After Britain and her allies defeated Germany in 1918, the Wislin movement died away.N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993) 117-118J Singe, The Torres Strait, People and History (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia; 1979), 183-184. During the 1920s and 1930s racial legislation was strictly applied to Torres Strait Islanders enabling the government to remove Islanders to reserves and mission across Queensland. A small number of documented removals from Saibai occurred between 1909 and 1941; 2 people were removed to Palm Island and 1 person was taken to Yarrabah.Queensland, Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Community and Personal Histories Removals Database. In 1936, around 70% of the Torres Strait Islander workforce went on strike in the first organised challenge against government authority made by Torres Strait Islanders. The nine-month strike was an expression of Islanders' anger and resentment at increasing government control of their livelihoods. The strike was a protest against government interference in wages, trade and commerce and also called for the lifting of evening curfews, the removal of the permit system for inter-island travel and the recognition of Islanders' right to recruit their own boat crews.N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993), 181-186, 278J Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987), 54. Three men were jailed on Saibai in 1936 by the authorities after strike protests occurred on the island.N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993), 191-192. The strike produced a number of significant reforms and innovations. Unpopular local Protector J D McLean was removed and replaced by Cornelius O‚ÄôLeary who established a system of regular consultations with elected Islander council representatives. The new Island councils were given a degree of autonomy, including control over local police and courts.J Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987), 54-55. On 23 August 1937, O‚ÄôLeary convened the first Inter Islander Councillors Conference at Masig. Representatives from 14 Torres Strait communities attended the conference. Namabai Atu, Mareko, Soki and Enosa represented Saibai at the conference. After lengthy discussions, unpopular bylaws (including the evening curfews) were cancelled and a new code of local representation was agreed upon.N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993), 210-214Queensland State Archives, A/3941 Minutes of Torres Strait Councillors Conference held at Yorke Island 23‚Äì25 August 1937. In 1939, the Queensland Government passed the Torres Strait Islander Act 1939, which incorporated many of the recommendations discussed at the conference. A key section of the new act officially recognised Torres Strait Islanders as a separate people from Aboriginal Australians.Sections 3 (a) ‚Äì (c) of the Torres Strait Islander Act (Qld) 1939. See also: Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Native Affairs for 1939(1940) 1N Sharp, Stars of Tagai, The Torres Strait Islanders (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra; 1993), 214-216. During World War Two, the Australian Government recruited Torres Strait Islander men to serve in the armed forces. Enlisted men from Saibai and other island communities formed the Torres Strait Light Infantry. While the Torres Strait Light Infantry were respected as soldiers, they only received one third of the pay given to white Australian servicemen. On 31 December 1943, members of the Torres Strait Light Infantry went on strike calling for equal pay and equal rights. The Australian Government agreed to increase their pay to two-thirds the level received by white servicemen. Full back pay was offered in compensation to the Torres Strait servicemen by the Australian Government in the 1980s.J Beckett, Torres Strait Islanders: Custom and Colonialism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987), 64-65Boigu Community Council, Boigu, Our Culture and History, 89-100. At the end of World War Two, the Queensland Government introduced measures to compensate Torres Strait Islanders for their contribution to the war effort and to populate the north as a defence against foreign invasion.D Ober, J Sproats & R Mitchell, Saibai to Bamaga, The Migration from Saibai to Bamaga on the Cape York Peninsula (Bamaga Island Council Joe Sproats and Associates, Townsville; 2000) 14Queensland State Archives, Director of Native Affairs correspondence, SRS 505/1, 9M/10, Development of Northern Peninsula Area. After the war, enlisted Torres Strait Islander men from Saibai, Boigu and Mt Cornwallis islands also discussed the possibility of developing a community on the mainland. Saibai elder, Bamaga Ginau, supported the proposal. In 1947, king tides caused serious damage to properties and gardens across Saibai. The village of Saibai was totally flooded by of water. Erosion and a lack of freshwater were concerns. Bamaga Ginau called a meeting regarding the future of Saibai and after much discussion a number of families made the decision to leave Saibai and move to the Cape York Peninsula.D Ober, J Sproats & R Mitchell, Saibai to Bamaga, The Migration from Saibai to Bamaga on the Cape York Peninsula (Bamaga Island Council Joe Sproats and Associates, Townsville; 2000), 6-8Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Native Affairs for 1948 (1949) 22. The first families left Saibai on the pearl luggers Millard and Macoy and arrived at Muttee Heads in June 1947, where they established a temporary settlement in abandoned army facilities.D Ober, J Sproats & R Mitchell, Saibai to Bamaga, The Migration from Saibai to Bamaga on the Cape York Peninsula (Bamaga Island Council Joe Sproats and Associates, Townsville; 2000), 16-17. In July 1948, the Queensland Government gazetted 44,500 acres extending from Red Island Point to Kennedy Inlet and the Cowal Creek mission, as a reserve for the use of the Torres Strait Islanders.Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Native Affairs for 1949(1950) 25Queensland, Queensland Government Gazette, 24 July 1948, 675. Saibai women help unload produce for the general store on Saibai Island, 1952. The Saibai Island I.I.B. Store is being re-stocked with produce. Several women and men are unloading sacks and barrels and taking them to the store. In 1948, Mugai Elu and Tumena Sagaukaz left Saibai with their families and moved to Red Island Point. The Islanders at Muttee Heads relocated to a new settlement inland from Red Island Point in 1952. The new settlement was named Bamaga in honour of the leader of the migration, Bamaga Ginau. The smaller community at Red Island Point changed its name to Seisia in 1977. After gaining its independence from Australia in 1975, Papua New Guinea asserted its right to the islands and waters of the Torres Straits. In December 1978, a treaty was signed by the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments that described the boundaries between the 2 countries and the use of the sea area by both parties.Sharp, 226-227 The Torres Strait Treaty, which operated from February 1985, contains special provision for free movement (without passports or visas) between both countries.Under Art. 11. There is constant traffic throughout the year between Saibai and Papua New Guinea. Free movement between communities applies to traditional activities, such as fishing, trading and family gatherings, which occur in a specifically created Protected Zone and nearby areas.See also Art 12. The Protected Zone also assists in the preservation and protection of the land, sea, air and native plant and animal life of the Torres Strait. =Local government= Flag of Saibai Island On 30 March 1985, the Saibai community elected three councillors to constitute an autonomous Saibai Council established under the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. This Act conferred local government type powers and responsibilities upon Torres Strait Islander councils for the first time. The council area, previously an Aboriginal reserve held by the Queensland Government, was transferred on 21 October 1985 to the trusteeship of the council under a Deed of Grant in Trust.Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1986(1987) 3Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1987 (1988) 29. In March 2000, the elections for the Saibai Council were conducted on a clan basis. Seven councillors were elected to represent each of the 7 traditional clans. Each clan elected its own councillor. This system of representation has been maintained for the Saibai community forum. In 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission recommended that the 15 Torres Strait Island councils be abolished and the Torres Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) be established in their place.

History The 9th National Jazz & Blues Festival held at Plumpton in 1969 Initially called The National Jazz Festival, it was a showcase for British and US jazz and was held at Richmond Athletic Ground in the sedate London suburb of Richmond. The first festival took place on 26-27 August 1961, and the headline acts included Johnny Dankworth and Chris Barber. Inspiration for the event came from the Newport Jazz Festival, held in the US since 1954. Martin Chilton, \\"Reading Festival, a history: from jazz to rock\\", Daily Telegraph, 27 August 2015. Retrieved 10 February 2020 In 1964 the festival changed its name to \\"The National Jazz and Blues Festival\\", which reflected the change in musical tastes occurring in Britain in the early 1960s. Gradually the jazz component of the festival was whittled away and by 1967, the festival was featuring the likes of Cream, Fleetwood Mac and Jeff Beck, whilst the jazz groups were relegated to an afternoon session. One of the features of the festival during the 1960s was its constant search for a permanent home: festival noise and crowds alienated locals and the festival moved from Richmond to Windsor in Berkshire (1966‚Äì67), to Sunbury in Surrey (1968) and then to Plumpton (1969‚Äì70). By this time the jazz content was almost non-existent and the festival was featuring a mix of progressive rock, folk and blues and drawing crowds of around 30,000. Move to Reading In 1971, the festival finally found a permanent home when Pendleton moved base to Reading. This move also signified the beginning of the end of the more eclectic mix of music that had been the hallmark of the festival. By 1971 the festival had become \\"The National Jazz, Blues and Rock Festival\\" and had begun to mutate into a hard rock festival. Although George Melly and John McLaughlin did participate in these years, it was bands such as Hawkwind, Thin Lizzy and Rory Gallagher who drew the crowds. By 1975, the festival attendance had swollen to 70,000 and there were nasty scenes where can fights became the norm and some reggae artists were received with hostility. In 1976 the festival changed its name to \\"Reading Rock\\" and the transformation was complete. Hard rock and heavy metal were the staple of the festival until well into the 1980s.

History Founded in 1883, Lochcarron Camanachd is one of the oldest in the west Highlands. In its first century the Club won the Strathdearn Cup eight times and the Sutherland Cup six times as well as winning its league division on many occasions. The early nineties were a particular success for Lochcarron, as having temporarily reduced to one team, they went from North Division Four to the Premier Division in quick succession. The first team reached the club's only senior final, the Macaulay Cup final in 2001, where they were beaten 3‚Äì0 by Inveraray. They then won the National First Division Championship in 2002 and the Balliemore Cup also in 2002. Amongst the key players in this era were Kenny Ross and Fraser MacKenzie. The club was voted Marine Harvest Club of the Year 2002. The club was chosen as the Highland Sports Development Association Club of the Year 2003, a first for the sport of shinty. The club also secured a third spot finish in the Premier Division. However, the club then went into decline, narrowly avoiding relegation in 2006. After finishing bottom of the Premier Division, they had to defeat Kyles Athletic in a playoff. The club was relegated in 2007 after a prolonged season, with their final match being played against Inveraray in Kiltarlity on 8 December 2007 ‚Äì a 2‚Äì2 draw was not enough to overhaul Oban Camanachd. The club only finished 4th in North Division One in 2008 and was threatened with relegation again at the end of the 2009 season to North Division Two. This would have had far reaching repercussions for the club which would have seen their second team (which had failed to fulfil several fixtures) be disbanded. However, the club received a reprieve from relegation as Glenurquhart rejected the chance to have their reserve team promoted from North Division Two despite new bye-laws permitting reserve sides to do this. The club retained its place in North One for 2010 and also retained its second team. The club was rocked early in 2010 by the resignation of Alasdair \\"Gaiter\\" MacKenzie as manager, he was swiftly replaced by Murdo John Fraser. After a few tough seasons, the decision was made to start again at the bottom of the Shinty League System in 2013. This voluntary relegation did not start smoothly with two heavy defeats and then a draw to lowly Lewis. However, Lochcarron soon adapted to their new surroundings and clinched promotion as well as appearing in the Sutherland Cup final which they lost to fellow voluntary relegated team Ballachulish. However, co-manager Kenny Murray left for Lewis Camanachd as Ross Brown came in as manager. League reconstruction saw the Camandoes promoted twice, ahead of their desired development, and they inevitably finished the 2015 season at the bottom of North Division One. Reconstruction was slow and arduous, but 2016 saw the club begin to recover and win the Strathdearn Cup against Glenurquhart. Today the Club has a reputation for its youth development and represents shinty in Sportscotland‚Äôs national youth sports programme. The club actively supports shinty at both its local senior school Plockton High and Lochcarron Primary School and through the recently formed Ross & Sutherland Shinty Development Association. The club plays at the Battery Park in Lochcarron (opposite the Bank of Scotland) on its newly extended pitch, complete with modern changing rooms.

She is the daughter of Maddy Prior and Rick Kemp of the folk-rock band Steeleye Span.  Singing career  Kemp began her singing career performing live with Steeleye Span while still in her teenage years. This led to her being invited to contribute vocals to several albums by various folk artists. In 1996 she sang with The Carnival Band on their Carols at Christmas CD. In 2002 Park Records released the a cappella folk album Bib and Tuck by 'Maddy Prior And The Girls', a trio composed of Maddy Prior, Rose Kemp and Abbie Lathe. Kemp wrote, and sang lead vocals on, several of the album's tracks. Her first single, \\"The Milkman Makes Eggs\\" was an airplay favorite. Kemp's first solo album Glance, an acoustic pop record, was released on Park Records in 2003. She subsequently toured with The Oyster Band as part of The Big Session, appearing with them across the UK and Europe. 2004 saw a considerable change in the direction of Rose's musical output. She recorded a mini-album, originally entitled 'The Free To Be Me E.P' but later renamed simply 'Mini-Album', at Warehouse Studios in Oxford with members of The Fourers. The new recording was very much a rock record, with Kemp playing electric guitar and taking charge of the arrangements and production for the first time in her career. Kemp signed an album deal with One Little Indian Records in July 2005, and recorded her second full-length album, 'A Hand Full of Hurricanes', at studios in Bristol and Cardiff with producer Charlie Francis. This album was released in February 2007. After a large amount of time spent touring the UK and Europe in support of the record, she began recording in summer 2007 at State of Art studios, Bristol. Her third studio album, Unholy Majesty was produced by Chris Sheldon and was released on 1 September 2007. The following two years saw Rose making appearances at the acclaimed Roadburn Festival (Tilburg, Netherlands) and Supersonic Festival (Birmingham, UK), as well as a headline tour and appearances supporting Porcupine Tree and Goony makes baby apples. She released a fourth album, Golden Shroud, in 2010 supported it on a tour with Mono (Japanese band) and Grails (band). In December 2010, a Rose Kemp cover version of the Cardiacs song \\"Wind and Rains is Cold\\" - recorded in collaboration with electronic musician Rarg - appeared on Leader Of The Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1, a fundraising compilation album to benefit the hospitalised Cardiacs leader Tim Smith. Kemp has also been known to cover another Cardiacs song, \\"Fairy Mary Mag\\", in concert as an a capella version.  Other projects  =Jeremy Smoking Jacket= Kemp also performs with SJ Esau as part of the experimental, often improvisational pop trio Jeremy Smoking Jacket. The group recorded an EP entitled 'Now We Are Dead (and Other Stories)' which was released jointly by Enormous Corpse and Fact Fans in August 2005; Max Milton left the group in October 2006, but Kemp and Sam continued as a duo, recording a live session for Huw Stephens' show on BBC Radio 1 in November 2006. They have performed at the Glastonbury Festival and at Tate Britain. The pair are currently working on their first full-length album. =VILNA= In February 2006 Kemp joined an instrumental Post-rock band called Snakes on a Plane as their lead guitarist. Originally a five piece, second guitarist Matt Williams aka Team Brick left and the band changed their name to VILNA, after a piece of music by the French band Weidorje. The four piece, whose other members are Joe Garcia, James King and Alex Bertram-Powell gradually moved into more progressive/doom metal territory. Although VILNA ceased to be in 2007, Joe Garcia and James King would subsequently play in Rose's band and played on the 2008 album 'Unholy Majesty'. In 2009, King, Garcia and Bertram-Powell reunited to form the progressive psych band ANTA. =Stones Barn= Kemp, with Maddy Prior and Abbie Lathe, co-facilitates singing workshops at Stones Barn in Cumbria (http://www.maddyprior.co.uk/sbindex.htm).

Directed by Mary Lambert and written by King, it stars Dale Midkiff, Denise Crosby, Blaze Berdahl, Fred Gwynne, and Miko Hughes as Gage Creed. The title is a sensational spelling of \\"pet cemetery\\". The film was released on April 21, 1989, and grossed $57.5 million at the box office on a budget of $11.5 million. A sequel, Pet Sematary Two, was released in 1992 and a second film adaptation was released in 2019. Plot The Creed family‚ÄîLouis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage‚Äîmove from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis accepts a job as a physician with the University of Maine. They befriend their neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who is mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before dying, calling Louis by name though they have never met. That night, Pascow appears to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient MiÍûåkmaq burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house. He now stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious toward Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he revived his pet dog, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her pet. Sometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the MiÍûåkmaq ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death. He tells him the story of a local named Bill Baterman who buried his son Timmy in the MiÍûåkmaq ground after he was killed in World War II. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying the townsfolk. A group of men including Jud tried destroying Timmy by lighting the Baterman house on fire, only for Bill to perish with his son. Jud insists that the burial ground is evil and Louis must not bury his son there. After the funeral, Rachel and Ellie leave for Chicago while Louis remains home. Despite Pascow and Jud's warnings, Louis exhumes his son's body and buries him at the ritual site. In Chicago, Pascow appears to Ellie in a dream and warns her that Louis is about to do something terrible. Rachel is unnerved by her daughter's dream but can only reach Jud when she calls, who tells her Louis is not home. She decides to return to Maine, much to Jud's alarm. That night, Gage returns home and steals a scalpel from his father's bag. He taunts Jud before slashing his Achilles tendon and his mouth, before biting his throat, killing him. Rachel returns home and is lured into Jud's house by the voice and specter of her dead sister Zelda, only to discover that she is actually seeing Gage, holding a scalpel. In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her. Waking up from his sleep, Louis notices Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers his scalpel is missing. Receiving a phone call from Gage that he has \\"played\\" with Jud and Mommy, he fills three syringes with morphine and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection before entering the house. Gage taunts him further and Louis is startled by Rachel's corpse hanged from the attic before Gage attacks him. After a brief battle, Louis overpowers Gage and injects him with the morphine syringe. He then lights Jud's house on fire, leaving it to burn as he carries Rachel's body from the fire. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to \\"make it worse\\", but grief- stricken Louis believes that because Rachel was not dead as long as Gage was, burying her \\"will work this time\\".

Romero in 1984 for $10,000. King had previously declined several other offers for a film adaptation. Romero eventually had to pull out of the production, as he was busy with Monkey Shines. Development executive Lindsay Doran loved the finished script and advocated for it to be made at Embassy Pictures and then at Paramount Pictures, after she became vice president of production there in 1985. She was told each time that there was no more demand for Stephen King films after the slew of adaptations from his novels released in the early 80's. It was only during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike that Paramount reconsidered because the studio was facing a possible shortage of new productions for 1989 release. Stephen King's script for Pet Sematary was finished and ready to go, so Doran was given the greenlight to obtain the rights for Paramount and start production. King, who had final say on the choice of a director, met with the studio's first choice of Mary Lambert. She impressed him with her enthusiasm for his novels and her commitment to stay faithful to his source material, which secured her the job. The original cut of the film delivered to Paramount's executives was judged to be too long, so excess footage had to be removed. The original ending scene was more ambiguous: it showed only the undead Rachel entering the kitchen where Louis is playing solitaire, leaving his fate uncertain. Although Lambert called this the \\"more spooky, sad... tragic\\" ending, because the audience knows \\"it's not going to be what he wants. She's not coming back as his wife\\", the studio decided it was too tame and at their request it was re-shot to be more graphic. Rachel's appearance was made far more gruesome with special prosthetic effects, and she kills Louis at the end as alluded to in his screams when the film cuts to black. =Casting= Initially, Paramount executives wanted a pair of twins to play the role of Gage, like those chosen to play Ellie, which was the more cost- effective option. However, Lambert was very impressed with three-year-old Miko Hughes, whom she felt was a natural talent despite his young age, so she lobbied the studio to accept her choice. She also faced resistance from executives over her choice to cast Fred Gwynne, whom the studio believed audiences wouldn't take seriously because of his fame as Herman Munster. After first auditioning girls for the role of Zelda, Lambert changed course and ended up casting Andrew Hubatsek in the role, because she felt having a grown man playing the role of a teenage girl deformed by spinal meningitis made the character more frightening. =Filming= As stipulated by King when selling the rights, Pet Sematary was shot in Maine where the story was set and King himself wrote the screenplay. Production was based out of Ellsworth and auditions held at The Grand theater, where several hundred locals auditioned to be extras or for small spoken roles. King himself was very involved in the filming process, consulting with Lambert frequently on her ideas for the story and any deviations from the script she wished to make. The house used for the Creeds' home is a private residence near Hancock, while Jud's house across the street was actually a facade constructed around an existing house that was insulated with fireproof material so that the mock-up could be burned around it. The interiors of the Creed house were recreated on a soundstage in Ellsworth, while the interiors of Jud's house were built inside the Bangor Arsenal. The approach to the MiÍûåkmaq burial ground was filmed at an abandoned granite quarry on Mount Desert Island in Acadia National Park, while a hilltop near Sedgwick was the site of the MiÍûåkmaq ground itself. Other locations included a forest near Ellsworth for the pet cemetery, Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor for the graveyard scenes, and Ellsworth Town Hall, which stood in for the hospital of the University of Maine, Orono. Music The film's score was written by Elliot Goldenthal.[ Allmusic ((( Pet Sematary > Overview )))] The film features two songs by the Ramones, one of Stephen King's favorite bands: \\"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\\" appears in a scene, and \\"Pet Sematary\\", a new track written specially for the picture, plays over the credits.MattFini's Halloween Top 10 Lists: Most Memorable End Credit Songs The song \\"Pet Sematary\\" became one of the Ramones' biggest charting hits, reaching number four on Billboards \\"Modern Rock Tracks\\" list, despite being, in the words of AMG, \\"reviled by most of the band's hardcore fans\\". Lambert was better known for her work directing music videos, especially those for Madonna including \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Material Girl\\". Through her work in the music industry she was friends with the Ramones. She approached them about recording a song for the film and they agreed to write and perform \\"Pet Sematary\\", which is featured in the closing credits. Release The Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"defied the critics and opened at blockbuster levels\\". The film grossed $57 million in the United States. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 51% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.42/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Pet Sematary is a bruising horror flick that wears its quirks on its sleeves, to the detriment of its scare factor.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B. Variety called it \\"undead schlock dulled by a slasher-film mentality\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has some effectively ghoulish moments\\" but \\"fails mostly because it doesn't trust the audience to do any of the work\\". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \\"sickening.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 28, 1989). \\"Siskel's Flicks Picks\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 7, p. O. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Lambert goes for strong, succinct images and never stops to worry whether there's a lack of credibility or motivation.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post called it \\"bland, clich√©d, cheap\\". Harrington criticized Gage's actions as disturbing and the climax as \\"an ugly payoff to an inept setup\\". Philip Strick of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"The family feuds and loyalties which lend some coherence to the novel and justify its punchline ... are simply plundered for their shock effect en route to the final bloodletting. Emaciated, then, rather than enhanced by its adaptation, Pet Semetary as a movie is nevertheless strikingly well-told.\\" Bloody Disgusting rated it 4.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The plot alone would make for a scary movie, but by injecting excellent atmosphere, capable acting and generally nightmarish scenes, Pet Sematary is a truly effective horror flick and well worth the price of admission.\\" At Dread Central, Steve Barton rated it 4/5 stars and called it one of the best King adaptations; Jason Jenkins rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"one of the better King adaptations of the period\\". Home media It was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on April 14, 2003. \\"Collector's Edition\\". Pet Sematary was a best-selling VHS upon release. Paramount released it on DVD in 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2012. Pet Sematary was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on March 26, 2019. Legacy =Sequel= A sequel, Pet Sematary Two, was released in 1992 to poor reviews and a disappointing box office. Although it references the events of the first film, the sequel focused on all-new characters. Pet Sematary has acquired a cult following in recent years, and members of the cast occasionally appear at horror conventions to discuss it. =Documentary= A documentary, Unearthed & Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary, premiered in September 2014, and was released in January 2017. Pet Sematary was ranked #16 on IFC's list of the best Stephen King film and television adaptations, and also placed at 16 on Rolling Stones Top 30 King adaptations. =2019 film= There was intermittent buzz about a possible adaptation of Pet Sematary. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was announced to direct an adaptation in October 2013, but nothing came of it. In August 2017, the brother-sister team behind the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's It, Andr√©s and Barbara Muschietti, told the Toronto Sun that they hoped to adapt Pet Sematary after the sequel of It. Again, there was no further action. Finally, in December 2017 Paramount Pictures announced that it was remaking the film, with Jeff Buhler penning the script and Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer set to direct. The new adaptation stars Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz as Louis and Rachel Creed, with John Lithgow appearing as Jud Crandall. The movie began filming in Montreal, Canada, in June 2018 and was released on April 5, 2019.

The lake is the terminus for west branch of the aqueduct. The aqueduct delivers water to the lake by a pipeline from Pyramid Lake. Besides storing drinking water, Castaic Lake is the lower reservoir in a pumped-storage hydroelectric system. During times of peak electricity demand, water is released from Pyramid Lake and run through the turbines at Castaic Power Plant. At night, when demand and electricity prices are lower, water is pumped from Castaic Lake to Pyramid Lake. The income from the electricity sold offsets a portion of the cost for pumping the water in some parts of the aqueduct, such as over the Tehachapi Mountains. Creek resumes Some water is released into Castaic Lagoon, immediately downstream of the dam. The lagoon provides Groundwater recharge of the aquifer and recreation. Downstream of the lagoon, water continues in Castaic Creek through the eastern Sierra Pelona Mountains to its confluence with the Santa Clara River, a few miles west of Santa Clarita.

He was elected in 1985 as a Workers' Party member of Dublin City Council for Crumlin/Kimmage area, and was re-elected at subsequent local elections until 2011, where he was forced to resign his seat due to dual mandate. He was finally elected at the 1989 general election. He joined with Workers' Party members who formed Democratic Left in 1992. He unexpectedly lost his seat at the 1992 general election. Labour's Pat Upton was unexpectedly returned on the first count, with Byrne finally losing the last seat to Fianna F√°il's Ben Briscoe by five votes after a marathon 10-day count. He was elected to the 27th D√°il at a by- election on 9 June 1994 following the resignation of long-serving Fianna F√°il TD John O'Connell (who had previously been a Labour TD for the same constituency). Byrne was a backbench supporter of the 'Rainbow' government led by Fine Gael's John Bruton. Byrne lost his seat again at the 1997 general election. Although the Labour Party and the Democratic Left merged in 1999, he was not selected to contest the Dublin South-Central by-election which followed Pat Upton's death later that year. Upton's sister Mary was elected for the Labour Party. Byrne contested the 2002 general election on the Labour Party ticket as Mary Upton's running-mate, but was unsuccessful. Along with Mary Upton, he contested the Dublin South-Central constituency at the 2007 general election advocating a Labour Party/Fine Gael government but missed the final seat by 69 votes. Byrne was nominated by the Labour Party to contest the Seanad election in the Labour panel but was not elected. In 2009, he was re- elected to Dublin City Council.

During ministers questions, O'Brien had criticized Tainiste Joan Burton over homelessness in Ireland, citing the experiences of his brother who was a recovering heroin addict. Byrne asked of O'Brien \\"Why doesn‚Äôt his good family give him a home?\\" which infuriated O'Brien. Irish Times journalist Miriam Lord, criticized Byrne, remarking that \\"You sense the relief rising in the chamber. They don‚Äôt like it when the real world intrudes.

The town is part of M√°laga Metropolitan Area and of the comarca of Valle del Guadalhorce. It sits at the entrance to the Guadalhorce valley on the slopes of the Sierra de Mijas mountains, some 17 km from M√°laga. The municipality covers an area of 82 km2 between the Sierra de Mijas and M√°laga basin, and is crossed by the river Guadalhorce. It is the most populous municipality in the region of Guadalhorce and third within the province, with 33,567 inhabitants, behind Antequera and Ronda. Alhaurin de la Torre experienced a marked increase of population in the 90s due to the expansion of the metropolitan area of M√°laga. The population density is 409.35 inhabitants/km2. The city was founded by the Phoenicians, mostly from Libya. Since 1991 it has been the headquarters of the M√°laga Provincial Prison, just outside the city, which currently is one of the most well known in Spain, housing some of the special cases of social impact, like the Malaya case amongst others. Geography The township sits between the Sierra de Mijas, mountain formation covered with pines and oaks and belongs to the Cordillera Penib√©tica, and the Hoya de M√°laga, alluvial depression formed by the Guadalhorce river, which irrigates the whole district and is occupied by numerous crop orchards. The highest peak of Alhaur√≠n de la Torre is Mount Jabalcuza in the Sierra de Mijas, but also include others such as Jarapalo or Abarcuza. =Location= It borders the towns of M√°laga to the east, C√°rtama to the north, Torremolinos to the southeast, Mijas to the southwest, Benalm√°dena to the south and Alhaur√≠n el Grande to the west. { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em; padding: 0.5em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;width =\\"60%\\" border = 2 align=\\"center\\" -----  width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\"  Northwest: C√°rtama  width =\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"  North: C√°rtama  width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\"  Northeast: M√°laga (District of Campanillas) -----  width =\\"10%\\" align=\\"center\\"  West: Alhaur√≠n el Grande  width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\"  Rosa de los vientos  width =\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"  East: M√°laga (District of Churriana) -----  width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\"  Southwest Mijas  width =\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"  South: Benalm√°dena  width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\"  Southeast: Torremolinos } =Hydrography= The hydrography of Alhaurin de la Torre is limited in terms of river inflows. These include the passage of the river Guadalhorce by the municipality along with numerous streams, the majority deviant, dry or with very little flow. The most notable is the water that is often left after some heavy rains in winter, spring or fall. Alhaur√≠n de la Torre is one of the municipalities belonging to the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin. Description The city centre has old Moorish-style streets and houses. Services are the main source of income. It was historically an agrarian village, where citrus and subtropical fruit plantations and olive groves still cover the landscape. History The origin of the place goes back to pre- historic times, and it is known that the Phoenicians that set up factories in M√°laga and C√°rtama in about 1,000 BC settled in Alhuar√≠n. It was here that Lauro was founded, and centuries later the Romans called it Lauro Vetus. The Moors, after the Islamic conquest of Iberia, called it Albarrac√≠n, and it grew from that into a larger collection of farm-houses. The re-conquest of the town in 1485 meant another variation on the name, and the place was finally called Alhaur√≠n de la Torre. The population increased sharply due to the influx of Christian settlers after 1571. There are many archaeological remains in the municipality, most of them being in the Estaci√≥n de la Alquer√≠a area, officially designated as being of Cultural Interest.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a small town and locality about from the northern tip of Cape York in the north of Queensland, Australia. It is within the Northern Peninsula Area Region. It is one of the northernmost settlements in continental Australia and is the administrative centre for the Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council. In the , Bamaga had a population of 1,164 people, of whom 957 (82.4%) identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. History The original site for the township of Bamaga was at a site known as \\"Muttee Heads\\" some south of the present Bamaga township. The present site was established after World War II by people from Saibai Island in Torres Strait, after Saibai Island was devastated by abnormally high tides. It is named after Saibai elder Bamaga Ginau, who envisaged the site but died before it was established. In 1947, the Bamaga township was moved to its present site as a result of a need by the founding people for a larger supply of fresh water. With local industries and the Northern Peninsula Airport (on Urradhi traditional land) Bamaga became the administrative centre for the Northern Peninsula Area, which was made up of the three Aboriginal communities of Injinoo, Umagico and New Mapoon, and the Islander communities of Seisia and Bamaga. All five are Deed of Grant in Trust ‚Äî communities with their own community councils. Bamaga Post Office opened by September 1951. Bamaga State School opened on 28 January 1964. On 23 March 2005 it was renamed Northern Peninsula Area State College. Some 20 years later, another community, \\"New Mapoon\\", was established. It was set up for the forced relocation of people of \\"Old Mapoon\\" community, located some two hours north by road from the township of Weipa for bauxite mining. Bamaga State High School opened on 30 January 1973 but closed on 9 December 1994. At the 2006 census, Bamaga had a population of 784. Geography All communities except Bamaga and New Mapoon are located on the coastline and the current residents hold a close affiliation with the sea. The current populations are approximately 75% Islander and 20% Aboriginal. Bamaga and the surrounding communities are located north of the Jardine River which supplies the town water. Bamaga has an Islander population of approximately 700 people with a further 300 temporary non-islander residents. The Community has reticulated town water, which is pumped from the Jardine River. A new water treatment plant has been constructed recently and Bamaga is fully sewered. Climate Bamaga has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen Aw) with constantly high temperatures throughout the year. The dry season runs from early June to late November. Language The community languages of Bamaga are Kalaw Kawaw Ya, Brokan (Torres Strait Creole), and English, particularly for education and government business. Industry All of Bamaga's internal and main roads are sealed. The major industry is tourism mainly during the drier months of the year. This runs from May ‚Äì October (The Developmental Road is impassable during the wet season and the ferry across the Jardine River does not operate). The community owns Resort Bamaga, an accommodation house for corporate visitors. There is some cattle production, small business retailing and a concrete batching plant. Bamaga Island Council is the biggest employer with 200 staff. Modern supermarkets can be found at Seisia and Umagico.

It is made up out of the Bamaga P‚Äì7 Campus and Bamaga 7‚Äì12 Campus within the Bamaga township and the P‚Äì7 Campus which is located in the Injinoo Community. The standard of schooling is reflective to any found amongst most Aboriginal/Islander communities however in recent years standards have improved. There are now 50+ teachers and teacher aides through all schools. The Bamaga and New Mapoon Communities have established Child Care Centres for early childhood schooling. The Cape York Campus, a technical and further education (TAFE) college, has been established at Bamaga. The campus provides a wide range of tutorial courses including seamanship and other courses. The campus is a branch of the Far North College of TAFE situated at Cairns. Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council operates an Indigenous Knowledge Centre at HACC Centre Building in Adidi Street, Bamaga. Utilities =Electricity supply= There is a local Ergon Energy generator powerhouse at Bamaga which continually supplies 240 volt power to all communities. There are two local Ergon linesman stationed at Bamaga. Most lines are antiquated and subject to breakdowns causing blackouts on occasions. Powercards are an innovative idea for electricity supply to all residences in the Bamaga area. These are similar to phonecards and are inserted into the powerboards at each residence. The cards are available in $20 or $50 amounts. There are therefore no issue of power bills as responsibility remains with each household to maintain power by the use of the cards. =Water supply= The quality of the town drinking water has improved of late with the introduction of new community reservoirs and the newly completed water treatment plant by Sunwater. The town water is sourced from the Jardine River supply. =Sewerage= Sewerage for all communities except Seisia is by underground sewer. Seisia is proposing to remove all septics in favour of sewer in the coming budgets. Garbage collection is twice weekly (Mon-Thur) and should this not suffice, the local waste depot is only away from the police establishment. Leisure Fishing and camping are very popular. A boat and 4WD vehicle would be handy. There is the Bamaga Tavern open Monday-Saturday and Seisia Fishing Club which serves food and drinks on Fridays with live music. There are restaurants at the Seisia Village Resort, Seisia; Resort Bamaga; Loyalty Beach Fishing Lodge, and also Punsand Bay Lodge, Punsand Bay.

The sporting facilities at Bamaga have undergone a recent facelift and there are now established Olympic Basketball courts, Volleyball courts & Tennis courts. Football has again emerged as a strong sport in the region and councils have constructed night lighting of the fields for cooler night games. There are five organised football teams in the communities. To assist sporting ventures in the region, a newly constructed Gymnasium at the Basketball courts will assist with health and training. There are also established darts, pool and fishing. Tourism The adventure of a 4WD trip to Bamaga through very rugged terrain is the main catalyst for tourist activity by road. There are many sights, towns and other points of interest during the journey. Tourist activities whilst at Bamaga include Sight-seeing tours to Thursday Island, Guided fishing and pig hunting tours; bird watching in the nearby Lockerbie Scrub rainforest; visiting World War II aircraft wrecks in the Bamaga area and also at Horn Island (near Thursday Island) and photo shoots at the \\"Tip of Australia\\". The area is shrouded in history with culture and war memorabilia. Muttee Heads is a fishing/camping spot with access to Jardine River mouth and is west on Cairns road. The abandoned ruins of the Pajinka Wilderness Lodge is north on Pajinka Road is the most Northerly part of Australia. Twin Falls/Fruit Bat Falls is south on the Peninsula Developmental Road to Cairns and a great swimming spot. Punsand Bay Resort is a great camping spot some north.

In the , Seisia had a population of 260 people. Geography Seisia is the area north of New Mapoon and west of Bamaga on Cape York Peninsula. Seisia Island Community lies within a small DOGIT area granted in 1986 by the Queensland Government at Red Island Point The community has a permanent population of about 100 people and is situated at the most northerly deep-water port on Cape York Peninsula Attractions Seisia is popular as a destination for anglers and a number of fishing charter operators use Seisia as their base. A campground at Seisia is used by about 50 per cent of camping travelers to Northern Cape York Peninsula. The majority of tourist services in the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) are provided under lease arrangements with the Seisia Island Council. Seisia is becoming increasingly well known as the \\"Gateway to the Torres Strait\\" and as a base on the mainland to educate and inform visitors about Torres Strait Islander culture. Tours linking Seisia with a number of Torres Strait islands (including the market days on Saibai) have commenced, capitalizing on opportunities to educate visitors as to the historical links between Seisia and the Torres Strait. A number of recreational fishing guides can be contacted through the Seisia Village campground.  History  = European contact = Seisia, formerly known as Red Island Point, is also known as Ithangee in its Aboriginal language. Ithunchi was originally used as a traditional camping site before European contact.N Sharp, Footprints Along the Cape York Sandbeaches (Australian Studies Press, Canberra; 1992) 12. The Oiyamkwi clan of the Ankamuti was indigenous to the island. In 1864, a government settlement was established at Somerset at the tip of Cape York. The introduction of diseases, exclusion from traditional hunting grounds and the brutality of Native Police under the direction of Somerset‚Äôs Police Magistrates, decimated the Aboriginal people of the NPA.N Sharp, Footprints Along the Cape York Sandbeaches (Australian Studies Press, Canberra; 1992) 35-40, 55-58. By 1915, surviving remnants of the Aboriginal population had regrouped at Red Island Point and Cowal Creek. Yadhaigana, Wuthathi, Unduyamo and Gudang people from the north and east had established themselves as a single group at Red Island Point. Other Yadhaigana people and Wuthathi had formed a group at Injinoo (known then as Small River).N Sharp, Footprints Along the Cape York Sandbeaches (Australian Studies Press, Canberra; 1992) 15, 85-87.

In 1942 during World War II, US Army engineers established a military airstrip inland from Red Island Point. The airstrip was known as the Jacky Jacky or Higgins airstrip. A number of RAAF bomber, fighter and transport squadrons operated from the airstrip. It is still used today as the airport for the Northern Peninsula Area. A radar station was also established at Muttee Heads in 1943 with local Aboriginal people assisting in its construction and operation. New jetties and wharves were built by Army engineers at Muttee Heads and Red Island Point.R Marks, Queensland Airfields, World War Two, 50 Years On (R & J. Marks, Brisbane; 1994) 14-17. At the end of World War Two, the Queensland Government introduced measures aimed at compensating Torres Strait Islanders for their contribution to the war effort. These were also intended to populate the north as a defence mechanism against foreign invasion. Around 1945, the Director of Native Affairs, Cornelius O‚ÄôLeary, inspected the North Peninsula Area with a local stockman, Dick Holland, to identify suitable locations for a new settlement. In his opening address to the 1947 Island Councillors‚Äô Conference held at Badu, O‚ÄôLeary spoke of the government‚Äôs \\"wish for the expansion of the Torres Strait Race as a healthy industrial unit in North Queensland\\".D Ober, J Sproats and R Mitchell, Saibai to Bamaga, The Migration from Saibai to Bamaga on the Cape York Peninsula, (Bamaga Island Council, Joe Sproats & Associates, Townsville; 2000) 14Queensland State Archives, Director of Native Affairs Office, SRS 505/1, Correspondence Files, File 9M/10, part 1, Administration Cape York Peninsula, Development of Northern Peninsula Area. During the war years, enlisted Torres Strait Islander men from Saibai, Dauan and Boigu also discussed the possibility of developing an Islander community on the Australian mainland. These discussions continued after the war at Saibai, with the involvement of Island elders and leaders. Saibai elder Bamaga Ginau supported the proposal. He held strong concerns regarding the inadequate supplies of freshwater and firewood on Saibai and the damaging effects of poor drainage, disease and king tides. In 1947, a series of king tides during the wet season caused \\"serious and in some cases irreparable damage to properties and gardens\\" on Saibai. Bamaga Ginau called a meeting regarding his concerns for the future of Saibai. After much discussion, a number of Saibai families made the decision to leave the Island and move to the mainland.D Ober, J Sproats and R Mitchell, Saibai to Bamaga, The Migration from Saibai to Bamaga on the Cape York Peninsula, (Bamaga Island Council, Joe Sproats & Associates, Townsville; 2000) 6-8Queensland, Native Affairs ‚Äì Information contained in Report of Director of Native Affairs for the Twelve Months ended 30 June 1948 (1948) 22.

The Act conferred local government type powers and responsibilities upon Torres Strait Islander councils for the first time. Umagico, Bamaga, New Mapoon and Cowal Creek also elected council representatives at this time. On 29 October 1987, the council area, previously an Aboriginal reserve held by the Queensland Government, was transferred to the trusteeship of the council under a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT).Queensland, Annual Report of Department of Community Services for 1986 (1987) 3; Queensland, Annual Report of the Department of Community Services for 1987 (1988). At the , Seisia had a population of 165. In 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission recommended that the 3 NPA Aboriginal Shire Councils and the 2 NPA Torres Strait Islander Councils be abolished and a Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council be established in their place. The first Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council (NPARC) was elected on 15 March 2008 in elections conducted under the Local Government Act 1993.

Biography Born Geraldine Perdue in Kansas City, Missouri, following high school, she attended a private school for girls. Standing 5' 2.5\\", she began her career as a dancer (she had been dancing since the age of six), gaining much popularity. She first received attention in Hollywood during a stage production entitled Attila and the Huns, with Ram√≥n Novarro playing Attila and Perdue playing one of the Huns. Perdue went on to appear as a dancer with Novarro in the 1921 film A Small Town Idol. Her first film credit was the 1923 film Daytime Wives. She was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars that year. Perdue reportedly got on poorly with fellow actress Grace Darmond, with whom she starred with in A Dangerous Adventure (1922). It was later told that the two women were actually fighting it out for real in several scenes, nearly pulling each other's hair out. However, she still went on to appear in many more films, including the 1924 film The Last Man on Earth. She later played Mrs. Newlywed in The Newlyweds film series of short comedies in 1928 and 1929. Soon enough, though, Perdue's career was beginning to fall apart. Her boss, future presidential father Joseph P. Kennedy, insisted that she change her name to Ann Perdue, a more sensible name compared to Derelys. She sued him, but lost, and her film career ended in 1929. The suit was brought against Film Booking Inc. Distributing Agency for Robertson- Cole Photoplays in April 1923. Movie distributors had conducted a contest in a picture magazine asking fans to suggest a name for Miss Perdue. Her last film was The Smiling Terror (1929), a low-budget serial. Throughout her career, she was especially noted for her great talent for dancing in her films. She even organized dancing episodes in several films. She also performed solo or in group at a variety of locations in Los Angeles. Personal life She was divorced from Louis M. Feldman in Los Angeles, California in November 1926. Death Derelys Perdue died in 1989 in Los Angeles, California, aged 87.

After winning a beauty contest, Leahy went on to make only one film in her very short-lived film career. Life and film career In 1922, sisters Constance Talmadge and Norma Talmadge, Joseph Schenck and film director Edward Jose held a contest in England to find a new leading lady. The contestants reputedly numbered nearly 80,000 and the competition resulted in three girls thought suitable: Leahy, Katherine Campbell, and Agn√®s Souret who proceeded to travel to Hollywood at the end of 1922. Born in London, Leahy was described by Norma Talmadge, as \\"the most ravishing girl in England\\". Although it was said by her publicity that the young beauty queen had acted in English and French films in Europe, this proved to be untrue, especially after director Frank Lloyd had her dismissed from Within the Law (1923), which was supposed to be Leahy's big film debut, claiming that the actress could do nothing that an actress was supposed to be able to do. Leahy was selected as one of thirteen WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1923, probably due to the help of producer Joseph Schenck, Norma Talmadge's husband, who had signed a three-year contract with the girl. Following this, Schenck handed Margaret over to his brother-in-law Buster Keaton to appear in his next comedy, for Schenck believed it did not take much for an actress to be a comedian. Leahy's only film, Three Ages (1923), directed by Buster Keaton, did absolutely nothing to improve her already crumbling film career. Leahy's role was not given much attention, and she never acted again. Following this one film, Leahy chose to remain in California and get married, instead of returning to England. She later became an interior decorator and grew to despise the movie industry. She apparently committed suicide in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 64.

In December 1861, Sir George Ferguson Bowen (1821‚Äì99), Governor of Queensland (1859‚Äì67), described the necessity for a station in the far north of Queensland. From a naval and military point of view, a post at or near Cape York would be valuable, due to the establishment of a French colony and naval station in New Caledonia.

It is the third of 4 albums he had released in the year 2006, as a follow-up to Thugs Revenge and The Story and eventually being followed by Evolution of Elevation. The production on the album is diverse, ranging from G-funk to synth melodies and was produced in its entirety by Playalitical. It has sold 90,700 copies while being on Top Rap albums chart (thus providing notable sales increase). Critical response The Midwest Cowboy received positive reviews. David Jeffries gave the album 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Maverick rapper Bizzy Bone's third release of 2006 -- and it's only July -- is yet another album that suggests the overly prolific man could up his chances if he slowed down and beefed up his quality control. At times, The Midwest Cowboy recalls 2004's very good Alpha and Omega, an album that included quite a bit of Bizzy's singing, and while it had plenty of the cryptic post-Bone lyrics that are now infamous, it didn't indulge to the point of disaster like some later albums. Also like Alpha and Omega, comprehendible bits of Bizzy's uneasy personal life shine through, extra enticing for hardcore fans and maybe just enough to sway the curious. Add to this some subtle hints that he misses Bone and would like to patch things up, and you've got what should be Bizzy's great return, but getting to these grand statements means slogging through eccentric filler and productions from an overworked Playalitical, who handles nearly everything in the background. Playalitical drowns the more difficult cuts in layers of Bizzy's vocals plus horns, harps, and what have you, but he's perfect for the cuts where the rapper decides to dip his toe back into the mainstream. The seductive \\"Lovey, Dovey,\\" the swaggering \\"Around the World,\\" and the old-school-feelin' \\"Wit a $20 Dolla Bill\\" are the best examples, and with the confessional \\"I Must Fess Up\\" added to them, you'd have one killer EP.

This group consists of three genera: Terfezia, Tirmania, and Mattirolomyces. They are a few centimetres across and weigh from 30 to 300 grams (1‚Äì10 oz). Desert truffles are often used as a culinary ingredient. Family description Fruit-bodies (ascomata) are large, more or less spherical to turbinate (like a top), thick-walled, and solid. The asci are formed in marbled veins interspersed with sterile tissue. The asci are cylindrical to spherical, indehiscent (not splitting open at maturity), and sometimes stain blue in iodine. Ascospores are hyaline to pale brown, spherical, and uninucleate.Cannon, P.F., Kirk, P.M. (2007). Fungal Families of the World. p. 347. Singapore: CABI Publishing. 456 pp. Habitat and ecology Desert truffles, as the name suggests, predominantly grow in the desert. They have been found in arid and semi-arid zones of the Kalahari desert, the Mediterranean basin, Turkey, Syria, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the Negev desert in Israel, the Sahara, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, Croatia, and China.Kagan-Zur V.

Field Mycology 13 (1): 17-21. doi:10.1016/j.fldmyc.2011.12.004 They can be formed near Sunrose plants, but they are very rare to find and can't be cultivated (thus justifying their cost). Culinary use and commercial importance Desert truffles do not have the same flavor as European truffles, but tend to be more common and thus more affordable. Forest truffles (genus Tuber) typically cost $1000 per kilogram, and Italian truffles may sell for up to $2,200 per kilogram, while Terfezia truffles sold as of 2002 in Riyadh for $80 to $105 a kilo, and in recent years have reached, but not yet exceeded, $270. Israeli agricultural scientists have been attempting to domesticate Terfezia boudieri into a commercial crop. Vernacular names Desert truffles go by several different names. In Iran they are called Donbalan, In Turkey they are called Domalan in Central Anatolia and Keme on the Syrian border. In Algeria and Tunisia they are called terfez, the Bedouin of the Western Desert call them terfas ÿ™ÿ±ŸÅÿßÿ≥. The Kuwaitis call them fagga ŸÅŸÇÿπ, the Saudis ŸÅŸÇÿπ faq'h, and in Syria, and in Libya terfase ÿ™ÿ±ŸÅÿßÿ≥, they are known by their classical Arabic name, kamaa ŸÉŸÖÿ£. Iraqis call them kamaa, kima or chima ŸÉŸÖÿ£, depending on local dialects and in Oman they arefaqahŸÅŸÇÿπ The Hebrew word is kmehin (kmeha in singular). In southern Spain, they are known as turmas or criadillas and in the Canary Islands they are known as Papas Crias. In Botswana they are called mahupu. In Iran; they are called Dombal. The Nama-Damara call them !Nabas, where they are also known as the \\"Kalahari truffle\\". In Hungary they are known as homoki szarvasgomba (\\"sand truffles\\") and are sold to English-speaking nations as honey truffles. In Saudi Arabia, there are two varieties; khalasi are oval with a black skin and a pinkish- ivory interior, and zubaidi have a cream colour but are generally more expensive.

Los Angeles International Charter High School now occupies the former campus.Landsberg, Mitchell. \\"County gives Los Angeles International Charter High School a second chance.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 10, 2010. Retrieved on September 8, 2011. Origins Pacific Christian on the Hill (PCH), originally Pacific Christian High School, was founded in 1965, but its roots go back to 1904 with the formation of Los Angeles Free Methodist Seminary (later Los Angeles Pacific College) by the Free Methodist Church. When the college was divested by the church and merged with another college,Azusa Pacific University#History some property was left for the development of a high school under the guidance of an independent, interdenominational board of directors. A private college preparatory high school was created for grades 9-12. Later it added a junior high school, grades 7 and 8. School description The school provided a liberal arts education with a strong foundation in the Christian faith. There were no religious affiliation requirements for entry and the students came from many different Protestant denominations. However, true to its origins, chapel services for the students were held every Wednesday at the local Free Methodist church (Hermon Community Church) located close by. PCH was fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), a member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI), California Scholarship Federation (CSF) and the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) for athletics. The school mascot was the panther. This was reflected in the name of the school yearbook, Pardalis, Greek for panther. Structures on campus (1970s-2000s): Lingren Hall: the main building housed the class rooms, library, lab, darkroom, book storage, and lockers. The Panther Den: housed yearbook and journalism classes, restrooms, and lunch sales. The Office: used to be a two-story building. Housed administration offices, teachers' lounge, computer lab, and girls' locker room. Boy's Locker room: housed the locker room, weight room, athletic equipment storage, and general grounds storage. The amphitheater: pictured on this page. Observatory: as of the 1990s this was the oldest building remaining on campus. Student population In addition to supporting Hermon area children, PCHS reached out to enroll students from other towns in the northeastern suburbs of Los Angeles. The school was attractive to Christian parents who preferred to have their children schooled in a Christian environment. Hence, PCH was able to attract students from towns such as neighboring Highland Park, California, South Pasadena as well as towns further afield in the San Gabriel Valley such as Pasadena, San Gabriel, San Marino, Rosemead, Temple City, Alhambra and Eagle Rock, California. Many of the students were graduates of Christian middle schools based in Pasadena and San Gabriel. A rival Christian high school, Maranatha High School, originally based in Arcadia and now in Pasadena, provided healthy competition for the enrollment of these students. Coincidentally, the two schools were founded in the same year, 1965. A junior high (middle school, grades 7-8) was added in 1975. Student population generally hovered around 150, from the late 1970s until a few years before the school closed. By 2003, student enrollment had declined to less than 100 overall, hastening the school's eventual financial demise. The graduating class of 1986 was the largest in many years at 28 students. Closure The Bowl. A unique feature of the school was an open-air amphitheater used for assemblies, the yearly school play, and other events. The school closed in the summer 2004 just before celebrating its 100th anniversary; the school simply had no money to continue operating. While the school grounds remained shuttered, the school board and the Hermon community discussed the future of the school and its properties. Hermon Community Church retained the right of first-refusal. The school board and the church prepared to enter the courts to settle the matter. However, an appropriate buyer, agreeable to both sides appeared and on December 7, 2006, the school board agreed to the sale of the site to Bethesda Christian University. After the sale to Bethesda was completed, the new owners signed a multi-year lease of the historic campus to Los Angeles International Charter High School (LAICHS), beginning with the 2007-08 academic year. LAICHS operates as a public secondary school under the umbrella of the Los Angeles County Office of Education. In 2009, LAICHS graduated its first senior class of approximately 40 students. Current enrollment as of 2014 averages 250 students in grades 9 through 12; future plans call for addition of grades 7 and 8. Since 1965 the school had only four principals: *1965-1983 Gerald W.

He is riding in the back of his father's old Cadillac, which is being driven by Carmela with Ralphie beside her. There is a caterpillar on Ralphie's bald head, then a butterfly. Tony at first sees Gloria sitting next to himself, then Svetlana. Tony discusses the dream with Dr. Melfi, who suggests that it signifies that Carmela is in control and Tony wants to square the changes in the lives of the others in the car with her. But Tony is growing dissatisfied with his therapy and rejects her interpretation. At the next session, he admits that Svetlana broke up with him because she thinks he is \\"high-maintenance,\\" too hard to cope with emotionally. This is after four years' therapy. Although Melfi tells him that he needs to continue, he states that it is over. She offers to shake hands; he kisses her on the cheek and leaves. Sophia notices a cake in her father Bobby's car. When Janice asks him about it later, he tells her that he goes to Karen's grave every day, and he buried the cake on what would have been their anniversary. Janice says she understands his grief. Sophia and Bobby Jr. wonder about their mother's ghost. After a Sunday dinner at the Soprano home, Carmela insists that A.J. play a game with the two children. He takes out a Ouija board and engages in a mock s√©ance that terrifies them. When the children are at home, Janice uses an internet chat program to direct them to their own Ouija board. When Bobby arrives home, his children are in a terrified state and he calls Janice for help. She tells him she had heard them with the Ouija board earlier in the day, but thought it would be improper to intervene. She uses the manufactured situation to encourage Bobby to move on, and prevails on him to eat his wife's last frozen baked ziti. At Junior's trial, the judge denies Melvoin's motion to dismiss on the grounds of mental incompetence. Bobby reassures Junior that they will get to a juror. Tony has a sitdown in New York City with Carmine and Johnny, who demand 40% of the profits of his HUD scam. Tony walks out but phones with a counter-offer of 5.5%, which Carmine rejects. On Carmine's orders, Joey Peeps and an associate beat up \\"Vic the Appraiser,\\" who works for Tony, and tell him to start working for Carmine. Vic later gets beaten up again, this time by Vito and an associate, to convince him to work for the Soprano family. Alone with Silvio, Tony raises the possibility of reaching out to Little Carmine Lupertazzi in Florida through their old friend Beansie Gaeta. He voices his suspicion to Silvio that Paulie is leaking information to Johnny, and they agree not to tell him about the trip. In fact, Johnny is still treating Paulie as if they are confidantes, hinting that there might be a change of leadership in New Jersey. \\"Carmine won't forget you,\\" he says. In Florida, Tony meets with Little Carmine, who agrees to travel home and talk to his father. Tony threatens action against New York should negotiations fail to yield results. Tony dreams.

The operation formed part of Operation Bodyguard, the cover plan for the Normandy landings in 1944. Titanic was carried out on 5‚Äì6 June 1944 by the Royal Air Force and the Special Air Service. The objective of the operation was to drop 500 dummy parachutists in places other than the real Normandy drop zones, to deceive the German defenders into believing that a large force had landed, drawing their troops away from the beachheads and strategic sites such as Caen. Titanic was one of several deception operations involving the Royal Air Force on D-Day; others were Operations Glimmer and Taxable, executed by No. 218 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron, and radar deceptions by No. 101 and No. 214 squadrons. Background Operation Titanic formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The most complex portion of Bodyguard involved a wide-ranging strategic deception, organised by the London Controlling Section (LCS), in southern England called Fortitude South. Through decoy hardware, radio transmissions and double agents, Operation Fortitude South attempted to inflate the size of the Allied force in England and develop a threat against the Pas-de-Calais (rather than Normandy, the real target of Operation Overlord). As D-Day approached, Allied planners moved on to tactical deceptions (roughly under the umbrella of Fortitude) to help cover the progress of the real invasion forces. The D-Day naval deceptions (Taxable and Glimmer) were planned for the eve of the Normandy landings to develop threats against the Pas-de-Calais involving No. 218 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force and Harbour Defence Motor Launch's of the home fleet. Titanic was intended as an accompaniment to these deceptions, as well as to create general confusion for the defending forces on the morning of D-Day. It simulated paratrooper drops (using dummies and small numbers of SAS personnel). The idea for Titanic originated from a plan submitted by David Strangeways (head of the tactical deception unit of 21st Army Group) which in turn was a rewrite of a plan from the Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) Ops (B). Operation Map of the Operation Titanic area Seine-Maritime in the east, Manche in the west and Caen in the centre Titanic was divided into four operations (I to IV), consisting of various combinations of dummy paratroopers, noisemakers, chaff (codenamed Window) and SAS personnel. The noisemakers, codenamed Pintails, were attached to each dummy to simulate rifle fire. They also carried a small explosive timed to destroy the dummy and give the appearance of a paratrooper burning his parachute. Four squadrons from No. 3 Group RAF (the special duties squadrons) carried out the drops. No. 138 and No. 161, flying Handley Page Halifaxes and Lockheed Hudsons, as well as No. 90 and No. 149, flying Short Stirlings. British parachute dummy now on display at the Merville Gun Battery museum in France M. R. D. Foot, intelligence officer for the SAS brigade, was ordered to arrange the special forces contingent. He first approached the head of 1st SAS Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Paddy Mayne, who refused to take part in an intelligence operation, having had a bad experience implementing deception plans while in north Africa. However, Lieutenant Colonel Brian Franks of the 2nd SAS Regiment was convinced to take part in the operation. 2nd SAS provided twelve men under the command of Captain Frederick James Fowles (Chick) and Lieutenant Norman Harry Poole. After landing these teams were to locate and open fire on the German forces, allowing some to escape in the hope they would report the parachute drops. In total, around four hundred dummies were planned to be dropped as part of the operation. Titanic I simulated the drop of an airborne division north of the Seine river; near Yvetot, Yerville, Doudeville in the Seine-Maritime region and Fauville in the Eure region. Two hundred dummies and two SAS teams were parachuted in across these four Titanic I targets. Titanic II would have involved dropping fifty dummies east of the Dives River to draw German reserves onto that side of the river. However, this segment of the operation was cancelled just before 6 June. A further fifty dummies were dropped, under Titanic III, in the Calvados region near Maltot and the woods to the north of Baron-sur-Odon to draw German reserves away to the west of Caen. Finally, Titanic IV involved two hundred dummies dropped near Marigny in the Manche, as with Titanic I the intention was to simulate the dropping of an airborne division. Two SAS teams were also dropped near Saint-L√¥. This group commanded by Captain Fowles and Lieutenant Poole landed at 00:20 on 6 June 1944, 10 minutes ahead of schedule. To deceive the Germans into thinking there was a large parachute landing in progress, the SAS teams played 30 minute pre-recorded sounds of men shouting and weapons fire including mortars. The mission went according to plan. The only aircraft lost were two Short Stirlings and their crews from No. 149 Squadron taking part in Titanic III. Eight men from the SAS failed to return; they were all either killed in action or executed by the Germans in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.Godson & Wirtz, p.110 Impact At 02:00 on 6 June 1944, the Germans reported the landing of parachutists east of Caen and in the Coutances, Valognes and Saint-L√¥ areas and hearing ships engines out at sea. In response the Germans ordered the 7th Army to increase the level of their preparedness and to expect an invasion, but General Hans Speidel decreased the level of alert when it was reported only dummy parachutists had been found.Barbier, p.113 However, Generalfeldmarshall Gerd von Rundstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzerdivision Hitlerjugend to deal with a supposed parachute landing on the coast near Lisieux which was found to consist solely of dummies from Titanic III. The dummies and SAS teams of Titanic IV diverted a Kampfgruppe from the 915th Grenadier Regiment, the 352nd Infantry Division reserve away from the Omaha and Gold beaches and the 101st Airborne Divisions drop zones. The regiment, believing an airborne division had landed, were employed searching woods instead of heading to the invasion beaches.

In the , Kowanyama had a population of 944 people. Geography Kowanyama is a town on the Gulf of Carpentaria side of Cape York Peninsula. The town resides within the Kowanyama Local Government Area (LGA) which covers a land area of 2,516.1 km¬≤. The aboriginal people who live in this community include Kokominjena, Kokoberra and Kunjen groups, amongst others. In their overarching Yir-Yoront language, Kowanyama means \\"The place of many waters.\\" The community is situated on the banks of the Magnificent Creek, a tributary of the Mitchell River, inland from the coastline of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Kowanyama is accessed by an all-weather airstrip, as well as unsealed roads in the dry season from Pormpuraaw to the north, Normanton to the south and Cairns to the east. History Kunjen (also known as Koko Wanggara, Ngundjan and Olkola) is a language of Western Cape York. The Kunjen language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Kowanyama Community Council and Cook Shire Council. In 1905, Trubanamen Mission was established inland on Topsy Creek, now known as the old mission. Aboriginal peoples of the region were gradually drawn from their ancestral lands into the mission settlement. Photo of Kowanyama near its beginnings, taken June 1919 Later, in 1916, Mitchell River Mission was founded on the present site of Kowanyama and the Trubanamen site abandoned. Some peoples continued to occupy their traditional lands, moving into Kowanyama as late as the 1940s. More than 1000 people now live in Kowanyama, making it one of the largest communities on the Cape York Peninsula. Kowanyama's Aboriginal people continue to identify strongly with their ancestral countries and with the languages, stories, songs, dances, and histories associated with those countries. Language groups associated with countries in the Kowanyama region are Yir Yoront, Yirrk Thangalkl, Koko Bera, Uw Oykangand, and Olkola. In 1964, a cyclone destroyed the mission. The Queensland government funded the rebuilding. Kowanyama Post Office opened by 1967. In 1967 the Anglican church were no longer able to sustain their activities in the area as a Church Mission. The Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, a government department, under the Act continued running the affairs of the community. In July 1987, the State Government of Queensland implemented legislation for a DOGIT over the lands in the Mitchell River delta, an area of 250 km¬≤. The deed covered the traditional lands of the people of Kowanyama. Like other DOGIT communities of the time, Kowanyama had a town Council elected by Aboriginal people living in the community. The newly formed Kowanyama Council assumed responsibility for implementing certain conditions of the DOGIT. Seven elected aboriginal residents hold three-year terms in office. Since the 1990s, many Kowanyama people have been returning to their ancestral lands through the Homelands Movement. Homelands within the Kowanyama DOGIT include Scrubby Bore, Red Lilly, Ten Mile, Shelfo, Stewart Place, Old Rodeo Ground, Kowanyumal, Duck Hole, Wonya Bore, Kokomenjen Island, Wallaby Island, Joe's Lagoon, Yangr Bore, Engkoram, Fish Hole, Robert Demaine great elder and Thilpi. Other homelands, including the Oriners Pastoral Lease and the Sefton Pastoral Lease, were independently purchased by the Kowanyama Council and are located outside the DOGIT boundary. At the 2006 census, Kowanyama had a population of 1,017. In the , Kowanyama had a population of 944 people.  Shire Council operations  =Community Justice Group= Front view of Kowanyama Community Justice Group's 'Courthouse' A Community Justice Group operates within Kowanyama. This group is made up of respected members in the community. They meet to discuss issues within the town and make recommendations to Council. The community also has a Council of Elders, who are consulted by the Kowanyama Council when making community decisions. The elders operate in conjunction with the Lands Office. = The Lands Office= Front view of Kowanyama Land and Natural Resource Management office, Gilbert St. The Kowanyama Aboriginal Land and Natural Resources Management Office (KALNRMO) works to promote and facilitate aboriginal management of the natural and cultural resources of Kowanyama country by the people of Kowanyama. Through community consultation and direction, KALNRMO has developed a community development agenda for the Kowanyama region, including: *Homelands development *Land and Fisheries Management *'Tourism and Visitor management *Kowanyama Ranger Service * Native Title Claims * Cultural Resource documentation Through the initiatives of KALNRMO, the Kowanyama community is widely regarded as a leader in indigenous land management issues. Since 1987, Kowanyama has effected substantial local control over fishing in the Mitchell River Delta, including the closure of some waters to non-Aboriginal fishing under state fisheries legislation. This action, funded through the enterprise income of the Kowanyama Aboriginal Council, has provided Aboriginal people access to the River‚Äôs fish stocks for their cultural and economic needs. In this way, Aboriginal people can fish and hunt as they have done for many thousands of years. KALNRMO employs a senior ranger and four field rangers. The Kowanyama Rangers implement land management strategies in many areas of the DOGIT, and, in addition to tourism and visitor management, patrol closed and open waters. The Rangers also observe fisheries regulations, especially for illegal commercial or recreational fishing in closed waters. Beginning in 2007, the Rangers monitor threatened turtle populations and participate in the Carpentaria Ghost Nets Programme to remove debris (primarily fishing nets) discarded into the Gulf of Carpentaria by commercial fishermen from Australia and Indonesia. Education The Kowanyama State School has approximately 210 students from pre-prep to year 10. Since the beginning of 2014, the school has also started to enrol students in a year 11 and 12 pathways program. The Kowanyama State School opened in January 1904. Shopping Kowanyama has a small supermarket that sells fresh foods, packaged and frozen foods, and hardware items. The store is similar to a medium-sized IGA store. The store is operated by Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships (DATSIP), and the manager is able to obtain any goods that are not normally kept for sale. The store prices are somewhat higher than provincial towns, which reflect the high costs of transport and storage. The \\"Coffee Shop\\" does not sell coffee; operated by the Anglican Church, it stocks take away food, entertainment media and small goods. Accommodation Kowanyama River House Kowanyama River House is a 17-room guest house overlooking Magnificent Creek in Kowanyama Township. The guest house is located 100 metres from the Cultural Centre and 200 metres from the Kowanyama Aboriginal Shire Council offices and Supermarket.

Its traditional language region is in Western Cape York within the local government areas of Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama and Shire of Cook, in the catchments of the Coleman River and Mitchell River. Following the removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, it is also spoken in Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama. Climate Kowanyama experiences a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw). Daytime temperatures generally stay above all year round and reach up to in the pre-wet season period in October and November. The wet season runs from December to April and is characterized by frequent torrential downpours and high humidity. During the dry season, almost no rain falls and days are warm to hot but humidity is low and the nights can become quite mild. In February 2014, of rain fell in Kowanyama over a six-day span, including a 24-hour total of on 8 February. Residents were confined to their houses for almost two weeks; however no major damage was reported. Travel Kowanyama is serviced weekly in the dry season by road trains from Cairns. The service becomes more frequent as the wet season approaches. Early storms in October can make the dirt road to Chillagoe east of the community subject to flooding. By late December the storms of the monsoons have usually arrived, isolating the community by road. The monsoons are regarded as the arrival of nhawrr yirrpa, the Rainbow Snake who brings the life giving water to the land. During the wet season, which may last until May, the community is serviced only by aircraft, as all other access is restricted. During the wet season, fresh foods and perishables are flown into the community each week on charter planes by stores in town. Airline passenger services to Cairns, away is maintained throughout the year through Kowanyama Airport.

Pormpuraaw is an Aboriginal community situated on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula approximately halfway between Karumba and Weipa on the Edward River. It is by road from Cairns. Pormpuraaw currently has a 4-man police station. Formerly known as Edward River Aboriginal Mission, Pormpuraaw was an Anglican mission established in 1938. The people included Thaayorre, Wik, Pakanh and Yir Yoront. This was the third mission to be set up in the southwestern Cape York region. In 1967 control was passed from the church to the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs. The community received DOGIT status, and is governed by a community council. Pormpuraaw has been successful in developing a commercial crocodile farm, a cattle operation and some tourism. In the , Pormpuraaw had a population of 749 people.  History  Pormpuraaw (Porrm-puur-ow) was previously known as Edward River Mission and is situated on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula between the Chapman River and Mungkan Creek. The community is home to 2 groups of people, the Thaayorre (Thie-Orr) people and the Mungkan people,It is widely accepted in the community of Pormpuraaw that the Thaayorre and Mungkan Peoples are the Traditional Owners however a determination of native title by the courts has never been made. and includes 16 outstations. = European contact = European settlement on Cape York began with the establishment of Somerset in 1865.C G Austin, ‚ÄòEarly History of Somerset and Thursday Island‚Äô (1949) Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 4, 2 <http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:212282/s18378366_1949_4_2_216.pdf(PDF)> at 8 April 2013. The settlement was formed at the tip of Cape York Peninsula after a recommendation from the Queensland Governor Sir George Bowen that it would be a favourable location for a harbour of refuge and a well-positioned international trading port. Frank and Alexander Jardine overlanded a herd of cattle to establish a pastoral station near Somerset to supply the settlement with meat. The Jardine brothers had several skirmishes with Aboriginal people on their journey to Cape York that culminated in what the Jardine brothers named the \\"Battle of the Mitchell\\". On arriving at the Mitchell River: > \\"Whilst the cattle halted ‚Ä¶ they came on to a number of blacks fishing, > these immediately crossed to the other side, but on their return, swam > across again in numbers, armed with large bundles of spears and some nullahs > and met them ... The natives at first stood up courageously, but either by > accident or through fear, despair or stupidity, they got huddled in a heap, > in, and at the margin of the water, when ten carbines poured volley after > volley into them from all directions, killing and wounding with every shot > with very little return‚Ä¶ About thirty being killed.‚Äô\\" After this fatal encounter, the Jardine brothers continued north, crossing the Coleman and Edward rivers and on to Somerset. Gold mining brought further European settlement to Cape York, after William Hann‚Äôs expedition found gold on the Palmer River in 1872.G Pike, Queen of the North: A Pictorial History of Cooktown and Cape York Peninsula (G Pike, Mareeba, 1979) 22-23. In 1876, Robert Sefton found gold while prospecting at the Coen River. His return to Cooktown with 140 ounces in 1878 prompted a subsequent gold rush in Coen.G Pike, The Last Frontier (1983) 63-64; Author unknown, ‚ÄòThe Coen‚Äô, The Queenslander, 13 July 1878, 470. The town of Normanton was established by 1868, and a Native Police detachment was stationed there shortly afterwards.P Saenger, Sweers Island: Changes over 200 years since Flinders visit, Gulf of Carpentaria Scientific Report (Southern Cross University: 2005) 15. Native Police camps were established at Highbury in 1885 and in Coen in 1888, which helped European settlement advance further into Cape York.J Richards, The Secret War: A True History of Queensland‚Äôs Native Police(University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 2008). In 1874, the Mitchell River was considered as a potential location for a port to service the Palmer River goldfield. The river was surveyed again in 1886, with a view to establishing a town to service the recently formed pastoral stations. However, neither of these surveys reportedly amounted to anything.Author unknown, ‚ÄòExploration of the Mitchell River‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 29 January 1874, 4; Author unknown, ‚ÄòThe Mitchell River‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 11 March 1886, 3. In 1896, it was argued that, as the land from Albatross Bay down to the Gilbert River was not needed for European settlement, there was no need to establish a mission in the area.Author unknown, ‚ÄòAboriginals of Queensland‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 21 October 1896, 6-7. In 1900, the Church of England created the Diocese of Carpentaria, based on Thursday Island.N Loos, White Christ, Black Cross: the emergence of a black church (Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, 2007) 58. Securing a grant from the Queensland Government, Gilbert White (the first Bishop of the Diocese of Carpentaria), turned to Ernest Gribble for help in establishing a mission at Mitchell River.

Chapman continued to visit the site during the 1920s, but the establishment of a permanent mission station was stalled because the Diocese of Carpentaria was unable to find the necessary funds.Author unknown, ‚ÄòChurch News‚Äô, Brisbane Courier, 23 February 1929, 7. Chapman was keen to extend the missionary influence to the Edward River, to block attempts to have the area thrown open to pastoral selection.P Freier, Living With the Munpitch: The history of Mitchell River Mission, 1905-196 (PhD Thesis, James Cook University, 1999), 202. Anglican missionary, Walter Daniels, attempted to establish a mission station at Coleman River during 1932, but this attempt also failed. In 1939, Joseph Chapman returned to the Edward River to establish a permanent mission station.

In 1966, the Anglican Church approached the government to take control of the mission. Responsibility for the mission was handed over to the Queensland Government on 1 May 1967.18A/20, Edward River Transfer to State. In 1971, a pilot crocodile breeding research project was established in the area. In 1972, a crocodile farm was established with Australian Government funding by Applied Ecology Pty Ltd. By 1975, the farm contained 1,012 crocodiles.01-029-004, Edward River Crocodile Faming. = Local government = On 30 March 1985, the Edward River community elected 5 councillors to constitute an autonomous Edward River Aboriginal Council established under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984. The Act conferred local government type powers and responsibilities upon Aboriginal councils for the first time. On 23 July 1987 the council area, previously an Aboriginal reserve held by the Queensland Government, was transferred to the trusteeship of the council under a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT). Also in 1987, the Edward River Mission community changed its name to Pormpuraaw, taken from a local dreamtime story in the Kuuk Thaayorre language of the Thaayorre people, about a burnt hut or ‚ÄòPormpur‚Äô. On 1 January 2005, under the Local Government (Community Government Areas) Act 2004, Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Council became the Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Shire Council. According to the 2006 census, the population of the community was 600, with 536 of them being indigenous persons.  Language  Stanford cognitive psychologist, Dr. Lera Boroditsky, studied the language of the people in Pormpuraaw, Kuuk Thaayorre, due to its unique way of using cardinal directions instead of the more common 'left' and 'right' to explain direction. She explores the people's ability to always know where true North lies, as well as the effect of this directional understanding on the language. She discussed her findings on an episode of NPR's Radiolab. Yir Yiront (also known as Yiront, Jirjoront, Yir-yiront, and Kokomindjan) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is in Western Cape York within the local government areas of Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama and Shire of Cook, in the catchments of the Coleman River and Mitchell River. Following the removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, it is also spoken in Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama. Education There is a State primary school which caters for children from Years 1 to 7 with classes from differing year levels combined. There is one preschool and one day care centre which is operated by an Aboriginal corporation. There is no high school or TAFE in the division. Utilities Electricity is supplied by a generator. Electricity is paid up front via the use of power cards which are purchased from the Coffee Shop and Australia Post Post Office. Power is very expensive with an average cost of A$40 to A$45 per week when running air conditioners. Town water is supplied by a bore and pumped into tanks. The water is of reasonable quality and high in minerals which gives it a strong flavour. Both police residences have rain water tanks that are suitable for drinking. Water pressure from both water sources is low. Sewage is by pumping stations to settling ponds.

During the First World War it fought in Egypt, against the Senussi, and then on the Western Front. It was disbanded on 4 February 1919. Background Following the outbreak of the First World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), under the command of Major General Alexander Godley, for service abroad. By October 1914, there were sufficient volunteers to form two brigades, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Brigade. These two formations formed the main body of the NZEF and, together with the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade and the 1st Light Horse Brigade, were the basis of the New Zealand and Australian Division, which fought in the Gallipoli campaign against the Turks. In the meantime, another regiment of infantry was being raised, with effect from 1 May 1915. This regiment, the precursor to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade (NZRB), was to consist of two infantry battalions and was originally known as the Trentham Regiment (The Earl of Liverpool's Own). The two battalions were placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harry Fulton. Later, as the first two battalions finished its training in New Zealand, the government decided to increase the strength of the regiment by adding two further battalions, thus bringing the regiment up to the size of a brigade. By this time, the Trentham Regiment's designation had been abolished and it was now officially known as the New Zealand Rifle Brigade (Earl of Liverpool's Own). Formation The first personnel, the officers and non-commissioned officers, for the first two battalions of what was then the Trentham Regiment arrived at Trentham Camp, near Wellington, in late April 1915 for a period of instruction by staff of the New Zealand Staff Corps, supervised by Fulton. The main body of the regiment, around 2,200 soldiers, arrived at the end of the following month. Over 600 of these were from the Wellington Military District, while Auckland, Canterbury and Otago contributed over 500 soldiers each. In contrast to how the rest of the NZEF had been organised, the regiment had no provincial identity. Instead, battalions and companies had numerical designators. Thus, Fulton took command of 1st Battalion while Lieutenant Colonel Stewart was in charge of 2nd Battalion. The regiment underwent training for the next few months, disrupted by a move to a camp near Palmerston North after an outbreak of meningitis at Trentham. Poor weather had also affected the camp grounds. In September 1915, an advance party of 50 men from both battalions were dispatched to Egypt via the Suez, with the rest of the two battalions to follow the following month with the 7th Reinforcements on 10 October 1915 aboard the transports Maunganui and Tahiti. Fulton's 1st Battalion arrived at Cairo on 14 November; the Tahiti, carrying the 2nd Battalion, was travelling to Suez via Colombo, and the men it was carrying would not arrive at the camp being set up near Cairo for a few more days. Egypt The 1st and 2nd Battalions were attached for duties with the Western Frontier Force, which had been raised to counter a Senussi invasion from Libya. The 1st Battalion fought two actions south-west of Matruh as part of a mixed force (including British, Australians, and Indians), one on Christmas Day, the other on 23 January 1916. Both were successful and broke the back of the invasion. By December 1915, the much depleted New Zealand and Australian Division had been evacuated from Gallipoli, and was placed in reserve near the Suez Canal. Since the deployment of the main body of the NZEF, the numbers of volunteers had steadily increased to the point that they could no longer be integrated into either of the two existing brigades. In January 1916, the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray, proposed the number of available New Zealand personnel warranted the establishment of a New Zealand infantry division for service on the Western Front. The New Zealand government concurred after Murray provided assurances that there was sufficient NZEF personnel in Egypt to keep the new division up to strength in the short term. To form the new infantry division, the original New Zealand Infantry Brigade was redesignated as the 1st Infantry Brigade while three battalions of reinforcements already in Egypt, with another inbound, was to form the 2nd Infantry Brigade. The two battalions of the NZRB in transit to Egypt from New Zealand would join the two battalions already in Egypt to form the completed third brigade of the division. The 3rd and 4th duly arrived in mid-March 1916 and after a period of reorganisation the full brigade left Alexandria on 7 April for France. France Members of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade operating a mortar at the front near Le Quesnoy, 1918 After a period of training the brigade entered the line on 13 May east of Armenti√®res. It participated in the vast majority of the battles of 1916, 1917 and 1918. Notable examples include: * The brigade's first major offensive was during the Battle of the Somme when it attacked on 15 September as part of the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. * The Battle of Messines, possibly the most complete Allied victory of the war until late 1918. * Third Ypres, normally described these days as Passchendaele. * It was thrown into a gap in the line caused by the German attack, called Operation Michael, on 26 April 1918. * Finally it fully participated in the Hundred Days Offensive that ultimately culminated inside Germany Disbandment The NZRB, as part of the New Zealand Division, formed part of II Corps of the Second Army, assigned to the Army of Occupation on the Rhine. The NZRB made its way to Cologne, where it was to be stationed, on foot, beginning its march from France on 28 November 1918. It arrived at Cologne on 22 December 1918. Its occupation duties were light, with morning parades and training sessions leaving time in the afternoon for sightseeing. An education programme was implemented although many men were more interested in returning to New Zealand. The NZEF had begun demobilising on 26 December 1918 and by the end of the following month, up to 1,000 personnel were leaving each week for England to catch ships destined for New Zealand. By mid-January 1919, the brigade's normal complement of four battalions had been reduced to two with the final units being disbanded on 4 February 1919. The brigade was nicknamed The Dinks although its origin is unclear. It is generally understood to be a contraction of \\"Dinkum\\", meaning having excellence and quality. The nickname itself appears to date to the arrival of the 2nd Battalion in Egypt. The newly arrived personnel sought to maintain high standards of presentation and drill which the Gallipoli veterans also in Egypt considered to be excessive. They referred to the battalion as \\"Square Dinkums\\" but with disrespect, and this was later applied to the brigade as a whole once it had been assembled. Another possibility for the nickname is that following the 1st Battalion's engagement of December 1915 at Mersa Matruh against the Senussi, Gallipoli veterans ironically referred to it as \\"a fair dinkum fight\\", comparing to the much more intensive action experienced on the Gallipoli peninsula. Over time, the nickname was shortened to \\"The Dinks\\", and the brigade's personnel took pride in it as the nickname began to be used in a more respectful context as it established its reputation on the Western Front.

Known for her withering wit and sometimes-off-color wisecracks, she was one of the few women making a living as a screenwriter at a time when women were a rarity in the profession.New York Times, Obituary. May 2, 2006. \\"You write to please yourself,\\" she said, \\"The only office where there's no superior is the office of the scribe.\\"L.A. Times. October 5, 1982. 6. Early life Allen was born Jacqueline Presson in San Angelo, Texas, the only child of Willie Mae (n√©e Miller), a buyer, and Albert Jack Presson, a department store merchant.Profile Filmreference.com; accessed October 16, 2014. She was \\"never particularly fond of her given name\\", and decided to use her first initial when writing. She would spend every Saturday and Sunday in the movie house, from one o'clock until somebody dragged her out at seven. From that time on movies became very important to her, and Allen knew she wouldn't be staying in West Texas. Allen attended Miss Hockaday's School for Young Ladies in Dallas for a couple of years, but came away, in her words, \\"having had no education to speak of.\\"McGilligan, 1986. She skipped college and at 18 left home to become an actress. In New York, her career lasted \\"for about twenty-five minutes\\", Allen says, when she realized that she only liked rehearsals and the first week of performance, and would rather be \\"out there\\" where the decisions were being made.Acker, 1991. pp. 201‚Äì203. In the early 1940s, Allen married \\"the first grown man who asked me,\\" Robert M. Davis, a promising young singer, and they lived in Claremont, California during World War II. She continued acting while in California; she has a small credited role (under the name Jay Presson) in the 1945 film An Angel Comes to Brooklyn and can be glimpsed briefly as \\"Miss Zelda\\" in the 1946 film Gay Blades. =Writing career= Allen became a writer by default, having always read constantly. Being able to write pretty well, she decided to \\"write her way out\\" of the marriage and set out to become financially independent of her husband. She always claimed her first husband's big fault was marrying someone too young. Her debut novel, Spring Riot, was published in 1948 and got mixed reviews. Her next effort was a play, which she sent to producer Bob Whitehead. Because he had produced Member of the Wedding, she thought he would like it since her play was also about a child, but the play came back from Whitehead's office rejected. Allen waited for a couple of months and sent it back, rightly figuring that some reader had rejected it instead of Whitehead himself. This time Whitehead read the play and instantly optioned it, but due to casting problems her play was never produced on stage. The reader who had initially rejected her play was Lewis M. Allen, whom she would later marry. =Second marriage= Allen returned to New York and performed on radio and in cabaret, both of which she loathed, and would go through the whole performance wishing to be fired. In the meantime she started writing again, little by little, and sold some of her work to live television programs like The Philco Television Playhouse. When she married Lewis M. Allen in 1955, they moved to the countryside, where Lewis wrote and Allen in her words \\"didn't want to do anything.\\" She had a baby, and spent two and a half \\"absolutely wonderful years in the country.\\" Eventually the couple came back to the city to work. By then, Bob Whitehead had become a good friend and encouraged Allen to write another play. She drew on her married life and wrote The First Wife, about a suburban working couple. It was made into the film Wives and Lovers in 1963, starring Janet Leigh and Van Johnson. When Allen read The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, by Muriel Spark, she instantly saw play potential where no one else did. After undergoing hypnotherapy to alleviate a yearlong bout of writer's block, Allen produced a draft of the play in three days. Career =Marnie= While The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie was still an unproduced script, Alfred Hitchcock read it and offered Allen the script for Marnie (1964). Hitchcock brought Allen to California to work on the film at Universal Studios in the San Fernando Valley. Allen, who lived close by, would bicycle to work. This upset Hitchcock, who insisted that a limousine be sent for her every day, whether she wanted it or not. On days when she tried to walk to the studio, the limousine trailed along behind her. In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn fast enough to make a first-rate movie, although she thought Marnie did have some good scenes in it. Hitchcock would have made her a director but she told him no. Said Allen: \\"It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. I like to get things on and over with. ... Did you ever hear the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn't make it up. I would never propose myself as a director.\\" Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said \\"almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If I was getting a bum rap somewhere, I didn't know it.\\" =The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie= The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, about an iconoclast Scottish girls' school teacher, did not premiere on the London stage until after Marnie's completion. Produced by Donald Albery, it premiered at the Wyndham's Theatre in May 1966 with Vanessa Redgrave and ran hundreds of performances. In January 1968, it opened in New York with Zoe Caldwell as Brodie and ran for an entire year. Allen also wrote the screenplay for the 1969 film starring Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens. Said Allen: \\"All the women who played Brodie got whatever prize was going around at that time. Vanessa did, Maggie [Smith] did\\". =Forty Carats= After Jean Brodie, Allen had another success on Broadway with Forty Carats (1968). Her adaptation of the French boulevard comedy by Pierre Barillet and premiered in December 1968 with Julie Harris as the 42-year-old who has an affair with a 22-year-old man.The Guardian Obituary, May 5, 2006; accessed October 17, 2014. Harris won a Tony Award for her performance. In 1973, Allen adapted her play for the screen, which turned out to be a critical and commercial disappointment.Alternate Film Guide. May 2, 2006; accessed October 16, 2014. =Travels with My Aunt= Bobby Fryer, who had produced the Jean Brodie film, had collaborated with Katharine Hepburn to make the film version of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt (1972), specifically for George Cukor to direct. Cukor for some reason wasn't getting any work and Hepburn was casting around for projects. They asked Allen to come on board for the script, but she was busy and instead suggested Hugh Wheeler. After a few months, Fryer and Hepburn still weren't happy with Wheeler's script, so Allen agreed to work on the project and wrote a very straightforward script for them. But Hepburn had just starred in the disastrous adaptation of Madwoman of Chaillot and didn't want, in Allen's words, \\"to play another crazy old lady.\\" Hepburn was reluctant to let Cukor down and wouldn't admit her reservations and began to find fault with the script, even rewriting many sections herself. Consequently, Allen finally gave up the endeavor, telling Hepburn that she ought to write it herself, which the actress did. Eventually, Hepburn provoked the studio into making her quit the project, leaving Fryer free to bring Jean Brodie's Maggie Smith onto the picture. One speech of Allen's remains in the script, otherwise it is all Hepburn's product. The Writer's Guild refused to put Hepburn's name on the script because she wasn't a guild member; Fryer refused to let Allen take her name off because she was the one he paid, and Wheeler was burned that he received no credit at all. =Cabaret= Structure was what Allen brought to the screenplay for Bob Fosse's Cabaret. The producers hadn't wanted to film the stage script by Joe Masteroff and John Van Druten, and felt that not portraying the male lead as a homosexual was dishonest to the story. They wanted to go back to Christopher Isherwood's original novel Goodbye to Berlin of 1939, but the Berlin stories weren't structured in any linear fashion and Allen had to diagram the entire story.Crist, 1984. pp.282‚Äì311. Allen and Fosse got along badly from the start: she found him \\"so depressed that it took two hours just to get him in the frame of mind for work.\\"Gottfried, 2003. p.205. In Allen's opinion most of the humor from the original was lost; she believed Fosse didn't really like the lead character of Sally Bowles at all. She worked on the screenplay for ten months, but in the end Fosse and the producers were still unhappy with the final form, and having commitments elsewhere, Allen handed the script over to her friend Hugh Wheeler. =Funny Lady= In Allen's opinion, the problem with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had not wanted to do a sequel to Funny Girl and was determined to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have come out of nowhere. =Family= The idea for the television show Family was born in Aaron Spelling's kitchen, where he and Leonard Goldberg came up with the idea about a show that centered on the emotional life of a family. They pitched the idea to Allen and she liked it. Allen spent two weeks at the Beverly Hills Hotel while she knocked out a script. Len and Aaron loved it; it was touching and had marvelous moments of compassion, and was exactly what they had talked about in the kitchen. The pilot was great, but ABC didn't buy it. It wasn't until two years later that ABC entered a production deal with Mike Nichols, who turned down all their ideas in favor of the script for Family that his Connecticut neighbor Jay Allen had shown him. It was Nichols who brought in Mark Rydell for the pilot which premiered at 10:00pm on March 9, 1976; the series went on to run for four years and 86 episodes.Spelling, 1996. p.97. Later in life Allen would remark about television: \\"I hate it, I hate it because the buck doesn't stop anywhere.\\" =Just Tell Me What You Want!= \\"Male characters are easier to write. They're simpler. I think women are generally more psychologically complicated. You have to put a little more effort into writing a woman.\\" ‚Äì Jay Presson Allen. Allen wrote the novel Just Tell Me What You Want! in 1969, with the idea of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting together a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. =Prince of the City= When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was convinced it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen let it be known that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed. When asked if the original author ever has anything to say about how their book is treated, Allen replied: \\"Not if I can help it. You cannot open that can of worms. You sell your book, you go to the bank, you shut up.\\" =Deathtrap= Allen adapted Ira Levin's play Deathtrap (1982) for Lumet, exchanging a weak, confusing ending for a more directly resolved one. Though not being able to do what a screenwriter needs to do to a play ‚Äì \\"opening it up,\\" taking it outside the original set or sets, make it bigger ‚Äì she was limited to bookending the script with scenes in a New York theater. The plotting was so very tight, which is what the studio executives had wanted when they bought it. It was up to Allen to cut away the underbrush, simplifying the rhetoric as much as possible and adding some realism to the characters. =La Cage Aux Folles= Allen returned to the stage with an adaptation for Angela Lansbury of A Little Family Business, a French boulevard comedy by Pierre Barillet and . She was also hired by Broadway producer Allan Carr to adapt Jean Pioret's non-musical 1973 play La Cage Aux Folles as a musical reset in New Orleans. The never-to-be-produced production was called The Queen of Basin Street, and was to be directed by Mike Nichols with Tommy Tune choreographing and Maury Yeston writing the songs. Nichols, who was a producing partner with Lewis Allen, eventually quit in a dispute over profits; Tommy Tune followed him and Carr fired Jay Allen.Suskin, 2000. When Carr finally produced a musical version, Allen was forced to file suit for payment from her work on the adaptation.Jay Allen vs. Allan Carr, 1983 =The Verdict= \\"What I really like to do is a very swift rewrite for a great deal of money. Then I'm out of it. There's no emotional commitment at all ‚Äì your name's not on it, you're home free\\", she would explain. Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen in for a rewrite when they were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had produced from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script they were happy with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway. =Hothouse= Allen tried to recapture the success of Family with Hothouse for ABC in 1988; the drama about the lives and work experiences of the staff of a mental hospital lasted eight episodes. Personally Allen thought it was some of her best work, though its short life was a mixed blessing for her, said Allen: \\"Unfortunately, ABC didn't have the courage of their initial convictions. They skewered it, they turned tail on it. However if they had picked it up I'd have had to turn out 26 episodes. I'd be in Forest Lawn now. Television is a killer. It is really not for sissies.\\"Gardner. 1991 =Tru= The 1991 Broadway production of Tru starring Robert Morse as Truman Capote was actually a request of the lawyer for the Capote Estate. Allen was reluctant to write about Capote at first, but once she had researched him, she found the last ten years of his life not as off- putting as she had thought: \\"Capote had a kind of Gallantry in the face of a devastating situation.\\" Friends of Capote were amazed at her accuracy portraying a man she had only met but not known, and there was much question about how many of the lines are Capote's and how many Allen's; she maintained that at least 70% of the dialogue is Capote's own. =Script doctor= When she wasn't writing, Allen and her husband were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing particularly salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that \\"developed\\" scripts tend to need rewrites ‚Äì from outside the \\"development circle\\". > \\"A production rewrite means that the project is in production.

They pay good money.\\" Her last film work was her screenplay for the 1990 remake of the classic, Lord of the Flies. However, she disliked the finished product and had her name removed. The trick in adapting, Allen said in a 1972 interview with The New York Times, \\"is not to throw out the baby with the bath water. You can change all kinds of things, but don't muck around with the essence.\\" Death Jay Presson Allen died May 1, 2006 at her home in Manhattan following a stroke, aged 84.

Takagi's gimmick is that he is Stone Cold Steve Austin. He is known in Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) and around the micro-indy scene for his hilarious promos and natural charisma as well as his extensive use of comedy in his matches. He is the president of DDT and has also worked as the chief executive officer of Wrestle-1. He became the new president of Pro Wrestling Noah when CyberAgent purchased the company. Career Takagi was trained by Goro Tsurumi and started at his International Pro Wrestling revival promotion, IWA Kakuto Shijuku. Soon, however, Takagi broke off, seeing that IWAKS's limited exposure would only limit him to be an independent wrestler, in 1997 he formed DDT (Dramatic Dream Team), which not only would promote in Tokyo (as opposed to Tsurumi's Chigasaki, Kanagawa base), but also be based on the entertainment wrestling kingpin of the day, World Wrestling Entertainment. Since then Takagi's show has acquired a cult following as a good version of American- style entertainment wrestling. Takagi has also made appearances in All Japan Pro Wrestling, but prefers to remain his own man and his own promoter. On May 5, 2015, Takagi was announced as the new chief executive officer (CEO) of Wrestle-1. He also continued serving as the president of DDT, while being involved with Wrestle-1's management. Starting on April 1, 2017, Takagi served in the role of an advisor to new president Kaz Hayashi. In March 2017, Wrestle-1 underwent a change in management, which led to Takagi assuming the new role of an advisor, from which he resigned the following September. On September 1, 2017, DDT was sold to the CyberAgent company. Takagi retained his position as the company's president. On July 15, 2019, at Wrestle Peter Pan 2019, Takagi won the inaugural O-40 Championship by defeating Super Sasadango Machine. On September 29, at Who's Gonna TOP? 2019, he lost the title to Gorgeous Matsuno. On January 30, 2020 Takagi became new president of Pro Wrestling Noah and commented that Mitsuharu Misawa once saved DDT when he gave chances to DDT wrestlers to perform at Noah events and he wanted to rise both DDT and Noah as world class promotions.

It has a precipitation average of 900 mm per year, in contrast with the Dry Pampas to the west, which average less than 700 mm.WWF Setting Like the Pampas in general, the region's terrain is predominantly hilly and of a temperate climate, though rich mollisols are more abundant here than to the west, where soils of loessic origin are more common. Except for a few bluffs near the Paran√° and R√≠o de la Plata rivers, as well as the Tandilia and Ventania mountain ranges to the south, the region's slope rarely exceeds 6 degrees. It covers Buenos Aires Province almost completely, the centre and south of Santa Fe Province, most of C√≥rdoba Province and the eastern third of La Pampa Province, totalling at least 600,000 km¬≤. The Uruguayan savanna, which lies east of the rivers in Entre R√≠os Province of Argentina, Uruguay and the south of Brazil, is sometimes considered part of the Humid Pampa. The Uruguayan savanna is not as flat as the named aforementioned areas. The flatlands are also interrupted by low hill's ranges like Tandilia in the southeast, namely at Sierra de los Padres, Balcarce, Olavarr√≠a, Tandil and like the higher system of the Sierra de la Ventana to the south, near Bah√≠a Blanca. Finally, there are also some dunes at the Atlantic coast, such as at the city of Banderal√≥. Climate The area is characterised by four distinct seasons. Winter brings chilly, occasionally frosty nights. Humid, temperate weather characterizes spring and fall. Summer days can be extremely hot. The natural vegetation comprises meadows of high grass with isolated forests (locally referred to as montes) of algarrobos, talas and chanares, which used to be common in areas near the main rivers but have been mostly cut down during the 20th century. The great rhea lives in the pampas of Argentina and eats plants, lizards, insects, frogs, small birds and snakes. Flora The Humid Pampa is characterized by medium-height grassland, with both perennial and annual grasses with scattered herbs and shrubs. The grasslands are interspersed with areas of dry woodland as well as freshwater and saltwater wetlands and lagoons. The omb√∫, considered an emblem of the Humid Pampa (and not a proper tree but a herb), grows naturally north of the R√≠o de la Plata and east of the Paran√°, seldom south of the R√≠o de la Plata and never south of the Salado. Before the introduction of cattle, horses and sheep by the Spaniards on the 16th century, the region was covered by hard grass, but the animals' grazing facilitated the growth of softer, greener grass. Grazing land in La Pampa Province Population Due to the important immigration to Argentina in the second half of the 19th century and first decades of the 20th, and because the weather allowed for two annual harvests, the lands started being heavily used for agriculture, which made Argentina a major agricultural producer (the self-styled \\"Granary of the World\\"). Being fertile and close to the Atlantic Ocean, the Humid Pampa was one of the preferred destinations of millions of immigrants, who were mostly Italian, French and Spanish, but also German and other Europeans. The lands of the region were taken care of by the gauchos for centuries, and the region was the centre of their culture, including their music and dances. Areas that were kept for extensive breeding of cattle and sheep stayed under the control of large estates' owners, and in lesser number to medium-size estates. Smaller farms are known as \\"chacras\\" (their owners being chacareros or chacreros). The urban population of Argentina (89% of its 38.6 million inhabitants, as estimated for 2005) is concentrated today in cities within the Humid Pampa (Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba and Rosario are the largest). In all, over 23 million Argentines live in this area,INDEC which produces two-thirds of the Argentine economy.IADER Given the commercial and agricultural desirability of most of this area for the last 130 years,Infobaires not much pristine land remains. One of the best corners of unspoiled pampa is the Otamendi Natural Preserve near Campana, Buenos Aires Province. Established in 1990 on 2,600 hectares (10 mi2) of former grazing land, the parcel has become one of Argentina's chief points of interest in its agrotourism circuit.Otamendi Gallery Image:Jun√≠n Campo 01.jpgSoy field near Jun√≠n, Buenos Aires Province Image:Ombu del Parque Rivadavia.jpgOmb√∫ in a Buenos Aires city park.

Rewa State, also known as Rewah, was a princely state of India, surrounding its eponymous capital, the town of Rewa.RewaCityOnline ‚Äì Information about Rewa City With an area of about , Rewa was the largest princely state in the Bagelkhand Agency and the second largest in Central India Agency. Rewa was also the third wealthiest principality in Central India, with an average revenue of Rupees 2.9 million in 1901.https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V09_384.gif The British political agent for Bagelkhand resided at Satna, on the East Indian railway. The Bagelkhand Agency was dissolved in 1933, following which Rewa was placed under the authority of the Indore Residency.  History  According to legend, the kingdom of Rewa was founded around 1140 CE. On 5 October 1812, it became a British protectorate. Between 1 April 1875 and 15 October 1895, Rewa remained under the direct colonial administration of British India.Princely States of India The ruler of Rewa ruled from Bandhavgarh during the founding reign of Raja Vyaghra Dev, who was a direct descendant of Gujarati warrior king Vir Dhawal. In the mid-1550s, Raja Ramachandra Singh Baghela maintained a musically talented court, including the legendary Tansen. In 1617, Maharaja Vikramaditya Singh moved his capital to Rewa. Maharaja Martand Singh was the last ruler of Rewa who acceded to the Union of India after the country became India. Emperor Akbar was given refuge at Rewa at age 10, when his father Humayun fled India following a defeat in war. Prince Ramchandra Singh and Akbar grew up together as royal heirs. Maharaja Ramchandra Singh and Akbar stayed friends. Two of the Navratnas of Akbar, Tansen and Birbal (originally named Mahesh Das) were sent from Rewa by Maharaja Ramchandra Singh once Akbar became the Emperor of India. Rewa was the first princely state in India to declare Hindi as a national language, in the times of Maharaja Gulab Singh. He is also credited for declaring the first responsible government in modern India, providing citizens of Rewa state a right to question their monarch's decisions. The state came under British paramountcy in 1812 and remained a princely state within the British Raj until India's independence in 1947. During the long minority of Raja Venkat Raman Singh (1876, 1880‚Äì1918), the administration of the state was reformed. In 1901, the town boasted a high school, a \\"model jail\\" and two hospitals: the Victoria hospital and the Zenana hospital. However, it was still adjudged among the most backward areas of the country by V.P. Menon, after he visited the state in 1947. = Post-independence period = Upon India's independence in 1947, the maharaja of Rewa acceded unto the Dominion of India. Rewa later merged with the Union of India and became part of Vindhya Pradesh, which was formed by the merger of the former princely states of the Bagelkhand and Bundelkhand agencies. Rewa served as the capital of the new state. In 1956, Vindhya Pradesh was merged with other nearby political entities to form the Indian constitutive state of Madhya Pradesh. The Maharaja's palace was converted into a museum. In February 2007, the most-extensive book on the history of Rewa, Baghelkhand, or the Tigers‚Äô Lair by Dr D.E.U Baker, was published by Oxford University Press. Bagheli is local language of Rewa.  Rulers The predecessor state Bandhogarh was founded 1140. The chiefs of Rewa were Baghels descended from the Solanki clan, which ruled over Gujarat from the 10th to 13th century. Vyaghra Deo, a brother of a ruler of Gujarat, is said to have made his way into northern India around the middle of the 13th century and gained the fort of Marpha, north-east of Kalinjar. His son Karandeo, married a Kalchuri (Haihaya) princess of Mandla, and received in dowry the fort of Bandhogarh which, until its destruction in 1597 by Akbar, was the Baghel capital. In 1298, Ulugh Khan, acting under orders of Mughal Padshah (emperor) Alauddin, drove the last Baghel ruler of Gujarat from his country and this is believed to have caused a considerable migration of Baghels to Bandhogarh. Until the 15th century, the Baghels of Bandhogarh were engaged in extending their possessions and escaped the attention of the Delhi Sultans, in 1498‚Äì1499, Sikandar Lodi failed in his attempt to take the fort of Bandhogarh. = List of rulers = The following is a list of known rulers of Rewa (or its predecessor state, Bandhogarh), in chronological order by their reign.

Barbara Olson, a passenger on the flight, asked her husband on her mobile: \\"What do I tell the pilot to do?\\" suggesting Burlingame was next to her at the back of the aircraft. He would have turned 52 the day after the incident. Burlingame was buried in the Arlington National Cemetery. He was initially deemed ineligible for burial there due to his status as a reservist deceased at an age younger than 60, but Burlingame was given a waiver and his case triggered reform of Arlington's burial criteria.Chris Smith Astronaut Frank Culbertson, Burlingame's friend and classmate at the Naval Academy and who had witnessed and photographed the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks from space, played taps on his trumpet at Burlingame's memorial service. At the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Burlingame is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-69.

Arms were designed, but World War I broke out before the project was finalised, and the arms were never actually taken into use. Giving the colonies their own insignia in time of war could let them have a symbol to rally around in case of rebellion.

It is situated on Long Island's Great South Bay. History The Moorings was the conception of Francis Henry Hawkes, a developer who purchased the estate of Charles Lanier Lawrance in 1962. Francis Hawkes, his wife Jean Whiting Hawkes, and his five children lived in the home until Francis retired and moved with his wife and youngest child to Arizona. The home passed through many hands and was divided and in turn developed, but Charles Lawrence's home still stands and is owned by Donald and Lynn Zergebel. The estate originally belonged to famed Wall Street banker, H. B. Hollins and was landscaped by the famous Olmsted Brothers. Hawkes improved upon the site by constructing roadways, curbs, bulkheading, drainage, and waterways connecting to a private yacht marina. He also enforced strict stipulations to maintain the characteristic beauty and dignity of the lush bayside wooded acreage; land was sold at acre minimum and no two estates could be of generic plans nor could they be of similar plans within the gates. Sporadic building began in 1964, prior to the incorporation of the homeowner's association. Meadow Farm, the 19th century Hollins estate remained on a waterfront parcel and was eventually demolished. However, the estate's owners salvaged marble fireplaces, paneling, and other appurtenances for the construction of a new estate. The new development on the original estate parcel became Harbour View Estates. \\"The Moorings\\" means \\"a place suitable for anchoring\\" in Middle English.

It is set around the life of the last independently ruling Nawab (noble) Wajid Ali Shah and concludes with the British annexation of the Nawab's kingdom of Awadh in 1856. The two main characters are the aristocrats Mirza Sajjad Ali and Mir Raushan Ali who are deeply immersed into playing chess. Their desire for the game destroys the competency of the characters, and makes them irresponsible in their duties towards their families and society. They derive immense pleasure in developing chess strategies and ignore the real life invasion by the British. Their city Lucknow falls to British attackers as they are busy playing a game of chess.

It is a mostly Indigenous community, situated about from the Northern Territory border, and west of Burketown. The settlement began with the establishment of the Doomadgee Mission in 1933, which relocated from Bayley Point to Nicholson River in 1936. In the , Doomadgee had a population of 1405 people.  History  =Indigenous peoples= The Waanyi and Ganggalidda (Yukulta) people are the recognised Aboriginal Australian peoples who are the traditional owners for the region surrounding Doomadgee. Historically, Gadawa, Lardil, Mingginda and Garawa groups inhabited or traversed the area. The Waanyi language (also known as Wanyi, Wanyee, Wanee, Waangyee, Wonyee, Garawa, and Wanji) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Gulf Country. The language region includes the western parts of Lawn Hill Creek and Nicholson River, from about the boundary between the Northern Territory and Queensland, westwards towards Alexandria station, Doomadgee, and Nicholson River. It includes the local government area of the Shire of Doomadgee. Yukulta (also known as Ganggalida) is also spoken in the Gulf Country, including the in Doomadgee and Mornington Shires. =European settlement= From the late 19th century, Europeans started settling in the area, making a huge impact on the lives of the Indigenous peoples. Conflict occurred, as it did elsewhere in the Australian frontier wars. Native Police, known as yabayiri to the locals, were established at Turn Off Lagoon, which was on the Nicholson River about west of present-day Doomadgee site, in 1889. Before this, Native Police had been at a location on Carl Creek, to the south, since 1878. The Protector of Aboriginals was appointed on 30 Apr 1936, under the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897, whereby Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people became wards of the state. The Protector controlled the lives of Aboriginal people in Queensland until the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Affairs Act 1965 came into force on 28 April 1966 and the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs was created, and every Clerk of the Court within the State became a District Officer. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. =Doomadgee Mission (1933‚Äì1983)= Aerial view of Doomadgee Mission, 1950 (SLQ) Doomadgee Mission, originally known as Dumaji (a name deriving from a coastal sand dune known as Dumaji by the Ganggalidda people), was established on Bayley Point () on the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1933, including the Doomadgee Mission School. There had been a mission home for Aboriginal children established at Burketown by Len and Dorothy Akehurst, members of the Open Brethren, in 1930, and this was moved to the new site of Dumaji (subsequently known as \\"Old Doomadgee Mission\\" a couple of years later, at the request of the Aboriginal people. Most of the residents of Old Doomadgee came from Burketown and were Gangalidda and Garawa people. At first the girls lived in a house and the boys in tents, but dormitories were built over time. The boys and girls lived in separate dormitories. The Akehursts returned to Sydney in 1935. After the Protector was appointed (April 1936), the mission was classed as an \\"Aboriginal reserve (Church-sponsored), managed by a Local Protector\\". In 1936, after the coastal site of the mission had been devastated by a cyclone, the community and the dormitories were relocated to Nicholson River, known as \\"New Doomadgee\\". There were around 50 children and 20 adults at this time, but the population soon grew through the 1930s and 1940s, when the Queensland Government removed many Aboriginal families from surrounding pastoral stations, including Westmoreland, Lawn Hills and Gregory Downs. Official records show more than 80 removals between 1935 and 1957 (and prior to the establishment of Doomadgee Mission, many Aboriginal children in the region were removed to the Mornington Island Mission and other missions and Aboriginal reserves further south). A photograph held by Queensland State Archives taken around 1940 shows about 80 children at the mission, and official records report about 100 children in 1949. The mission settlement included a hospital, a school, a cattle run which included horses, and a garden. However, government reports dated 1949 and 1950 report that there was no school building and lessons took place in the dormitories. Here the inhabitants were subjected to close supervision and strict adherence to a Christian way of life, with the girls allowed only to sing hymns as amusement. Conditions were difficult, and the mission's practices were criticised in a 1950 government report. All all children over six years old lived in dormitories; boys left the dormitory around the age of 14 to take up station work, while girls were trained in domestic duties and often remained in the dormitories until they married. By the late 1950s, many residents left, moving to the Mornington Island mission, where by this time families were allowed to stay together. A 1958 Open Brethren report showed that about 115 children aged 6‚Äì20 years were in their care. During the 1960s, older unmarried girls started returning to their parents. The girls' dormitory was renovated in 1964, in 1965 there were still 35 boys and 23 girls living at the mission, and in 1968 there were at least five children still living in a dormitory. From 28 April 1966, the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs became responsible for the mission. In 1969, the Queensland Government was appointed trustee of the reserve on which the mission was located, and after continuing criticism of the conditions at the mission, it took administrative control from the Brethren in August 1983. It is not clear exactly when the last children left the dormitories. However, the contents list of a book by the Akehurst's son, Vic, shows devotes Part 5 to the 1970s and Part is titled \\"The Last Four years as a Mission - 1980 to 1983\\". The National Library of Australia has a sound recording of an interview by Gwenda Davey with Vic Akehurst about his parents, made in 2003 and available online, including a full transcript. Two dormitory buildings still remain: the girls' dormitory and over the road from it the boys dormitory. One dormitory was destroyed by fire in 2003. =Later 20th century ‚Äì 21st century= Doomadgee Post Office opened on 2 January 1969. In 1985 the population of Doomadgee was approximately 800. As of July 2006, eight of 25 Queensland government departments were represented in Doomadgee: * Queensland Police Service * Queensland Corrective Services * Queensland Ambulance Service * Department of Education and the Arts * Department of Employment and Training * Queensland Health (Hospital, Emergency Department and Community Health Services) * TAFE Queensland * Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy From January 2007, the Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council in the area was given full shire status. At the 2011 census, Doomadgee had a population of 1,258. Governance and demographics On 21 May 1987, the Aboriginal reserve was transferred from the Queensland Government to the trusteeship of the Doomadgee Aboriginal Council, under a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT). On 1 January 2005, the Doomadgee Aboriginal Council became the Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council. Doomadgee is located within the Aboriginal Shire of Doomadgee, situated about from the Northern Territory border, and west of Burketown. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. It is a mostly Indigenous community, with population of 1405 people in the 2016 Australian census.  Education  The Doomadgee Mission School, established in 1933, became Doomadgee Community School in 1970. In 1975 it came under the control of the Queensland Government's Education Department, becoming Doomadgee State School. Doomadgee State School is a government primary and secondary (Early Childhood-10) school for boys and girls at Goodeedawa Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 325 students with 35 teachers and 10 non-teaching staff (7 full-time equivalent). It includes a (Prep-10) special education program.

January 1855 The Frankfurt Art Association () is an art museum founded in 1829 by a group of influential citizens of the city of Frankfurt, Germany. The aim of the institution is to support the arts in the city, which was an important center of trade and business. Works of art were bought and exhibitions organized in order to open access to art and culture for the public. Among the founders were Johann Gerhard Christian Thomas, a senator and later mayor of the city, historian Johann Friedrich B√∂hmer, and art historian Johann David Passavant. Soon after the establishment of the museum, many important and influential citizens and artists became members. Today, the museum is situated in the center of Frankfurt, in a gothic building from 1464 called the Steinernes Haus ('Stone Building'), near the city's town hall. There are around 1,700 members who support the activities and enable the museum to reach its aim today, more than 150 years after its establishment. Although the museum has no permanent collection, as art is not purchased any more, its exhibitions of contemporary art are internationally renowned. Furthermore, guided tours, symposia, film programs, and excursions are organized. So even in the neighbourhood of important museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art (Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst) and Schirn Gallery (Schirn Kunsthalle), the museum manages to assert itself as an important meeting point not only for Frankfurt's art scene. Especially young artists of the state-run art school (St√§delschule ) and the well-known design school HFG are closely connected with the museum and cooperation is common.\\\\  Directors of the Frankfurter Kunstverein (since 1945)  * Curt Gravenkamp (1945 ‚Äì 1961) ‚Äì Exhibitions (selection): Frankfurter Kunst der Gegenwart, 1947 ff; , Fritz Winter, Mateo Cristiani, 1952; Ernst Wilhelm Nay; 1952, Georg Meistermann, 1953; Mateo Cristiani, Hanny Franke; 1955 Hann Trier, Joseph Kaspar Correggio, 1960 * Ewald Rathke (1961 ‚Äì 1970) ‚Äì Exhibitions (selection): Edvard Munch, 1962; Amedeo Modigliani, 1963; Arnold B√∂cklin, 1964; Picasso Handzeichnungen, 1965; Wols ‚Äì Gem√§lde, Aquarelle, Zeichnungen, Fotos, 1965/1966; Konstruktive Malerei, 1966/1967; Alexej Jawlensky, 1967; Kompass New York, 1967/1968. * Georg Bussmann (1970 ‚Äì 1980) ‚Äì Exhibitions (selection): Kunst und Politik, 1970; Renato Guttuso, 1974; Kunst im 3.

The film tackles the social problem of genteel poverty, focusing on a struggling family. It stars Philip Hubbard, Margaret McWade, Claire Windsor, and Louis Calhern. Weber filmed in real locations, using as much natural lighting as possible. Scenes were filmed on location around Los Angeles, particularly at the old University of Los Angeles campus, now Los Angeles City College. Many supporting roles were given to non-professionals. The Blot was restored by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill for British television. Brownlow singles out the film for praise in his book Behind the Mask of Innocence (1990). The Blot screened at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in 2002. It was released on DVD in 2006 with expert audio commentary by film historian Shelley Stamp. Plot At the end of class, poorly paid college professor Andrew Griggs begs his unruly students to show more appreciation for his efforts to teach them. Among the most disrespectful are a spoiled trio led by Phil West (Louis Calhern), whose father is the school's wealthiest trustee; Bert Gareth, a congressman's son; and Walt Lucas, a 23-year-old who must graduate to receive his inheritance. Unbeknownst to his friends, Phil's interest has been piqued by the professor's daughter, Amelia (Claire Windsor). He frequently drops by the public library where she works, just to be able to speak to her. She, however, is unimpressed by him and his wealth. The Griggs' poverty is contrasted with the prosperity of their next-door neighbors. \\"Foreign-born\\" shoemaker Hans Olsen is sympathetic to their plight, as is his eldest son Peter (Amelia's secret admirer), but his wife strongly dislikes what she considers Mrs. Griggs' superior airs. One day, Phil finally manages to persuade Amelia to let him drive her home after work, as it is raining (and her shoe has a hole in it). He is invited inside. Mrs. Griggs, knowing who he is, decides to spend what little she has on some fancy sandwiches, cakes and tea in an attempt to put up a brave front. She is heartbroken to find when she brings them in that Phil has departed and poor Reverend Gates (another of Amelia's admirers) is to be the recipient of her expensive bounty. As a result, Mrs. Griggs is unable to make the mortgage payment on the house. Juanita Claredon (Marie Walcamp), another of the country club set, considers herself Phil's girl. Noting a change in the now more thoughtful and considerate man, she follows him one day to the library and sees her rival. Eventually, she realizes that his love for Amelia has matured him, and wishes him well. When Amelia becomes sick, the doctor recommends she get some nourishing food, such as chicken. Mrs. Griggs tries unsuccessfully to buy one on credit (a scene observed by Phil). In desperation, she steals an uncooked chicken from Mrs. Olsen's open window; this is witnessed by the horrified Amelia. While Amelia does not see her mother change her mind and put it back, Mrs. Olsen and Peter do. When Mrs. Olsen threatens to make this theft known, Peter insists he will leave home if she does. Meanwhile, Phil sends anonymously a basket of food (including a chicken) to the Griggs. However, Amelia refuses to eat it, as she believes it was stolen. The next day, though she is still ill, she goes to work, as it is payday. Afterward, she goes to apologize to Mrs. Olsen and to pay for the theft. Her teary attempt to make amends moves her neighbor, who denies she lost a chicken. The strain is too much for Amelia; she faints. Phil and Mrs. Griggs rush over and take her home. There, Phil confesses it was he who sent the chicken. Amelia is finally won over. Phil writes his father about the inadequate salaries paid to the teachers, calling it a \\"blot on the present day civilization\\"; impressed, Philip West Sr. comes to see his altered son and agrees that something must be done. In the meantime, Phil dragoons his friends into paying the professor for extra tutoring in the evenings. During that night's session, both Peter and Gates see that Amelia has given her heart to Phil. In the final scene, the saddened reverend congratulates them and makes his way home.

The more skilled the spinner, the more complex and subtle tricks they can pull. Some advanced tricks involve body wraps, which involve wrapping a poi string around an arm or leg, then pulling it to swing the poi back in the opposite direction. Throws and catches are also performed with the poi. Split time and split direction moves are possible, and some of the more difficult moves, such as the 'five beat weave', isolations or hyperloop require a considerable amount of manual dexterity, coordination and fine timing to accomplish. Manual strength is not a factor, as power and control come from good timing. There are different planes that the poi are spun in and these are usually parallel planes: # wall plane - facing a wall # wheel plane - sitting in car, poi spinning at your sides like wheels # horizontal plane - like a lasso The poi can be spun in the same direction (weaves) or opposite directions (butterflies). Moves such as stalls and wraps can change direction of one poi to change between these two classes. Weaves Weaves are a class of trick based around the \\"basic weave\\". =The 3 Beat Weave= Considered by many poi spinners to be one of the staple moves, this is often one of the first few tricks learned. The poi are swung 180 degrees out of phase with each other, in a forward rotation. As one of the poi reaches its highest point it is swung down across the front of the body. When the poi that was swung across the body reaches its lowest point, the second poi is at its highest point on the same side of the body. The second poi is then swung across the body in a similar fashion to the way the first one was, although obviously in the opposite direction. Meanwhile the first poi is swung round to its highest point without changing sides. The swinger's arms are now crossed in front of their body. The first poi is swung down across the front of the body so that it is on its original side while the second poi is swung to its highest point. The first poi is then swung round to its highest point and the second to its lowest point without crossing sides. The first poi is then swung over the top of the opposite arm and down across the front of the body, while the second poi is swung back up to its highest point. The poi are now in the mirror position from when the arms were first crossed. From this point the same sequence from when the arms were first crossed is used, only in mirror image. The sequence can then be repeated for as long as the swinger wants. The basic weave is called \\"three-beat\\" because each poi spins three times in a cycle: once on the same side of the body (e.g. left hand poi on left side) and twice on the opposite side. Backwards weaves, behind the back weaves, and 1-beat, 2-beat, 4-beat, 5-beat, and other weaves are also possible. Butterflies Butterflies are a class of trick based around the \\"basic butterfly\\". The hands are held close together in front of the spinner and the poi spin in opposite directions flat to the spinner so that the poi cross at the top and bottom of their circles. This move can be done behind the head, behind the back and extended to any number of moves; there are as many variations on the butterfly possible as there are for the weave. The name butterfly refers to its appearance when viewed from the front: The poi appear to be flapping horizontally like a butterfly's wings. =The Basic Butterfly= The poi are swung in a forwards direction in phase with each other (same time). The hands are then both moved in front of the swinger so that the poi traverse a circle in front of the spinner - the left poi spinning clockwise, the right poi counter-clockwise. Their angles are very slightly offset to prevent the poi from colliding as they cross at the top and bottom of their respective circles. This move can also be performed in reverse/backwards. =The Overhead Butterfly= This is a variation of the basic butterfly where as the poi swing upwards from their lowest position the hands are moved to a position above the head. As the poi swing back downwards from their highest point the hands are moved down the opposite side of the head to complete the butterfly \\"flap\\". The hands are moved from the front to the back of the head alternately with each \\"flap\\" so that the poi flap alternately once in front of the head then once behind. Highly skilled performers perform butterflies with 4 poi (two in each hand) to execute a double butterfly. In each hand, one is held out of each end of a fist. The most expert practitioners do this with 6 poi so that a third one-footed butterfly can be performed with the other foot. However impressive though this last one certainly is, the majority of poi performers consider such things to have no real use, as it is highly difficult to transition from the one-handed butterfly back into two-handed moves. Wraps Wraps are a class of trick in which the poi are wrapped around something, most typically part of the body, to change the path or direction of spin. There are two types of wrap - basic or recoil wraps wrap around the target and then bounce off so that the poi ends up spinning in the opposite direction to which it started from, and thru-wraps which wrap around a moving body part so that the direction stays the same but the poi changes the path it is travelling along. Basic and recoil wrap sequences can be generated in infinite variety by tracing line paths with the hand between multiple points on the body and matching poi head direction as the hand travels back and forth along the line. Typical targets for a wrap are the arms and legs, although any body part is suitable - one of the more dangerous places to perform wraps is around the neck. These are among the most dangerous fire poi tricks as the poi can come into contact with the body or become entangled round the body; double neck thru-wraps are perhaps the most dangerous move that can be done with fire poi due to the risk of the poi tangling. =The Leg Wrap= A diagram illustrating the differences between the Leg, Groin and Ankle wraps. The Dashed line in the Groin Wrap illustrates the movement of the plane of swinging compared to the Leg wrap. The dashed line in the Ankle wrap illustrates the position of the legs compared to standing position. The leg is outstretched to the side while the poi are being swung to the sides of the body. The poi string or chain makes contact with the outstretched leg, causing the lower portion of the string or chain to be wound round the leg. Provided the poi had enough speed when contact with the leg was made, it will wind completely around the leg, with the head impacting the leg. The head will then rebound. Pulling upon the string/chain at this point will mean that, again provided there was enough initial speed, the poi completely unwinds from the leg and swings freely in the opposite direction to the one it did initially. At this point the swinger can proceed with another trick. =The Ankle Wrap= This is a variation upon the leg wrap where instead of outstretching the leg, it is bent to 90 degrees at the knee, with the lower portion of the leg turned out to the side. The string/chain then contacts with and winds round the ankle instead of the leg. The ankle wrap is usually not carried out on both legs at once as this requires jumping, which is exceptionally difficult to carry out at the required height and speed to complete the move before requiring to land. =The Air Wrap= The poi meet one another at the strings/chains, and wrap around one another. After spinning around one another for one rotation, the poi come undone again. This technique must be done with converging planes, steady hands, and with no pull from the spinner. Flowers Flowers are a class of trick based on compound circles, where the hands are moved in large, slow circles, and the poi rotate several times for each arm rotation, creating further circles around the perimeter. These moves create beautiful, symmetrical traces when performed cleanly. =Flowers= Split Time, Same Direction spin: The arms are moved in the same direction as the poi. Both poi are spinning in the same direction as each other. The arms remain 180 degrees apart. Same Time, Opposite Direction spin: The poi are spinning in opposite directions and the arms coincide twice per rotation, on the top and bottom positions. There's also a variation called Split Time, Opposite Direction - hands meet twice still, but on front and back (sic) positions. =Antispin Flowers= The arms are moved counter to the poi, e.g. if both poi are spinning forwards, both arms will do backwards circles. Much more difficult to master than regular flowers. The trickiest thing is that to make a four-petal antispin flower you need to make three rotations of poi in one rotation of arm and do it with good timing. =Opposite Arm Direction (Butterfly) Flowers= The arms are moved in opposite directions relative to the body. ie: From flower start position one arm moves forward and one backwards reaching opposite points, the next place is meeting above the head, then opposite points, then meeting at the waists. Both are moving opposite directions in circles while the poi moves antispin or inspin. Contact poi Contact poi is a class of moves where one or both poi are released from the hand and manipulated with other parts of the body. These moves are generally derived from staff and devilstick moves, and require poi with counter-weighted handles. =Suicides= The poi is thrown against a part of the body (generally the leg or opposite arm), rotates around it, flies off, and is caught again. =Propellers= The poi is released, and kept spinning in place by spinning the hand in a small circle, with the wrist pressing against the chain close to the weighted handle. =Wibbles= The poi is thrown, then its direction is repeatedly changed by rebounding it from the hand or wrist. The poi is caught close to the handle, but not grasped. If done cleanly the poi will be stalled for only a fraction of a second before recoiling. =Orbits= The poi is thrown and caught in opposite hands, then thrown forward causing the head of the poi to orbit the chain or neck. Further moves Advanced spinners are able to spin their moves in places such as behind the back and between the legs. There is a huge variety of different poi movements, and more are being developed over time. Most poi movements do not have clear, unambiguous names; the same movement may appear under various names in different groups of spinners. =Buzzsaw= The spinner spins both of the poi inside his or her arms at high speeds. This is done by spinning the poi 180 degrees out of phase with each other, therefore avoiding collisions of the poi heads. This makes a beautiful ring of light trail inside the spinners arms. Spinners must be careful and measure the length of the chain or rope on the poi correctly, so as not to accidentally hit themselves on the chin or on top of the head. The spinner can perform this move while bending backwards greater than 45 degree sometimes at degrees greater that bring the spinner into a limbo-like stance. =Stalls= Stalls are moves that \\"stall\\" the poi, making them appear to stop in midair. They are used to change direction and transition into other moves. It is done by spinning the poi, and then extending your arm in the direction perpendicular to the point at which you wish to stall. This can be done above the head, between the legs, behind the back, and to one side or the other. Stalls are a staple move in poi, and are versatile and easy to learn. =Isolations= Isolations refer to a class of moves where the poi handle is also spun in a circle, 180 degrees apart from the poi head. 'Perfect' isolation occurs when the poi handle and poi are moving in the same circle, and can usually create beautiful synchronized moves. Isolations can be done during a buzzsaw or in front of the body on a wall plane. =Extensions= Extensions are movements where the poi is in line with the arm, ie. is an extension of the arm. This move is mostly used in big circular arm movements. Hybrids are combinations of isolations and extensions. =Hyperloops= Hyperloops are movements where the poi ropes becomes entangled (twisted up) and then untangled, keeping the ends spinning the entire time.

The shield itself shows a maneapa beneath a blue sky on green grounds. Beneath the ground are stylised depictions in blue and gold of ocean waves. The coat of arms was approved by the College of Arms and granted by royal warrant on 3 December 1976. The motto is Tuvalu mo te Atua, Tuvaluan for \\"Tuvalu for the Almighty\\". This additionally serves as the title of the Tuvaluan national anthem. History The coat of arms of Tuvalu featured on the national flag of Tuvalu in 1995-1996 but the design which was introduced in those years proved to be unpopular. The old flag, featuring the British Union Flag in the canton and without the Tuvaluan coat of arms, was reinstated. The coat of arms is still featured on Tuvalu's state flag.

Rationale and procedure Authentication by legalization is widely used in international commerce and civil law matters in those jurisdictions where the simpler apostille system has not been adopted (e.g.: Canada, China). The procedure of legalization (also known as attestation or authentication, though these are essentially the same process) can be simply split into 3 stages, though each stage can vary in the amount of steps required: * Verification by the government of the issuing country * Verification by the Embassy of the destination country within the issuing country * A final verification of all steps within the destination country itself Broadly speaking, the aim of any international document authentication process is to solve a fundamentally practical problem: how can civil and judicial officials reliably verify the authenticity of a document that was issued abroad? Legalization attempts to solve this dilemma by creating a chain of authentications, each by a progressively higher government authority so as to ultimately narrow the point of contact between countries to a single designated official (usually in the national department responsible for foreign affairs). Therefore, by authenticating the signature and seal of this final official a foreign jurisdiction can authenticate the entire chain of verifications back to the entity responsible for issuing the original document without scrutinizing each \\"link\\" individually. For example, a Canadian individual who wishes to immigrate to Indonesia, both jurisdictions which are not party to the Hague Convention, must first authenticate their vital statistics documents with the appropriate provincial authority or Global Affairs Canada, then take those authenticated documents to be legalised at the Indonesian overseas mission with jurisdiction over their place of residence. This is not always the case vice versa, though. An Indonesian individual who wishes to immigrate to Canada does not need to do any such thing, as Canada does not make authentication of foreign public documents a requirement for their acceptance in the country. Apostille Convention The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement for Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents has supplanted legalization as the default procedure by a system of apostille. It is available if both the origin country of the document and the destination country are party to the treaty. The apostille is a stamp on which standard validating information is supplied. It is available (dependent on the document) from the competent authority of the origin country, and often the document has to be notarized before it can be apostilled. In the United States the Secretaries of State for the various states are the competent authorities who can apply an apostille. A list of the competent authorities designated by each country that has joined the treaty is maintained by the Hague Conference on Private International Law.

She documented slavery in the United States through a collection of interviews with ex-slaves in her book The House of Bondage, or Charlotte Brooks and Other Slaves, which was posthumously published in 1890. Life and work She was born Octavia Victoria Rogers in Oglethorpe, Georgia, where she lived in slavery until the emancipation. She attended Atlanta University where she studied to be a teacher. Octavia Rogers saw teaching as a form of worship and Christian service. She received her first teaching job in Montezuma, Georgia. In 1874, at around 21 years old, she married another teacher, Dr. Aristide Elphonso Peter Albert, and they had one daughter together, Laura T. Albert. In 1875 Octavia converted to the African Methodist Episcopal Church, a church under the ministry of Henry McNeal Turner, a Congressman and prominent political activist. After her conversion, she then taught because she saw teaching as a form of worship and as a part of her Christian service like her fellow contemporaries. While teaching in Montezuma, Georgia, both she and her husband became strong advocates for education and \\"American religion\\" as they used their home to teach reading and writing lessons. Her husband became an ordained minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1877. Shortly after the couple married, they moved to Houma, Louisiana. = The House of Bondage, or Charlotte Brooks and Other Slaves = In Houma, Louisiana, Octavia Albert began conducting interviews with men and women who were once enslaved. She met Charlotte Brooks for the first time in 1879 and decided to interview her later, along with other former slaves from Louisiana. These interviews were the raw material for her collection of narratives. Although most of the book focuses on the narrative of Charlotte Brooks, Albert also implemented the interviews from ex- slaves John Goodwin, Lorendo Goodwin, Lizzie Beaufort, Colonel Douglass Wilson, and a woman known as Hattie. Their interviews and experiences shaped her book The House of Bondage, or Charlotte Brooks and Other Slaves as a mix of slave stories that would expose the inhumanity of slavery and its effects on individuals. Albert's goal in writing her book was to tell the stories of slaves, their freedom, and adjustment into a changing society in order to \\"correct and create history.\\" The stories of Charlotte Brooks and the others would eventually be compiled into a book after Octavia's death, published in New York by Hunt and Eaton in 1890. Octavia Albert died on August 19, 1889, before The House of Bondage became widely known.

Kohat Division ! 3,211,458 ! ! ! }  History  In 1941, the area which today covers the division (excluding Orakzai and Kurram) was known as Kohat District. Kohat District was one of five trans-Indus districts in the North-West Frontier Province of British India. It was split into the Tehsils of Hangu, Kohat, and Teri. Here is a description of the area given by the Imperial Gazetteer of India. Kurram, on the other hand, was an agency in the province bordering Kohat District. It is also described in the Gazetteer. At that time, the area that would later become Orakzai District was an unadministered patch of land known as Tƒ´rƒÅh. Its description is below. At the time of the One Unit policy, Kohat District became a part of the then- much-larger Peshawar Division. When the policy ended, though, Kohat District stayed in the division. The area received full-fledged division status between the Pakistani censuses of 1981 and 1998, and during the same time period, Hangu Tehsil and Karak Tehsil (formerly Teri Tehsil) were also upgraded, to district status (becoming Hangu District and Lakki Marwat District). In August 2000, Kohat Division was abolished along with every other division in the country, but was reinstated (with all the other divisions of Pakistan) eight years later after the elections of 2008. In 2018, the 25th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan was passed by the Parliament of Pakistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. This entirely and fully merged the seven agencies of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the six Frontier Regions with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. With this merger, Kohat Division gained the agencies of Kurram and Orakzai, which became districts, and the Frontier Region Kohat (which was fully merged into Kohat District as Darra Adam Khel Subdivision).  Geography  Kohat Division has a total area of . Kurram and Karak Districts are the two largest districts in the division, having areas of and respectively. Together they make up about 55% of the area of the division. Kohat District, despite being the most populous, comes in as the third-largest district in the province with an area of . The two smaller districts of the division, Hangu (with an area of only ) and Orakzai (with an area of ) make up the interior of the division, wedged between the three larger districts to their west and east. The important Kurram River (a major tributary of the Indus River) begins in this division, in Kurram District. = Surrounding areas = To Kohat Division's northeast, you will find Peshawar Division, to the division's southwest, Bannu Division can be found. To the southeast of Kohat Division, the divisions of Sargodha and Rawalpindi in the province of Punjab can be found, and Kohat Division borders the country of Afghanistan to its northwest.  Demographics  As of the 2017 Census of Pakistan, the division had a population of 3,211,458, out of which there were 1,591,494 males, 1,619,908 females, and 57 people who identified as Transgender; this made the sex ratio of the division 982 males for every 1,000 females, and makes it very unique among the divisions of Pakistan and across all of South Asia, as in most of Pakistan and South Asia, males are the majority. The division had 355,594 households, making the average household size of the division 9.03, one of the highest in Pakistan; 463,732 people in the division lived in an urban area, but the majority (2,747,726) lived in a rural area, making the urbanization rate of the division a 14.43%, far below the national average Geographically, it is the fourth-largest division in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and has the fifth-largest (or third-smallest) population. It has a population density of , making it the second-least densely populated division in the province. Kohat Division had nine urbanized municipalities in 2017. Their names were (ordered by population) Kohat, Karak, Hangu, Sadda, Tall, Lachi, Doaba, Shakardara, and Parachinar. Kohat, the division's namesake and largest city, is situated in Kohat District and has over 200,000 inhabitants. Kohat is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's fourth-largest city and is a fast- growing city whose population grew at a rate of more than 3% every year between 1998 and 2017. Karak, Kohat Division's third-largest city, is the largest city and namesake of Karak District. Having a population just over 50,000, it is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's 24th largest city. Hangu, Kohat Division's second-largest city, is the largest city and namesake of Hangu District. Having a population just under 50,000, it is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's 27th largest city. In 1998, Hangu was larger than Karak, but due to Karak's fast growth, has been overtaken. Sadda, in Kurram District, is the fourth-largest city in Kohat Division, with about 35,000 inhabitants. It was the second-largest city in the now-defunct Federally Administered Tribal Areas and is the 40th largest city in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is a fast-growing city (with a population growth rate of 3.75% every year between 1998 and 2017, which means its population more than doubled during that period) and is more than six times larger than Parachinar, Kurram District's administrative district capital. Orakzai District is the only district in the division without a single urbanized area. It is entirely rural. The division has one cantonment, the Kohat Cantonment, adjacent to the city of Kohat which had a population of 36,935, making up the division's entire military population. This made 1.15% of the entire population of the division active military personnel. In 1998, the dominant language in the division was Pashto, with over 90% of the population speaking it as their mother tongue. Punjabi is spoken by about 1% of the population, and Urdu and Saraiki are spoken by about 0.35% and 0.3% of the population respectively. Of the remaining 5% of the population, most are suspected to speak the Kohati dialect of Hindko (a language for which official statistics were not collected in 1998), which was predominant in urban Kohat more than a century ago.

Before 2018, the Kurram Agency (now Kurram District), the Orakzai Agency (now Orakzai District), and the Frontier Region Kohat were not a part of Kohat Division, but were a part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, then outside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. :B. There were only three constituencies solely inside Kohat Division at the time of the 2018 Pakistani general election, but there was a fourth constituency, NA-51, that was made of regions from different divisions. NA-51 covered the Frontier Region Kohat in Kohat Division, but the area only makes up 33.15% of the population of the constituency and 3.69% of the population of the division, so it is omitted in the infobox. That seat was won by Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal. :C. At the time of the 2018 Pakistani general election, Kohat District sent three representatives to the KPK Assembly and Hangu District and Karak District sent two each, but elections were held a year later (in 2019) in the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that were formerly part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. At the time of the 2019 elections, Kurram District elected two representatives, and Orakzai District elected one representative, which add up to ten for the entire division.

Running between Ilford and City Thameslink station, it is operated by Stagecoach London. As of 2017 it was the busiest bus route in London. History AEC Regent III RT on Bond Street in August 1955 East London Mercedes-Benz O530G on Cheapside in April 2007 Tower Transit Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvo B9TL in Stratford in July 2015 Route 25 began operation on 30 October 1910 between Old Ford and Victoria via Bank, Holborn, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly, the same routing as today's route 8. On 20 June 1912, routes 8 and 25 exchanged their eastern branches at Bank, with route 25 taking over what has become its traditional route from Seven Kings to Victoria. By the end of the World War I, route 25 was working daily between Seven Kings Garage and Victoria, with a Sunday 25A route from Chadwell Heath to Victoria. During the 1920s, London's bus transport expanded rapidly, and route 25 soon had gained 25B, 25C and 25D suffixed routes. On 1 December 1924, many routes in the group were renumbered, with 25A becoming 125, 25B changing to 26, 25C to 126 and the 25D becoming route 145. This situation remained until 3 October 1934, when the newly constituted London Passenger Transport Board instituted its own numbering system, which generally re-instated the situation previous to December 1924, apart for route 145, which by then had developed into a self-contained route, thereby keeping its route number. Each route ran every 6 minutes on Mondays to Fridays, providing 40 buses per hour on the common sections; the routes were operated from garages in Seven Kings, Forest Gate, Upton Park and Hammersmith on route 25. From 4 September 1982, the route was revised to run in two overlapping sections, Ilford to Victoria and Becontree Heath to Aldgate; the latter section being renumbered 225, albeit running to Limehouse instead of Aldgate. Both routes were AEC Routemaster operated, however Route 225 was created purely as a means of converting the eastern end of what was route 25 to one man operation which took place under the next programme of changes on 23 April 1983 using Leyland Titans from Seven Kings and West Ham garages. On 16 January 1988, route 25 (now Ilford to Victoria) was converted to one man operation. This rendered the use of route number 225 superfluous and consequently the whole service was renumbered back to 25, albeit still running in overlapping sections. The route was allocated to the East London division of London Buses in April 1989. On 18 July 1992 the route was curtailed at Oxford Circus, with the section to Victoria becoming part of route 8. On 20 March 1993, the route was withdrawn from Becontree Heath and curtailed at Ilford Hainault Street and also Saturday and Sunday services were diverted via Cannon Street.http://www.londonbuses.co.uk/_routes/current/025.html When next tendered, the route returned to East London (by now part of Stagecoach London) on 26 June 2004.Bus tender results Route 25/N26 Transport for London 18 December 2003 The weekend diversion to Tower Hill was withdrawn.

Three such vehicles ran on the route in addition to the regular articulated vehicles. Some of these also appeared on the RV1 (which has since stopped operation).

It was designated as a Grade I listed structure in 1953.Nelson's monument, Great Yarmouth, British Listed Buildings, accessed 20 June 2016. History Designed by architect William Wilkins, it was raised in the period 1817‚Äì19 from money raised by a committee of local magnates. The first custodian of the monument was former Able Seaman James Sharman, a member of the crew of HMS Victory from Norfolk and one of those who carried Nelson below decks after he was shot. The monument, correctly called the Norfolk Naval Pillar, is in the style of a Doric column topped by six caryatid figures that support a statue of Britannia proudly standing atop a globe inscribed with the motto from Nelson's coat of arms Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat (translates to 'Let him who has merited it take the palm'), she holds an olive branch in her outstretched right hand, a trident in her left and looks inland ‚Äì said to be towards Nelson's birthplace in Burnham Thorpe in Norfolk. The whole monument is high, compared to for the monument in Trafalgar Square and the top is reached by some two hundred and seventeen steps. The structure was completely restored in time for the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar in 2005. In 2006 it was removed from English Heritage's Buildings At Risk register. In August 2006 it was rededicated. It currently stands, albeit separated in its own small railed plot, in an industrial estate. The monument is open to the public on a limited basis.Website In the late nineteenth century, the original synthetic Coade Stone caryatids were replaced with concrete replicas. The figure of Britannia and the six caryatids were replaced by a fibreglass copy in 1982.

The newly demarcated area was a Trans-Indus district called Mardan District. It consisted of two tehsils, Mardan Tehsil and Swabi Tehsil, which would later become the two districts that make up Mardan Division today. This setup continued until One Unit, a geopolitical policy that abolished the provinces making up West Pakistan and consolidated West Pakistan into one province. After the One Unit policy ended in 1970 and the provinces returned with their original forms, the divisions that had been created as a result of the policy stayed in the North-West Frontier Province, which meant Mardan District stayed in Peshawar Division. The area received full-fledged division status between the Pakistani censuses of 1981 and 1998, and during the same time period, Swabi Tehsil was also upgraded, to district status (becoming Swabi District). In August 2000, the division was abolished along with every other division in the country, but was reinstated (with all the other divisions of Pakistan) eight years later after the elections of 2008.

The division had 526,077 households, making the average household size of the division 7.60; 715,250 people in the division lived in an urban area, but the vast majority (3,282,427) lived in a rural area, making the urbanization rate of the division 17.89% While geographically, it is the smallest division in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it is the most densely populated, with a population density of , making it the fourth-most populated division in the province. The largest city in Mardan Division is its namesake, Mardan. Mardan had a population of 358,604 in 2017 and was the second-largest city in the entire province (after Peshawar) at the time. Swabi was the second-largest city in the division, and it had a population of 123,412 and was the eighth- largest city in the province. The next three most-populous cities in the division were Takht-i-Bahi, in Mardan District, with a population of 80,721, Topi, in Swabi District, with a population of 52,983, and Tordher, in Swabi District, with a population of 41,420. The whole division had seven municipalities in 2017, with five of them being concentrated in Swabi District. The division has one cantonment, the Mardan Cantonment, adjacent to the city of Mardan which had a population of 6,871, making up the division's entire military population.

Here is a description of the area given by the Imperial Gazetteer of India. North Waziristan, on the other hand, was an agency in the province bordering Bannu District. It is also described in the Gazetteer. After independence, Bannu District became a part of the then-much-larger Dera Ismail Khan Division.

This entirely and fully merged the seven agencies of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the six Frontier Regions with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. With this merger, Bannu Division gained the agency of North Waziristan, which became a district, the Frontier Region Bannu (which was fully merged into Bannu District as Wazir Subdivision), and the Frontier Region Lakki Marwat (which was fully merged into Lakki Marwat District as Bettani Subdivision).

This was the highest household size in the country in 2017. 143,746 people in the division lived in an urban area, but the overwhelming majority (2,513,055) lived in a rural area, making the urbanization rate of the division a mere 9.46% While geographically, it is the third-smallest division in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it is the least populated, with a population density of , making it the third-least densely populated division in the province. Bannu Division had four urbanized areas in 2017, the lowest amount out of any division in the entire province, and its most populous city, Lakki Marwat, had a population of 59,465, and that made it the smallest city in the province that was classified as the largest city of its own division, and it only was the 20th largest city in the entire province. Bannu, the namesake of the division, in Bannu District, was the second-largest city in the division and the 25th largest in the province, with a population of 49,965. The city of Bannu, though, was the largest city in the division, in 1998, but its population stagnated throughout the period of time between 1998 and 2017, growing only 0.25% every year. The other two urbanized areas in the province are the town of Naurang of Lakki Marwat District, with a population of 29,955, and the only urbanized area in North Waziristan District (and the whole region of Waziristan), Miranshah, which had a population of 4,361 in 2017. The division has one cantonment, the Bannu Cantonment, adjacent to the city of Bannu which had a population of 8,320, making up the division's entire military population. This made 0.31% of the entire population of the division active military personnel.

That seat was won by Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal. :C. At the time of the 2018 Pakistani general election, Bannu District sent four representatives to the KPK Assembly and Lakki Marwat District sent three, but elections were held a year later (in 2019) in the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that were formerly part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. At the time of the 2019 elections, North Waziristan elected two representatives, which add up to nine for the entire division. Once again, though, there was another constituency, PK-115, that was made of regions from different divisions. PK-115 (just like NA-51) covered the Frontier Region Bannu and the Frontier Region Lakki Marwat in Bannu Division, but together those areas only make up 19.42% of the population of the constituency and 2.61% of the population of the division, so it is omitted in the infobox.

Agencies offering this level of training under this title include Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), and Scuba Schools International (SSI). Other agencies offer similar training under different titles. Advanced Open Water Diver is one step up from entry level certification as a beginner autonomous scuba diver. A major difference between Autonomous diver equivalent Open Water Diver (OWD) certification and AOWD is that the depth limit is increased from . Prerequisite certification level for AOWD training is OWD or a recognized equivalent (ISO 24801-2). Certification requirements for AOWD includes theory learning and assessment, practical training and assessment, and a minimum requirement for number of logged dives, that varies between agencies. SSI requires 24 logged dives. PADI requires 5 dives on course, and the prerequisite is OWD which requires 4 open water dives. No additional logged dives are specified. Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI Equivalent certification The equivalent course offered by National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) is the Advanced Scuba Diver. As a second level qualification, the AOWD certification level is aimed somewhere between the CMAS * Diver and CMAS ** Diver qualifications, or between the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) Ocean Diver and Sports Diver qualifications, although some differences occur. For example, BSAC Ocean Divers are trained in basic rescue skills for recreational diving, but only need five open water dives to qualify. Scuba Diving International (SDI) offers an Advanced Adventure Diver course similar to the Advanced Open Water Diver courses. The World Underwater Federation, CMAS, recognizes four main levels of dive education indicated by a one star, two star, three star, or four star designation. One star indicates an ability to dive in the company of an experienced diver, two star indicates additional skills and the ability to dive with a diver of the same grade, three star indicates the additional skill in leading a group of divers of any grade in open water. Four star diver is an award issued by a national technical committee to a diver competent to use divers and diving in order to achieve major tasks or project objectives.  Purpose  The whole PADI training system. The AOWD is the second level qualification offered by several diving agencies following the American ANSI standard. At the first level, Open Water Diver, divers gain basic knowledge of skills, equipment and theory for diving to a recommended depth of about . The AOWD is described by PADI as refining these skills, allowing the diver to explore a broader variety of diving to a maximum depth of . Prior to starting an AOWD course, some organizations have prerequisites for a particular number of logged dives. The course usually contains some mandatory dives and knowledge while another portion of the course consists of free elective topics such as drift diving or search and recovery.  Certification standards  The PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course requires a single instance of an Underwater navigation and a Deep diving activity as well as a single instance of three of the remaining topics from a list of approximately 18 possible specialties. Until 1998, night diving was also mandatory, but this is no longer the case. It was dropped at the request of the Scandinavian countries, for whom there is almost no night during the summer months when most of the diving is done, as it created an unreasonable restriction on certifying advanced divers (which is a prerequisite for further training). Most other countries still recommend the night diver course. According to PADI, the Advanced Open Water Diver course is for divers who want to gain more underwater experience while diving with a PADI Professional, or have fun learning new things. In addition to logging more dives, the student can improve skills learned during their open water diver course, such as navigation and buoyancy. The SSI Advanced Open Water program requires training and diving experience. To be certified as a SSI AOWD one needs to have completed four specialty courses and minimum of 24 logged dives. In the absence of a logged dives requirement, it is possible to become certified as AOW with some other agencies while having less than 10 lifetime dives.  Issues  The name of this specific training level has been a topic of controversy within the diving community for many years. The crux of this debate is in the interpretation of the word 'Advanced' in its title, and what is the proper application or use of this adjective. One school of thought on the matter defends the use of the word Advanced, explaining that it is describing the training accurately as being more comprehensive (i.e., more advanced) than the basic entry level training. The opposing school of thought is that the use of the word 'Advanced' is essentially deceptive marketing, as graduates of the class very commonly then refer to themselves as \\"Advanced Divers\\". However, the training standards are not sufficient to raise a recreational diver (particularly the novice diver to whom the class is frequently marketed) to traditional expectations of holistic dive mastery. This is relevant because in the USA the diving community continues to equate 'advanced' with 'expert.' As such, while it is agreed that the training is indeed more than basic, it is insufficient to create an Advanced (i.e., Expert) Diver. Specifically with regard to the PADI 'Advanced' certification standard, a 2006 coroner's court in the United Kingdom heard expert evidence to the effect that \\"I do not believe that someone with eight dives should be classified as an advanced diver. It is madness.\\" A related matter is NAUI's name changes from \\"Open Water II\\" to \\"Advanced Scuba Diver.\\" NAUI's program was, at the time, a 38 hr. Open Water I course, followed by a six dive Open Water II course (aka \\"Sport Diver\\"), followed by the third course in the sequence, \\"Advanced Diver.\\" At the time, PADI had a similar progression. Then, PADI eliminated its upper level course (Advanced Open Water Diver) and repurposed the title for its middle course to gain a competitive advantage. NAUI followed suit, in an unsuccessful attempt to maintain market share. Publicly, NAUI claimed that this change was intended to address customer confusion as to the comparative rigors of training required to earn specific certifications.

It is surrounded on the north by the villages of Woolstone and Oxenton, and to the south by Woodmancote and Bishop's Cleeve, a very large urban village. Gotherington has a population of around 1,200, while its neighbour, Bishops Cleeve, has a population of 15,000 (including celebrity chef Martin Bettan).Gotherington Parish Council - History The populations reduced at the 2011 census to 995 for Gotherington. History It is believed that Gotherington was founded in about 780 A.D. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Godrinton, and was for around six centuries split into Upper Gotherington and Lower Gotherington. It was a strongly agricultural area until the mid-nineteenth century, from which point market gardening increased in its place. Development of the village began in the 1880s when the village was one of the first to have its own rural nurse that had been organised by Elizabeth Malleson. The village school opened in 1881 and a post office in 1894. The local Parish Council was formed in the same year. Gotherington railway station opened in 1906 and closed in 1955. However, it is open on rare occasions and for private hire. It has recently been restored by a private owner, and a halt built on the neighbouring Gloucestershire Warwickshire RailwayGWR- Gloucestershire's Main Heritage Railway - Gotherington this links to the Cheltenham Racecourse. Unfortunately a Landslide on Nottingham hill meant there had to be repairs done to the track near Manor Lane in Gotherington and only part of the track was open for sometime, but it was fully opened once again in 2011. Various trains use this line other than the main steam train for certain events such as thomas the tank engine weekends and the occasional Diesel Engined Train.

It was inspected by Ofsted in March 2009, who rated every single aspect as \\"outstanding\\". The sole area noted as needing improvement was the library provision. Nearby is the Rex Rhodes building, housing the Garden House Nursery School, and an after school club for the children of Gotherington school. The Village Hall hosts a regular Parent and Toddler group for young families. The first school in the village was opened in 1881. Sport The village has several sports opportunities, with locals fielding cricket and football teams, with Cheltenham North rugby club nearby and playing fields behind the village hall. It is home to the Battens Bruisers rivals. Churches = Anglican (Church of England) = As is common in the Church of England, Gotherington is part of a complex structure of rural parishes. The overall benefice of Bishop's Cleeve and Woolstone with Gotherington and Oxenton is made up of two ecclesiastical parishes - Bishop's Cleeve, and Woolstone with Gotherington and Oxenton. The parish of Woolstone with Gotherington and Oxenton encompasses the tiny villages of Woolstone and Oxenton as well as Gotherington. There are two church buildings - St Martin de Tours at Woolstone, and St John the Baptist at Oxenton - but there is no Anglican church building in Gotherington even though most of the population live there. To redress this imbalance, services are held from time to time in Gotherington Village Hall (see the link below for details.) = Gotherington Free Church = Prior to 2000 there was a Free Church in Gotherington. The building is still there but at the time of writing its future, and the question of any free church ministry in the village, is uncertain. Local Services Despite being a relatively small village Gotherington is served by a local shop, Gotherington Stores, which also has a tea room and carries the village's post office. The village also has a pub, The Shutter Inn. Many houses in the village of Gotherington are old and original, with some new houses being built adjacent to the local pub, and others clad in local stone clustered around the school. The children's recreation area has been upgraded to meet the needs of all age groups. A gardening club, wine club and community group are also active. Gotherington railway station is located on the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. The village is served by bus companies Stagecoach West and Swanbrook.Gotherington Parish Council - Transport information Governance The village falls in the 'Oxenton Hill' electoral ward.

Schirripa as Bobby Baccalieri * = credit only =Guest starring= Synopsis At Junior's trial, Bobby carefully chooses a juror who wears a wedding ring. Eugene and Dogsy intimidate him with carefully chosen words. Little Carmine returns to New Jersey to talk to Carmine and Johnny about reducing their claim on Tony for a share of the HUD scam. Carmine will not bend. Johnny later meets Tony and Silvio and offers a minor compromise; Tony rejects it and orders Little Paulie, who takes two others with him, to vandalize Carmine's new restaurant. Carmine uses his union influence to shut down work at the warehouse project. Tony decides to wait the dispute out, expecting the financial losses on both sides will quickly force Carmine into a compromise. Johnny and Tony meet in secret; Johnny says Carmine's decisions lighten his pockets and, to Tony's astonishment, obliquely suggests that they collaborate to kill him. Paulie has an angry confrontation with Silvio, who tells him his earnings are low and Tony is beginning to doubt his loyalty. He runs into Carmine and greets him effusively; he is shocked as he realizes that Carmine has no idea who he is. He learns that his mother's friend Minn keeps all her savings under her mattress. He breaks into her house thinking she is out, but she stumbles upon him in her bedroom and he suffocates her with a pillow. He goes to Tony, greets him effusively, and gives him a large envelope of cash. They smile at each other, on good terms again. Carmela visits Furio's house, alone, to discuss decorating; it seems they are going to kiss, but they are interrupted by one of her father's contractors. They make a \\"date\\" to choose the tiles of the house together. With Tony and other members of the crew, Furio visits an Indian casino in Connecticut. While most of the others carouse, he stands aloof. Later, as the drunken crew prepare to board the casino's helicopter for the flight home, Furio grabs Tony and appears barely able to restrain himself from shoving him into the spinning tail rotor. He tells the baffled Tony he was standing too close to the blades. The next morning, he does not appear to collect Tony, who cannot clearly remember what happened the previous evening. Furio has abruptly returned to Italy. Tony complains that he has lost one of his key men. Carmela becomes unhappy and bad-tempered. A family dinner to meet Meadow's new boyfriend, Finn DeTrolio, dispirits her. She is shocked by the notion that there are homosexual themes in Billy Budd, the book A.J. is studying, and argues about it with Meadow and her roommates. The antagonism spills over into their next meeting, a mother- daughter birthday meal. A.J. tells Meadow about their mother's visits to Furio; he does not understand what they imply, but she does. Tony asks her to treat her mother more gently. When Tony asks Carmela if seeing Meadow turning into a \\"smart, beautiful, independent woman\\" is not all she ever wanted, she stares into a wall and answers in an emotionless tone of voice, \\"Yes.\\" First appearance * Finn DeTrolio: Meadow's new boyfriend, who is looking to go to dental school. Deceased * Minn Matrone: suffocated by Paulie Walnuts after he attempted to steal her money and she caught him in the act. Final appearance * \\"Eloise\\" marks the final appearance of the character Furio Giunta, a DiMeo crime family soldier imported from Annalisa Zucca's Camorra family in Italy. Furio is only mentioned in future episodes. Title reference * The title refers to the portrait Eloise at the Plaza Hotel, which is based on the books of the same name. Carmela and Meadow have a tradition, mentioned in the pilot episode, of eating lunch while seated in front of this painting.

Named for its pale coloration, it is closely related to the relatively common shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus), but is much larger, averaging between in length and in weight at maturity. This species takes 15 years to mature and spawns infrequently, but can live up to a century. A member of the sturgeon family, Acipenseridae, which originated during the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago, the pallid sturgeon has changed little since then. In 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service placed the pallid sturgeon on its endangered species list because few young individuals had been observed in the preceding decade and sightings had greatly diminished; the species is now rarely seen in the wild. It was the first fish species in the Missouri River drainage area to be listed as endangered, and a loss of its habitat is thought to be responsible for its decline. The vast majority of the Missouri River drainage system has been channeled and dammed, reducing the gravel deposits and slow-moving side channels that are its favored spawning areas. Until the middle of the 20th century, pallid sturgeon were common and anglers found catching such a large fish in fresh water a rewarding experience. The species is considered to be good-tasting, and its eggs have been used as caviar, although less commonly than those of many other sturgeon. Efforts to prevent the species from becoming extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is to survive in the wild.  Taxonomy and etymology  Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson classified the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in the genus Parascaphirhynchus and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all sturgeon worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which may soon become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has only one other genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by three species found in west-central Asia. The word pallid means \\"deficient in color\\", and compared to other species of sturgeon, the pallid is noticeably paler. The scientific name for the fish is derived from Scaphirhynchus, a Greek word meaning \\"spade snout\\" and albus which is Latin for \\"white\\".  Biology  = DNA studies = To better protect the pallid sturgeon from extinction, research on its DNA and that of other closely related species was conducted to assess the differences within various populations of pallid sturgeon, and the differences between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. Early DNA research indicated that pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon were a single species. However, a 2000 study comparing DNA sequences in the three members of the genus Scaphirhynchus(pallid, shovelnose, and Alabama sturgeon) showed that the three are distinct species. Between 2001 and 2006, several studies examined two populations of pallid sturgeon located in the upper Great Plains section of the Missouri River and compared them to a southern population located in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana. These DNA studies concluded that the northern populations of pallid sturgeon are reproductively isolated and are genetically distinct from the Atchafalaya population. However, the genetic variability among pallid sturgeon was found to be far less than that between them and the shovelnose sturgeon. Another reason for DNA testing was to determine the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, but based on the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear to be the result of pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males. = Physical characteristics = Detail and measurement of head of a hatchery-raised pallid sturgeon The pallid sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in North America. They are generally between in length and weigh as much as . The species is ancient and has remained virtually unchanged for 70 million years, since the Cretaceous period. The pallid sturgeon has a distinctive appearance that has been referred to as \\"primitive\\", \\"dinosaur-like\\" and even \\"ugly\\". Although visually similar, the shovelnose sturgeon is much smaller and usually weighs no more than . Pallid sturgeon are much paler in coloration with grayish white backs and sides, while shovelnose sturgeon are brown. Pallid sturgeon turn whiter as they age and younger specimens are easily confused with adult shovelnose sturgeon since they are similar in color. Like the shovelnose sturgeon, their tails are heterocercal, with the top tail fin being longer than the bottom fin, though this is more pronounced in pallid sturgeon. As with other sturgeon, pallid sturgeon lack the scales or bones found in more \\"modern\\" species of fish. Instead, they have cartilaginous skeletons with five rows of thick cartilage plates that extend along their sides, undersides, and backs, as well as over most of the head. These thick cartilage plates are covered by the skin and serve as a protective armor. The bony cartilage also extends along the backside, from the dorsal fin to the tail. The pallid sturgeon's snout and head are longer than that of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their extendable mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels is one of the best ways to distinguish the two species. = Reproduction and lifecycle = The immature larva of a pallid sturgeon being raised in a fish hatchery Pallid sturgeon have a long lifespan, living in excess of 50 and perhaps as long as 100 years. They lack bones and scales, which makes it more difficult to establish their age and determine exactly how long they live. As is true for many long-lived species, pallid sturgeon reach reproductive maturity relatively late. Males reach sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 7 years, while females are believed to become capable of reproduction when they are at least 15 years old. One study of nine females indicated that they begin egg development between the ages of 9 and 12 years, but do not reach reproductive maturity until they are 15 years old. Reproduction does not take place every year; the average interval between spawnings is three years, although other studies suggest an interval as long as 10 years. Spawning usually takes place May to July. Prior to the construction of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of the hundreds of thousands of eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood. For several decades, no natural reproduction of pallid sturgeon was observed, since all the fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.  Ecology  = Distribution = The pallid sturgeon's historical range spanned the entire Missouri River and into the Mississippi River. Historically, the species was rare to nonexistent in the upper Mississippi, probably due to a lack of proper habitat. Currently, the species is considered imperiled throughout its entire range. As of 2008, pallid sturgeon can still be found throughout their original range, but their population numbers have severely declined from the mid-20th century. The Missouri and Mississippi rivers from Montana to Louisiana, as well as the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, continue to harbor an aging population of pallid sturgeon. Pallid sturgeon have never been very common; as early as 1905 when the species was first identified, they represented only one in five of all sturgeon in the lower Missouri River and as few as one in 500 where the Illinois River meets the Mississippi. Between 1985 and 2000, the ratio of pallid sturgeon to all sturgeon netted declined from one in about 400 to one in nearly 650. A 1996 study concluded that between 6,000 and 21,000 pallid sturgeon remained in their natural habitat at that time. Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) showing siphoning feeding behaviour Six areas were studied for wild pallid sturgeon population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS has referred to these six areas of wild population studies as \\"recovery priority management areas\\" (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the Marias River in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of Lake Sakakawea, and the lower Yellowstone River up to the confluence of the Tongue River, Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the Niobrara River to Lewis and Clark Lake along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during the study period. Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total. = Habitat = Pallid sturgeon prefer moderate to swift river currents and most captured specimens have been recovered in rivers and streams in which the current averages between . They also prefer turbid waterways and water depths between . The species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful, but also lives in predominately rocky waterways. Pallid sturgeon prefer swift river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon. In a study based in Montana and North Dakota conducted on both the pallid and shovelnose sturgeon, both species were fitted with radio transmitters so researchers could track their swimming habits. Pallid sturgeon were found to prefer wider river channels, midchannel sandbars, and numerous islands, and were most commonly recorded in water depths between . The study also showed that the pallid sturgeon moved as much as per day and up to . Pallid sturgeon are believed to have preferred the muddy and generally warmer waters that existed prior to Missouri River dam construction. = Food preferences = Pallid sturgeon are generally bottom feeders, skimming the sandy reaches of the various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though little is known about the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.  Conservation  USFWS employees release a pallid sturgeon into the Yellowstone River Though never believed to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government and most of the states with pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure the survival of the species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar. The route and the environmental characteristics of Missouri River in the northern Great Plains states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent upstream migration. The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought an end to the seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged. These alterations of the river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species. In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered. Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades. = Species preservation efforts = Two populations of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both at risk of extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations in Montana will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15 years of age, recovery efforts in Montana will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to five years to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done in an effort to restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species. Surgical implant of a radio transmitter in a sexually mature pallid sturgeon In Nebraska, a small number of pallid sturgeon have been captured along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River. The lower reaches of the Platte River, a more than stretch from the Elkhorn River to its confluence with the Missouri River, has suitable spawning habitat for pallid sturgeon, although no conclusive evidence has been found that spawning is occurring in this region. Along with the lower Yellowstone River, the lower Platte River was identified as one of the best of the remaining regions with the potential for the natural spawning. In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms section of the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid sturgeon larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50 years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently being used by the larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River. In 2007, the USFWS concluded that hatchery-based reproduction efforts should be continued, along with monitoring of any population changes, to determine the effectiveness of human intervention. The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's ability to protect people from harmful and destructive flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.

History La Turbie was famous in Roman times for the large monument, the Trophy of Augustus, that Augustus made to celebrate his victory over the Ligurian tribes of the area. During the Middle Ages, the village (called then Turbia) was mainly under the dominion of the Republic of Genoa. Dante wrote in his Divina Commedia that Turbia was the western limit of the Italian Liguria. It was alternatively part of Savoy or the Principality of Monaco, from where the population of Turbia has assimilated the dialect Monegasque, even if the local Ligurian dialect has maintained some characteristics of the nearby Ni√ßois of Nice. Actually the local dialect is nearly extinct, mainly after the 1860 inclusion of the Savoian County of Nice in France. On 13 September 1982, Princess Grace de Monaco was killed in a fatal car accident at La Turbie. The commune formerly included the communes of Beausoleil and Cap d'Ail, which was disestablished at the beginning of the 20th century. Only the old main town, around the remaining structure of the Roman Trophy of Augustus, forms the current commune. Geography The boundaries of La Turbie were formerly more extensive and included the territory now contained in the town of Beausoleil, formerly known as Haut-Monte-Carlo, owing to its proximity to Monaco. The commune of La Turbie retains a smaller, common boundary with part of the Principality. La Turbie can be reached either from Cap d'Ail on the coast or the Grand Corniche. Within the town is the Trophy of Augustus, also known as the Troph√©e des Alpes.

History  Disability activism as volunteerism and parent-oriented organizations such as the March of Dimes began in the 1950s. Disabled children were largely hidden by their parents out of fear of forced rehabilitation. In the 1960s, disability advocates joined the growing civil rights movement and women‚Äôs rights movements to promote equal treatment and challenge stereotypes and generalizations, and dsability rights advocacy began to have a cross-disability focus. People with different kinds of disabilities (physical and mental disabilities, along with sight and hearing disabilities) and different needs came together to fight for a common cause. In psychiatry, since the 1970s, self-advocacy and patient empowerment have been emphasized. This emphasis started to advocate for changes in the delivery of services and to encourage patients to take a more active role in their own care. In the UK, self-advocacy, which followed years of parents' and professionals' advocacy on behalf of people with learning disabilities, is said to have started in 1984 with funding of People First London Boroughs following the attendance of a small number of learning-disabled people at and international conference held in the US.In the late 1980s, the concept of self-advocacy gained acceptance in influential circles, due to the work of organizations such as Kings Fund, and in the arts, academia and publishing world due to the work of organizations like Yorkshire Arts Circus and academics. Self-advocacy started to attract serious studies, one of the most notable being Ken Simons‚Äô Sticking up for Ourselves. Jim Sinclair is credited as the first person to communicate the anti-cure or autism rights perspective in the late 1980s. In 1992, Sinclair co-founded Autism Network International (ANI), which publishes newsletters \\"written by and for autistic people\\" with Donna Williams and Kathy Grant, who knew Sinclair through pen pal lists and autism conferences. The first issue of the ANI newsletter Our Voice was distributed online in November 1992 to an audience of mostly neurotypical professionals and parents of young autistic children. The number of autistic people in the organization slowly grew and ANI became a communication network for like-minded autistic people. In 1996, ANI established a yearly retreat and conference for autistic people, which was known as \\"Autreat\\" and was held in the United States.Sinclair, Jim. History of ANI . Retrieved 12 November 2005. The theme of the first conference in 1996 was \\"Celebrating Autistic Culture\\" and had close to 60 participants. The success of Autreat later inspired similar autistic retreats, such as the Association for Autistic Community's conference, Autspace, in the US; Autscape in the UK; and Projekt Empowerment in Sweden. In 1996, Martijn Dekker, an autistic computer programmer from the Netherlands, launched an email list called \\"Independent Living on the Autism Spectrum (InLv). The list also welcomed those with \\"cousin\\" conditions, such as ADHD, dyslexia, and dyscalculia. American writer Harvey Blume was a member of the list;he described it as embracing \\"neurological pluralism\\" in a 1997 article in The New York Times. Blume discussed the concept of \\"neurological diversity\\" with Australian sociologist Judy Singer. The term \\"neurodiversity\\" was first published in Singer's 1998 Honours thesis and in Blume's 1998 article in The Atlantic. Blume was an early self-advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement. In 2004, autistic researcher Michelle Dawson challenged applied behavior analysis (ABA) on ethical grounds. She testified in Auton v. British Columbia against the British Columbian government's mandatory funding of ABA.Collier, Roger. \\"Autism\\". The Ottawa Citizen (2007-12-01). Retrieved on 2008-02-17. The same year, The New York Times covered the autism self-advocacy perspective by publishing Amy Harmon's article, \\"How about not curing us? Some autistics are pleading.\\" The rise of the Internet has provided more opportunities for disabled and neurodivergent people to connect and organize. Considering the geographical distance, communication and speech patterns of neurodivergent people and the domination of neurotypical and able-bodied professionals, and family members in established organizations, the Internet has provided a valuable space for self-advocates to organize and communicate. Criticism The potential for self-advocacy to lead to overconfidence and ignorance or dismissal of crucial or otherwise relevant facts has been debated. The discussion about democracy in medicine met claims the public cannot know about everything so experts are needed to produce knowledge on behalf of the public and make decisions for them; the public cannot make wrong decisions due to a lack of complete knowledge on the subject. This view renders the public unable to further academic research interests or shape academics' intellectual ideas and democracy as the public electing a party in charge that makes decisions for them. Deborah Lupton said there are disadvantages for patients responding with greater levels of self-advocacy; she said in cases of intense suffering and the possibility of death, the doctor accepting an authoritative, controlling role may be important as a form of comfort. According to Lupton, trust in doctors and faith in their expert knowledge is needed to comfort extremely ill people. In their research on thirty-two women wanting to know about how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could relieve menopausal symptoms, Henwood, Wyatt, Hart and Smith challenged the claim the internet is able to promote self-advocacy. According to them, becoming self-advocate educated on the internet requires having the skills to access this information, and some knowledge to distinguish the usefulness of different types of information and decipher what information is valid. Patients' strategies for searching for information on the internet were unsystematic.

They are intended to discover pharmacological effects and identify any adverse reactions the vaccines may achieve in humans. Current status of H5N1 candidate vaccines Candidate vaccines were developed in the United States and the United Kingdom during 2003 for protection against the strain that was isolated from humans in Hong Kong in February 2003 but the 2003 strain died out in 2004 making the vaccine of little use. In April 2004, WHO made an H5N1 prototype seed strain available to manufacturers. In August 2006, WHO changed the prototype strains and now offers three new prototype strains which represent three of the six subclades of the clade 2 virus which have been responsible for many of the human cases that have occurred since 2005. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) awarded H5N1 vaccine contracts to Aventis Pasteur (now Sanofi Pasteur) of Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, and to Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, California. Each manufacturer is using established techniques in which the virus is grown in eggs and then inactivated and further purified before being formulated into vaccines. \\"A universal influenza vaccine could provide protection against all types of influenza and would eliminate the need to develop individual vaccines to specific H and N virus types. Such a vaccine would not need to be reengineered each year and could protect against an emergent pandemic strain. Developing a universal vaccine requires that researchers identify conserved regions of the influenza virus that do not exhibit antigenic variability by strain or over time. A universal vaccine, ACAM-FLU-A, is being developed by the British company Acambis and is being researched by others as well. Acambis (meanwhile also acquired by Sanofi Pasteur) announced in early August 2005 that it has had successful results in animal testing. The vaccine focuses on the M2 viral protein, which does not change, rather than the surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins targeted by traditional flu vaccines. The universal vaccine is made through bacterial fermentation technology, which would greatly speed up the rate of production over that possible with culture in chicken eggs, plus the vaccine could be produced constantly, since its formulation would not change. Still, such a vaccine is years away from full testing, approval, and use.\\"CIDRAP article Pandemic Influenza - Last updated June 16, 2011 As of July 2007, phase I clinical trials on humans are underway in which a vaccine that focuses on the M2 viral protein \\"is being administered to a small group of healthy people in order to verify the safety of the product and to provide an initial insight into the vaccine‚Äôs effect on the human immune system.\\"eurekalert article Universal flu vaccine being tested on humans published July 17, 2007 (See also Universal flu vaccines) The current development state of ACAM-FLU-A is unclear.

By Marie-Eve Laforte =Results of trials= Early results from H5N1 clinical trials showed poor immunogenicity compared to the 15-mcg dose that induces immunity in a seasonal flu vaccine. Trials in 2006 and 2007 using two 30-mcg doses produced unacceptable results while a 2006 trial using two doses of 90 mcg each achieved acceptable levels of protection. Current flu vaccine manufacturing plants can not produce enough pandemic flu vaccine at this high dose level.THE PANDEMIC VACCINE PUZZLE - Part 3: H5N1 poses major immunologic challenges \\"Adjuvanted vaccines appear to hold the greatest promise for solving the grave supply-demand imbalance in pandemic influenza vaccine development. They come with obstacles‚Äîimmunologic, regulatory, and commercial‚Äîbut they also have generated more excitement than any other type of vaccine thus far. [In August 2007], scientists working with a GlaxoSmithKline formula published a trial of a two-dose regimen of an inactivated split-virus vaccine adjuvanted with a proprietary oil-in-water emulsion; after the second injection, even the lowest dose of 3.8 mcg exceeded EU criteria for immune response (see Bibliography: Leroux-Roels 2007). And in September, Sanofi Pasteur reported in a press release that an inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with the company's own proprietary formula induced EU-accepted levels of protection after two doses of 1.9 mcg.\\"THE PANDEMIC VACCINE PUZZLE - Part 4: The promise and problems of adjuvants The \\"GlaxoSmithKline-backed team that described an acceptable immune response after two adjuvanted 3.8-microgram (mcg) doses found that three fourths of their subjects were protected not only against the clade 1 Vietnam virus on which the vaccine was based, but against a drifted clade 2 virus from Indonesia as well [...] To achieve prepandemic vaccines, researchers would have to ascertain the right dose and dose interval, determine how long priming lasts, and solve the puzzle of measuring primed immunity. Further, regulatory authorities would have to determine the trial design that could deliver those answers, the public discussion that would be necessary for prepandemic vaccines to be accepted, and the safety data that would need to be gathered once the vaccines went into use\\".THE PANDEMIC VACCINE PUZZLE - Part 5: What role for prepandemic vaccination?

The company conducted the trials under its contract with the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The goal was to test the virus-like particle (VLP) H5N1 vaccine at different dose levels with and without 1 of 2 undisclosed adjuvants. The two trials involved 666 healthy adults who received an intramuscular vaccine or placebo at day 0 and day 21. In findings after the first 42 days, adjuvanted vaccines provoked strong immune responses (seroconverion and seroprotection rates of 86% to 100%) based on hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) at all doses tested. The unadjuvanted vaccine at the 45-microgram dose yielded more than 82% seroconversion and seroprotection in both trials. No serious adverse events were observed. The patients who received the adjuvanted vaccines showed signs of protection against a different H5N1 strain. Gregory Glenn, MD, Novavax's senior vice president and chief medical officer, said the results give the company enough data to advance to later-stage testing.\\" *CIDRAP article Sanofi reports results for H5N1 vaccine with adjuvant published May 12, 2006 :\\"In a human trial in France, an experimental H5N1 avian influenza vaccine with an adjuvant showed modestly better performance at a lower dose compared with a similar H5N1 vaccine that was tested earlier in the United States. The new study, published in this week‚Äôs The Lancet, showed an immune response in 67% of patients receiving two doses of 30 micrograms (mcg) of the vaccine plus an adjuvant. An accompanying commentary, however, pointed out several obstacles that need to be addressed before an effective vaccine can be mass-produced. The vaccine is manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, a subsidiary of France-based Sanofi Aventis. It is an inactivated, split-virion strain of H5N1 known as Vietnam/1194/2004.\\" *CIDRAP article Glaxo says its H5N1 vaccine works at low dose published July 26, 2006 :\\"An H5N1 avian influenza vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) triggered a good immune response in human volunteers at a much lower dose than other H5N1 vaccines reported so far, which means that hundreds of millions of doses could be produced by next year, the company announced today. In a clinical trial, 80% of volunteers who received two vaccine doses containing 3.8 mcg of antigen with an adjuvant (a chemical that stimulates the immune system) had a strong immune response, the British-based company said in a news release. A typical dose of seasonal flu vaccine is 15 mcg. \\"This is the first time such a low dose of H5N1 vaccine has been able to stimulate this level of strong immune response,\\" GSK Chief Executive Officer J.P. Garnier said in the news release. By comparison, an H5N1 vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur induced a good immune response in 67% of volunteers who received two 30-mcg doses with an adjuvant, according to findings reported in May. The US government is stockpiling the Sanofi vaccine. Garnier called the GSK vaccine a breakthrough because, with the effectiveness of the low dose, a given amount of antigen will go much further than it would otherwise. \\"The meaning of this is that we are going to be in a position, starting later this year, to produce hundreds of millions of doses of an effective pandemic vaccine, so this is a big breakthrough,\\" Garnier said on BBC Radio, as reported today by Agence France-Presse (AFP). The GSK vaccine was made from an inactivated H5N1 virus collected in Vietnam in 2004, according to Jennifer Armstrong, a GSK spokeswoman in Philadelphia.\\" *CIDRAP article Chinese report results for whole-virus H5N1 vaccine published September 7, 2006 :\\"In a human trial in China, a whole-virus H5N1 avian influenza vaccine generated an immune response with a relatively low dose of antigen, suggesting that it could be used to immunize more people than may be possible with some other vaccines under development. The study, published online today in The Lancet, showed an adequate immune response in 78% of volunteers after two 10-microgram (mcg) doses of the vaccine plus an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant. That exceeds the European Union's requirement of an acceptable response (a hemagglutinin-inhibition titer of 40 or more) in 70% of volunteers. The vaccine is made by Sinovac Biotech in Beijing, China, from an inactivated strain of H5N1 known as Vietnam/1194/2004.\\" *National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) news article NIAID DNA Vaccine for H5N1 Avian Influenza Enters Human Trial published January 2, 2007 :\\"The first human trial of a DNA vaccine designed to prevent H5N1 avian influenza infection began on December 21, 2006, when the vaccine was administered to the first volunteer at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Scientists from the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the NIH Institutes, designed the vaccine. The vaccine does not contain any infectious material from the influenza virus. Unlike conventional flu vaccines, which are developed by growing the influenza virus in hens' eggs and then administered as a weakened or killed form of the virus, DNA-based vaccines contain only portions of the influenza virus' genetic material. Once inside the body, the DNA instructs human cells to make proteins that act as a vaccine against the virus. VRC Director Gary Nabel, M.D., Ph.D., together with a team of scientists from the VRC recognized the potential for employing new vaccine technology against influenza, a disease for which effective vaccines have long been made, but for which the reliability of supply and manufacturing capacity has been problematic. Dr. Nabel and his colleagues previously have shown the DNA vaccine approach to be effective against influenza viruses in animal models, including highly pathogenic viruses such as the H5N1 strain and the H1N1 virus that caused the deadly 1918 pandemic. The DNA vaccine used in this study is similar to other investigational vaccines evaluated by the VRC that hold promise for controlling other viruses, such as HIV, Ebola, SARS and West Nile. [...] The study will enroll 45 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60. Fifteen will receive placebo injections and 30 will receive three injections of the investigational vaccine over 2 months and will be followed for 1 year. Volunteers will not be exposed to influenza virus. [...] The candidate vaccine, synthesized using a modified version of the hemagglutinin (H) gene from the H5N1 influenza virus, was manufactured at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant. This is the first VRC candidate vaccine manufactured at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant. The candidate vaccine went from the research bench into clinical trials in less than 6 months.\\" Clinical trials clinical trials ","title":"H5N1 clinical trials"},{"id":"5019378","text":"Paul Drayton (born 28 December 1944) is a British composer, conductor, pianist, and teacher.

The Norman Kingdom of Sicily also took part in negotiations and the treaty thereby determined the political course of all Italy for the next several years. The treaty followed on the heels of the Battle of Legnano of 29 May 1176, a defeat for Frederick Barbarossa. Frederick quickly thereafter sent envoys to Pope Alexander III at Anagni, asking for an end to the schism between him and Frederick's antipope, Callixtus III. After a preliminary agreement was reached, a conference was scheduled for July 1177. Frederick spent some time in the interim interfering in Venetian rivalries in hopes of securing a pro-Imperial group in power at the time of the confrontation. On 24 July, the pope from the Basilica di San Marco sent a delegation of cardinals to the emperor in the Lido, at the mouth of the Venetian Lagoon. The emperor formally acknowledged Alexander as pope and abandoned his own antipope; the cardinals formally lifted the excommunication that had hitherto been placed upon him. Sebastian Ziani, the doge of Venice, and Ulrich II von Treven, the patriarch of Aquileia, then escorted the emperor into Venice itself. The delegates of the king of Sicily were Romuald, Archbishop of Salerno, a chronicler who left an eyewitness account of the scene, and Count Roger of Andria. In the treaty that was concluded, the emperor recognised the temporal rights of the popes over the city of Rome, but the city did not surrender to the pope and forced him to leave in 1179. A fifteen-year peace was concluded between Frederick and William II of Sicily, paving the way for Sicily's golden years of peace and prosperity. Likewise, a six-year truce was concluded with the Lombard League, but negotiations were to continue, and the emperor finally recognised the independence of the Lombard cities in the Peace of Constance of 1183.

He twice stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for the House of Commons: in Croydon North East at the 1955 general election and in Ilford South at the 1959 general election. By investigating the division between brokers and jobbers at the London Stock Exchange while at the OFT, Borrie set in train the events which would lead to Big Bang in 1986. By forcing breweries to sell their extensive pub estates, Borrie enabled the far more diverse drinking scene that we enjoy today.

He was best known as a nationalist of the early 20th century, who upheld Brehon Law. He was President of the Supreme Court of the Irish Republic, Chief Judicial Commissioner of Ireland. He was selected by the League of Nations to oversee the 1935 Saar status referendum and was a Senator of the National University of Ireland. He was also a noted scholar, philosopher and author, whose 1911 translation of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgement is still widely used by students today. In 1896, he won the British championship for the Quarter mile race. He is the grandfather of the bronze casting sculptor Rowan Gillespie. Early life Creed Meredith was born at 17 Lower Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, in 1875. He was the son of Sir James Creed Meredith and Ellen Graves Meredith (1848‚Äì1919), his father's third wife and the daughter of his father's first cousin, Rev Richard Graves Meredith (1810‚Äì1871), of Timoleague, County Cork, elder brother of Sir William Collis Meredith and Edmund Allen Meredith. James was a nephew of Sir Edward Newenham Meredith (1776-1865), 9th Bt, and a brother of Ralph Creed Meredith and Llewellyn Meredith (1883‚Äì1967). He was a cousin of Richard Edmund Meredith, Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Meredith was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, from which he received a master's degree. In 1896, while a student at Trinity, he became the British Quarter Mile Champion, running the distance in 52 seconds and beating Fitzherbert of Cambridge, the holder of the championship. Coincidentally, his future brother-in-law, Howard Meredith Percy (1879‚Äì1902), won for Canada the inter-collegiate championship in the half-mile and mile runs when at McGill University. Following university, Meredith embarked upon a legal career, becoming a barrister. Career In 1914, Meredith had approached Sir Thomas Myles to use his yacht, the Chotah, to land guns for the Irish Volunteers at Kilcoole. Meredith himself helped out aboard the Chotah during the operation with his friends Erskine Childers and Edward Conor Marshall O'Brien. Meredith was unusual amongst Protestants and graduates of Trinity College Dublin of his era, in that he was an active supporter of Sinn F√©in and the revolutionary D√°il government between 1919-22. He served as the President of the D√°il Supreme Court from 1920‚Äì22. Although a republican ‚Äì with a small 'r' ‚Äì Meredith became a pacifist and a member of the Irish Proportional Representation Society. He was a founding member of the United Irish League along with fellow pacifist and writer Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, the painter Dermod O'Brien, William O'Brien M.P. and Michael Davitt. In 1917, Meredith campaigned with George William Russell and Sir Horace Plunkett for the establishment of the Irish Convention in an attempt to find a way around the Unionist stonewall against self-government. After Sinn F√©in's landslide victory in 1918 general election and the unilateral declaration of independence, the D√°il appointed Meredith to chair a committee of lawyers to draw up a constitution for the newly declared Irish Republic, working closely with his cousin, Arthur Francis Carew Meredith K.C. Two years later the new D√°il Courts system was set up to replace the English-law based court system, and Meredith was appointed President of the Irish Supreme Court over Arthur Clery because of the fact that he was by then a King's Counsel (a senior barrister).Kotsonouris (a) 35 At the conclusion of the War of Independence some D√°il deputies argued that elements of the Brehon law should be incorporated into the legal system of the new State. Meredith was among those who supported this view. In 1920, on an appeal by a deserted wife and child, seeking compensation or support from her husband, Meredith pronounced that English Law was retrograde in this matter and that he would give his judgment in accordance with the spirit of Brehon Law. He awarded the woman compensation and thus became the last known Irish judge to make an appeal to the ancient Irish law system. However, Laurence Ginnell and others in the judiciary who supported this initiative of reviving aspects of Brehon Law took the losing anti-Treaty side during the subsequent Civil War (1922‚Äì23), and so the project came to nothing. Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the civil war and the collapse of the Republic, the newly established Irish Free State did not abandon Meredith's talents. He was appointed Chief Judicial Commissioner of Ireland on 14 August 1923, served on the High Court from 1924-37, and then on the Supreme Court of Ireland until his death. He was elected to the Senate of the National University of Ireland, a position he also held until his death. In 1934 he was asked by the League of Nations to oversee the Saar valley plebiscite on the French/German frontier, and in 1937 he returned to the Supreme Court of Ireland. Mrs Lorraine Creed Meredith In 1908, at St. George's Church, Montreal, Meredith married Lorraine Seymour Percy, the daughter of Charles Percy (1852‚Äì1918) of Weredale Park, Montreal, 'one of the great railway geniuses of his era', and a niece of Arthur Trefusis Heneage Williams. Mr Percy was \\"a great family man, devoted to cultivated society and an admirier of fine arts, particularly music, and a lover of nature and his family fireside.\\" Percy had come from England to Canada in 1876 at the bequest of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway Company to be their treasurer, later becoming a director of the Central Vermont Railway. Lorraine's mother, Annie Redmond Meredith (1849‚Äì1930), was a daughter of Henry Howard Meredith (1815‚Äì1892) of Rosebank House, Port Hope, Ontario. She was a first cousin of James Creed Meredith's mother, and a niece of the already mentioned Edmund Allen Meredith and William Collis Meredith. Mrs Annie (Meredith) Percy was a talented artist and \\"a woman of rare culture and charm, artistic in taste, and noted for her charitable works and activities associated with the Church of England, of which she was a communicant since childhood\\". Lorraine Meredith was herself a great patron of various Irish artists and poets. She was particularly close to the painter Grace Henry, the wife of the better known Paul Henry. Grace Henry's biographer described the two women as \\"slightly silly and full of fun\\". The two often travelled and painted together, and when Mrs Henry died in 1953, it was Mrs Meredith ‚Äì then living in Cyprus ‚Äì who paid for her funeral. Mrs Meredith kept close ties with her Canadian relations and frequently took her two daughters (Moira and Brenda) to stay with them, particularly at the country home in Livingston County, Michigan, of her uncle, Howard Graves Meredith (1856‚Äì1934), described by Lord Birkenhead as \\"a great character, and one of the most attractive and warm-hearted men I have ever met\\". Their daughter Moira's son is Rowan Gillespie, the Irish bronze casting sculptor, whose latest work Proclamation is a memorial to the signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and, according to his biographer Roger Kohn, to his grandfather's dream of a Utopian society. Philosophy and writings Meredith was remembered as a kind, intelligent and philosophical man. A polymath, he held doctorates in literature and law. He wrote a successful play and five books, most notable of which was his 1911 translation of 'Kant's Critique of Aesthetic Judgement', still widely used today by English speaking scholars of Immanuel Kant. The Merediths' Dublin house, Hopeton, was a centre for well-known poets, writers and artists of the time, and they also kept a country residence, Albert House, at Dalkey. Never one to follow the crowd, he became a Quaker in later life and after his death, 14 August 1942, was buried at the Friend's Temple Hill Cemetery, Blackrock, Dublin.

It is used to describe the terms of a game, sport or competition, often a game of chance. A sheep station is a large sheep farm in Australia or New Zealand, hence denoting something important, large or valuable. The phrase \\"playing for sheep stations\\" has both a literal and ironic usage. In the negative, it is used to encourage participants to play in a friendly and not too competitive manner. Playing sport or cards or a game of some sort, but not for prizes, one might say \\"take it easy, we're not playing for sheep stations\\". It could be used starting a game of cards or pool for example, to check whether the game would be played for money, beer, or just pride, asking \\"so, are we playing for sheep stations or what?\\" In typical Australian fashion, it can also be used to mean the exact opposite, because a sheep station is such an expensive item that nobody would bet it on a game, the phrase \\"we're playing for sheep stations\\" can also be used to mean that the game is purely for sport, and there is no bet or prize involved.

The film is an adaptation of a 1990 play written by Keith Reddin. Cast * David Arquette as Tommy Hudler * Stanley Tucci as Heinrich Grigoris * Kate Capshaw as Gale Ancona * Mary McCormack as Sally * Ryan Reynolds as Howard Ancona Reception The Alarmist was reviewed by several mainstream critics. Most of them praised Stanley Tucci's performance, but criticized the film itself. Stephen Holden from The New York Times called Tucci's performance \\"one of the subtlest, most delicious performances of his career\\". He found the first part of the film very entertaining, but considered that the movie deteriorates in its second part when it becomes more serious. \\"Shortly after the halfway point, \\"The Alarmist\\" takes a dramatic U-turn into a murder mystery in which Tommy suspects his boss of being the killer. At this point a movie that succeeded as a light, loopy satire of sex, salesmanship, shoddy ethics, gun nuts and geeky teen-agers finds itself seriously in over its head. Unable to decide where to go or what tone to adopt, it ends up treading water.\\" Edward Guthmann from San Francisco Chronicle also praised Tucci's performance, but criticized the film indecision. \\"As a showcase for Tucci's comic skills, \\"The Alarmist\\" succeeds. We start the film feeling buoyed by his roosterlike energy and audacity, and we end it feeling let down by a script that can't quite decide what it wants to say.\\" Steve Davis from The Austin Chronicle called The Alarmist a \\"near- pointless movie\\" and wrote: \\"Perhaps the greatest sin of The Alarmist is its complete waste of Tucci in the role of Heinreich Grigoris, Hudler's paternal but unscrupulous mentor. Tucci never takes off; it's a stillborn performance. Maybe if Tucci had found something with which to work, the movie in turn might have found the center it so badly needs.

Schirripa as Bobby Baccalieri =Guest starring= Synopsis With the Esplanade project shut down, Johnny is worried about his lost revenue. Tony declines to move against Carmine, but when Johnny offers generous concessions, he agrees to go ahead. Chris has come back from rehab in very good shape; Tony asks him to contract the job out and make it look like \\"an outside job\\". Chris delivers a pre-payment to two heroin dealers, and delivers instructions for the hit. However, Carmine unexpectedly changes his mind and offers to negotiate; at a sitdown he agrees to accept just 15% and praises Little Carmine for smoothing things. For Johnny the hit is still on, but Tony finally decides not to go ahead and tells Chris to ensure the hired guns don't talk. Chris pays them, then Benny and Petey appear and kill them. When Tony and Johnny meet again, Johnny expresses his resentment against Carmine and his son, and his anger at Tony for letting him down. They embrace and part, but eye each other warily as Johnny drives away. Thanks to juror intimidation, Junior is freed following a mistrial. Celebrating upon returning home, Bobby and Janice dance together but Junior, distrusting Janice, finds a pretext to stop them. Tony takes Carmela on a surprise trip to \\"Whitecaps,\\" a house on the Jersey Shore he is thinking of buying, if it is available. At first hesitant, Carmela is finally delighted; she and Tony walk hand-in-hand on the beach and kiss. Tony meets the house's owner, attorney Alan Sapinsly, who lives next-door, and offers cash in the shortest possible time allowed by law. Sapinsly calls the current buyer, who is having difficulty obtaining a home loan, and negotiates and threatens his way out of their contract. Irina drunk dials Carmela and brags about Tony's relations with her and tells her he also had sex with Svetlana. This causes Carmela extreme distress, and when Tony returns home, she is hurling his possessions from an upstairs window. She tells Tony that he has embarrassed her for years with his infidelity and tells him to leave the house. Tony says, \\"You stole from me!\\"‚Äîthe cash hidden in the birdseed. He goes to Irina's home. Svetlana is there, and she explains that soon after Tony thrashed Zellman in front of Irina, humiliating him, their relationship ended. Tony spends the night at Whitecaps. He explains to Sapinsly that he no longer wishes to buy the house, but Sapinsly declines to release him from the contract. Meadow argues with her mother about the separation, asking her how she could \\"take shit\\" from Tony for so many years. Tony returns home and becomes violent when Carmela tells him to leave. She threatens to call a lawyer and get a restraining order. A.J. helps Tony clear the home theater so that he can stay there. Tony lies in the pool. Carmela complains to him about (he thinks) a trivial matter and there is soon another argument. Finally she says, \\"For the last year, I have been ‚Ä¶ in love with Furio.\\" Tony, at first incredulous, again becomes violent. He charges at her, almost punches her, but stops himself and punches the wall beside her head instead, smashing it in. He tells her he looked for women with different qualities from her in his affairs. She reminds him that he hardly knew most of the women he slept with, the strippers and cocktail waitresses, and walks out, calling him a \\"fucking hypocrite.\\" Tony calls Dr. Melfi but hangs up when she answers. She tries to call him back but his number is blocked. He finally tells the family he has decided to move out completely. Both children go to him and he embraces them. Sapinsly calls Tony to say he will release him from the sale but will keep the $200,000 deposit. He offers to negotiate; Tony declines. Benny and Little Paulie take the speakers out of Tony's home theater, install them on Tony's boat, anchor it just offshore from the Sapinsly house and, at lunchtime, play a Dean Martin concert at high volume. The Sapinslys close the patio doors and try to ignore it. At night, as they sit peacefully on the patio, the music starts again.

This genus is considered to be a member of the Ornithocheiridae, a diverse group of pterosaurs known for their keel-tipped snouts and large size. Tropeognathus is regarded as the largest pterosaur found in the Southern Hemisphere, only rivaled by the huge azhdarchids. The type and only species is Tropeognathus mesembrinus. Fossil remains of Tropeognathus have been recovered from the Romualdo Formation, which is a Lagerst√§tte located in the Santana Group of the Araripe Basin in northeastern Brazil.  Discovery and naming  Comparison between the holotypes of Ornithocheirus simus (A and C) and Tropeognathus mesembrinus (B and D) In the 1980s the German paleontology museum Bayerische Staatssammlung f√ºr Pal√§ontologie und historische Geologie in Munich acquired a pterosaur skull from Brazilian fossil dealers that had probably been found in Cear√°, in the geological group called the Santana Group, which is located in the Araripe Basin (Chapada do Araripe) of Brazil. In 1987, it was named and described as the type species Tropeognathus mesembrinus by Peter Wellnhofer. The generic name is derived from Greek œÑœÅœåœÄŒπœÇ, tropis, \\"keel\\", and Œ≥ŒΩŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ, gnathos, \\"jaw\\". The specific name is derived from Koine mesembrinos, \\"of the noontide\\", simplied as \\"southern\\", in reference to the provenance from the Southern hemisphere.Peter Wellnhofer, 1987, \\"New crested pterosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\\", Mitteilungen der Bayerische Staatssammlung f√ºr Pal√§ontologie und historische Geologie 27: 175‚Äì186; Muenchen The holotype, BSP 1987 I 46, was discovered in a layer of the Romualdo Formation within the Santana Group, dating to the latest Aptian and earliest Albian stages. Along with the holotype, several other pterosaur specimens were found in the fossil site, these specimens however, were referred to genera such as Anhanguera and Cearadactylus.Leonardi, G. & Borgomanero, G. (1985). \\"Cearadactylus atrox nov. gen., nov. sp.: novo Pterosauria (Pterodactyloidea) da Chapada do Araripe, Ceara, Brasil.\\" Resumos dos communica√ßoes VIII Congresso bras. de Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 27: 75‚Äì80. The uncovered holotype consists of a skull with lower jaws. A second specimen was referred by Andr√© Jacques Veldmeijer in 2002: SMNS 56994, which consists of a partial mandible. In 2013, Brazilian paleontologist Alexander Kellner referred a third, larger, specimen: MN 6594-1, a skeleton with skull, with extensive elements of all body parts, except the tail and the lower hindlimbs. After Tropeognathus mesembrinus was named by Peter Wellnhofer in 1987, other researchers tended to consider it part of several other genera, leading to an enormous taxonomic confusion.Wellnhofer, P. (1991). The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pterosaurs. New York: Barnes and Noble Books. pp. 124. . It was considered an Anhanguera mesembrinus by Alexander Kellner in 1989, a Criorhynchus mesembrinus by Veldmeijer in 1998 and a Coloborhynchus mesembrinus by Michael Fastnacht in 2001. Later the same year, David Unwin referred the Tropeognathus material to Ornithocheirus simus, making Tropeognathus mesembrinus a junior synonym, though he had reinstated a Ornithocheirus mesembrinus in 2003.Unwin, D.M., 2001, \\"An overview of the pterosaur assemblage from the Cambridge Greensand (Cretaceous) of Eastern England\\", Mitteilungen aus dem Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin, Geowissenschaftliche Reihe 4: 189‚Äì221 In 2006, Veldmeijer accepted that Tropeognathus and Ornithocheirus were cogeneric, but rejected O. simus as the type species of Ornithocheirus in favor of O. compressirostris, which was named as Lonchodectes by Unwin due to an analysis by English paleontologist Reginald Walter Hooley in 1914. This made Veldmeijer use the names Criorhynchus simus and Criorhynchus mesembrinus instead. In 2013 however, Taissa Rodrigues and Alexander Kellner concluded Tropeognathus to be valid, and containing only T. mesembrinus, the type species. Back in 1987, Wellnhofer had named a second species called Tropeognathus robustus, based on specimen BSP 1987 I 47, which is a more robust lower jaw. In 2013 however, T. robustus was considered as a species of Anhanguera, resulting in an Anhanguera robustus.  Description  =Size= Restoration of three flying individuals Tropeognathus is known to have reached wingspans of about , as can be inferred from the impressive size of the specimen MN 6594-1. The maximum wingspan estimate for Tropeognathus reaches , making it slightly larger than the average estimate, though much larger than other ornithocheirids such as Ornithocheirus and Coloborhynchus, which are typically estimated to be between . A skull unearthed belonging to the related Coloborhynchus likely measured , which led to a wingspan estimate of , respectively larger than the average estimates for this genus, but still shorter than that of Tropeognathus. This specimen however, was concluded to belong to the another genera, though in several studies, some paleontologists consider it under the species Coloborhynchus capito, which was originally called Ornithocheirus capito by the British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley back in 1870.Martill, D.M. and Unwin, D.M. (2011). \\"The world's largest toothed pterosaur, NHMUK R481, an incomplete rostrum of Coloborhynchus capito (Seeley 1870) from the Cambridge Greensand of England.\\" Cretaceous Research, (advance online publication). Seeley, H.G. (1870). The Ornithosauria: an Elementary Study of the Bones of Pterodactyles. Cambridge, 130 pp. =Skull and crests= Restored fossil skull of Tropeognathus, notice its prominent keel-like crest on its snout Skull comparison of different anhanguerians, notice Tropeognathus (E and F) with a well-developed \\"keeled\\" crest The skull of Tropeognathus bore distinctive convex \\"keeled\\" crests on its snout and underside of the lower jaws, and this was prominent, well-developed, and relatively large in Tropeognathus, specially in males, however, compared to other ornithocheirids such as Ornithocheirus, they were relatively thin rather than thick.Veldmeijer, A.J. (2006). \\"Toothed pterosaurs from the Santana Formation (Cretaceous; Aptian-Albian) of northeastern Brazil. A reappraisal on the basis of newly described material .\\" Tekst. - Proefschrift Universiteit Utrecht. The upper crests arosed from the snout tip and extended back to the fenestra nasoantorbitalis, the large opening in the skull side. An additional, smaller crest projected down from the lower jaws at their symphysis (\\"chin\\" area). The similar anhanguerid Anhanguera possessed jaws that were tapered in width, but expanded into a broad, spoon-shaped rosette at the tip, which differed from Tropeognathus for having a narrower appearance.Kellner, A.W.A. and Tomida, Y. (2000). \\"Description of a new species of Anhanguera (Pterodactyloidea) with comments on the pterosaur fauna from the Santana Formation (Aptian‚ÄìAlbian), northeastern Brazil.\\" Tokyo, National Science Museum (National Science Museum Monographs, 17). The jaws can be distinguished from its relatives by a few differences in the crest: unlike its close relatives Coloborhynchus and Ornithocheirus, the crest on the upper jaw of Tropeognathus was more prominent and much larger, and therefore resulting in a broader skull. =Vertebrae= The first five dorsal vertebrae of Tropeognathus are fused into a notarium, with five sacral vertebrae fused into a synsacrum, and the third and fourth sacral vertebrae are keeled within. The front blade of the ilium is strongly directed upwards, resulting in a narrow structure.  Classification  Skull cast based on the fossil remains found In 1987, Wellnhofer assigned Tropeognathus to a Tropeognathidae. This concept was not adopted by other workers; Brazilian researchers place Tropeognathus mesembrinus in the Anhangueridae, along with Anhanguera. The most recent cladistic analyses however, place Tropeognathus within the Ornithocheiridae as a basal member, meaning that it was more closely related to Ornithocheirus than Anhanguera. This concept is mostly used by the European colleagues, who prefer to use the Ornithocheiridae as the most inclusive group rather than the Anhangueridae. A topology made by Andres and Myers in 2013 placed Tropeognathus within the family Ornithocheiridae in a more basal position than Ornithocheirus, and the family itself is placed within the more inclusive clade Ornithocheirae. In 2019, the description of the new ornithocheirid Ferrodraco by Pentland et al. had made paleontologists reclassify the family Ornithocheiridae. In the analysis, a topology placed Tropeognathus as a basal member of Ornithocheiridae, while assigning the other genera within the subfamily Ornithocheirinae. Topology 1: Andres & Myers (2013). Topology 2: Pentland et al. (2019).  In popular culture  Hand puppet from Walking With Dinosaurs, Oxford Museumhttp://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/learning/pdfs/dinosaur.pdf Tropeognathus mesembrinus was the subject of an entire episode of the award- winning BBC television program Walking with Dinosaurs (which used the first name of its cousin Ornithocheirus but was incorrectly named as a species of it, as Ornithocheirus mesembrinus). In Walking with Dinosaurs: A Natural History, a companion book to the series, it was claimed that several large bone fragments from the Santana Group (known as Santana Formation in the book) of Brazil had indicated that O. mesembrinus may have had a wingspan reaching almost and a weight of , making it one of the largest known pterosaurs.Haines, T., 1999, \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\": A Natural History, BBC Books, p. 158 However, the largest definite Ornithocheirus mesembrinus specimens described at the time measured , in terms of wingspan. The specimens which the producers of the program used to justify such a large size estimate were described in 2012, and were under study by Dave Martill and David Unwin at the time of Walking With Dinosaurs' production. The final description of the remains found a maximum estimated wingspan of for this large specimen. Unwin stated that he did not believe the higher estimate used by the BBC was likely, and that the producers likely chose the highest possible estimate because it was more \\"spectacular.\\"Bredow, H.P. (2000). \\"Re: WWD non-dino questions.\\" Message to the Dinosaur Mailing List, 18 Apr 2000.

It is located on the south bank of the Douglas Water and on the A70 road that links Ayr, on the West coast of Scotland, to Edinburgh on the East, around 12 miles south west of Lanark. The placename is of Gaelic origin, derived from the Old Gaelic dub and glais, meaning \\"dark stream\\", in reference to the Douglas Water. The Douglas family took this name when their ancestors settled here in the 12th century. History The village grew to service the nearby Douglas Castle, the seat of the Lords of Douglas. The first recorded mention of the Parish of Douglas is in a charter of Bricius de Douglas, Bishop of Moray dated between 1203-1222 to the monks of Kelso Abbey which is witnessed by Freskin Parson of Douglas, brother to the bishop.Maxwell, vol. I, p. 17 The castle was well established by the time of William the Hardy when he was called upon to imprison Hugh de Abernethy there in 1288 and where Abernethy died at some point before 1293.Maxwell, vol. i, p. 21 The castle was occupied for some time by English forces during the Scottish Wars of Independence. However the castle was liberated by Sir James Douglas when in 1307 he and some followers trapped the English garrison inside the castle chapel whilst they were worshiping and burnt it to the ground, causing some damage to the castle. Notable buildings The only remains of the castle are those of a 17th-century corner tower, still known as \\"Castle Dangerous\\", after the Walter Scott novel which took Douglas Castle as its inspiration. In the 1930s Charles Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home allowed the mining of coal in the park near to the castle, in a philanthropic effort to alleviate local unemployment. The Lanarkshire coal industry, once the mainstay of Scotland's production, had seen its output almost halved by 1937, with catastrophic consequences for local communities. As a consequence of the mining works the castle was considered to be at risk of subsidence and had to be demolished in 1938. The oldest structure within the village itself is the ruin of St. Bride's Church, which like the castle originated in the 14th century. This church became the mausoleum of the Lords of Douglas. The church clock, which is still in working order today, and installed sometime in the 16th century, is rumoured to have been given as a gift to the village by Mary, Queen of Scots, after spending time in the area. The parish church was moved to its present site, near to the old chapel, where the Douglas St Bride's Parish Church still stands. Its congregation now worships at the newer St Bride's Church built some distance away. James Gavin Monument Within the village stands a monument to the Covenanter James Gavin, a local tailor, who had his ears cut off with his own tailoring scissors for refusing to renounce his presbyterian principles. After suffering this humiliation he was transported to a life of slavery in the West Indies. The ruins of the house he built after his eventual return from banishment stood until 1968 with its engraved lintel still in place above the front door featuring a carving of a pair of tailor's scissors. The lintel has been incorporated within the monument erected in what was the rear garden of the house. Also within the village is a statue of James Douglas, Earl of Angus, commemorating the Cameronians regiment which he raised in 1689. Nearby, another memorial commemorates its disbanding, over two and a half centuries later, in 1968. The village was shaped later by the Industrial Revolution, which brought woolen mills and coal mining (in common with other villages in this part of Scotland). There is a heritage museum in Douglas that charts the history of the area. Polish Memorial Garden The village was one of several locations near which a large camp of the Polish Army was set up in 1940. Units of the 10th Polish Cavalry, including the Podhalanski (Highland) Battalion, 10th Mounted Rifles Regiment, the 24th Lancers as well as brigade support and service units were stationed here for a brief period in a temporary tented camp before moving north to Fife and Angus where they were deployed to defend the east coast of Scotland against invasion. Three Polish monuments created by the 10th Cavalry Brigade in the vicinity of the village have been put together in a Memorial Garden.

It was available with either 1200 cc or 700 cc V4 engines.

Model designations: * GV1200GL * GV1200GLF * GV1200GLG * GV700GL History In response to the Honda Magna, Suzuki made the Madura model. Like the Magna, it was a V-four powered cruiser. Like the Magna, the Madura was offered with two different engine sizes. Both bikes' smaller engines displaced 700 cc, but while the larger V65 Magna displaced 1100 cc (actual 1098 cc), the big Madura displaced 1200 cc (actual 1165 cc). Production of the Madura was halted after just two years. According to Peter Seifert of Vernon, B.C., Canada, 5099 Maduras were produced. Features The Madura had a V-four engine with hydraulic lifters. The lifters reduced maintenance, and avoided the kind of cam-wear problems that plagued the Magna. Despite displacing 100 cc more, the Madura didn't have more power or torque than the Magna. The Madura was factory rated at 117 hp, while the Magna was rated at 116 hp. Actual power in a road-tested bike was found to be about . For comparison, a same year V65 put down 93 hp. In addition to the maintenance-free lifters, the Madura had a self-adjusting hydraulically actuated clutch, and a low-maintenance, shaft final drive. The rear suspension was a sophisticated monoshock arrangement that used a single rear swingarm tube to carry the driveshaft as well. Ergonomically, the Madura featured a low, scooped seat, swept-back handle-bars, and foot-controls that wouldn't be considered \\"forward\\" by later standards, but at the time were noted for being 14\\" ahead of the center of the seat. Speed According to Cycle magazine, the 1200 cc Madura completed the 1/4-mile in 11.753 seconds at 115.08 mph. For comparison, on the same day the V65 Magna ran 11.86 at 115.86 mph Cycle Guide recorded an 11.36 at 117.18 mile. while their Magna clocked 11.44 at 118.42 Motorcyclist clocked a corrected 11.47 at 117.6 with the GV1200 Madura.

Fourfold, namely, was Agni (fire) at first. Now that Agni whom they at first chose for the office of Hotri priest passed away. He also whom they chose the second time passed away. He also whom they chose the third time passed away. Thereupon the one who still constitutes the fire in our own time, concealed himself from fear. He entered into the waters. Him the gods discovered and brought forcibly away from the waters. He spat upon the waters, saying, 'Bespitten are ye who are an unsafe place of refuge, from whom they take me away against my will!' Thence sprung the √Çptya deities, Trita, Dvita, and Ekata. - 1:2:3:1 Relation to Indra and Killing of Trishiras The Shatapatha Brahmana also mentions that they followed Indra just as a Brahman follows the train of a king. They roamed about with Indra, even as nowadays a Br√¢hman follows in the train of a king. When he slew Visvar√ªpa, the three-headed son of Tvashtri, they also knew of his going to be killed.; and straightway Trita slew him. Indra, assuredly, was free from that (sin), for he is a god. \\\\- 1:2:3:2 Other Stories In RV 1.105, Trita fallen into a well begs aid from the gods. Sayana on 1.105 comments that this relates to three rishis, Ekata, Dvita and Trita who found a well, and Trita, drawing water, was pushed down by the other two and imprisoned, where he composed a hymn to the gods, and managed miraculously to prepare the sacrificial Soma; this is alluded to in RV 9.34.4 and described in Mahabharata 9.2095. RV 8.47 asks Dawn to send away bad dreams to Trita, who eats them and wears them on his body as ornaments; Dvita also receives these bad dreams.

Early life Eric Williams was born on the 13 July 1911, and was educated at Christ's College, Finchley. In 1940, he joined the Royal Air Force. Capture RAF Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams was the navigator of a 75 Squadron Short Stirling bomber (BK620) shot down on a bombing raid over Germany on 17/18 December 1942. He evaded capture for three days, but was eventually caught and sent to Oflag XXI-B at Schubin in Poland. There he quickly formed a friendship with Lieutenant Michael Codner, who spoke French, and together they planned and executed an escape through a tunnel. However, they were quickly recaptured and, as punishment, sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan (now ≈ªaga≈Ñ in Poland). The \\"Wooden Horse\\" and escape  As described in his novelization of the true events The Wooden Horse, Stalag Luft III was designed to be a highly escape-resistant camp. Tunnelling in particular was made harder by the use of numerous environmental and technological solutions: the perimeter fence was placed some distance from the huts, necessitating longer tunnels; the sandy soil was yellow when moist, a markedly different colour than the dry grey surface sand, making disposal of freshly dug tunnel soil difficult; and the Germans employed seismographs to measure vibration caused by digging. Williams and Codner came up with the idea of constructing a vaulting horse and using it daily to cover the opening of a tunnel entrance close to the perimeter fence, while the other camp inmates vaulted continuously over the horse to mask the vibration of the tunnelling work. Sand was carried back inside the horse and dried in the attic of the camp canteen before being distributed in the compound. (Peter Tunstall and Dominic Bruce claim to have used a wooden horse to camouflage a tunnel opening in the Spangenberg concentration camp two year previously, in 1941.) With the assistance of a third POW, Oliver Philpot, the tunnel was completed by 29 October 1943 ‚Äì an important factor, since Williams, Codner and Philpot planned to use the local railway to quickly put distance between themselves and the camp, rather than the usual escape strategy at the time of travelling on foot at night and hiding in barns or haystacks during the day, but the Escape Committee only had local railway timetables valid until the end of October. Posing as French labourers, the trio made their way by train to the Baltic; Philpot headed to Danzig, while Williams and Codner made their way to Stettin, where they eventually managed to make contact with the Danish Resistance and gain passage on a ship to Copenhagen and thence to Gothenburg in neutral Sweden. There they met Philpot, who had been able to travel more quickly to Sweden via Danzig (Gdansk). From Sweden, all three officers were repatriated to Britain. After his return to active duty, Williams worked for MI9, the intelligence organization tasked with supporting available European Resistance networks and making use of them to assist Allied airmen shot down over Europe in returning to Britain. After a period of training in Canada, he was in Italy when the war in Europe ended. He was subsequently sent to the Philippines to do welfare work with liberated Allied prisoners of war. He was there when the war ended.Laplander (2014) Writing career At the end of the war, on the long sea voyage home on the RMS Queen Mary, Williams wrote Goon In The Block, a short book based on his experiences. Four years later, in 1949, he rewrote it as a much longer third-person narrative under the title The Wooden Horse. He included many details omitted in his previous book, but changed his name to \\"Peter Howard\\", Michael Codner to \\"John Clinton\\" and Oliver Philpot to \\"Philip Rowe\\". Two years later, he wrote The Tunnel, a prequel to The Wooden Horse that described his and Codner's escape from Oflag XXIB. Williams also amassed a substantial collection of escape literature and published several anthologies of excerpts from this collection. Postwar Williams spent much of the time after 1962 living on his boat Escaper in the Eastern Mediterranean with his wife Sibyl. Personal life Williams married twice, first to Joan Mary Roberts in 1940, then to Sybil Grain MBE in 1948.

It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Powell and Lewis and Clark counties at 5,902 feet (1,799 m) above sea level. In the Helena National Forest, the pass is thirteen miles (20 km) west of Helena. The Northern Pacific Railway (NP) used the pass for its line from Logan to Garrison via Helena, built in 1883. This line was the NP's primary freight route and was also used by their secondary passenger train, the Mainstreeter. The NP also built an alternate line over Homestake Pass, which was used by their primary passenger train, the North Coast Limited. The rail line at Mullan Pass is currently operated by Montana Rail Link; it crosses under the pass and the continental divide at via the Mullan Tunnel. The pass was named after Lieutenant John Mullan, the U.S. Army engineer who first crossed the pass on March 22, 1854, and later supervised construction of the Mullan Road, the first road over the pass, in 1860. Notable events On September 30, 1911 Mullan Pass was the site of the first aeronautical crossing of the North American Continental Divide. Aviation pioneer Cromwell Dixon flew from Helena to Blossburg, some 15 miles to the west, over the Mullan Pass then successfully flew back the same day. His achievement earned him $10,000, presented to him by Governor Edwin L. Norris. West portal of Mullan Tunnel. On February 2, 1989, the Helena train wreck occurred when, during a significant cold snap, a train crew uncoupled the locomotives from a 48-car train due to mechanical problems. The air brakes failed on the cars, and the train rolled nine miles back into Helena where, at approximately 5:30 a.m., they collided with a parked work train and caught fire. An explosion later linked to a tank car filled with hydrogen peroxide shook the town, knocked out power, and caused extensive damage in the community, but no deaths.\\"20 years ago today, Helena shook, rattled and froze\\" In mid-July 2009, part of the Mullan Tunnel roof collapsed while it was being enlarged to handle double-stack freight cars.

Sarugee Daizenshuu in Japan, is a game for the PlayStation Portable system that consists of a collection of 45 mini-games, many of which borrow from elements of Ape Escape 2. The game was first released in Japan and later in Europe and North America. By utilizing the PSP's Wi-Fi capabilities, up to 4 players can play at a time. A sequel, Ape Escape Academy 2 was released in Japan and Europe, but not in North America. Gameplay A monkey working for Specter, the player must work up from junior class to senior class by playing mini games by meeting certain criteria for each class. There are 9 mini games in each class to complete. Failing to meet the criteria rewards you with an X, while meeting the criteria rewards you an O, similar to tic-tac-toe. Each level has a certain number of lines required to pass the class (one line consists of 3 Os, either horizontally, vertically or diagonal). The game also offers review lessons for players that have almost met the requirements. Usually, these are mini-games that the player has failed previously. Critical reception The game received generally poor reviews, averaging just 55% on GameRankings.Ape Escape Academy Reviews Many reviewers criticized the difficulty of most of the mini-games, as the controls were not explained fully, often leading to a failure during the first run in these minigames. However, most reviewers liked the variations in the available mini-games. It is believed that because of this game's lackluster reception, the future of the Ape Escape series in the North America is uncertain, as successive titles in the series (such as Ape Escape Racer and Ape Escape Million Monkeys) have yet to receive a North American release. Recently, however, Ape Quest was released for download for the PSP on the PlayStation Store in Japan & the US.

He has been described as a pr√©lat aventureux et vagabond, an \\"adventurous and vagabond prelate\\" (Chalandon 1907). A Tuscan by birth, he originally served as an ambassador from G√©za II of Hungary, but decided to remain in Sicily after a diplomatic mission. There he became bishop of Agrigento and a noted courtier. Noted, that is, for his luxury and debauchery. He threw lavish banquets, which he used to begin a whispering campaign against Richard Palmer, Bishop of Syracuse, a rival candidate for the vacant archbishopric of Palermo (1166). Ironically, he complained of the Syracusan bishops foreign, English origins. Likewise, he convinced the Grand Protonotary Matthew of Ajello that Palmer was planning to kill him and very nearly started a blood feud. The archbishopric was filled by Stephen du Perche, also a foreigner, and Gentile was the first ecclesiastic to join the large conspiracy against him. Nevertheless, Gentile swore an oath of fealty to Stephen just before the latter moved the court to Messina, where the conspiracy was uncovered and the \\"leader\\" of the group, Henry, Count of Montescaglioso, arrested and imprisoned. Gentile himself had avoided the court proceedings, but hurried with Matthew of Ajello back to Palermo to await Stephen's return. Once again, the conspiracy was uncovered and Gentile fled to his diocese, where the people handed him over to a royal justiciar come to arrest him. The bishop was imprisoned in San Marco d'Alunzio, the first Norman fortress on the island. On Stephen's fall later in 1168, Gentile was released and was a guarantor of the deal whereby Stephen's life was spared should he immediately leave Sicily, which he did. The \\"old voluptuary\\", as Norwich calls him, was passed over again for the vacant archdiocese, Walter of the Mill being elected instead. Nonetheless, Gentile's penchant for conspiracy and sedition had apparently been satisfied and he took no part in any more such quarrels, dying early in 1171 and succeeded by Bartholomew.

It is located in the municipality of Loznica, in the Maƒçva District. Le≈°nica's current population is 4,731 (2002 census). History The village is one of the oldest in Serbia, with records dating back to the 10th century AD. It is one of a few old settlements there which was not based on a Roman dwelling, but was started by Serbs. Geography and features Le≈°nica is located on the Drina River and between the towns of ≈†abac and Loznica. The Jadar River also runs through Le≈°nica. The rivers provide ample fishing opportunities, being rich with carp, barbel, stuka, and zelenjara. The opposite end of the village is bordered by the Vidojevica Mountain, which is relatively low (approx. above sea level), but its oak and beech forests provide picturesque beauty. Pheasant hunting is popular, and the hunters' club of the same name maintains the animal populations diligently. Le≈°nica is part of the –ú–∞cva district, close to the Bosnian border. The main attraction is Le≈°nicas Orthodox church located in the middle of the village. Economy The village is an economic and business center to the surrounding villages, and the main street is part of the route from Belgrade to Sarajevo. On Saturday mornings there is a market behind the fire house, where everything can be bought, from farm cheese, eggs, and livestock, to clothing, tools, electronics and Nike shoes. This is not the only opportunity to shop in Le≈°nica. There are butcheries, grocery shops, fishmongers, bakeries, and many other shops. The bakeries of the village (of which there are many) have a reputation for their excellent pastries, probably a result of the competition between them. Village center There is an eighth grade primary school (Petar Tasiƒá), a chestnut wooded park, and many shops, of which the barber shop in the main street is the oldest. In fact, it is the oldest in the country, where the same family of barbers have worked for generations. Across the road from the park and diagonally from the school is the beautiful 19th-century church of St. Peter and Paul. The church was partially destroyed by the Nazis during their occupation, but was rebuilt to provide a spiritual home for the villagers and a magnificent floodlit vista at night. The other side of the park is the location of a late 19th-century manor built by the Pejiƒá family, who were the landlords of the settlement. It belongs to the descendants of the family, but sadly, it lies almost in ruin, as it has not been in use since the 1950s, when it was used as school after being confiscated by Communist rulers. There has been recent interest in reviving this once grand building.

Throughout its history, CBS has been the source of a number of innovative ministries, including the development of the Ministry Training Strategy (MTS) and the creation of Matthias Media. Campus Bible Study has also been influential in encouraging an increasing number of young people from Sydney into full-time Christian Ministry, and has been linked to the growth in enrolments at Moore Theological College through MTS.  University Churches  CBS also runs five different university churches for various groups of students living in the residential colleges at UNSW. Unichurch UNSW is an English speaking congregation. The Fellowship of Overseas University Students (FOCUS) at UNSW runs four congregations for international students ‚Äî Mandarin, Cantonese, Indonesian, and International (English).  Affiliations  CBS should not be confused with the Christian Union (CU), which (as of 2006) was a student-run, Student-Guild-affiliated organisation. CBS and the CU work in concert to conduct ministry on campus. Most members of CU are also members of CBS. CBS is also affiliated with the Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students (AFES) but is not a member ‚Äî the AFES group at UNSW is the Christian Union (CU).

The angst and protest qualities of punk music and style have had a strong appeal to Latino youth in the U.S., and to the people in Latin America. It is impossible to pinpoint the exact location or moment when Latinos began engaging in the punk subculture. However, Latin American rock began showing aspects of punk music during the mid-1960s with the Peruvian band Los Saicos; this band reflected many aspects of other proto- punk bands such as the Yardbirds. The Saicos were predecessors to some of the most influential proto-punk bands in the U.S., such as New York Dolls, MC5, and The Stooges Johnny Thunders (John Anthony Genzale, Jr) of the seminal New York Dolls, who also played with The Heartbreakers and the Waldos, was of Latino descent and very clearly played Latin-influenced scales on some of his tracks (e.g. King of the Gypsies). Punk music began engaging a wider variety of artists and audience in the late 1970s and 1980s, either in Latin America or in the U.S. By the mid-1970s, the aesthetics promoted by glam rock in the United Kingdom had created a social gap between the audience and the artist. The punk scene that began to sprout during that era shared more commonalities with the youth audience, while still retaining some attributes from glam rock. Punk music presented itself as the voice for white teenage angst, without the arrogance and verbosity of glam rock. The punk genre rooted itself in a music and style that created by the working class without the intellectual posturing of its previous genres. It was a genre created by and for the white working class in the United Kingdom. During the late 1970s, punk's social basis for creating commonalities with its fans, and its integration of style and instruments from reggae allowed for punk bands of different ethnicities to integrate themselves into the social scene in the United Kingdom.  Chicano/Latino Punk  In the late 1970s, many punk bands began appearing in Los Angeles, among them many Latino and Chicano punks like The Plugz, The Bags, The Zeros, Los Illegals, Los Angelinos, Odd Squad, Felix and the Katz, the Stains, and The Brat. Most of these bands did not consider themselves Latino punk bands, but artists challenging the mainstream just like their non- Latino peers. However, in the late 1970s Latino/Chicano punks in East L.A began organizing gigs in their own communities. These bands were part of a punk movement called The East Side Renaissance, who dedicated themselves to bringing to light the local Chicano/Latino bands in their own neighborhoods. = Latin American/Chicano hardcore punk = The Latino hardcore punk scene in the U.S. exploded during the 1990s due to all the political issues facing Latinos, such as Prop 187, NAFTA and the Zapatista Uprising. Policies that specifically targeted the Latino community all across the U.S. during the 90s pushed Latinos and Latinas to begin singing and writing hardcore punk as a form of angst and protest. Bands from cites like New York, Chicago, El Paso, Texas, Los Angeles, and Santa Fe, New Mexico had prominent hardcore Latino punk bands in the 1990s. Among the most notable Latino hardcore punk bands were: In contrast to their white punk peers, these bands were discriminated against for singing about the struggles of minorities that whites did not want to hear about. Latino hardcore punk bands began to sing about the direct problems that they, their families, and their Latino communities were facing. The themes of these problems were the violation of immigrant rights; particularly the abuse of Latino immigrant workers.  1970s Latin American punk  Little known outside Latin America, Latin punk was a huge sensation among teens in countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico during the 1970s. These countries shared a history of dictatorship, poverty and political oppression, about which these Latin American teens began to sing and play, about adversity and oppression that they had lived and suffered under. In the late 1970s, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil all had popular punk bands well-established within their circuits. In both Mexico and Argentina specifically the punk scene was large due to affluent youth who had the means to obtain the music of bands from the United Kingdom and the U.S. *In Brazil on the other hand, Douglas Viscaino was interested in the ideology of the youth revolting against the military regime of the nation. Bands such as his , Coquetel Molotov (from Rio de Janeiro), , and N.A.I were among the founders of Brazilian punk. *In Argentina, the punk scene depended in the ability to travel and gain knowledge of the punk scene, due to the military regime's media censorship. Bands such as Los Testiculos, Los Violadores, and others who cemented punk in Argentina were followed by bands like Los Baraja, Alerta Roja, Comando Suicida, Los Inadaptables, and Trixy y Los Maniaticos. *The original punk bands of Mexico, such as , Salida, Ritmo Peligroso and others, began playing music completely in English, alienating them from the mass marginalized youth of their nation. Yet in the north of Mexico punk was largely racialized with heavy influence from the United States. The 1980s would become the true fulfillment of punk in Latin America.  1980s Latin American punk  By the 1980s punk was well established in multiple nations of Latin America. Punk became a form of resistance among the youth of Latin America, in which they spoke against the establishment of their countries, which was completely dangerous. For in Chile during the 1970s the separation of rock music, and musician was one of the key points the dictatorship focused on overpowering. The youth followed the ideology of DIY, in order to create space in which created and alternative to their livelihoods. = Punk in Mexico = Mexican punk had more similar roots to that of 1970s based on the fact that marginalized minorities were beginning to participate and perform. It was during this time that bands such as Massacre 68 and began to emerge. Rebel'd was one of the most important bands, often considered the Ramones of Mexico, and has played with multiple bands such as the Ramones, the Dead Kennedys and the Misfits. In the late 1980s bands such as Musicbrainz info on Especimen https://musicbrainz.org/artist/3fc51e2b-bb90-47fa-b2ed-75bbdec23e67 and were key factors in the hardcore scene. = Punk in Colombia = In Colombia punk emerged amid national unrest, during an era in which there was a major war between narco-traffickers and the government of Colombia. Complot was one of the earliest bands there, and got its start playing covers of bands such as the Clash, the Buzzcocks and others. Within the realms of hardcore- punk La Pestilencia and Mougue emerged as the main contenders in the style in Colombia to date. The epicenter of punk in Colombia was Bogot√° with bands such as Chite and Area 12; but Colombia‚Äôs peripheries also had popular bands. = Punk in Peru = Peru is especially important to the Latino punk genre, with significant contributions in the mid-1960s with Los Saicos. Los Saicos played a key role in the genre of punk, being considered at times the first real punk band. The 1987 documentary El Grito Subterraneo (The Underground Scream), presented interviews of youth in the movement, and outside officials trying to understand the movement, as well as performances in Peru at the time, such as , Leusemia, Eutanasia, Kaos, Flema, Narcosis, Maria Teta, Empujon Brutal, Sinkura, Guerrilla Urbana, and others. = Punk in Brazil = Brazil was producing mixtapes in the early 1980s with a hardcore sound, as well as an early punk festivals. Yet in the mid-1980s, between punks, skinheads, and metal head, punk began to take an early post-punk turn, with bands such as Inocentes, Mercen√°rias and 365.

It holds 128Kib (16KiB) of data, and is mask-programmed with a start address for said data on a 16KiB boundary. It is also mask-programmable whether the /CE line needs to be high or low to activate, and also what the two (or four) 'internal' CE bits need to be set to activate, effectively making the total addressable area 18 bits. Finally, it is mask-programmable whether the bits are read out 1-bit serially or 4 at a time. TMS6125 The TMS6125 is a smaller, 32Kib (4KiB) version of effectively the same chip, with some minor changes to the 'address load' command format to reflect its smaller size. Texas Instruments calls both of these serial roms (TMS6100 and TMS6125) \\"VSM\\"s (Voice Synthesis Memory) on their datasheets and literature, and they will be referred to as such for the rest of this article. Both VSMs use 'local addressing', meaning the chip keeps track of its own address pointer once loaded. Hence every bit in the chip can be sequentially read out, even though internally the chip stores data in 8-bit bytes. (For the following section, CE stands for \\"Chip Enable\\" and is used as a way to enable one specific VSM) Commands The VSM has supports 4 basic commands, based on two input pins called 'M0' and 'M1': * no operation/idle: this command tells the chip to 'do nothing' or 'continue doing what was being done before'. * load address: this command parallel-loads 4 bits from the data bus. to fully load an address, this command must be executed 5 times in sequence, for a load of a 20 bit block (LSB-first 14 bit address, 4 CE bits, and two unused bits, effectively 18 address bits) into the internal address pointer. On the TMS6125 the command must be executed 4 times instead, and only a 16 bit block is loaded (12 address bits, two unused bits, and two CE bits). * read bit: this reads a single bit at the loaded address, and advances the 3 bit 'bit pointer' to point to the next bit within the address; if the bit pointer overflows, the address pointer is incremented. If the address pointed to on a specific chip is outside of the mask-programmed range of said VSM, the VSM will leave the data bus 'open' in a high impedance state, so another chip wired in parallel (which has the address within its mask-programmed range) can supply the data instead. A rarely used mask option made the read bit command read 4 bits at once; this was used on a few non-speech products, and could not be used with the TI-manufactured LPC speech ICs. * read and branch: this reads 16 bits of data from the current address(and bit?) pointed to, and loads the value read into the address pointer, leaving the high bits of the address pointer alone. (This was intended for making VSMs with multiple languages available, where the initial load addresses could remain static, so for example they would not require changes to code in a microcontroller, and only the values pointed to in the VSM needed changing. In practice it doesn't seem to have ever been used, as it doesn't work when more than one VSM chip shares a bus, which is what was done in most cases.) Part Numbering When used on Texas Instruments' Consumer Division products, the VSMs are always marked CDxxxxx where xxxxx is a 4 or 5 digit mask rom ID code, typically 23xx or 62xxx. The chips are SOMETIMES (typically after 1981) also marked TMC0350, as this seems to be the 'internal use class' of the chip. The very first VSMs (used in the Speak and Spell, 1978 version) were marked TMC0351 and TMC0352 and did not have a CD number. These two SEEM to have been 'grandfathered in' as CD2300 and CD2301, as all later VSMs start at CD2302 (used in the 'Vowel Power' Speak and Spell expansion cartridge). It should also be noted that CD22xx, CD25xx and CD28xx numbers are used for chips that are NOT VSMs. When used on Texas Instruments' non-consumer division products (such as generic voice chips for other computers/measurement devices which were still TI- branded) the chips are labeled VMxxxxx. When used on 3rd party products, the chips are marked CMxxxxx instead. The numbering scheme for the xxxxx part seems to be common between both CDxxxxx and CMxxxxx chips (but NOT VMxxxxx chips), so no chip of either series will have a common xxxxx number.

They began performing together with Shock, a rock/mime/burlesque/music troupe in the early 1980s with Barbie Wilde, Robert Pereno, L.A. Richards and Carole Caplin. Shock's first record \\"Angel Face\\", with production by Rusty Egan and Richard James Burgess, was a modest dance floor hit. In 1981, Shock co-starred with Ultravox at the 'People's Palace Valentine's Ball' at the Rainbow Theatre. Shock went on to support Gary Numan at his Wembley Arena shows in April, 1981. They eventually broke up and reformed as a foursome with Wilde, Dry, Crawford and Caplin and released the single, \\"Dynamo Beat\\", on RCA Records. However, soon after Dry and Crawford left to form Tik and Tok. Tik and Tok, having perfected a form of mime movement called 'robotics', appeared on television programmes including The Royal Variety Show in 1983 and The Tube. They supported Duran Duran at the Birmingham Odeon in 1982, worked with Vangelis at his home studio, and were themselves supported by a fledgling Depeche Mode. They released five singles and an album on the Survival label in the UK, Germany and Japan. Three of these singles were hits on the UK Indie Chart, \\"Screen Me I'm Yours\\" being the most successful, reaching No. 17. Their second single, \\"Cool Running\\", peaked at No. 69 in the UK Singles Chart. They went to Tokyo and Germany for live performances and, in 1982, were featured as costumed actors in the film Xtro, followed by the third Star Wars film Return of the Jedi in 1983. They were also the support act on Gary Numan's 'Warriors' tour in late 1983. In 2003, Dry and Crawford were invited to be guests at the first of an ongoing series of Star Wars autograph conventions worldwide, as a result of their roles in Return Of The Jedi. This led to them coming back together as Tik and Tok after 20 years, and releasing an album titled Dream Orphans. Tik and Tok then appeared at the 2006 Elektrofest, at Koko in London.

Urdu books Urdu fiction does date back to prior to pre-independence times when pioneers like Mirza Haadi Ruswa wrote Umrao Jaan Ada. These writers wrote not only to entertain, but to educate the masses, and to revive the culture in Indo-Pak at a time when the society was greatly overshadowed by British values. One recent name in fiction is that of Saadat Nasreen who published her first collection of short stories last year. Humour is a popular form of fiction. Shafiq Ur Rehman has contributed to this colourful genre of literature. Translations of major works of English and other languages into Urdu have begun to appear in the market, which range from popular titles like Shakespeare to present age fiction like Harry Potter. =Poetry= Poetry is one of the richest and oldest forms of Urdu literature and Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib, Allama Iqbal and others had already created a name for themselves before independence. More recently there have been notable poets like Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ahmed Faraz, Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi and Parveen Shakir. Poets in the sub-continent, particularly in Pakistan, have focused on a wide range of topics from social awareness, to politics, to religion and even romance. =Children‚Äôs literature= A colorful bookshelf full of books is an ideal part of any child's library. Urdu offers a range of books for children from folk tales to poetry to novels and short stories. Recently there has been a trend of writing awareness books of children on issues like health, the environment, and even child abuse. These have received wide appreciation due to their content and good quality printing with illustrations. One popular series is the Mina series initiated by UNICEF. Other NGOs are also working on such books for children. Regional books =Saraiki= A large number books are printed in the Saraiki language. =Sindhi= Sindhi is one of the most ancient languages among the regional languages of Pakistan and Sub-continent. The first translation of the Quran was into Sindhi. It has a rich literature ranging from religion, philosophy, medicine, Sociology, Logic, literature, history, politics and culture. Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, a writer of Sindhi poetry, is widely read and understood by people all over the world. He wrote Shah jo Risalo. Other popular poets are Sachal Sarmast, and Shaikh Ayaz. Jamal Abro, Ghulam Rabbani Agro, Ali Baba, Naseem Kharal and Syed Irfan Ali Shah write short stories. Sindhi Adabi Board, Sindhi Language Authority, Institute of Sindhology, have been involved in publishing many original and translated works into Sindhi. Amongst the works translated is Dry Leaves from Young Egypt by Eastwick in 1973. =Punjabi= Among Pakistan's several regional languages, Punjabi is the closest to Urdu and the most colourful. Many singers have adopted Punjabi to add ‚Äòspice‚Äô to their songs. This have contributed tremendously to the genre of Punjabi poetry. Punjabi literature however, was not as developed as the Sindhi literature. The roots of Punjabi prose can safely be traced back to Baba Nanak's Janam Sakhis, but the lack of attention paid to the medium hampered its growth. The literary scene was dominated by Urdu even until the 50s and no one paid a second thought to a group of people publishing Punjabi books and taking out a magazine. The Punjabi language publishing world has expanded, however. Last year the Lehran Adabi Board published a book Lehran Behran, which is a collection of critical articles on Punjabi language and literature. =Pashto= Early Pashto writers, after independence, were ‚Äòpassive nationalists, progressive nationalists, radical nationalists and Marxists. Except the passive nationalists, almost all of them were politically motivated.‚ÄôPashto Literature ‚Äì A Quest for Identity Fazlur Rahim Marwat Pashto literature developed within the Pashto struggle for freedom from what they saw as oppression by the ruling class, and this was clearly reflected in their writings. Pashto writing has moved towards objectivism to subjectivism. The quality of books has also improved considerably. =Balochi= Poetry is the only form of literature in the language which has seen some activity lately. Poetry was and still is a major part of Balochi literature, with a rich history of 600 years. Mullah Fazul Book Name \\"Shah Lachahkaar\\" (The Great Poet) The poetry of classic poet Mullah Fazul was born in house of Chawash Jangiyan Rind in the end of eighteenth century. His family migrated from western Balochistan and settled in Qassmi Chat, Mand Kech Mekran. He and his brother Mulla Qassim a renounce poet of Balochi Language were both widely known for their intelligence from early age. In addition to Balochi they had command of the Arabic and Persian Languages. The great contribution of Mulla Fazul are simply indistinguishable from evolution of the Balochi Language and the Balochi literature. He introduced numerous innovations such as change of thematic structure in poetry and Language. As known by many, Balochi poetry concentrated on narrative structure or storytelling. However, he introduced many themes that were foreign to this structure such as the social conditions of his people and ballads of patriotism and of the homeland. His departure from the conventional structure also resulted in him introducing new connotations to many classical Balochi words. It is attributed to him to perseverance and the evolution of the Balochi language to this very day. On 30 May 1854 at the age of eighty this popularly loved Baloch poet died. He left behind a wealth of literature to his beloved nation: he was buried in Mand, Balochistan.Baloch Vanguards Munir Ahmad Badini 90 novels were published in Balochi Language since 10 years, Most recent novel is \\"Bahisht-e-Doza\\" and it is 1200 pages long. English books =Fiction= It is very difficult to categorize writers in this genre. There are a few very good novel and short story writers who have won accolades not only nationally but also internationally, but it seems hard to draw the line between Pakistani and non-Pakistani writers here. The main problem being the fact that most of these writers are although born in Pakistan but they never really lived here and hence have no contact with their origins. Zulfikar Ghose‚Äôs Murder of Aziz Khan was the first cohesive modern English language novel published in 1967. The plot no doubt was purely a Pakistani theme but the fact remains that Ghose never really did live here and the rest of his novels were set in South America. In 1980, renowned novelist, Bapsi Sidhwa published her first novel, The Crow Eaters, from England. Ms. Sidhwa is thus far considered to be amongst the best-known authors of Pakistani origin. Some of the best English literature came from expatriate Pakistanis in the West. One such author, Hanif Kureishi, wrote a haunting memoir, The Rainbow Sign (1986), trying to bring together the two worlds he lived in. Another, Aamer Hussein, wrote a series of acclaimed short story collections. English literature grew rapidly over the next few years and several writers came on the scene and won international awards. Adam ZameenZad, Hanif Kureishi, Nadeem Aslam and Bapsi Sidhwa all received several awards for their writings. In recent years, there has been a crop of younger writers. Amongst them are Bina Shah, Kamila Shamsie, Uzma Aslam Khan and Sehba Sarwar, all who have proved to be authors extraordinary. Most of these writers, explore the issue of identity for expatriates, for Muslim women, and other social issues. Bina Shah's 786 Cyber Caf√©, for example delves into the lives of three young Pakistani men and a young woman confused about her priorities. Then there is Kamila Shamsie's Kartography, which details the life in Karachi with the protagonists belonging to the elite section of the society. Although it is a riveting tale, it hardly depicts the life in Karachi. Or maybe it does, but then that only a very small faction of our society so full of other social evils. Since 2000, Uzma Aslam Khan, Mohsin Hamid, Saad Ashraf, Sorayya Khan and Feryal Ali Gauhar have published several consummate new novels. Mohsin Hamid's Moth Smoke was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award and won other awards. Coming to the present era, in 2004, novels of Nadeem Aslam and Suhyal Saadi, two Pakistani- British authors, were long listed for the 2006 IMPAC Dublin Award. They have also won several other prestigious awards. Kamila Shamsie's Broken Verses has also been long listed for the 2006 Prince Maurice Award. A number of poetry collections were also published last year. Pakistani- British, Moniza Ali published her fifth poetry collection How the Stone Found its Voice. The first part of her collection reflects the event after the 9/11 and its effects. There was also a collection of Faiz's poems published by OUP under the title of Culture and Identity: Selected English Writings of Faiz. In 2007, Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist was also published, exploring the effects of 9/11 on a Pakistani man in New York. =Non-fiction= Last year saw a number of good autobiographies like Salma Ahmad's Cutting Free, Rao Rashid's Roller Coaster: My Early Years, Shaukat Mirza's From Exxon to Engro and several others. Then there was a reprint of Tariq Ali's Street Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties, Nehru and the Gandhis: An Indian Dynasty. Another exciting series is that of the historical reprints by Mohatta Palace on Karachi. In Travelogues there was Salman Rashid's Jhelum: City of Visata. Previously religious books were published only in Urdu, but in the last few years the trend has changed and now a number of publishers are taking up the task of either translating major works of religion from Urdu to English or are publishing original pieces. One such place is Darussalam which is quite well known for its excellent content and quality. =Children‚Äôs books= Although there is a treasure trove of children's books in Urdu, Pakistan fails to provide a good bookshelf of English fiction for children. There have been attempts, but the market is full of international authors like Enid Blyton, Roald Dahl and the popular Sweet Valley, R.L Stine, Famous Five, Hardy Boys series. Very recently, Mahnaz Malik, a Pakistani born British, published her first story book for children, which serves as a fund raiser project for The Citizen's Foundation. Mo's Star, illustrated by Cora Lynn Deibler and published by Oxford University Press, is the colorful story of a young penguin reaching out for the stars. The book was received with much appreciation from home and abroad, and was unveiled in a colorful launch ceremony held in a local hotel. Printing and Publishing industry Very close to the literary scene is the printing and publishing industry as the books are nothing if they do not get a publisher or a printer. Like every other thing in the region, the printing industry is with its own sets of problems the initial ones being the unfavorable socio-economic conditions, lack of mass education and the development of local languages. Given these conditions, the establishment of the publishing industry in present-day Pakistan can be traced back to the nineteenth century. Still, the subject matter of the books dealt mainly with religious or philosophical themes and was also very restrained. World War I bought newer printing methods, and with these improved printing methods the industry moved a step further towards development. Press now ventured into the realms of subjects as diverse as philosophy, Islamic thought and literary criticism. Even more encouraging was the fact that quality books were being translated from other languages into Urdu where there was a lack expertise. These included chemistry, physics, economics, and political science and commerce books. Another important milestone was the introduction of the printing of modern novels and short stories. Russian, French and Bengali novels were also translated to add flavor to the local literature. World War II also bought a significant change in the industry. The printing methods were further improved and the publication industry saw a boost in sales and production with the rising literacy rates and the political awareness in the masses. Since World War II, the publishing industry has been steadily growing despite the many hurdles like the low purchasing power of the masses and the lack of facilities. The principle centers of publishing are Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. Lahore stands out with its numerous publishing houses and has been the hub of the industry from the pre-independence era. Even now, getting a book published from Lahore is much easier than elsewhere. Pakistan's publishing industry also has a lucrative market for Urdu and religious books abroad. A considerable number of books and periodicals are exported to countries like Malaysia, East Africa and the Middle East. Also, a very large number of books is imported in Pakistan mainly from UK and USA. The Inter- Media Growth program of Pakistan and USA have signed an agreement whereby Pakistan can import books and still pay for them in its local currency. Emerging trends Time and technological advancements play a pivotal role in shaping the trends over the passage of time. As Pakistan too enters the digital age, traditional distinctions in media become blurred. This can be negative as well as positive. It can be seen as furthering the book culture but it can also at the same time be seen as the force behind loosening the bond between the book and its reader. =E-books= The biggest contribution of the internet in the book industry would be to digitize books and grant them a wider readership. A number of online websites have sprung up in the last few decades. Quite a lot of these sites are free and others charge a very nominal fee and provide unlimited access to ebooks. They can either be downloaded or read on screen. These obviously have become popular because of easy accessibility and the low cost. In Pakistan where a huge majority of people cannot afford the expensive original foreign titles, websites like Project Gutenberg provide an opportunity to familiarize with foreign literature. Even some Urdu websites have started to offer online versions of books for foreign readers. This helps in promoting one's culture as well as to help the expatriate Pakistanis. =Online book stores= Closely related to e-books are the online book stores, another wonder of the internet. An extension of the traditional book stores, online book stores give the option to search and read reviews of books, browse through categories, view the covers, author information, reader ratings and then order these books online. Although they are not free and even charge a shipping fee, its very convenient to search and order books online saving the hassle. Critics however say that it deprives one of having the pleasure of going through new books at a store and discovering exciting new books. =Reading clubs= Though not a new phenomenon, reading clubs are a breath of fresh air into the dying book culture. There are a number of book clubs/reading clubs online and offline. People sit and discuss their favorite books or simply talk about what they are reading these days. =Book fairs= The first International Book Fair was held in Karachi and Lahore last year at the expo centre and it was well received by the public at large despite the fact that all the books were originals and were highly priced. People thronged the premises even if they did not buy much. The sad thing to note was that the Indian publishers had a very impressive collection of reference books on various subjects, while one finds it very difficult to find books on those topics by Pakistani publishers. Then there are also the annual book fairs held at various places especially in schools, colleges and universities. Among weekly affairs, the Koocha-e-Saqafat and Frere Hall book fairs are worth a visit. They have a huge collection of books on a wide range of topics. They are usually second hand or reprinted, although it's a clear violation of the copyright law but a large number of Karachiites gather at the spot for book hunting. Urdu Bazaar at Lahore is the largest market of Paper print, books and stationery in Pakistan. Old Anarkali, Nisbat Road, Mall Road, Nila Gumbad, Lohari gate etc. have numerous small and large bookshops selling new and old (used) books. More than half of the books in Pakistan are printed from Lahore. =Mobile bookshops= The concept of a Mobile Bookshop was first used by the Welcome Book port some years back. Recently, Oxford started its own mobile book shop and it has been touring the city for quite some time now. Set on a truck, with the back converted into a small book shop with shelves and a counter set snugly at the end, the book shop attracted people outside various schools and universities.  Literary Festivals  There are three major literary festivals that take place in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. The Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) is a major literary event for publishers, booksellers, authors, and readers. Founded by Razi Ahmed in 2012, the LLF \\"aims to bring together, discuss, and celebrate the diverse and pluralistic literary traditions of Lahore.\\" It has attracted the likes of Mohsin Hamid, Ayesha Jalal, Bapsi Sidhwa, and C.M.Naim. The LLF has also conducted events in New York, in partnership with the Asia Society, and in London. The Karachi Literature Festival (KLF) and Islamabad Literature Festival (ILF) are founded by Ameena Saiyid and Asif Farrukhi, and produced by Oxford University Press. The KLF began in 2010, while the ILF was started in 2013. Much like the LLF, both KLF and ILF attract attention of authors, academics, and publishers. Famous attendees include Intizar Hussain, Amjad Islam Amjad, Kamila Shamsie, Zehra Nigah, and Zia Mohyeddin. Six literary prizes are awarded at the KLF: # KLF Coca-Cola prize # KLF Peace prize # KLF Embassy of France prize # KLF Urdu prize # KLF Fiction prize # Italy Reads Pakistan award Issues =Copyright infringement of books in Pakistan= The Copyright Ordinance of 1962 came into force in 1967 in Pakistan and has been in effect since then. A number of conditions are given in the ordinance which determines when a work is in violation of copyright. Pakistan is also a member of Berne Convention on copyright as well as the Universal Copyright Convention. The boom in the education industry created a vast market for text books, both for school and post-school levels. Where the primary sector is largely catered to by the local textbook boards, there is a serious dearth for books on professional subjects like medical, engineering or business. Thus increased the demand for foreign books. Due to import limitations the prices of these books were totally out of reach of an average Pakistani student. The National Book Foundation was set up to reprint and translate foreign titles with the permission of the original publisher. This was to make the prices affordable and within reach. But even this effort was not as successful as hoped because most of the reprinted titles were either obsolete or were very old editions. People who recognized this vacuum began a successful industry of illegally copied books. Almost all major tiles were reprinted illegally and were sold at a fraction of the original price. Not only were text books copied and distributed but the recent years have seen a number of local and international fiction works being leaked before the release of original titles in paper back. The release of the Harry Potter books can be taken as a classic example of this case. The book was all set to be released on 12 August and there was a huge hype surrounding its release. Almost all major book stores throughout the world had millions of books booked prior to the release. Even in Pakistan, a couple of leading bookstores were providing the facility of pre-ordering the book and getting a nominal discount. The trend of illegally reproducing books is not limited to international bestsellers. Usually one does not find unlicensed versions of books by Pakistani authors so easily but there is a market for such books as well. Tehmina Durrani's My Feudal Lord, Bapsi Sidhwa‚Äôs An American Brat, are only but two examples. When asked about the situation, Bapsi Sidhwa, a leading Pakistani English prose writer, says ‚ÄúPiracy is a problem because of the steep prices. However some pirates are developing a conscience and assigning my previously pirated books to publishers. They have made a packet off me, but so long as books are read, I don't mind as much as I should. If we have more publishers and a larger reading public, the prices could be better controlled.‚Äù There have been numerous raids on Urdu Bazaar shops for selling infringed books but this has done little to deter their suppliers. =Incentives for writers= Those who do not reproduce work and are genuinely interested are hardly encouraged. How many good writers will actually venture into the field when the encouragement they get is only meager at best? The government, the NGOs and the intellectuals hardly ever take the initiative to encourage young and budding writers of the country. This results in most of the young authors getting their works published under foreign publishers. At least they get the recognition they warrant in foreign waters. Yet, there are a few committed souls who work tirelessly to make a place for themselves in the literature- deprived country. =Decline in reading habits= There has been a visible decline in reading habits in last few decades. This can be attributed to a number of factors like television, internet and other means of entertainment. However, major factor is the increasing high retail prices beyond the buying power of general public.

Structure  The work is in three movements: # In kr√§ftigem, nicht zu schnellem Tempo (D minor - D major) # Langsam (B-flat major) # Lebhaft, doch nicht schnell (D major) The concerto is in the traditional three- movement quick-slow-quick form. It belongs less to the poetic and passionate style of Schumann's early masterpieces than to the more objective, classical manner of his later music, as ushered in by the 'Rhenish' Symphony of 1850. Certainly the opening movement, which is in sonata form, is conceived more on symphonic than concertante lines. Its powerful opening subject dominates the proceedings, and although the violin‚Äôs role is extremely taxing, its subordination to a ‚Äòsymphonic‚Äô scheme is emphasized by the fact that there is no cadenza. The second movement, in B flat, has the character of an intensely lyrical intermezzo, the theme of which hinting towards the Geistervariationen WoO 24, and passes without pause into a vigorous and dance-like sonata-rondo finale in the parallel major, D major. The third movement has a strong polonaise rhythm.  Composition  Schumann wrote it in D√ºsseldorf between 11 September and 3 October 1853 for the violinist Joseph Joachim. He had just previously completed another work for Joachim, the Fantasie in C major, Op. 131. On 1 October, the young Johannes Brahms entered Schumann's life. It appears that Schumann composed the finale of the Concerto in three days: 1‚Äì3 October, after making Brahms‚Äôs acquaintance. Later in October, he collaborated with his new friend Brahms and his pupil Albert Dietrich in the 'F-A-E' Sonata for violin and piano, also written for Joachim.  Subsequent history and conflicting opinions  Though Joachim performed Schumann‚Äôs Fantasie, he never performed the Violin Concerto. After playing it through with the Hannover Court Orchestra (of which Joachim was the concertmaster) for Schumann in October 1853, Joachim retained the manuscript for the rest of his life. After Schumann‚Äôs attempted suicide in February 1854 and subsequent decline and death in a sanatorium in Endenich, Joachim evidently suspected the Concerto was a product of Schumann‚Äôs madness and thought of the music as morbid. Joachim‚Äôs biographer Andreas Moser reproduced a letter in which Joachim discussed Schumann‚Äôs Concerto as showing ‚Äòa certain exhaustion, which attempts to wring out the last resources of spiritual energy‚Äô, though ‚Äòcertain individual passages bear witness to the deep feelings of the creative artist‚Äô.Letter dated 5 August 1898. Translation from Hans G√°l, ed., The Musician's World (London: Thames & Hudson, 1965). Joachim‚Äôs opinion prevailed on the composer‚Äôs widow Clara and on Brahms, and the work was not published in the Complete Edition of Schumann‚Äôs works and was in effect kept secret throughout the 19th century. Brahms did however publish, in a supplementary volume of the Schumann Edition, ‚ÄòSchumann‚Äôs last musical thought‚Äô, a theme on which Schumann had begun to compose variations in early 1854. Schumann had thought the theme had been dictated to him by the spirits of Mendelssohn and Schubert, no longer recognizing that it was a melody he had used in the slow movement of the Violin Concerto. Brahms also wrote a set of piano-duet variations on this theme, his Opus 23. =Spirit voices= Joachim deposited the manuscript of the concerto with the Prussian State Library in Berlin, and stated in his will (he died in 1907) that the work should be neither played nor published until 100 years after the composer's death, i.e. until 1956. However in March 1933, during a spiritualist s√©ance in London attended by Joachim's two great-nieces, the sister violinists Jelly d'Ar√°nyi and Adila Fachiri, a spirit-voice identifying himself as Robert Schumann requested Miss d'Aranyi to recover an unpublished work of his (of which she claimed to have no knowledge) and to perform it. In a second message, this time from the spirit of Joachim, they were directed to the Prussian State Library. =Menuhin's involvement= Yet no more was heard for four years, until in 1937 Schott Music, the music- publisher in Mainz, sent a copy of the score to Yehudi Menuhin asking for an opinion. He played it through with Hephzibah Menuhin, and reported to the conductor Vladimir Golschmann in July 1937 that it was the historically missing link of the violin literature. Menuhin planned to deliver the world premiere at San Francisco, and announced it for 3 October, but was interrupted by the appearance of Jelly d'Aranyi, who claimed the right of first performance for herself on the basis of the spiritualist messages. =First performances and recording= However, all of this was to no avail, for the world copyright to the concerto was held in Germany, and the German government insisted on the world premiere being given by a German. Georg Kulenkampff had worked on the score in some detail to render it playable, with Paul Hindemith (who, though his own works were now prohibited from performance in Germany, prepared the violin-piano reduction) and with Georg Sch√ºnemann, and it was Kulenkampff who gave the first performance, on 26 November 1937, with the Berlin Philharmonic. Kulenkampff recorded it soon after the first performance.R. Magidoff, Yehudi Menuhin, p.183-184. Menuhin gave the second performance, in the piano version, accompanied by Ferguson Webster, at Carnegie Hall, New York, on 6 December 1937, and repeated this with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra under Golschmann on 23 December. Jelly d'Aranyi gave the first London performance, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Queen's Hall.'There was also heard, after some delay and much advance publicity, the newly discovered violin concerto of Schumann; of this dismal fiasco, the less said the better.' - R. Elkin, Queen's Hall 1893-1941 (Rider, London 1944), 51. The concerto slowly made its way into the concert repertoire and is now recognized as an important work of the composer. For a recording made in 1988 the Austrian violinist Thomas Zehetmair went back to Schumann‚Äôs original manuscript, correcting many errors in the published edition.  Dietrich's concerto  Albert Dietrich, who must certainly have seen Schumann‚Äôs Violin Concerto in the month of its completion, composed a Violin Concerto of his own in 1874, intended for Joachim, which is in the same key (D minor) and also has a finale in Polonaise rhythm. It is possible that it was influenced by his private knowledge of the unperformed work.

He came from the Rumyantsev family which, though little known and documented in the 17th century, later claimed descent from a prominent 14th-century boyar. Alexander enrolled in the Preobrazhensky regiment of guards in 1704. While he guarded the headquarters of Peter the Great, the monarch noticed him \\"for his great height and smart face\\". Peter made Alexander Ivanovich his servant and later recommended him to Peter Shafirov and Peter Tolstoy. In the service of these two courtiers, Rumyantsev led a mission to capture hetman Pavlo Polubotok and carried out various diplomatic errands in Constantinople and in Persia. In 1720, he married the daughter and heiress of Count Andrey Matveyev, Countess Maria Matveyeva, who was rumored to have been intimate with the Tsar. His wife survived him by 40 years, and entertained Saint Petersburg society with the stories of her acquaintance with Louis XIV, Madame de Maintenon, and the Duke of Marlborough. When she died at the age of 90, Gavrila Derzhavin wrote a remarkable ode glorifying her virtues.

The film begins in 1983, as Blair and Brown are first elected to Parliament, and ended in 1994 at the Granita restaurant‚Äîthe location of the supposed agreement‚Äîwith a brief epilogue following the leadership contest. The film was directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Peter Morgan, based in part upon The Rivals by James Naughtie. The film stars David Morrissey and Michael Sheen as Brown and Blair. It was first proposed by Morgan in late 2002 and was taken on by Granada Television for ITV. After Frears agreed to direct, and the cast were signed on, ITV pulled out of it over fears that the political sensitivity could affect its corporate merger. Channel 4 picked up the production and filming was carried out for five weeks in May 2003. The film was broadcast on 28 September 2003, the weekend prior to the Labour Party's annual party conference. The film was critically praised. Morrissey received considerable praise, winning a Royal Television Society award for playing Brown, and Frears was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television Movie/Serial by the Directors Guild of Great Britain. The film also nominated for an International Emmy for Best TV Movie/Miniseries. In 2006, Sheen later reunited with Morgan, Frears, and producer Christine Langan to reprise his role as Blair in The Queen, which depicts the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997. In 2010, Sheen also reprised his role once again in The Special Relationship, that chronicles the \\"special relationship\\" between Blair and US President Bill Clinton up until the inauguration of Clinton's successor George W. Bush, and was broadcast on BBC Two in the United Kingdom and HBO in North America.  Plot  In the prologue, opening in medias res, shows Gordon Brown (David Morrissey) taking a telephone call from Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to arrange a meeting at the Granita restaurant in Islington. The narrative shifts to 1983; in the wake of the Falklands War, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative government enjoy huge public popularity as the general election approaches, while Labour's left-wing election manifesto loses them key voters. Whilst the Conservatives win a landslide victory, building upon their existing majority, Brown is elected as the new Member of Parliament for Dunfermline East. In London, he is shown to his office in the Houses of Parliament. John Smith (Frank Kelly), a senior Labour MP, introduces Brown to Blair, his new office-mate and the new MP for Sedgefield. Blair makes pleasantries with Brown and, though Brown is not initially impressed, the two become friends. Smith soon introduces the pair to Peter Mandelson (Paul Rhys), Neil Kinnock's director of communications. Shortly afterwards, Kinnock appoints Blair to be an assistant Treasury spokesman. Brown turns down a promotion to the Scottish Office, hoping a better position will come along. He and Blair discuss their political futures and both agree that, of the two, Brown would make a better leader of the party. Labour is unable to make significant dents in the Conservative majority at the 1987 general election, with the Tories dropping by only 0.2% in the national share of the vote compared to 1983. Kinnock promotes Smith to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Brown as his \\"number two\\". Three years later, Thatcher resigns as Prime Minister having been toppled from within the Conservative Party, and Brown asserts his view that a Labour victory in the next election will now be possible. Despite contrary predictions, however, the Conservatives led by John Major win the 1992 general election and secure the most votes ever recorded for a single political party in British history. Blair tells Brown that a new approach is needed, and that Brown should stand for the party leadership. Brown refuses to stand against Smith, his friend and mentor. Mandelson privately suggests to Brown that Blair should stand as leader but Brown ridicules the idea. Smith is elected and, over the next two years, Labour gains support as scandals rock the government ‚Äì but both Blair and Brown are concerned that Smith's \\"one more heave\\" strategy of allowing Conservative unpopularity to hand the next election victory to Labour is not radical enough. Blair, as Shadow Home Secretary, pledges to be \\"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\\" in the wake of the murder of James Bulger. During a late-night conversation about the future direction of the party, Smith tells a clearly irritated Brown that he sees Blair as his natural successor. A year later, Smith suffers a fatal heart attack. Blair, encouraged by his wife Cherie (Elizabeth Berrington), decides to stand in the leadership contest. He later meets with Mandelson to tell him that he has received support from key Labour frontbenchers. Previously a supporter of Brown, Mandelson switches his allegiance to Blair. Brown is furious that Blair has gone back on what he perceives as having been an unwritten understanding between the two that Brown was the more likely candidate for the leadership, but Blair is incredulous ‚Äì believing that the circumstances have changed enormously in the intervening years. Smith's funeral passes, and Blair's camp is sure that Brown will run. Charlie Whelan (Dexter Fletcher) and Ed Balls (Matt Blair) advise Brown that he will receive support from significant trade unions. Blair decides to arrange a meeting with Brown. At Granita, Blair tells Brown that he will run for the leadership, and in return offers Brown unprecedented power as his Chancellor, should they win the next election, also offering Brown sweeping control of social policy. Brown asks what Blair's plan is should Labour win a second term in office, and Blair responds that he would not make the same mistake as Margaret Thatcher and \\"go on too long,\\" agreeing to offer his support to Brown as his successor. Brown agrees and Mandelson prepares a statement from him, but discards Brown's alterations. The leadership contest is won by Blair.  Production  = Writing = The film was commissioned in 2002 by ITV's head of drama Nick Elliott, who encouraged Peter Morgan to put aside any other projects and start work on a script as soon as possible.Brooks, Richard (13 October 2002). \\"Blair and Brown to be TV double act\\". The Sunday Times (Times Newspapers): p. 5. Granada was initially sceptical of producing it; the company's executive chairman and chief executive‚ÄîCharles Allen and Simon Shaps respectively‚Äîbelieved that Blair would be forced to resign as Prime Minister over the impending war in Iraq, consequently leaving the story outdated.Wells, Matt (2 April 2003). \\"ITV ditches Blair-Brown drama \\". MediaGuardian (Guardian News and Media). Retrieved on 21 February 2008. The project was believed to be \\"too cerebral\\" and attempts were made to persuade Morgan to develop a television series to replace Cold Feet, another Granada production.Gritten, David (20 September 2003). \\"The power, the glory‚Äîand the heartbreak\\". The Daily Telegraph (Telegraph Media Group). John Whiston and Andy Harries convinced Allen and Shaps otherwise, citing Granada's history of producing ground-breaking drama and film as reasons for why The Deal should be made. ITV's director of channels, David Liddiment, who supported the production, resigned in December 2002 and was replaced by Nigel Pickard, who shared the concerns of Allen and Shaps. Peter Morgan wrote his first script draft in the three weeks preceding Christmas 2002. Recent events such as the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak and the contention surrounding the September Dossier made him believe that the perceived adversity between Brown and Blair was no longer in the public consciousness. His opinion was changed when he watched the 2002 Labour Party Conference and saw a \\"thunderous expression\\" on Brown's face as Bill Clinton praised Blair in his speech; Morgan realised that the rivalry was not over.\\"Interview with writer Peter Morgan\\". Channel4.com. Archived from the original on 12 December 2003. Retrieved on 19 November 2009. This draft was extremely sympathetic to Brown, focusing on what Morgan called \\"Gordon's heartbreak\\". Subsequent rewrites toned down this approach, though Brown still remained the \\"main character\\". The relationship between Brown and Blair as depicted in the script was based on that between Aaron Altman and Tom Grunick, the characters portrayed by Albert Brooks and William Hurt in Broadcast News. Morgan wanted to set the entire film in the 12 days following the death of John Smith, but the time frame was widened because the Labour Party's disastrous result at the 1992 general election was \\"absolutely crucial\\" to the relationship and motives of the main characters; Morgan had to show the moment Blair decided to aim to become leader of the party. Morgan and the producers engaged in a lengthy research process during script writing and editing, interviewing 40 to 50 of Brown and Blair's closest friends and advisors, as well as aides involved in the 1992 and 1997 elections. Significantly, many of the facts in the film are based on the first three chapters of James Naughtie's book The Rivals: The Intimate Portrait of a Political Marriage. The film briefly adopted The Rivals as a working title, but soon reverted to The Deal. Another title considered by Frears was Bambi and Stalin, based on a line in a speech given by Blair in 1995. Scenes set in the House of Commons chamber and committee rooms use the actual words as recorded in Hansard. In other scenes Morgan utilised dramatic licence, conceding that there was no evidence to suggest that any of the lines spoken elsewhere in the film were ever said in real life. The relationship between Brown and Blair received many thematic analogies; Morgan likened Brown's story to a \\"tragedy of an over-qualified Scot, who the Labour Party probably rightly felt at the time that it could not have as its leader.\\"; Despite the quote at the head of the film referring to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Frears wryly likened Brown and Blair to Beavis and Butt-head. Producer Christine Langan alluded to both Shakespearean and Biblical themes, painting Brown and Blair as Cain and Abel.Rampton, James (28 September 2003). \\"The Deal undone\\". Daily Express (Express Newspapers): p. 55. = Casting = At the time of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were considered for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003.

Michael Sheen made his first of three appearances as Tony Blair in The Deal Sheen worked with an accent coach to effectively mimic Blair's speech style, although he and Morrissey avoided doing simple impersonations of the men they played. Sheen cited Will Smith's title performance of Ali as a basis for his part; despite playing a real-life figure, he treated the role as if it were any other character.Wolf, Matt (13 April 2003). \\"He's got the power\\". The Sunday Times (Times Newspapers): p. 14. \\"Will was doing a very accurate version of Ali, but it never got in the way of a real character just doing the scene, and I thought that was great. That's what I aspire to, I suppose‚Äîsomething that isn't just an impersonation.\\" Sheen had made his film debut in Frears' Mary Reilly (1996), and although he was unsure whether his minor role had \\"burned into [Frears'] brain\\", Frears confirmed that he had remembered Sheen from that.Douglas, Edward (20 October 2006). \\"Exclusive: Michael Sheen of The Queen \\". ComingSoon.net. Retrieved on 21 February 2008. Frears' casting director approached Sheen in the audience of a play, inviting him to appear in \\"a love story about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\\". An informal meeting was scheduled between Frears and Sheen, at the end of which Sheen was cast as Blair. Paul Rhys studied Donald Macintyre's 1999 biography of Peter Mandelson and gained an appreciation of the politician's work on the Northern Ireland peace process, and of his sexuality. Rhys portrayed Mandelson with a \\"myopic loyalty\\" and identified him as \\"remain[ing] preposterously loyal to Blair\\" after his defection from Kinnock and Brown. The representation of Mandelson was compared to both Iago and Pandarus. Other people associated with Blair and Brown who appear in the film are Anji Hunter, Blair's assistant (played by Glenna Morrison), journalist Sheena McDonald (played by Valerie Edmond), and Sue Nye, Brown's assistant (played by Joanna Scanlan). = Filming = Stephen Frears directed The Deal In March 2003, shortly before filming began, ITV abandoned its plan to screen the film, citing fears that such a politically sensitive film could affect the Granada-Carlton corporate merger, which was due to go before the government's Competition Commission.Walker, Tim (30 March 2003). \\"Rivals no longer\\". The Sunday Times (Times Newspapers): p. 40. Within 24 hours, Channel 4 backed the production. A ¬£2 million budget was assigned to the film. Filming was postponed until May to accommodate Sheen's rehearsal schedule for the play Caligula. Frears ended shooting at 6 p.m. each day, so Sheen could leave the set in time to appear in the play at the Donmar Warehouse. The shoot was scheduled for five weeks. Set design was carried out by Michael Pickwood, a longtime production designer for Granada. The Blairs' house in Sedgefield, Myrobella, was \\"played\\" by a house formerly owned by Lord Hailsham, Kettlethorpe Hall in Lincolnshire. The Maughan Library was used as the Houses of Parliament, along with the real life scene in London. The scene in which John Smith eats with Brown was filmed on Blackfriars Bridge on the River Thames. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Certain personal effects of the characters that were familiar to the public were added to the sets.McKay, Alastair (17 September 2003). The Scotsman (The Scotsman Publications). Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera.Frears, Stephen.

The first in the series, RG550 was originally released in 1987 and advertised as part of the Roadstar series. That series was renamed 'RG' in 1992 and all models since are simply known as RGs. It rose in popularity throughout the 80s and it had the features that musicians in the rising shred and thrash metal movements of that time were looking for - a fast neck, comfortable body, powerful pickups, and a reliable tremolo system. The RG series has the most subtypes of any Ibanez model Bacon, pp.141-147 and is the most popular series of Ibanez electric guitars produced by Hoshino Gakki. The RG's deep cutaway, flatter fingerboard and extended fret range (24 frets as standard) has made it one of the most popular guitars for rock and metal music.  Origin and name  The Ibanez RG was originally designed in 1987, the same year as Steve Vai's signature guitar JEM 777, and perhaps RG was received and served as a derivative of Vai's model back then. Also, there has been some confusion and mischief around the RG name. One of the popular opinion was that Rocky George (guitarist formerly of Suicidal Tendencies, currently of Fishbone), was its designer, because Rocky's initials are the same as the model, and he was one of the first famous users of the RG model. Another was that it was meant to be a competitor for Yamaha RGX. Both above are disputed. The RG in the Ibanez RG name, in reality, is now widely considered to mean \\"Roadstar Guitar\\", although current instruments differ significantly from the past Roadstar and Roadstar II series, introduced in from 1979 to 1986.  Features  = Neck = The RG Series features a neck that is very thin in cross-section a wide, flatter than most (430mm/16.9in or 400mm/15.75in radius) double octave (24 fret) fretboard. Flatter radius on fretboards facilitate wider bends and lower string action at the expense of comfort in playing chords. For the virtuosic \\"shred\\" style of guitar playing or fast, aggressive thrash/speed metal rhythm, this type of neck is often preferred. The fretboards are usually made of maple or rosewood. = Body = The body of the RG Series features sleek, offset pointed double cutaways giving better access to the upper frets. Typically the body is made of Basswood or Mahogany, with some exception such as swamp ash (RGT220A) or alder (select J Custom RGs). = Hardware = The pickups are usually configured as HSH, HSS or HH. There are Japan-Custom IBZ, USA-Custom IBZ, Infinity, Powersound, Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, Acis, LoZ or EMG pickups in the RG Tremolo and Fixed series. The Prestige series typically comes equipped with either the USA and Japan IBZ series, IBZ DiMarzio pickups, DiMarzio pickups in different configurations (most often the \\"Tone Zone\\" and \\"Air Norton\\"), active EMGs in several configurations, and one model comes equipped with Non-OEM Seymour Duncans. Bare Knuckle pickups are now standard on some Prestige models. All of the RG550s, 560s, 565s, 570s, 670s 750s, 760s and 770s have a version of the Ibanez Edge tremolo (vibrato unit), be it Original or Lo-Pro. The Edge tremolo incorporated several manufacturing changes when compared to the original Floyd Rose, including increased mass, relocated fine tuners and improved locking posts. The locking posts are no longer used as of the 2003 model year along with the introduction of the Edge Pro. While most models of the RG series use variations of Ibanez Edge tremolo, there are fixed bridge models available, which are equipped with either a Hipshot-style bridge or a Gibraltar standard bridge. Fixed bridge versions of the Edge bridge are also available on a few select signature models. = Extra string models = Since the release of RG7620 and 7621 in 1998, RG's are famous for being the basis of particularly easy to play seven string guitars. Also, in 2007, Ibanez produced its first commercially available 8 string guitar, the RG2228. Ibanez introduced their first commercial nine-string models, the RG9QM and RG90BKP, for 2014.  Model variations  In addition to \\"standard\\" RG Series, there are various sub-series of guitars available: ;RGA :Arched top body shape. Introduced in 2005. ;RGD :Longer 26¬Ω\\" scale length, optimized for down-tuning. Introduced in 2010. ;RGV :RG guitars with traditional synchronized tremolos. Introduced in 2016. ;RT :More \\"traditional\\" features and look, such as non- locking synchronized style bridge. Available only in 1992‚Äì1993. ;RX :Same concept as RT, except these are 22 fret guitars. Introduced in 1994. Additionally, current the RG series and related sub-series are split into following versions depending on quality: ;J Custom line :Highest quality RG guitars produced in Japan by FujiGen or Sugi Guitars. Introduced in 1996. Most J Customs are offered exclusively in the Japanese domestic market, but a handful have been made available in other markets around the world. ;Prestige line :High quality RG guitars which are made in Japan by FujiGen. The Prestige series was instituted in 1996. All Japanese-made RG models since 2003 are included in the Prestige line including those in the RGA and RGD series. Prior to 2003 many Japanese-made RGs were not designated as Prestige. ;Premium line :Mid-tier guitars produced in a special facility set up in Indonesia. The Premium line started in 2010 and sits above the \\"standard\\" RGs and below the Prestige series. Some recent () Premium models have upscale features not offered in the Prestige line such as stainless steel frets and necks laminated from eleven pieces of wood. ;Iron Label line :Indonesian-made RG guitars that are primarily aimed at the metal guitarist. The Iron Label line started in 2013. ;GIO line :Entry-level guitars which are produced primarily in China.

Summary Sartre argues that while some believe imagining to be like an internal perception, imagination is nothing like perception. Perception is our study over time of a particular object with our senses. It is necessarily incomplete; one can only see one side of a chair at a time, for example. Thus, perception involves observation. By contrast, imagination is total. In the chair that appears in our imagination, we have all sides of the chair given to us at once. However, Sartre points out that imaginary objects cannot teach us anything. The totality of the chair that appears in our imagination comes from a synthesis of our knowledge of the chair and our intention toward it. We expect the chair to be X or Y, therefore, in our imagination, it appears to us this way. Thus, Sartre calls what goes on when we picture something imaginary, \\"quasi-observation\\". Imaginary objects are a \\"melange of past impressions and recent knowledge\\" (The Imaginary 90). In short, imaginary objects are what we intend them to be. Because imaginary objects appear to us in a way which is like perception but is not perception, we have a tendency to treat them as if they were real. That is not to say we are deluded; we know that they're imaginary. But we tend to ascribe emotions, traits, and beliefs to these irreal objects as if they were real. Throughout the book Sartre offers arguments against conceiving images as something inside a spatial consciousness. Sartre refers to this idea as the \\"illusion of immanence\\". Sartre says that what is required for the imaginary process to occur is an analogon‚Äîthat is, an equivalent of perception. This can be a painting, a photograph, a sketch, or even the mental image we conjure when we think of someone or something. Through the imaginary process, the analogon loses its own sense and takes on the sense of the object it represents. Again, we are not deluded. But at some level the photograph of my father ceases being merely colors on paper and instead stands in for my absent father. I then have a tendency to ascribe the feelings I have about my father to the picture of him. Thus, an analogon can take on new qualities based on my own intention toward it. Ultimately, Sartre argues that because we can imagine, we are ontologically free. A consciousness that could not imagine, he points out, would be hopelessly mired in the \\"real\\", incapable of the perception of unrealized possibilities, and thus any real freedom of thought or choice. In order to imagine, a consciousness must be able to posit an object as irreal‚Äînonexistent, absent, somewhere else and it does so always from a particular point of view. All of our engagements with the world have the potential to activate the imaginary process. And because the imaginary process relies on intentionality, the world is constituted not from the outside into our consciousness, but rather we constitute the world based on our intentions toward it.
