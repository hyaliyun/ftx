His first important contribution to the field was a 1977 book on Italian syntax. He achieved international recognition in 1981 for his book Transformational Syntax, which sold over 30,000 copies and was the standard introduction to Chomsky's Government and Binding Theory for many years; and this was followed by an introduction to transformational grammar in 1988, which sold over 70,000. He has since published several books on syntax within the framework of generative grammar and the Minimalist Program of Noam Chomsky, a number of which have appeared in the series Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics. In the 1990s, Radford was a pioneer of the maturation-based structure building model of child language, and the acquisition of functional categories in early child English within the Principles and Parameters framework, in which children are seen as gradually building up more and more complex structures, with lexical categories (like noun and verb) being acquired before functional-syntactic categories (like determiner and complementiser): this research resulted in the publication of a monograph on Syntactic Theory and the Acquisition of English Syntax in 1990, and numerous articles on the acquisition of syntax by monolingual, bilingual and language- disordered children. Since 2010, Radford has researched the syntax of colloquial English, using data recorded from unscripted radio and TV broadcasts. He produced a research monograph on this, and a number of articles, and is preparing a follow-up research monograph on the syntax of relative clauses in colloquial English.See (2012a, 2013, 2015b) within \\"Other selected publications\\".Colloquial English: Structure and Variation, Cambridge University Press. Accessed 10 January 2018. Since January 2014, Radford has been an Emeritus Professor of the Department of Language and Linguistics, University of Essex.\\"People: Professor Andrew Radford\\". University of Essex. Education Radford was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, reading Modern Languages (French, Italian and Romanian), Linguistics and Romance Philology. He graduated with a first-class degree and was awarded a research scholarship by Trinity College, Cambridge. He completed a PhD on Italian syntax there, supervised by Pieter Seuren. Career Radford was a Research Fellow in Linguistics at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1971 to 1975, before taking up posts as lecturer in Linguistics in the School of English & American Studies at the University of East Anglia (1975‚Äì76), Lecturer in Linguistics in the Faculty of Modern & Medieval Languages at the University of Oxford (1976‚Äì78), and Reader in Linguistics in the Department of Language and Linguistics at the University of Essex (1978‚Äì80). In 1980, he became Professor of Linguistics at the University College of North Wales, serving first as Head of the Department of Linguistics (1980‚Äì87), and later as Head of the School of Modern Languages and Linguistics (1987‚Äì89). In 1989, he returned to the University of Essex as Professor of Linguistics, where he served three terms as Head of the Department of Language and Linguistics, and one as Dean of the School of Humanities and Comparative Studies. He retired at the end of 2013, and has been Emeritus Professor at Essex since then. He served on the editorial board of the Journal of Linguistics, Journal of Child Language, Studies in Theoretical Psycholinguistics, Studies in Language Sciences, Chomskyan Studies, Rivista di Grammatica Generativa, and Iberia. He also served two spells as a member of the Linguistics Review Panel for the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Structure building model In his 1990 book, Syntactic Theory and the Acquisition of English Syntax, Radford summarizes the state of a maturation hypothesis for child language acquisition.Joseph Galasso, \\"Synopsis of the Structure-building model of Andrew Radford (1990): And other maturational hypotheses leading to child development theories of the time\\" (MS, California State University Northridge, 2017). Working within the principles and parameters frameworkNoam Chomsky, Lectures on Government and Binding (Dordrecht: Foris, 1981), and Some notes on Economy of Derivation and Representation (MS, MIT, 1988). as his point of departure, and drawing from previous work done by Hagit Borer and Kenneth WexlerHagit Borer and Kenneth Wexler, \\"The maturation of Syntax\\" (1983); in Thomas Roeper and Edwin Williams (eds), Parameter Setting (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 2013), pp. 123‚Äì172. on the apparent absence of A-chains in early grammar, Radford proposed a structure-building model focused (inter alia) on the lack of syntactic movement-operations in the early multi-word stage of child English syntax, viz. the lack of inflectional morphology. This led to an analysis that described children as gradually building up increasingly complex structure, with Lexical/thematic stage-1 (lexical categories like noun and verb) preceding Functional/syntactic stage-2 (functional categories like determiner and complementiser).

In its heyday it provided flowers to some of Chicago's most prominent and infamous citizens.  History  Schofield's Flowers was established just before the turn of the last century in 1896 by William F. Schofield, A.K.A. \\"Big Bill\\". It was located at 738 North State Street, directly across the street from Holy Name Cathedral, on the corner of State Street and Superior Avenue on the north side of the city of Chicago. Owned and operated by William F. Schofield, better known as \\"Big Bill\\", a young Irishman who came to America with his wife, Nellie Malloy. Schofield's Flowers flourished in the hardscrabble neighborhood, a family-run business became infamous. Popular culture In 1921, with only $10,000 dollars and a tommy gun in hand, notorious mobster Dean O'Banion made Schofield an offer he could not refuse. They became \\"business\\" partners. The Chicago North Side Gang transformed Schofield's into the florist of choice for mob funerals, all of the North State Street Gang's weddings, holidays and special occasions, like providing the wreaths for the victims of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. Dean O'Banion was murdered in a mob hit on November 10, 1924 while clipping chrysanthemums at the age of 32 years. The triggermen were members of Al Capone‚Äôs Chicago Outfit: Frankie Yale, John Scalise and Albert Anselmi After O‚ÄôBanion‚Äôs death, Schofield's Flowers lived on, with Bugs Moran taking over the North State Street Gang, along with Hymie Weiss, better known as \\"Hymie the Pol Weise.\\" Later years and closure After Prohibition, like the whole country, Schofield's Flowers experienced financial hardship during the Great Depression, (1929‚Äì39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world. At one time, \\"Big Bill\\" owned a foursquare block of land from Superior to Chicago Avenue and State Street to Dearborn Avenue. \\"Big Bill\\" lost everything but his flower shop, later renting from a Jewish family, one of his top clients who helped him through hard times. He made the papers again in the late 1960s when \\"Big Bill‚Äôs\\" son, Stephen Eugene Schofield, was arrested and eventually charged with gambling, \\"Scof\\", as he was known to friends, was sentenced to one year at Sandstone Federal Penitentiary by Judge Julius Hoffman. Hoffman refused to honor a plea bargain, instead opting to make an example of the case. He painted the Schofield Family as willing participants in organized crime since the 1920s, pointing to its association with O‚ÄôBanion and the North State Street Gang as proof. Schofield, Sr.‚Äôs wife Gwen took over the flower shop while she continued to raise their two children, Steven (Scof, Jr.) and Sandra. After his release six months later, Schofield Sr. rejoined his family business, after which it grew into one of the first FTD member florists. On September 3, 1974, Schofield Sr. died of a massive heart attack. Again Schofield's Flowers supplied one of the biggest funerals for one of their own Irish sons. Local dignitaries Mayor Daley, Eddie Kelley, head of the 47th Ward and the Chicago Park District, and George Dunn, head of the 42nd Ward and Cook County Commissioner joined the other 2,000 mourners. Schofield's Flowers continued in business, at 731 North Dearborn Street, run by surviving family members, wife Gwen and son Steven until it was sold to LaSalle Flowers in 1976. The original building was torn down on August 13, 1960 and is currently a parking lot.

Created in 1887 as the Sketch Club, the organization was created by local San Francisco Bay Area women to support and promote the talents of established and emerging Bay Area women artists. Located in San Francisco's Sunset District, SFWA is a nonprofit organization that welcomes all genders, while specifically serving women artists.  History  Initially known as the Sketch Club, SFWA was organized by independent women who met to share and critique each other's work and to counter the all-male Bohemian Club. The Sketch Club met monthly and also went on field trips. In 1887, the group's activities included lectures, semi-annual exhibits, weekly sketching trips to the East Bay, summer trips to Aptos, and trips to Pacific Grove. The group also established a university art scholarship in 1887. In 1894, 28 members exhibited their artwork in the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894, held in the California Pavilion. The organization was active until its San Francisco headquarters was destroyed during the 1906 earthquake. After the earthquake, the group began to exhibit men's work regularly, and in 1915 it merged with the San Francisco Art Association to create a coed organization. This merger did not last long, and by 1925, the women of the Society had branched off and formed the Society of San Francisco Women Artists (SSFWA). SSFWA held its first solo exhibit in 1926, and its meetings were held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which was at that time located on Van Ness Avenue. In 1931, the SSFWA sponsored the first decorative native arts exhibit at the De Young Museum. In 1932 the SSFWA exhibited Frida Kahlo's \\"Frida and Diego Rivera\\" at its 6th Annual Exhibition. This exhibit marked the first public showing of Kahlo's work. In 1939, it contributed to the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition with murals, artists, and landscape architects. During World War II, the SSFWA partnered with the Red Cross to help rehabilitate servicemen in local hospitals. By 1946 the SSFWA changed its name to San Francisco Women Artists and began a 30+ year relationship with Marchelle Labaudt (future Executive Secretary) and her Gough Street Lucien Labaudt Art Gallery. In 1976 the SFWA and Labaudt were commended by the Senate for their \\"outstanding contributions to the cultural enhancement of the City of San Francisco.\\" In 1983, the SFWA procured a gallery that provided exhibition space for members. After moving galleries multiple times in the 1980s and 90s, the organization held two landmark exhibitions, \\"Hands and Heart, the Art of Healing\\" in 1997 and \\"To Life\\" in 1998, which received praise from First Lady Hillary Clinton. In 2009 the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutger's University included the SFWA in a historical survey on organizations promoting women and women artists. In 2014, the design firm Studio Hinrichs designed the new SFWA logo pro bono while the organization was going through a rebranding. In July 2015, SFWA moved to the Inner Sunset area of San Francisco. Most recently, in 2016, SFWA was awarded the Neighborhood Arts Collaborative grant from the SF Grants to the Arts. The organization runs a student intern program in conjunction with the Mayor's Youth Education & Employment Program (MYEEP) and the Mercy High School \\"Women in Arts\\" Program as well as different educational presentations and discussions that are open to the public. These talks include the \\"artist-in-action\\" demonstrations, where SFWA artists teach the community different techniques and skills.  Notable former members  Members have included the artists Marcella Labaudt, Alice B. Crittenden, M. Evelyn McCormick, Helen Hyde, Dorr Bothwell, Claire Falkenstein, Ruth Asawa, Nell Sinton, Eva Almond Withrow, Imogen Cunningham, Emmy Lou Packard, Dorothy Winslade, Eleanor Dickenson, Dora Williams, Matilda Lotz, Clara Taggart McChesney and Ruth Bernhard.  Funding  San Francisco Women Artists is funded by its member artists, gallery activities and programs, individual donations, and grants. SFWA has received the San Francisco Arts Commission: SF Grants for the Arts, Neighborhood Arts Collaborative, and the Voluntary Arts Contribution Fund. It is currently a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization.

The major language of the region is Magahi. Language Magahi language spoken in south Bihar. It is Bihari group of Indo Aryan language. Around 16 million people speak Magahi as native language. It is spoken in eight districts of Bihar (Gaya, Patna, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura, Arwal), seven districts of Jharkhand (Hazaribag, Chatra, Koderma, Jamtara, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Giridih) and in West Bengal's Malda district. Culture Magahi culture refers to culture of Magadh. Culture of Magadh has been rich since ancient times and the land has produced many important personalities who contributed in India‚Äôs development. The land has been epicenter of various religious and political movements since ancient times. Lord Buddha and Mahavira got enlightenment on this land and moved around the neighboring places for their religious preaching. Buddha advocated ‚ÄòThe Middle Path‚Äô for his disciples. He talked of Ashtangika-marga for attaining nirvana, which is liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Mahavira advocated rigorous asceticism for his disciples. Both Buddhism and Jainism stood for the reason of truth and non-violence. Sikhism also has roots in Magadh. Sikh‚Äôs tenth Guru, Guru Govind Singh was born on this land. In nineteenth century, during struggle for independence against British, Patna became the centre for Wahabi movement. This movement was led by Sayyed Ahmed Shahid. It was both a political and religious movement. The movement was aimed towards reforming Islam. But for achieving this, reformers thought that independence from British was must. So they also acted against British. =Arts= Lomas Rishi Cave in the Barabar Caves, 3rd century BCE. Magadh has contributed a lot to the Indian culture. Mauryan art is the first imperial art in India. Ashokan pillars are unique and their incredible ‚Äòfinish‚Äô is the pride of Indian Architecture. These pillars are carved out of a single rock. These rocks pillars are polished in such a fashion that they appear to be made of metal. Such polishing is striking example of Mauryan art and the technique vanished after Ashoka. Pillar at Sarnath is one of the Ashoka‚Äôs pillars. The four lions carved on the top of the pillar are chosen as the national symbol of independent India. There is Iranian influence on Mauryan art. In Indian history, Ashoka was first to use inscriptions for spreading his messages. He followed the tradition of inscriptions from Iran. The tradition of rock-cut caves in India begun with the Mauryas. Rock-cut caves in the Barabar and Nagarjuni hills in Gaya are examples from Mauryan period. These were excavated by Ashoka and his grandson Dasaratha for the abode of Ajivika monks. A glimpse of the folk art of the period can be seen in the Yaksha and Yakshani figures found from Mathura, Pawa, and Patna. The Yakshini statue from Didarganj, near Patna is the most famous one and shows Mauryan polish. =Religion= Gupta‚Äôs contributions to the Indian culture are also remarkable. Hinduism reemerged in the form of Bhagavatism (Vaishnavism), Saivism and Saktism. Bhakti became central to the philosophy of Hinduism. Deo Surya Mandir World Top Sun Temple in Deo, Bihar, Aurangabad Bihar, India Hinduism also got influenced by Buddhism. Under this influence Vaishnavism imbibed Buddha as one of the incarnations of Vishnu. Sculptures and temples of Gupta period are milestone in the field of art. Guptas were first to use dressed stone for temple construction. Before this, temples were made of wood or other perishable material. Maha Bodhi Temple Gupta period is known as the ‚Äúclassical period‚Äù in the genre of sculpture as they were a combination of spirituality and idealism into art. This combination gets reflected in the images of Vishnu, in Dasavtara Temple at Deogarh. The seated Buddha from Sarnath and standing Buddha from Mathura represent fully developed form of Buddhist art. Their radiant spiritual expression carved with grace and refinement makes them masterpieces (Lal ed. 2002). Paintings at Ajanta and Ellora caves were made during Gupta period. =Literature= Nalanda University India ruins Arthashastra, written by Chanakya, is an important literature of the period for understanding politics and administration in general. Aryabhata, an outstanding scholar of the Gupta age, lived at Kusumpura, near Patna. He wrote Aryabhattiya, which talks about geometry. He was first to use decimal and thus gave a new dimension to mathematics. He was first to give right reasons behind eclipses. Aryabhata was first to utilize sign functions in astronomy. This age contributed Puranas and Smiritis to the Hindu literature. Kavyas such as Meghduta, Raguvansa and Kumarsambhava, dramas such as Abhijnashakuntalam, Mudrarakshasa and Devichandragupta are contribution of Gupta period to Indian literature (Lal ed. 2002). Guptas established many Universities for promoting education. Nalanda University was one of them. It was famous for education in religion and philosophy. Students from all over India, China, Tibet, Indonesia and Sri Lanka used to come here for studies. The famous Chinese pilgrim Hiuen-Tsang studied at Nalanda University. Hiuen-Tsang mentioned the glory of Nalanda University in his book Si-yu-ki. I-tsing stayed at Nalanda for ten years. He translated many Sanskrit manuscripts into Chinese. =Festivals= Chhath is important festival of Magahi people. Other important festival are Holi, Durga Puja, Jitiya, Teej, Diwali, Kajari, Basant Panchami, Vishua ie Magadhi New Year and Holi. =Music and dance= Magahi folk singers Folk songs and folk dance are an important aspect of Magadh culture. Folk songs like Phaag and Chaita are sung all over Bihar. While Phaag are sung in the month of Phalgun, Chaita are sung in the month of Chait. Rajashah of Patna is a famous name in the field of Indian classical music. He has not only reclassified the Indian Ragas but also discovered a new musical instrument called ‚ÄòThaat‚Äô. Rajashah also authored a book ‚ÄòNagmat Ashfi‚Äô on Indian music. Folk music of Bihar reflects the culture of its day to day life. Sanskaar geet like Sohar, Khilona, Khobar, Sumaangali are sung at various occasions like birth, moondan, marriage etc. There are different kinds of songs for each kind of festival celebrated in the region. Various folk dances performed by local people in the area are: Dhobia Nritya, Karia, Jhumar, Jhijhiya, Jharni Nritya, Jat-Jatin, Sama chakeva and Domkach. These dances are based on different religious, historical and social significance. =Cinema= Many movies also reflect the culture of Magadh. In the movie ‚ÄòAbhijan‚Äô, which was directed by Satyajit Ray, the actress Vahida Rahman delivered her dialogues in Magahi. Other famous Magahi films are ‚ÄòMaiyaa‚Äô directed by Fani Majumdar and ‚ÄòMore Man Mitwa‚Äô directed by Girish Ranjan. =Painting= In the genre of painting, Magadh is known for its ‚ÄòPatna Kalam Shaili‚Äô. The influence of both Mughals and British are found on the paintings of this school. Along with carrying these influences, this school has developed its own local features which make them unique. The famous painters of this school are Sevak Ram, Hulas Lal, Jayram Das and Shivdayal Lal.

Issues =Toll roads= Lingamfelter is a supporter of toll roads, having introduced a bill allowing tolls on any Virginia interstate highway, with the proceeds being set aside to \\"[p]ay or finance all or part of the costs of programs or projects, including without limitation the costs of planning, operation, maintenance and improvements incurred in connection with the toll facility provided that such allocations shall be limited to programs and projects that are reasonably related to or benefit the users of the toll facility\\";HB 2314 Tolls; provides for imposition and collection thereof for use of any component of Interstate system this is a position for which he has been attacked by Day in campaign literature as a contradiction of his self- portrayal as a fiscal conservative. Lingamfelter believes that tolls are a logical way to link road use with road financing. He defended his decision by saying, \\"We need to build some roads, okay?\\"Transportation Needs Intersect With Cultural Divide, The Washington Post. He also pointed out that tolls capture revenue from out-of-state travelers.Va. could charge tolls on interstate , Lillian Kafka, Potomac News, Feb. 13, 2007. Lingamfelter's toll bills require the use of automated toll collection. Despite the criticism, Lingamfelter's website calls attention to the toll bills, saying, \\"Virginians who travel throughout the country pay tolls in other states which go to make necessary improvements to the highway systems within those states.

The case was an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong, but as the case was decided in Hong Kong pursuant to the English Law Ordinance, section 3(1),Which provides \\"The common law and the rules of equity shall be in force in Hong Kong...\\" it is also taken to be an authoritative statement of English law. Facts Bouygues SA together with nine other co-plaintiffs made a claim under a policy of insurance against Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd. Red Sea Insurance was an insurance company incorporated in Hong Kong, but with its head office located in Saudi Arabia. In its counterclaim Red Sea Insurance alleged that one of the co-plaintiffs, PCG, negligently supplied faulty pre- cast concrete building units, and that if it was liable at all, Red Sea Insurance would be subrogated to the claims of the other co-plaintiffs against PCG. PCG applied to strike out that counterclaim. Red Sea then amended its pleading and claimed that the proper law governing the relations between Red Sea and PCG was the law of Saudi Arabia, and that under Saudi Arabian law, Red Sea had a direct right of action against PCG. Those claims failed at first instance and in the Court of Appeal because: * under Hong Kong law the right of action could only arise by way of subrogation once the claim had been paid under the policy of insurance; * in order succeed in their amended counterclaim Red Sea needed to establish that they had a right of action under both Saudi Arabian law and Hong Kong law to satisfy the double actionability test; * even though they had a good arguable case that there was a cause of action in tort under Saudi law, because they claim failed under Hong Kong law, it failed the dual actionability test, and therefore the claim was struck out. Red Sea appealed to the Privy Council. Decision Lord Slynn of Hadley gave the decision of the board. After reviewing the relevant authorities Lord Slynn held that the \\"flexible exception\\" to the double actionability requirement which had been created by the House of Lords in Boys v Chaplin [1971] AC 356 could apply in favour of not only the forum (the lex fori) but also in favour of the law of the place where the tort occurred (the lex loci delicti commissi). In this case the facts were overwhelmingly connected with Saudi Arabia, and so Saudi Arabian law only should be applied to the relevant issue. Lord Slynn further held that although Boys v Chaplin was predicated on a single issue (heads of loss) being subject to the flexible exception, it was possible that an entire claim could be subject to the exception. He stated: \\"The present appeal is not based on an isolated issue (as was the case in Boys v Chaplin). The contention put forward is that the whole case be decided according to the lex loci delictii. Although the cases may be rare where the exception should be applied the whole case, their Lordships do not consider that to apply the exception to the whole case is in principle necessarily excluded. In their Lordship's view the exception is not limited to specific isolated issues but may apply to the whole claim\\".[1995] 1 AC 190 at 207A-B Authority In England the decision was followed by the Court of Appeal in Pearce v Ove Arup Partnership Ltd [2000] Ch 403, it has now largely been superseded by the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995. However, it remains good law in other common law jurisdictions, and in England for claims relating to defamation. In Canada, the double actionability rule itself was reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Tolofson v Jensen [1994] 3 SCR 1022, although the Supreme Court retained the concept of a flexible exception. Similarly, in Australia the double actionability rule was abrogated by the High Court of Australia in John Pfieffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503. But similarly, a broad public policy style flexible exception similar to that in Red Sea Insurance v Bouygues SA was retained.

As distributional word-vectors can be built automatically from large-scale corpora,Harris, Z. (1954). \\"Distributional structure\\". Word. 10 (23): 146‚Äì162. this enrichment supports the construction of databases which can embed large-scale commonsense background knowledge into their operations. Distributional-Relational models can be applied to the construction of schema-agnostic databases (databases in which users can query the data without being aware of its schema), semantic search, schema-integration and inductive and abductive reasoners as well as different applications in which a semantically flexible knowledge representation model is needed. The main advantage of distributional‚Äìrelational models over purely logical / semantic web models is the fact that the core semantic associations can be automatically captured from corpora in contrast to the definition of manually curated ontologies and rule knowledge bases.  Distributional‚Äìrelational models  Distributional‚Äìrelational models were first formalized Freitas, A. ‚ÄúSchema- agnostic queries over large-schema databases: a distributional semantics approach‚Äù PhD Thesis, 2015Freitas, A., Handschuh, S., Curry, E., Distributional-Relational Models: Scalable Semantics for Databases, AAAI Spring Symposium, Knowledge Representation & Reasoning Track, Stanford, 2014 as a mechanism to cope with the vocabulary/semantic gap between users and the schema behind the data. In this scenario, distributional semantic relatedness measures, combined with semantic pivoting heuristics can support the approximation between user queries (expressed in their own vocabulary) and data (expressed in the vocabulary of the designer). In this model, the database symbols (entities and relations) are embedded into a distributional semantic space and have a geometric interpretation under a latent or explicit semantic space. The geometric aspect supports the semantic approximation between entities from different databases or between a query term and a database entity. The distributional relational model then becomes a double layered model where the semantics of the structured data provides the fine- grained semantics intended by the database designer, which is extended by the distributional semantic model which contains the semantic associations expressed at a broader use. These models support the generalization from a closed communication scenario (in which database designers and users live in the same context, e.g. the same organization) to an open communication scenario (e.g. different organizations, the Web), creating an abstraction layer between users and the specific representation of the conceptual model.

Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. New Hampshire voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, over the Democratic nominee, Ambassador John W. Davis of West Virginia. Coolidge ran with former Budget Director Charles G. Dawes of Illinois, while Davis ran with Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska. Also in the running that year was the Progressive Party nominee, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and his running mate Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana. La Follette‚Äôs support base was primarily among rural German and Scandinavian Americans,Stark, Rodney and Christiano, Kevin J.; ‚ÄòSupport for the American Left, 1920-1924: The Opiate Thesis Reconsidered‚Äô; Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 31, No. 1 (March, 1992), pp. 62-75 and he possessed little appeal in the Northeast outside a few New York and Boston anti-Prohibition precincts. Excluding the former Confederacy where the lower classes were almost entirely disfranchised, New Hampshire would prove La Follette‚Äôs third-weakest state ‚Äì and overall the Granite State was La Follette‚Äôs tenth-weakest of 48. Coolidge won New Hampshire by a margin of 25.11% of the vote, although this was marginally lower than his national margin of 25.22% over Davis. The 1920s were a fiercely Republican decade in American politics, and New Hampshire in that era was a fiercely Republican state in presidential elections. The economic boom and social good feelings of the Roaring Twenties under popular Republican leadership virtually guaranteed Calvin Coolidge an easy win in the state against the conservative Southern Democrat John Davis,Roseboom, Eugene Holloway and Eckes, Alfred E.; A History of Presidential Elections, from George Washington to Jimmy Carter; pp. 151-158 who had little appeal in Northern states like New Hampshire apart from being the only pro-League of Nations candidate.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 55 New Hampshire would still prove Davis‚Äô third-strongest antebellum free state behind Indiana and Rhode Island. Due to La Follette‚Äôs lack of appeal vis-√†-vis his Midwest and Western support base, both Coolidge and Davis exceeded their national vote share by around five percent in the Granite State. Coolidge also enjoyed a unique personal popularity which helped him in the state and the rest of New England. He was the epitome of a traditional New England Yankee, having been born in the small-town of Plymouth Notch in neighboring Vermont, and establishing his political career in neighboring Massachusetts as the state's governor. Thus Coolidge remained especially popular with voters across the New England region.

Using visually powerful action sequences and realistic performances, the film depicts the story of a simple housewife that becomes an assassin for money. A fiction feature film about a housewife living in the slums of Buenos Aires who becomes an assassin for hire to overcome the struggles of her emotional emptiness and tough economic situation. An intelligent and romantic detective investigates the murders. Stained of sexual tension, the relationship between the Detective and Matilde is both funny and refreshing. Madraza is a genre film that, using suspense, action and comedy, wanders through the many difficulties that citizens of Buenos Aires must endure. The movie¬¥s tone tends to satirize the current social perspective of Argentina and the limits of morale and insanity.

Katayev started working upon the novel in December 1925, although a 1925 short story titled \\"Grim Accident\\" (–ú—Ä–∞—á–Ω—ã–π —Å–ª—É—á–∞–π), published in the No.26 issue of Smekhach magazine, is considered to be its direct precursor, containing the embryo of a storyline. In August 1926 the novel was finished. Synopsis The accountant Filipp Stepanovich, cashier Vanechka and courier Nikita fall victim to the latest embezzlement 'epidemic' that had swept 90 per cent of the Moscow commercial institutions. They steal 12 thousand rubles which they'd been supposed to deliver from the bank to their firm, and embark upon a massive spree which takes them first to Leningrad, then to the Russian South and finally, penniless, back to Moscow, straight to jail.

I received a phone call from the Stanislavski quarters and was asked to write a play based upon the Embezzlers...\\", Katayev remembered in 1948. In 1927 the Moscow Art Theatre started working upon the production, directed by Nikolai Gorchakov. In 1928 the play premiered to considerable critical acclaim.

He was married to a daughter of Satyros, and to Tirgatao, a powerful Maeotian princess from the tribe of the Ixomatae. He was also the father of Oktamasades, who would later usurp the throne from his father, in which Leukon, seeing an opportunity to annex the Sindike, waged war on Oktamasades. Reign Not much is known about Hekataios's life or much of his reign, only that he, instead of killing Tirgatao on Satyros's advice, locked her away in a castle in which she eventually got away from. Satyros and Leukon searched for her, but she eluded them. She would wage war on both her former husband and Satyros, forcing them to sue for peace. Losing the throne and Abdication Oktamasades usurped the throne from his father, and then found himself in a war against Leukon, a Bosporan king and ally of his father. Leukon had managed to drive Oktamasades into Scythia after a single battle, in which reportedly Leukon said that he ‚Äúmade a vow to erect a victory monument, but not to the local Apollo of Labrys, but to the supreme deity and patron of all the Bosporans, Apollo the Healer.\\" Leukon then persuaded Hekataios to resign the throne and give it to him instead, which Hekataios is said to have agreed to. This would make the Sindike Kingdom the Asiatic portion of the Bosporan Kingdom, under which Gorgippos would rule.

Eventually, Heubusch was named as Smith's chief of staff, while also serving as a House Budget Committee staffer, with a focus on defense. Rep. Smith, a conservative former fighter pilot, was keen on rooting out Pentagon waste and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of defense equipment and systems. Concerned about the poor quality of weapons testing to ensure combat readiness, Smith was instrumental in creating the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E;) in 1983 as part of the Defense Authorization bill. (Heubusch helped craft Smith's amendment.) The idea was to create an independent office within the Defense Department that would act as a testing watchdog; despite some good work, OT&E; later became part of the cover-up of poorly designed weapons systems.Church, Foster, The Oregonian, July 11, 1988, \\"Smith in the Middle of Aegis Issue\\" Smith was forced to step up his work on the 133-member Military Reform Caucus (with Heubusch as staff director).

This followed the revelation of data in 1985 that, according to Heubusch at the time, showed that weapon impacts \\"caused problems with ammunition fires and explosions more serious than what the Army has let on.\\"South Florida Sun-Sentinel, November 21, 1985, \\"Fighting Vehicle Pleases the Army\\" In 1986, Heubusch and Smith also protested the Bradley's failure to ford streams without taking on massive amounts of water and sinking; \\"The Bradley doesn't swim worth a damn and the Army knows it,\\" Heubusch told reporters.Walker, Bill, Sacramento Bee, December 21, 1986, \\"Does Army Vehicle Sink Or Swim?\\" * Investigation of the Aegis air- defense system for US Navy vessels. In 1984, Smith ridiculed Navy testing of the Aegis system, saying it was conducted in secrecy, that the testing was too easy and that it produced inaccurate results. In 1988, a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf using Aegis shot down a 177-foot-long Iranian airliner (because it couldn't distinguish it from a 62-foot-long fighter), and 290 passengers were killed. Heubusch revealed that a General Accounting Office report on Aegis testing, made public in July 1988, confirmed Smith's contention that the Navy \\"essentially rigged the tests to prove it was easy for the ship to do what they said it would do.\\"Duin, Steve, Oregonian, July 14, 1988, \\"Frightening Flotsam of the Aegis affair\\"Royce, Knut, Newsday, July 17, 1988, \\"Weapons Test Flawed Report -- Report Faults Trials on Aegis System that Shot Down Jet\\" The reliably liberal Washington Monthly magazine looked backed in 1993 at the individuals who had contributed most to cleaning up the Pentagon during the Reagan era. \\"Many people, including a larger contingent of active- duty officers than might be guessed, played important roles in the military reform movement . . .\\" 17 men and women are named, among them Gary Hart and journalist James Fallows‚Äîand they include Smith and Heubusch.Washington Monthly, October 1993, \\"The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard.\\" In 1989, Heubusch left Capitol Hill to work for Elizabeth Dole, named as Secretary of Labor under new President George H.W. Bush.Foster Church & Alan R. Hayakawa, Oregonian, February 26, 1989, ‚ÄúJob Shuffle Takes Two Denny Smith Aides To Labor Department ‚Äú Heubusch became Dole's Chief of Staff.Alan K. Ota & Roberta Ulrich, Oregonian, November 4, 1990, ‚ÄúDole Resignation Sparks New Speculation‚Äù When Dole left the Labor Department to head the American Red Cross in 1991, Heubusch moved with her and became vice president of communications.Newsmakers, Washington Post, April 1, 1991  Executive Director of NRSC, 1995-96  Following the Republican landslide of 1994, Senator Alfonse D'Amato was named head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), one of the four permanent GOP campaign operations in Washington, responsible for maintaining the new GOP majority. Instead of the parochial practice (common then and now) of naming one of his own staffers to manage the sprawling 200-person operation, D'Amato and his chief strategist, Arthur Finkelstein, sought to professionalize the committee's operations. After an intensive search process, they named Heubusch as executive director.King, John, Associated Press, December 11, 1994, \\"POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: San Diego Almost A Done Deal\\" Other key hires included Jo Anne B. Barnhart as Political Director, and Gordon Hensley as Communications Director.Roll Call, September 23, 1996, p. A-24, \\"Politics' Fabulous Fifty\\" (Barnhart was a long- time aide and campaigner for Sen. William Roth, and later served as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.) They had a tough act to follow ‚Äî Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas had just piloted Republicans to a 7-seat gain and recaptured control of the Senate. The Bob Packwood sex-harassment scandal led to a costly special election, lost narrowly by GOP candidate Gordon Smith.AP story in Baltimore Sun, February 1, 1996, ‚ÄúOre. Democrat Finally Wins Senate Seat; Wyden Ends Party Losses From 1962, Calls Victory A Backlash Against GOP ‚Äú The NRSC faced several challenges beyond their control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995‚Äì96, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. The Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995 gave Bill Clinton an opportunity to marginalize his opponents, and slowed the momentum of the reform-minded Republican Congress. By late 1995, unrelenting Democratic and press attacks, and his own missteps, had turned Gingrich into a pariah through much of the country (2-to-1 unfav-fav ratio in surveys);Roman, Nancy E., Washington Times, January 23, 1996, \\"'96 elections: A referendum on GOP Congress\\" meanwhile, Dole was running for President, and allowing ambition to overshadow his Senate work. In mid-1996, Dole resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, but by then he was behind Clinton to stay, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide. D'Amato remained personally devoted to Bob Dole. Heubusch and the NRSC team urged Republican Senate candidates to carve out their own individual profiles on issues. The NRSC paid particular attention to blunting the wave of millionaire political unknowns (e.g., Tom Bruggere in Oregon, Mark Warner in Virginia, Elliott Close in South Carolina) recruited that year by the Democrats.Nakashima, Ellen & Hsu, Spencer S., Washington Post, October 7, 1996, ‚ÄúMark Warner Sets Va. Media Spending Record; Senate Candidate Puts $5.2 Million Into TV‚Äù It also shored up many endangered incumbents, including Bob Smith (New Hampshire), John Warner (Virginia), 75-year-old Jesse Helms and 94-year-old Strom Thurmond.Dewar, Helen, Washington Post, July 15, 1996, \\"Democrats' Senate Prospects Grow Brighter\\" Heubusch was also quick to exploit a June 1996 ruling by the US Supreme Court in a Colorado case, that allowed political parties to spend unlimited sums in campaigns, as long as the spending remained independent of candidates.Lambro, Donald, Washington Times, July 8, 1996, \\"Ruling unleashes cash for campaign \\" Heubusch immediately set up an independent arm of the NRSC to coordinate such expenditures.Marcus, Ruth, Washington Post, October 26, 1996, \\"Reinterpreting The Rules; 'Independent Expenditures' Alter Senate Races\\" There was aggressive independent spending in 14 Senate races \\"and we won nine of them\\", Heubusch later told the Washington Post.Washington Post, February 12, 1997 On Election Night, as Clinton defeated Dole by nearly 9 points and Gingrich's House Republicans lost a net 8 seats, Republicans won open Democratic seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska, while a GOP incumbent lost South Dakota. In a poor year for most Republicans, the NRSC under Heubusch had gained a net 2 seats, for a postwar GOP record total of 55 (and narrowly missed another gain in the Cleland-Millner race in Georgia). Heubusch, Barnhart and Hensley were later singled out by Roll Call newspaper in 1996 as among national \\"Politics' Fabulous Fifty.\\"Cook, Charles E., Roll Call, December 12, 1996, \\"Political Surveyor\\" column, p. 5  Gateway Computers and Ted Waitt, 1997-2008  In 1997, Heubusch was hired by Gateway Computers, the upstart South Dakota-based electronics manufacturer, as vice president for governmental affairs, creating and heading their DC office.Brasher, Philip, AP story in Toronto Globe & Mail, April 3, 1997 \\"Gateway woos Washington, PC supplier hires lobbyist, contributes to both parties\\" He was a registered lobbyist from 1997 to 1999,Data from US House of Representatives, Office of Records & Registration and on Gateway's behalf was a leading proponent of a ban on taxes on internet purchases. When President Bill Clinton endorsed such a moratorium in February 1998, Heubusch said: \\"We're looking at a wave of tremendous growth in the next 10 years no matter what legislation passes, because it's such a convenient way for someone to conduct business . . . If legislation like this doesn't pass, it will simply add to confusion for the consumer.\\"Sinocast, Comtex News Network, February 27, 1998, \\"What happens when Internet tax ban ends?\\" Gateway's founder and CEO Ted Waitt, known as a maverick in the tech industry, hired Heubusch for another reason. During the mid-1990s, computer software giant Microsoft had begun to challenge hardware manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and others for control of the \\"desktop.\\" Its core interest was in attempting to own the customer relationship by forcing hardware manufacturers such as Gateway to limit inclusion of nascent internet browsers to Microsoft only products, in particular Internet Explorer or \\"IE,\\" instead of Netscape's \\"Navigator.\\" Gateway was intent on providing customers with a choice of these new internet search tools and favored consumer personalization of the desktop. It saw Microsoft's demand as an antitrust violation given its monopolistic position in the marketplace. Microsoft provided the underlying operating system to run 95 percent of the world's personal computers at the time. Heubusch orchestrated an effort on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft's practices. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in particular were critical of the company's practices and forced the issue into the public eye. The most far reaching antitrust suit brought in the history of the department in relation to the U.S. computer industry resulted. The government's case was argued by famed attorney David Boies. In U.S. v Microsoft Corporation, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft's practices were in violation of antitrust laws. His judgement ordered the company to be broken into two separate business units, one to produce the operating system and one to produce software components. After years of various appeals, lobbying by Microsoft and the election of George W. Bush which led to new appointees at the Department of Justice, the company succeeded in denuding Judge Jackson's original order and the software giant, while chastened, was allowed to continue its monopolistic practices.\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp. By 2000, Heubusch had left Washington for Gateway's new headquarters in San Diego, and became Chief of Staff, answering directly to company founder Ted Waitt.,Wesch, Hank, San Diego Union-Tribune, August 11, 2001, \\"From the Murph to the turf by the surf\\" and later (in addition to Chief of Staff) vice president for strategy. One of the biggest challenges came when Waitt and Heubusch left the day-to-day management of Gateway for a single year, and in that time (calendar year 2001) the company had a loss of $1 billion, as sales fell 37% to $6.1 billion.McWilliams, Gary, Toronto Globe and Mail, May 28, 2002, \\"Gateway gets tougher Firm turns to methods of arch-rival Dell\\" Gateway struggled after the dot-com bust and tried several strategies to return to profitability, including withdrawal from international markets, reduction in the number of retail stores and most significantly, entering the consumer electronics business. However, none of these efforts was particularly successful from a financial standpoint, and Gateway continued to suffer major losses as well as market share in the PC business. By April 1, 2004, Gateway had announced that it would shut down its 188 remaining Gateway Country Stores. In March 2004, with the purchase of eMachines, Gateway management again changed, and Heubusch left his day to day executive duties to become assistant to the Chairman (Waitt) Gateway press release, PR Newswire, March 26, 2004, \\"Gateway Announces Leadership Team\\" After this change, more of Heubusch's time was occupied managing the Gateway founder's charitable and investment arms, including the Avalon Capital Group, the Waitt Institute, and the Waitt Family Foundation. His foundation work in particular bore several fruits, including: * Funding the purchase, authentication and restoration, with the National Geographic Society, of the Gnostic Gospel of Judas * Also with the National Geographic Society, executing the most extensive mapping project of the history of human migration, using DNA genome research * Organizing and funding the most thorough search to date for the lost airplane and remains of legendary aviatrix Amelia Earhart, involving an unprecedented sweep throughout the South Pacific. During Heubusch's management, the Waitt Foundation became the single largest supporting organization of the National Geographic Society. During his Gateway sojourn, Heubusch kept his hand in Republican politics, serving as an adviser to Elizabeth Dole's brief campaign for President in 1999,Ferraro, Thomas, Reuters, January 27, 1999, \\"Elizabeth Dole considers 2000 presidential bid\\" on the National Finance Committee in 2007 for John McCain's presidential campaign,McCain campaign press release, US Federal News, February 28, 2007, \\"Business And Industry Leaders To Spearhead Finance Effort\\" and on the Republican National Committee's Victory 2008 Finance Committee.RNC release, PR Newswire, April 25, 2008, \\"RNC Announces 2008 Victory Finance Chairs\\" Heubusch left Waitt at the end of 2007 to served briefly as CEO of Brahma Holdings, a start-up that allowed major insurance carriers to reduce their payouts for medical procedures dramatically by detecting fraud in big highly complicated cases.Bedard, Paul, U.S. News & World Report, March 16, 2009, \\"Defending Ronald Reagan and the GOP‚Äôs Brand\\" But his time there would be brief.  Ronald Reagan Foundation and Library, 2009-present  Heubusch at a book signing in 2017 In March 2009, Heubusch was selected by Nancy Reagan, chairman Fred Ryan and the Board of Trustees of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute to serve as its executive director.Staff reports, Ventura County Star, March 18, 2009, \\"Reagan Presidential Foundation appoints executive director, 2 board members\\" In an interview immediately thereafter, he announced that the Reagan Foundation is \\"about to rescue the cause of Reaganism from the jaws of Obamaism.\\" He called the Reagan name the \\"most important Republican brand\\" in decades and one that has to be defended as the memory of the former president fades. \\"One key goal is for me to make that name, Reagan, relevant in the modern sense.\\" Another is to answer critics who are attempting to attack the Reagan brand. \\"We want to be the ones who answer the question: What would Reagan do?\\" The Reagan Foundation board announced plans to help raise a $100-million endowment, centered on a celebration of the centennial of Reagan‚Äôs birthday in 2011. This would include $10 million to renovate the Library itself (in Simi Valley, California, to tell the expanding Reagan story. \\"This is necessary because in the over 20 years since President Reagan left office, scholars, historians, and public-policy officials have now had a chance to reflect on the contributions he made to this world, and the praise has only grown,\\" said Heubusch. The facility \\"needs to reflect what history is revealing.\\"Bedard, Paul, U.S. News & World Report, June 26, 2009, \\"Reagan: The Sequel Plans to celebrate Ronald Reagan‚Äôs 100th birthday in 2011 are well underway\\" The kickoff event was a 20th-anniversary celebration and conference on the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.Bakalis, Anna, Ventura County Star, October 14, 2009, \\"Conference expected to draw figures key to fall of the Berlin Wall\\" Obama created the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission, to celebrate the late President's centenary in 2011, but the bill provided no funding -- \\"which is the way Ronald Reagan would have had it,\\" Heubusch insisted, as he plumbed hard for private donations.Steiden, Bill, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, January 31, 2010, \\"Reagan‚Äôs status as a political icon endures\\" The gifts started to roll in‚Äîe.g., the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation announced a $12.75-million gift to help fund new state-of-the art interactive gallery displays at the Museum to exemplify the important role President Reagan had on the world and in people's lives,Associated Press, February 6, 2010, \\"Secretary Elizabeth Dole Promotes the Reagan Legacy During President Reagan‚Äôs 99th Birthday Celebration\\" and another $15 million for the Museum and to fund 200 college scholarships from General Electric (for which Reagan worked nearly a decade as spokesman).Business Wire, March 17, 2010, \\"Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Announces GE as Presenting Sponsor of the Ronald Reagan Centennial Celebration\\" The frenzied fundraising and activities led one writer to suggest that \\"Ronald Reagan is fast becoming the Elvis of the political world.\\"Bedard, Paul, U.S. News & World Report, April 9, 2010, \\"Reagan‚Äôs Elvis Moment\\" By February 2011, the goal Heubusch had set two years earlier was achieved -- $100 million raised.PR Newswire, February 6, 2011, \\"‚Äô100 on 100‚Äô: Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Passes $100 Million in Funds Raised for Foundation‚Äôs Endowment on President Reagan‚Äôs 100th\\" The centennial‚Äôs theme, agreed on by foundation officials and a bipartisan commission created by Congress, is \\"Ronald Reagan: Inspired Freedom, Changed the World\\"- a reference not just to his presiding over the end of the Cold War, Heubusch said, but also to \\"freedom from high taxes, high federal spending and useless regulations . . . It‚Äôs relevant in today‚Äôs debate, as people try to divine a way out of the economic mess we‚Äôre in.\\"Rein, Lisa, Washington Post, January 7, 2011, \\"Big plans to mark Reagan centennial\\" The Reagan Library is the most attended of the 14 presidential libraries‚Äîin 2011,Richardson, Valerie, Washington Times, February 4, 2011, \\"Library update grabs attention and holds it You-are-there sense keeps visits lively\\" and surpassed only once in 2014 by the then-new George W. Bush Museum in Dallas. One event needed adjusting‚Äîa planned May 2011 presidential debate sponsored by the Reagan Foundation had to be postponed until September, Heubusch announced. \\"Although there will be a long and impressive list of Republican candidates who eventually take the field, too few have made the commitment thus far for a debate to be worthwhile in early May.\\"Whitesides, John, Reuters, March 30, 2011, \\"First US Republican presidential debate postponed\\" In his years as Reagan Foundation chief, Heubusch has become a readily available spokesman on all Reagan matters, such as when a vial of the late President's blood was publicly auctioned in 2012,Dobuzinskis, Alex, Reuters story in Toronto Globe and Mail, May 22, 2012, \\"Fan of Reaganomics‚Äô put vial of Reagan‚Äôs blood up for sale\\" or when the former First Lady suffered broken ribs in a fall that same year.Associated Press, May 23, 2012, \\"Latest California news \\" In 2015, Heubusch and Ed Meese, who served as Counselor to the President (1981‚Äì1985) and Attorney General (1985‚Äì1988), penned a joint op-ed to detail numerous inaccuracies in Killing Reagan, a best-selling book by Bill O'Reilly, saying, \\"We believe that Killing Reagan does a real disservice to our 40th president and to history itself.\\" Today, the Reagan Foundation has nearly $350 million in assets, and an additional $125 million in the form of legacy gifts.  Author  In March 2017, Simon & Schuster (through its Howard imprint) published Heubusch's debut novel, The Shroud Conspiracy, a religious thriller concerning the turmoil after a forensic anthropologist discovers the Shroud of Turin - believed by many Christians to have been the burial cloth of Jesus Christ - is real. \\"Evil forces intend to use DNA from traces of blood in the fabric to clone Jesus and bring on a Second Coming of their own design,\\" as the Washington Times described the plot.Harper, Jennifer, Washington Times, March 14, 2017, \\"Inside the Beltway: New watchdog determined to ferret out Trump administration ‚Äòscandal‚Äô\\" NewsMax's Jane Blakemore called it \\"a pulse- pounding yarn\\" that \\"Heubusch pulls off with a poise that belies his status as a first-time novelist,\\". Steve Forbes, writing in Forbes, called it \\"a spectacular thriller.\\" Publishers Weekly noted \\"Heubusch‚Äôs thought-provoking conceit\\" and \\"interesting premise,\\" but criticized his \\"dense exposition and clunky characterization.\\" The book rose to rank as Amazon's #1 best-selling hardback in three categories. Heubusch's second novel, The Second Coming, was published in 2018. #1 New York Times best-selling author Brad Thor was quoted as saying the book is \\"a smart, electrifying thriller that delivers cover to cover.\\" Peggy Noonan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the Wall Street Journal, noted \\"John Heubusch is brilliant. I would read anything he writes.\\" Academy Award nominee Gary Sinise said the book \\"has the makings for a terrific movie.\\"  Personal life  In May 2013, Heubusch was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. Given six months to live, he underwent intensive chemotherapy, radiation treatments, a complicated surgery and immunotherapy treatments over a period of four years. He is presently cancer free. Heubusch and his wife, Marcella, live in the San Fernando Valley with their two children, Max and Jordana Heubusch.

Its population size has declined rapidly since the 1950s, and it is classified as critically endangered by the Australian government. Taxonomy In 2000, the common bent-wing bat of Australia was revised into three subspecies, including the southern bent-wing bat.Cardinal, B. R., & Christidis, L. (2000). Mitochondrial DNA and morphology reveal three geographically distinct lineages of the large bentwing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Australia. Australian Journal of Zoology, 48(1), 1-19. However, it is now recognized as a subspecies of the Australasian bent- wing bat (Miniopterus orianae). There is evidence to suggest that it is reproductively isolated from the other Australian subspecies, and warrants elevation to its own species based on genetics. =Etymology= The subspecies name is derived from the border between this subspecies and the eastern bent- wing bat, the Bassian volcanic plains. Description The southern bent-wing bat is slightly larger than the other two subspecies of bent-wing bats in Australia. It has an average weight of 15.7g and average forearm length of 47.6mm.Churchill, S. (2009). Australian bats. Allen and Unwin. Crows Nest, NSW. It roosts in caves and rock crevices. Its range is restricted to southeastern South Australia and southwestern Victoria.Codd, J. R., Sanderson, K. J., & Branford, A. J. (2003). Roosting activity budget of the southern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii). Australian Journal of Zoology, 51(3), 307-316. Their lifespans can be at least 20 years, as determined by the recapture of banded bats.Lumsden, L., & Gray, P. (2001). Longevity record for a Southern Bent-wing Bat Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii. The Australasian Bat Society Newsletter, 16, 43-4. =Reproduction= 200x200px Mating occurs in the autumn, but the embryo doesn't begin to grow until the spring due to delayed implantation.Dwyer, P. D. (1963). The breeding biology of Miniopterus schreibersi blepotis (Termminck)(Chiroptera) in north-eastern NSW. Australian Journal of Zoology, 11(2), 219-240. Females do not reproduce until their second year. The offspring, called pups, are born at 20% of their adult size, and reach full size by ten weeks of age. Southern bent-wing bats rely heavily on cave structure, choosing caves that allow high heat and humidity, which promotes development of their young, which are born hairless.Dwyer, P. D., & Hamilton- Smith, E. (1965). Breeding Caves and Maternity Colonies of the Bent-winged Bat in South-eastern Australia. The pups begin learning to fly at seven weeks old. Conservation The southern bent-wing bat is one of only five mammals in Australia to have the designation critically endangered; listing occurred in 2007.Lumsden, L. F., & Jemison, M. L. (2015). National Recovery Plan for the Southern Bent-wing Bat Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii. During the summer breeding season, most of the species forms maternity colonies in two caves, Bat Cave in Naracoorte Caves National Park and Starlight Cave in Warrnambool.Bourne, S., & Hamilton-Smith, E. (2007). Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii and climate change. Aust. Bat Soc. Newsl, 28, 67-69. The Naracoorte site hosted up to 200,000 individuals in the 1950s and 1960s, but in 2009, there were an estimated 20,000 individuals. =Reasons for decline= One possible cause of the species decline is climate change. In December 2006, over three hundred dead or dying bats were on the floor of Bat Cave, with other emaciated individuals still hanging on the walls. The cause of this mortality was attributed to lack of insects due to drought, in addition to a record number of cold nights that further suppressed insect activity. There has also been a significant decrease in genetic variation in recent years, which could cause further decline of the subspecies.Wood, R., and Appleton, B. (2010). Taxonomy, population genetics and conservation of the Critically Endangered Southern Bent-wing Bat (Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii). Abstract from the 14th Australasian Bat Society Conference, Darwin July 2010. The Australasian Bat Society Newsletter 35,17. Another possible cause of decline of this subspecies is guano mining in Australia, which frequently involved changing the shapes of caves to make extraction easier. Guano mining changed the cave environments by lowering their humidity, which possibly made them inhospitable to bat colonies.Baudunette, R. V., Wells, R. T., Sanderson, K. J., & Clark, B. (1994). Microclimatic conditions in maternity caves of the bent-wing bat, Miniopterus schreibersii: an attempted restoration of a former maternity site. Wildlife Research, 21(6), 607-619. It is unknown if pesticide or heavy metal exposure is contributing to the decline of this subspecies, although DDT and its related compounds DDD and DDE have been found in their guano, livers, pectoral muscles, brains, and fat tissues.Mispagel, C., Allinson, M., Allinson, G., Iseki, N., Grant, C., & Morita, M. (2004). DDT and metabolites residues in the southern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii) of south-eastern Australia. Chemosphere, 55(7), 997-1003. =Future threats= A major concern for conservation of this subspecies is the potential arrival of white-nose syndrome, which has killed millions of bats in North America since its introduction in 2007. A risk assessment stated that it was \\"Almost Certain\\" that white-nose syndrome would arrive in Australia by 2027.Holz, P. Hufschmid, J., Boardman, W., Cassey, P., Firestone, S.

While many caves in Australia would be too warm for the cold-loving fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, the caves in southern Australia are colder and suitable for growth of the fungus. The risk assessment predicted that of all cave-roosting bat species in Australia, the arrival of white-nose syndrome would have the most severe effect on the southern bent-wing bat. =Management actions= Fences have been placed outside of Bat Cave to deter foxes and rabbits from entering. Totally closing off cave entrances with bat-accessible gates, while effective for managing some species, is not effective for this subspecies, as it avoids caves with gates. Human access to Bat Cave is strictly regulated to minimize disturbance to the maternity colony, but Starlight Cave is on private land and therefore less protected. Most critically, researchers are seeking to determine what is responsible for the drastic decline of the subspecies, so more focused conservation actions can be implemented.

He is living in Europe for more than 30 years.  Life and works  Praskin had clarinette lessons, when he was very young. But very soon, he became acquainted with jazz through his father's record collection, which induced him finally to change his main instrument to alto saxophone. He had his first practical experience of improvised music, when he was a teenager in his home city, Los Angeles, where the jazz scene was very lively at that time. He became acquainted with modern jazz under George Morrow's aegis (the bass player in the Clifford Brown/Max Roach quintet). During his lessons under Morrow, he got to know other prominent musicians who lived in California like Bobby Hutcherson, J. R. Monterose and Harold Land‚Äîwhom he also worked with. At the end of the 1960s‚Äîat an important time in the Vietnam war‚ÄîPraskin was conscripted into the army, but he was sent to Korea and not to Indochina. During his short stay in Tokyo in 1971, his first LP record, Encounter, was published on Three Blind Mice. He also played as a sideman on Hideto Kanai's record Q. As a result, he came into contact with the flourishing free jazz scene of New York City. He made a name for himself very soon among the avant-garde in the metro-pole through jam sessions and recordings with leading musicians like Sunny Murray, Beaver Harris and Sam Rivers. Gunter Hampel joined Praskin in 1972 for his Galaxie Dream Band. Praskin was a member of the band until 1975. As a member of this band, he made an extensive tour in Europe in 1973, where he eventually moved. During the following years, he turned to his musical interest, the old style of jazz, without quitting his experiences from the free playing style. This led to his collaboration with artists of different styles like Barbara Dennerlein (organist), √ñzay Fecht (singer), Fritz Pauer (pianist), Branislav Lala Kovaƒçev (percussion player), Warne Marsh (saxophone player) and Hans Koller (saxophone player). Many years of musical partnership connected Praskin with the pianists Wolfgang K√∂hler and Larry Porter. Along with Porter, he led the Porter/Praskin quartet from 1984 to 1993.

The Tribunal, mainly supporters of President Nicol√°s Maduro, also restricted the immunity granted to the Assembly's members, who mostly belonged to the opposition. The dissolution was considered by the opposition to be a \\"coup\\" while the Organization of American States (OAS) termed the action a \\"self-coup\\". The decision was condemned by some media outlets with analysts characterizing the move as a turn towards authoritarianism and one-man rule. Politicians throughout the Americas, as well as leaders from the United Nations, expressed concern with the decision and demanded its reversal, though the Venezuelan government stated no coup had taken place and instead justified its decision as a reaction to \\"coup-like actions\\" allegedly performed by the opposition. On 1 April 2017, the TSJ reversed its decision, thereby reinstating the powers of the National Assembly. Public dissatisfaction with the decision persisted however, with the strengthening of the protests that year \\"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\\" resulting from the crisis. Background Following the death of President Hugo Ch√°vez, Venezuela faced a severe socioeconomic crisis during the Presidency of his successor, President Nicol√°s Maduro, as a result of their policies. Due to the state's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls, civil insurrection in Venezuela culminated in the 2014‚Äì17 protests. Protests occurred over the years, with demonstrations occurring in various intensities depending on the crises Venezuelans were facing at the time and the perceived threat of being repressed by authorities. The discontent with the United Socialist Government saw the opposition being elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 Parliamentary Election. As a result of that election, the lame duck National Assembly consisting of United Socialist officials filled the Venezuelan Supreme Court with allies. Into early 2016, the Supreme Court alleged that voting irregularities occurred in the 2015 Parliamentary Elections and stripped four Assembly members of their seats, preventing an opposition supermajority in the National Assembly which would be able to challenge President Maduro. The Assembly nevertheless swore in 3 of the members in question, in response to which the Supreme Court ruled that the Assembly was in contempt of court and in violation of the constitutional order.Deutsche Welle. 30.03.2017. Venezuela Supreme Court takes over legislative powers from National Assembly. The TSJ court then began to approve multiple actions performed by Maduro and granted him more powers. President Maduro speaking to the TSJ on 7 February 2017, asking for the establishment of an alliance of \\"the judiciary, the citizen and the executive\\" while saying the National Assembly was in contempt. After facing years of crisis, the Venezuelan opposition pursued a recall referendum against President Maduro, presenting a petition to the National Electoral Council (CNE) on 2 May 2016. By August 2016, the momentum to recall President Maduro appeared to be progressing, with the Council setting a date for the second phase of collecting signatures, though it made the schedule strenuous, stretching the process into 2017 which made it impossible for the opposition to activate new Presidential Elections. On 21 October 2016, the Council suspended the referendum only days before preliminary signature-gatherings were to be held. The Council blamed alleged voter fraud as the reason for the cancellation of the referendum. International observers criticized the move, stating that CNE's decision made Maduro look as if he were seeking to rule as a dictator. Days after the recall movement was cancelled, 1.2 million Venezuelans protested throughout the country against the move, demanding President Maduro to leave office, with Caracas protests remaining calm while protests in other federal states resulted in clashes between demonstrators and authorities, leaving one policeman dead, 120 injured and 147 arrested. That day the opposition gave President Maduro a deadline of 3 November 2016 to hold elections, with opposition leader, Miranda Governor Henrique Capriles stating, \\"Today we are giving a deadline to the Government. I tell the coward who is in Miraflores ... that on 3 November the Venezuelan people are coming to Caracas because we are going to Miraflores\\". Days later on 1 November 2016, then National Assembly President and opposition leader Henry Ramos Allup announced the cancellation of 3 November march to the Miraflores presidential palace, with Vatican-led dialogue between the opposition and the government beginning. By 7 December 2016, dialogue halted between the two and two months later on 13 January 2017 after talks stalled, the Vatican officially pulled out of the dialogue. Further protests were much smaller due to the fear of repression, with the opposition organizing surprise protests instead of organized mass marches. Other actions by President Maduro and his Bolivarian officials included a 7 February 2017 meeting which announced the creation of the Great Socialist Justice Mission which had the goal of establishing \\"a great alliance between the three powers, the judiciary, the citizen and the executive\\", with Maduro stating that \\"we have been fortunate to see how the judicial power has been growing and perfecting, carrying a doctrine so complete with the constitution of 1999\\" while stating that the opposition-led National Assembly \\"took power not for the majority not for the people but for themselves\\". Events =Judicial events= The Court ruled that the National Assembly was \\"in a situation of contempt\\", because of the aforementioned rulings against the election of some of its members. It stripped the Assembly of legislative powers, and took those powers for itself; which meant that the Court might have been able to create laws. The court did not indicate if or when it might hand power back. A statement issued by the court however stated that it would retain the powers of the legislature until the \\"contempt situation persists and the National Assembly actions are invalidated\\". The action transferred powers from the Assembly, which had an opposition majority since January 2016, to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which has a majority of government loyalists. The ruling also granted President Maduro the power to suspend elections, imprison opposition deputies and withdraw Venezuela from the Organization of American States. Ruling N¬∫ 155 Ruling N¬∫ 156 Reactions to the judicial ruling 10 April Protests The move was denounced by the opposition, with Assembly President Julio Borges making statements on 30 March describing the action as a coup d'√©tat by President Nicol√°s Maduro. Borges called on the military to intervene, stating that \\"they cannot remain silent in the face of the violation of the Constitution\\" and \\"that FAN officers are also going through drama caused by the high cost of life. We want to make a call on them to be the first guardians of democracy and the Venezuelan Constitution and that they become part of the solution.\\" Finally, Borges called on international attention to the ruling and called for new protests saying \\"there is fear, there is repression, but it is time to stand up.\\" Hours later, opposition officials gathered outside of the TSJ headquarters and were attacked by pro-government paramilitary groups called colectivos and National Guard troops. Deputy Juan Requesens was attacked by colectivo forces while Carlos Paparoni was pushed to the concrete by a National Guardsman. A journalist for the National Assembly's broadcast team, El Capitolio TV was struck in the head and required stitches. Government supporters and authorities also attempted to take recording devices away from the media on the scene. Students protesting the rulings outside of the TSJ on 31 March 2017. Attorney General Luisa Ortega D√≠az meeting with President Maduro on 1 April 2017 In a rare break of ranks, on 31 March 2017, pro- government Attorney General Luisa Ortega D√≠az stated on Venezuelan state television while holding a copy of the 1999 Constitution that the TSJ's ruling was a \\"rupture of constitutional order\\" and that it was her \\"duty to inform my country of my deep concern over these events,\\" with her audience responding with a lengthy applause. Borges, the Assembly President, stated that officials should follow Ortega's example and called on the military \\"to obey the orders of your conscience.\\" Meanwhile, protesters were repressed by the National Guard armed with buckshot and batons. Many demonstrators were arrested, with the media being caught in the assault, having their cameras confiscated while one female reporter of Caracol Radio was singled out by a group of troops and beaten. On 4 April 2017, opposition called for a march from Plaza Venezuela to the National Assembly with thousands of Venezuelans participating, though access to the meeting point was quickly blocked by the Bolivarian National Guard. Twelve subway stations were closed. Pro-government colectivos blocked opposition marches and fired weapons at protesters, with demonstrations resulting in the injuries of about 42 individuals, including seven police officers, while over 50 people were arrested. In reporting the story, The New York Times noted that in the previous few months Maduro had been swiftly consolidating power, and the Assembly was considered by many to be the sole remaining counterbalance to the President's control. It also noted that following such moves by the government, \\"many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship.\\" Fox News also noted that following the sporadic protests that did not produce results, with the government already consolidating itself within the military and politically by canceling elections, calls for further demonstrations as well as the intervention of the armed forces were futile. Reversal of decisions Following the rare criticism from Attorney General Ortega, an inner-circle official, Maduro ordered a review of the TSJ's decision regarding the National Assembly. One day later, the Tribunal reversed that particular order, thereby reinstating the powers of the Assembly. The opposition, however, dismissed the backtracking and called on Venezuelans \\"to take to the streets\\" against what they called an attempted coup, arguing that the moves proved that Maduro controlled the judiciary and therefore separation of powers did not exist in the republic. Protests in the country continued after the reversal with the opposition demanding early elections. Proceedings against TSJ Following the reversal of the rulings by the TSJ, the National Assembly prepared proceeding against the court, accusing the court of not being separated from the executive, though Reuters noted that \\"the move by the opposition-led congress would only be symbolic because it remains powerless\\". Following the criticism of the TSJ's ruling by Attorney General Ortega, there were calls for her to be involved in the so-called Republican Moral Council, made up of the Prosecutor's Office, the Office of the Comptroller and the Office of the Ombudsman, which had the right to remove members of the TSJ according to the Venezuelan constitution. During protests on 4 April, opposition leaders announced that they would pursue the removal of the seven judges who signed the rulings against the National Assembly. On 7 April, Ombudsman Tarek William Saab announced the decision of the Republican Moral Council decision on the TSJ judges, stating that he and Comptroller Manuel Galindo had rejected the request to endorse proceedings against the TSJ, whereas Attorney General Ortega had dissented. =Constitutional assembly= Proposal On 1 May 2017 following a month of protests that resulted in at least 29 dead, Maduro called for a Constitutional Assembly that would draft a new constitution that would replace the 1999 Venezuela Constitution. He invoked Article 347, and stated that his call for a new constitution was necessary to counter the actions of the opposition. Critics suspected that the members of the Constitutional Assembly would not be elected in open elections, but selected from social organizations loyal to Maduro. The proposal would be an alternative way to close the National Assembly. It would also allow him to stay in power during the interregnum, as the process would take at least two years. Diosdado Cabello pointed that the new constitution would prevent a politician similar to the Argentine Mauricio Macri from ever becoming president of Venezuela. Macri was elected president in the 2015 presidential elections, ending the 12-years terms of N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, longtime allies of both Ch√°vez and Maduro. The MUD started a common front for all the people in Venezuela that oppose the amendment. It is composed by the MUD, the Marea Socialista, minor parties without representatives in the Assembly (such as the marxists Bandera Roja), disenchanted chavistas, the Catholic Church, universities, human rights organizations, lawyers and artists. Eustoquio Contreras is the only deputy that defected from Maduro and opposed the amendment. Luis Salamanca, former rector of the National Electoral Council, considers that the front may not be capable to stop Maduro, as he is unwilling to negotiate the proposal. Approval On 22 May, the Republican Moral Council ‚Äì which the opposition hoped would establish proceedings against TSJ judges ‚Äì shared their approval of the National Constitutional Assembly despite the absence of Attorney General Ortega, with Ombudsman Tarek William Saab stating that \\"The call to the National Constituent Assembly is a constitutional exit to the political situation that the country is living, in order to foster dialogue and coexistence of the country\\". The next day on 23 May, Danilo Antonio Mojica Monsalvo, the magistrate of the Social Cassation Chamber of the TSJ announced his disagreement with President Maduro's Constitutional Assembly, stating that without a popular referendum voting on the assembly, the move would be \\"spurious ... a legal metaphor to describe what is done outside the Constitution\\". Another TSJ judge, Marisela Godoy, spoke out against Maduro's proposal, stating \\"At this moment I support, without any fear, the attorney general (Luisa Ortega D√≠az), who is not any official\\" and that if she were to be criticized by the government, she \\"does not care\\". However, the Constitutional assembly proposal was accepted by the CNE, with an election slated for 10 July 2017. Reactions to constitutional assembly The call generated further protests. 920 Battalions were created and maintained, composed by 200,000 militias to respond to violent protests. Pedro Carre√±o, aide of Diosdado Cabello, stated that Venezuela would be suffering an attack similar to the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat against Salvador Allende, and that those militias would prevent that. Capriles complained that Maduro is preparing forces to wage a war, and said \\"let the world see who wants elections and who tries to impose himself by force\\". Protesters may be tried under military justice, instead of civil courts. The constitution of Venezuela limits the scope of the military courts to crimes of a military nature. =Parallel Supreme Tribunal= On 20 June 2017, President of the National Assembly Julio Borges, the opposition-led legislative body of Venezuela, announced the activations of Articles 333 and 350 of the Venezuelan Constitution. A \\"road map\\" was also enacted by the opposition which entailed the nullification of further actions performed by the TSJ, the call for a continuous, peaceful protest movement \\"until the restitution of the constitutional order\\" and for Venezuelans to continue to confront President Maduro's constitutional assembly. Article 333 Article 350 Reactions to parallel government According to Jose Vicente Haro, a constitutional lawyer, the Venezuelan opposition should name new directors of Venezuela's branches of government in order to establish a parallel government and to further pursue corrupt individuals, however noting that the Bolivarian government may attempt to jail opposition leaders. Reactions =Domestic= * Venezuela ‚Äì Foreign minister Delcy Rodr√≠guez described the international rejection to the ruling as a right-wing conspiracy against President Maduro, and dismissed the OAS as \\"imperialist\\". =International= Supranational bodies * European Union ‚Äì Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stated that the TSJ's decision \\"restricts the parliamentary immunity of its members, who were democratically elected by the people\\" and that \\"[t]he European Union recalls that full respect for the Constitution, democratic principles, the rule of law and the separation of powers is crucial for the country to achieve a peaceful outcome of the current difficult situation and regain political stability\\". * Organization of American States ‚Äì Secretary General Luis Almagro promptly denounced the move and called for the urgent convocation of the Organization's Permanent Council under Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. * Mercosur ‚Äì In a 31 March statement, the bloc expressed that, \\"In the face of the grave institutional situation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ... (members) have decided to call an urgent meeting of Foreign Ministers ... to analyze possible solutions ... The founding countries of Mercosur reiterate their unalterable support for the fundamental principles of the rule of law and for the preservation of democracy in the Latin American region\\". A day later on 1 April, Mercosur activated a democratic clause due to the \\"lack of separation of powers\\", with the clause used to closely monitor the state of democracy in Venezuela, which \\"does not imply the expulsion\\". Members also said that they would present a similar case to the OAS so the Inter-American Democratic Charter could be invoked. * United Nations ‚Äì U.N.

Biography Ruth Jacobs was born in Cambridge, England. She was the oldest of three children born to her parents who worked as a bookseller and an accountant. Her grandfather was Marcus Hast, a Hebrew composer who spent 40 years as rabbi at the Great Synagogue of London. In 1908, her soon-to-be husband Elisha Arakie Cohen, travelled to England where he met and married Jacobs. They returned to Winnipeg, Manitoba where her husband worked as a lawyer for the firm Daly, Crichton and McClure. In 1910 a son named Ralph was born. In 1913, she began writing book reviews for the Winnipeg Telegram under the pen name Sheila Rand. In 1917 she was hired as an editor and regularly published poems and short stories. In January 1919, the Telegram was in financial trouble and she was recruited by the Winnipeg Tribune where she started to write a column called \\"What to Read... and What Not.\\" The column included book reviews and poems written by herself. After her husband died in March 1919, she began working at Eaton's, writing advertising copy for their catalogues. She continued to write for the Tribune and also became literary editor of Western Home Monthly. She was also elected vice-president of the Canadian Authors' Association which led to regular speaking engagements. In 1922, she signed a deal to publish her poetry in several North American newspapers. She began to write under a new pen name, Wilhelmina Stitch. In 1923 she moved back to England in order to further her son's education. He would later become a noted professor of economics. In 1924, she married Frank Collie, a physician from Scotland. She resumed her writing career and submitted poetry to the London Daily Graphic. Her daily poetry earned her the nickname, \\"the poem a day lady.\\" Her poetry made her name well known and she was regularly called on to speak for community groups. In 1930, she went on a two-month speaking tour of North America where she spoke every day for 50 days. Collie died in 1936 after a brief illness at the age of 48.

A Prescott Library Association opened a public reading room space in 1870. But there was no regularly funded library until the Carnegie library (a free public library) at 125 E. Gurley Street was built in 1903. Its funding and construction was a project of the Monday Literary Society or Monday Club, a group formed in 1895 (as the Women's Club of Prescott), a group of women dedicated to the educational and cultural well-being of their community. It has also been known as Prescott Public Library and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under that name. The replacement library, the current Prescott Public Library, built in 1974, is two blocks away.  History  The Monday Club requested matching funds from Andrew Carnegie to build the library. The goal was to create a ‚Äòfree public library‚Äô for the Prescott community. In July 1889, Carnegie agreed to fund $4,000 with the understanding the other $4,000 would be raised by the Prescott community. The Monday Club achieved its goal and a building lot was granted. However, a fire in July 1900 destroyed the books for the anticipated library. The Monday Club accepted donations for replacement books and pressed on. In November 1903, the library opened, situated near Marina and Gurley in Prescott, Arizona. It was the first public library in the area. Julia M. Goldwater, Prescott resident wrote to Andrew Carnegie in 1899, appealing for help to build a library in Prescott: > June 1, 1899 Mr. Andrew Carnegie > , Pennsylvania Dear Sir, > Your well known philanthropy has prompted me to appeal to you in the > interest of a truly charitable work. In our little town of 3500 inhabitants, > we have after much effort and work established a library of nine hundred > volumes‚Äîgood readable books in good condition, but we have no endowment, > rents are high, and we have been compelled to charge for the tickets. It is > our aim and hope to make the library free and to maintain a free reading > room. In no place could such a room be more needed than in Prescott with its > large floating population of young men, many of whom can not afford to keep > their own rooms lighted and heated, and therefore have no recourse but the > saloons and ‚Äúdives‚Äù for there are no innocent amusements in the town. If we > could get an endowment of $10,000 or even $8,000, we would at once, make the > library free, for all the women on the library committee are willing to work > very hard to keep the matter in good shape, to raise money to buy new books > and to subscribe for periodicals. I truly believe that the amount of money I > mention would do greatest good in this way than in any other. I have tried > to write briefly so as not to demand too much of your valuable time, but if > you are interested to investigate the matter, I shall taker pleasure in > giving you all the information possible. I am privileged to refer to the > Governor of the Territory, Hon. N. Oakes Murphy, Phoenix, Arizona, who will > tell you I am sure that the library is in capable hands. Hoping that you > will feel some interest in our necessities, in spite of the hourly calls on > your charity, I am, Very respectfully yours, > Julia M. Goldwater Carnegie responded in 1899 with an offer of $4,000, conditional upon the people of Prescott matching that sum. The existing library collection was lost in a 1900 conflagration that burned much of downtown Prescott, but a $1800 insurance claim was paid for the loss, and other fundraising eventually raised enough to meet Carnegie's condition. Builders Maxwell & Sines constructed the library for $8,242. It was opened with 1300 volumes on November 24, 1903. Ownership was passed from the Monday Club to the city of Prescott in 1917. with The library served the Prescott community until 1974 when the current Prescott Public Library opened.

She read them with her a brother and her father would read the Sunday funnies to her. Her mother was a painter and encouraged her to read everything and anything. Sawyer used her creativity to make her own characters along with stories and her own original illustrations. She once convinced her mother to call the head of Marvel Comics to inquire if he wanted to buy any of her characters.  College  Rather than pursuing passion for comics, Sawyer attended college with the intentions to \\"buckle down\\" and find a \\"real job.\\" She received a bachelors in technology and management which she used right after college where she received a job as a manager.  After college  In 2006 Sawyer was reminded of her passion for comics after meeting Rob Taylor, owner of the independent comic company Superhuman Works. She accepted a job at his company where she would edit his scripts, scout for talent, take submissions from artists, and set up convention appearances for him. It only took a year for her to realize that this was something she could do.  Career  She founded her own company, Lockett Down Productions and published two comics, The Rippers and Eating Vampires. In 2012 Ray Felix,the executive director for Bronx Heroes Comic Con asked Sawyer to host a panel on women in the industry where she met numerous female comic creators and was inspired to create a space specifically for women in the comics industry. That year she founded Women in Comics Collective.  Publications  Sawyer started writing The Rippers when she was 17 years old. In the series, an intergalactic, government-regulated Bounty Hunter named Rhiannon O‚ÄôCair is accused of a crime that she doesn‚Äôt remember committing. Her newest project is Eating Vampires, about a young girl named Evelyn who is the last of a race of Healers. Her Vampire Eating guardian Rigel goes to great lengths in order to protect her from Preternatural beings that want her dead.

All fifty states and the District of Columbia were part of the 1972 United States presidential election. Indiana voters chose thirteen electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Indiana was won by the Republican nominees, incumbent President Richard Nixon of California and his running mate Vice President Spiro Agnew of Maryland. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic nominees, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and his running mate U.S. Ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland. Nixon carried Indiana with 66.11% of the vote to McGovern's 33.34%, a victory margin of 32.77%. Although Indiana is one of the most reliable Republican states in the country, this is the only occasion where a Republican candidate (indeed, where any Presidential candidate) carried every county in the state.Thomas, G.

The band has as main characteristics a heavy sound with psychedelic nuances, and lyrics sung in English addressing social contexts and human behavior. According to a ranking of the site ReverbNation, which uses as criteria the activity of the band within the site itself, and numbers of movement of the main social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), schedule of shows and other forms of virtual advertising, the band in 2015 Was in the second position among the 10 Brazilian bands of the metal most engaged in social networks, taking first place in February 2016 and remaining in the lead up to the present day. Already in the global sphere in the global ranking of the site that has 3.8 Millions of subscribers and bands from 250 countries, the band has been in the Top 50 since May 2015. Unfortunately in 2017 a band ended its activities.  History  = Start = In the mid-1990s, guitarist Marcelo Figueiredo, who was already an important presence in the underground music scene of the city of Guaruj√°, decides to create a band to give vent to his own compositions, but faces a recurring problem: Local musicians did not believe in authorial music, preferring to dedicate themselves to cover songs of their idols. After more than a decade of attempts and frustrations, Marcelo finally manages to gather musicians interested in his ideas, and with Priscila Soares in vocals, Milton Felix on bass and Zensk Metal on drums, in 2009 the band Depth Hate is formed. With this formation in 2011, the band does a series of shows in places considered important rock strongholds, in the city of S√£o Paulo there were three shows: one at Blackmore Rock Bar, and two at Fofinho Rock Bar. In the city of Santos two more shows at the Coliseu do Rock, and in the city of Santo Andr√© in the Central Rock Bar, always putting to the test its sound autoral and obtaining excellent response of the public. In 2012 with the departure of Zensk, the drummer M√°rcio Leite joins the band, the band then begins a period of composition and lapidation of their own sound, deciding to face the financial difficulties, the band decides to record their songs independently even if it had To do this Have patience to do little by little, since the band itself will take care of all the costs of the recording process, along with that, at the same time Milton leaves the band, entering in its place the bass player Pedro Pessoa. = International Repercussion = With this formation in the second semester of 2013 the band enters in studio and records the songs, \\"In the darkness of hours\\" and \\"Stage of mind\\", and decides to spread the songs through the internet, a few months later already in 2014, the band returns to the studio records and releases the songs, \\"Zombie\\" and \\"Soon the eternity\\", from there the band begins to have a huge growth of activity in its pages and social networks, arousing the interest of fans of heavy metal and specialized media both in Brazil and abroad, and the songs \\"In the darkness of hours\\", \\"Stage of mind\\" and \\"Zombie,\\" are selected for the soundtrack of the first episode of the Mexican program Tattoo Wars Mexico, after winning careful selection which involved bands from around the world. Taking advantage of the excellent repercussion of its material, on December 31, 2014, the band launches on its YouTube channel the video clip of the song \\"Soon the eternity\\", the clip is dark and brings as a subject a suicide and ends up having excellent repercussion both In Brazil, and abroad, so much so that the video clip is selected by Mish Mash Network to be part of episode 78 of the American program InsaniTV, which brings video clips from bands from around the world, being one of the few Brazilian bands to have participated in the program, Alongside all of this here in Brazil the music video continued to be widely shown on subscription channels affiliated with PlayTv. A few months later, in 2015 the band returns to the studio to record and release the songs, \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Subconscious\\", and once again the band can select \\"Save me\\" to be part of this time Soundtrack of the fourth episode of the Mexican program Tattoo Wars Mexico, being until now the only Brazilian band to participate in the soundtrack of the program. By this time the songs of the band were already playing in several radios and webradios from various parts of the world and it was not long before the band granted its first interview in English to the Swedish blog specialized in bands of the world underground Ghgumman Blogg of Robex Lundgren. = Recognition in the brazilian underground scene The end = Some months later, in November 2015, the band performed in Santos at Studio Rock Caf√©, and once again the band put their repertoire of authorship to the test causing great repercussion for their live performance. In early 2016 the band returned to the studio, recorded and released the songs, \\"Nothing can kill your heart\\" and \\"Memories of my past\\", both were very well received by the fans of heavy metal, with that the band added eight recorded songs and digitally available for purchase on major streaming platforms and is considered one of the emerging bands in the underground scene. = The end = In 2017, disagreements among its members caused the band to end its activities, ending a promising trajectory.

Committee on Character and Fitness for the State of Illinois, 335 F.3d 678 (Ill. 2003), was a decision made by the Supreme Court of Illinois in which the court upheld the Illinois Committee on Character of Fitness's denial of a license to practice law to Matthew F. Hale, on the ground that he lacked the moral character and fitness to practice law. The committee denied Hale's application on December 16, 1998, and refused again after an appeal on June 30, 1999, citing his antisemitic and racist views were \\"Inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\\" regardless of his stated intentions to uphold the state's values. After his petition to the Illinois Supreme Court was denied, Hale then filed a case in federal court against the Board of Admissions to the Bar, the Third District Committee, members of the Hearing Panel, and the Illinois Supreme Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, citing the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, concluded that Hale did in fact have an opportunity to litigate his challenges to the Illinois Supreme Court's ruling, and subsequently dismissed his case.  Background  Matthew Hale was a former Bradley University student who was expelled after several inciting incidence which included threatening African-American students with a gun and burning the Israeli flag. Hale later formed the New Church of the Creator, which believes that \\"the white race are the creators of all worthwhile civilization,\\" and encourages a \\"racial holy war.\\" Hale later attended and graduated from Southern Illinois University School of Law, and passed the bar exam in that same year. Hale then applied for a license to practice law in the state of Illinois. He was open about his racist and antisemitic views within his law application, but also stated that these views would not get in the way of him practicing law. Despite these claims Hale's application was rejected based on the committees findings that he \\"did not satisfy his burden of proving that he possessed the requisite character and fitness on several findings.\\" and that his past actions and current views would likely lead him to actions inconsistent with the bar Illinois Supreme Court case Immediately after his rejection, Hale petitioned the Illinois Supreme Court to reconsider his application, and questioned the constitutionality of rejecting his application based on a set of beliefs he held, citing the First Amendment. The Supreme Court denied his petition. Justice James D. Heiple was the sole dissenting justice on the Illinois Supreme Court, writing in his dissenting opinion that the court was \\"speculating\\" about Hale's potential future actions, and argued for review to determine whether a law license may be denied based \\"on predictions of future actionable misconduct.\\" The court of appeals pointed out that Heiple's dissent \\"does not reflect the state of the law,\\" and are not binding. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decision After the Supreme Court dismissed Hale's petition, Hale filed a case against the admissions board, the Third District Committee, members of the Hearing Panel, and the Illinois Supreme Court, feeling he did not receive proper judicial proceedings regarding the denial of his bar application and the perceived infringement upon his free speech rights. Hale cited 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, which provides that \\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law.\\" On July 14, 2003, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision. The court rejected Hale's argument, citing the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which states that federal courts \\"should not sit in direct review of state court decisions,\\" and the question became whether the Supreme Court's allowance of Hale's application's rejection counted as judicial proceedings, and whether he had a chance to litigate his case in front of them. The court also held that the First Amendment did not guarantee him the right to incite racial discrimination as an \\"officer of the court.\\" They also stated that he had a fair chance to litigate his case with the Supreme Court, and that he was denied anyway. They also stated that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine did not allow them to review the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court. Scholarly assessment The case called scholarly attention and debate about the ramifications of denying admission to the bar to applicants with objectionable views, in light of the Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Baird v. State Bar of Arizona, which held that the \\"freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment prevents a state from excluding a person from a profession solely because of the applicant's beliefs.\\" Some commentators viewed the decisions as a mistake. Jason Billy, writing in Harvard BlackLetter Law Journal, noted that \\"the In re Hale decision has left unanswered many residual free-speech questions. One can easily imagine other scenarios wherein a bar association is confronted with an applicant with a spotless academic record, who is lacking evidence of any criminality, yet who openly espouses racist beliefs.\\" Billy argued that minority groups are \\"far better served by a system within which bar associations do not paternalistically protect such groups from the private racism of lawyers: where members of the bar are not punished for their candor with regard to racial politics, minority groups may in fact increase their social, political, and economic savvy by fully and autonomously participating in the legal market without the viewpoint-based gate-keeping of bar authorities.\\" Matthew Stevenson wrote in the Montana Law Review that \\"Hale's imperfect record, standing alone, does not meet the cumulative standard by which applicants have traditionally been denied. Illinois committee members blended Hale's imperfect record with their personal repugnance at his political views to conjure up a formula worthy of their dismissal. Yet their repugnance should have played no role in the decision.\\" Stevenson wrote that Hale's sworn claim that he would uphold the law should have been accepted: \\"The fallback position for the state is their right to disbar an applicant if his oath proves to be insincere, not to deny him on a hunch that the oath will be broken.\\"  Later developments  Two days after Hale's application was denied a member of his church went on a shooting spree, killing two and injuring 9. Hale stated after that his church \\"does not condone illegal activities.\\" On April 6, 2005, Hale was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison for attempting to solicit the murder of Judge Joan Lefkow.

Early years and musical influences  Rufes started playing music at the age of 7 when he had received a Spanish guitar for his birthday. He bought his first electric guitar at the age of 12 after a whole year saving money. His early childhood musical influences included The Beatles, Chuck Berry and few years later The Ramones and Guns N' Roses.  Career  After many years playing very different styles of music, David's musical career took off with a very special way to play rock-fusion through his album Assorted Random Notes (2014). Just after releasing the album he would have the opportunity to share the stage with first class musicians like Joe Satriani, The Aristocrats (Guthrie Govan, Bryan Beller and Marco Minnemann) or Mike Keneally. He moved to the USA where he kept developing his very own style while enjoying playing with artists like Daniel Ben Zebulon (Stevie Wonder, Richie Havens, Isaac Hayes...) or Robben Ford.

A 1991 reissue with the same title was a compilation including tracks from Yazoo Basin Boogie and Grossman's 1972 release Memphis Jellyroll. The original release was issued with guitar tablature. The track \\"Adam's Voice\\" is a child speaking. Reception In his Allmusic review of the compilation release, critic Cub Koda wrote \\"Grossman has spent so many years producing videos and how to books on acoustic guitar, it's hard to think of him as a guitarist himself, which is why albums like this are so valuable and reassuring. Grossman can back up everything he says and believes musically, with an encyclopedic knowledge and feel for country- blues, rags, and fiddle tunes as demonstrated here...

She was the first freestyle water skier, and had a unique and creative approach to her sport. In the 1950s, Cook invented swivel skiing, a style of water skiing that became hugely successful around the world, which combines the moves of ballet with water skiing by using swivel bindings on the ski. Today there is a trophy in her name, which is awarded to the best female performer at the National Water Ski Show Tournament each year. Cook developed a love for water skiing in her early teens. In 1945, she competed in her first National Water Ski Championships, winning first place titles in the slalom and tricks categories, as well as a first place title overall. She had never seen a jump or slaloms course until the day before the competition, making her victory all the more impressive. This first place title was the first of eight overall firsts for Willa in the National Championships, out of the nine National Championships she participated in. In 1948, she began a career performing at Cypress Gardens, a show that featured water skiers, and became a prima ballerina. She participated in world water skiing competitions in 1949, 1950, 1953, and 1955, and won the overall world title three times, along with five world event victories. In 1959, Cook retired from competing, but has continued to water ski passionately. In 1989, she was an honoree of the International Water Ski Federation. She became a chairperson of the American Water Ski Hall of Fame museum, and used her creative talents to design their exhibits. McGuire also spent her career using her skills to teach others, and was always involved in teaching younger water skiers; many of her students became champion water skiers later on.

It is a rare species with a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two bright pink flowers and grows in only two seasonally wet locations, a few hundred metres apart.  Description  Caladenia winfieldii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, 100‚Äì150 mm long and 6‚Äì8 mm wide. One or two bright pink flowers 80‚Äì120 mm long and 5‚Äì100 mm wide are borne on a stalk 300‚Äì600 mm high. The sepals have thin, fawn- coloured, club-like glandular tips 10‚Äì30 mm long. The dorsal sepal is erect, 35‚Äì70 mm long and 2‚Äì4 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 35‚Äì75 mm long, 4‚Äì7 mm wide, spread apart from each other and held horizontally with the tips curved downwards. The petals are 30‚Äì55 mm long, 3‚Äì5 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is 15‚Äì23 mm long, 10‚Äì11 mm wide and dark pink. The sides of the labellum have thin teeth up to 6 mm long, the tip of the labellum curls under and there are four rows of pink calli up to 2 mm long, along the mid-line. Flowering occurs from October to late November.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia winfieldii was first formally described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected near Manjimup and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (winfieldii) honours Harry Winfield who discovered this species in 1987.  Distribution and habitat  The majestic spider orchid is only known from two populations a few hundred metres apart near Manjimup in the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions where it grows under paperbark and Banksia trees in seasonally-wet places.  Conservation  Caladenia winfieldii is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The main threats to the species are activities of feral pigs, inappropriate fire regimes, kangaroo grazing, hydrological changes and dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi.

She is also known by the Haida names K'woiyeng, Yahgujanaas and S'itkwuns. Some sources list her birth year as 1858.  Family and Personal Life  She was born in Klukwan Village, Alaska, a member of the Yakulanas lineage of the Haida clan. Although she was an only child, her parents adopted a slave girl named Wiba as a playmate for Isabella. Her parents died of smallpox when she was young and she was raised by chief Albert Edward Edenshaw. Around 1873, Isabella was wed to Charles Edenshaw in a traditional Haida ceremony. After converting to Christianity, they were married again in an Anglican service on December 27th, 1885. The ceremony took place at St John‚Äôs Church in Masset. Isabella‚Äôs aunt and uncle Albert and Amy Edenshaw were married in the same ceremony, along with nine other couples. Charles inherited a traditional plank house from his uncle and built a Victorian style home located in Masset. Isabella and Charles kept a large grizzly bear mortuary pole in the front yard that honoured Isabella‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs sister. Together they had eight children; Florence, Emily, Agnes, Robert, Albert and three others that died in infancy. Their daughter Florence Davidson became a prominent Canadian artist. Their son Robert drowned in a swimming accident. Isabella‚Äôs family only resided in Masset during the late fall, winter, and May. For the rest of the year their family travelled around the province. At the end of February, they travelled to Kung (the site of an old village in Naden Harbour) where they would camp for a month to collect and dry halibut. This could be kept for eating or be traded by the family. In June they migrated to the mainland where Isabella worked at the Inverness Cannery in New Kasaan. Here she would purchase material for her family‚Äôs winter wardrobe. They stayed here until late summer, when they returned to the islands. During this time Isabella and Florence collected huckleberries, crab-apples, salal berries, cranberries, and potatoes.  Artistic Career  Haida Hat, 1895, Isabella Edenshaw, spruce root and paint, Canadian Museum of Civilization. Lidded Basket, 1905, Isabella Edenshaw, spruce root and paint Isabella wove spruce roots into baskets and hats which were later painted by her husband. She frequently travelled to North Beach with her daughter Florence to collect spruce roots for her weaving. The distinctive qualities of her art have been recorded as such: \\"Seen in the appearance of the \\"mamastiki\\" [concentric diamonds] motif in conjunction with four-ply twining (especially S-twining) at the perimeter of the top, the absence of special demarkation at the lower perimeter of the crown, and the use of four-strand braid...as brim finish when, and this is essential, the construction of the top, crown, and brim of the hat is in accord with the standard Haida formula (Laforet 1990: 295).\\" Their records of her known artworks are as follows: 31 hats, 7 mats, and 7 baskets. Of the hats attributed to Isabella and Charles, 10 are decorated with frogs, 9 with ravens, 4 with sharks, 3 with whales, 1 with a beaver, 1 with a hawk, 1 with a sculpin, 1 with a long-beaked bird, 1 with a sea lion. Of the mats, 3 are decorated with sea lions, 1 with halibut, 1 with sculpin, 1 with mosquito, 1 with a bear. Of the baskets there are 2 decorated with Wasgo figures, 1 with a whale, 1 with a beaver on the outside and salmon on the inside, 1 with a frog, 1 with a whale and frog, and 1 with a bird. During Isabella's annual travels to mainland British Columbia, she would sell her baskets and hats at George Cunningham's store in Port Essington. In 1902, Charles F. Newcombe purchased a spruce root cradle-liner painted with a dogfish design and several baskets from Isabella. Her work appeared in the exhibitions Raven Travelling: Two Centuries of Haida Art at the Vancouver Art Gallery and Signed Without Signature at the British Columbia Museum of Anthropology. Her woven baskets and hats are included in the collections of the McCord Museum, the National Gallery of Canada and the BC Museum of Anthropology.

Once war began with England, censorship forbade these names, but the band was allowed to continue performing, including at events for German troops. Widmann was drafted to the Wehrmacht during the war but was released in 1944 due to health reasons. He continued playing events in Germany even as Allied troops began invading, playing cinema houses in between films. After the war, Widmann formed a new band which played during the American occupation, sometimes using older arrangements from the war period, but also employing Berlin-based arranger . He recorded again in the late 1940s, and died of a stroke in 1954. The 1955 film Music in the Blood, directed by Erik Ode, is based on his life with Viktor de Kowa in the lead role.

It can be triggered also by a previous cardiac surgery with a consequent heart shock. It represents around 20% of cases of acute mesenteric ischaemia. Pathophysiology Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia occurs due to severe vasoconstriction of mesenteric vessels supplying the intestine. Acute abdominal pain is the only early acute symptom in those patients, which makes early diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis CT angiography would be helpful in differentiating occlusive from non-occlusive causes of mesenteric ischaemia.

Patch of Land focuses on 6‚Äì24 months real-estate first lien mortgage loans with borrower guarantees. The company has originated more than $725 million real estate loans secured by $1.16 billion of real estate and has returned $185 million of investor capital. Patch of Land was one of the first real estate crowdfunding platforms. It was the first real estate crowdfunding platform to focus exclusively on real-estate loans as opposed to equity, or both debt and equity simultaneously. Patch of Land was the first to pre-fund the loans it offered, providing immediate accrual of interest and giving borrowers access to all borrowed funds immediately without needing to wait for investors to fund. Patch of Land was also one of the first to co-invest in its property loans alongside investors on its platform. History Patch of Land was established by Jason Fritton, Brian Fritton and Carlo Tabibi in 2012 in Los Angeles, California shortly after congressional passage of the United States Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, making it one of the earliest providers of online Real-Estate Crowdfunding. Jason Fritton was among those who lobbied the United States Congress for the inclusion of real-estate crowdfunding in the JOBS Act. The company hired AdaPia d'Ericco as Chief Marketing Officer and Amy Wan as its General Legal Counsel. In August 2015, Patch of Land announced its Indentured Trustee Investment Model, offering a bankruptcy remote investment structure and stronger consumer protections for its investors. Patch of Land opened its Indentured Trustee Model documentation to the public in the hopes that other firms would follow suit, as many did. In May 2015, Patch of Land completed the largest ever real-estate investment loan offering of $1,900,000 to be fully crowdfunded (via regulation 506c) as of that date. In 2015, CNBC created its Crowdfunding Index, powered by Crowdnetic, and included Patch of Land in both the real estate sub-sector as well as the overarching crowdfinancing sector In April 2016, the company hired Paul Deitch from Oaktree Capital Management as CEO. He quit in November 2017 and was replaced by co-founder and chairman Jason Fritton. In 2016, Entrepreneur named Patch of Land to its list of 100 Brilliant Companies. =Funding and investment= In October 2014, Patch of Land became the first real estate crowdfunding firm to crowdfund itself via the SeedInvest equity fund-raising platform. In April 2015, the company raised $23.6 million in a Series A round led by SF Capital Group as well as an investment from Ron Suber, president of Prosper Marketplace. In February 2016, the company announced that it had secured $250 million in investments from a large east coast credit fund via a forward flow arrangement.

The Embassy of El Salvador in London was concurrently accredited to India until June 2008, when El Salvador opened its embassy in New Delhi. The Embassy of India in Panama City was initially concurrently accredited to El Salvador, but this was later changed to the Embassy of India in Guatemala City. The two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding on holding regular consultations between their respective foreign ministries in February 2004. The first Foreign Office Consultations between El Salvador and India were held in August 2012. The same month, they signed an agreement on co-operation in science, technology & innovation. In November 2010, Salvadoran Ambassador to India Zamora Rivas stated that India was \\"very much central to our [El Salvador's] future plans\\" with regard to increasing the country's business ties with Asia. Salvadoran Foreign Ministers Maria Eugenia Brizuela de Avila, Francisco E. Lainez, and Hugo Martinez visited India in February 2004, March 2007, and March 2011 respectively. Vice President Ana Vilma de Escobar visited the country in January 2008 to attend the CII Partnership Summit. Several other Salvadoran ministers have also visited the country. From India, the highest level visits to El Salvador have been at the level of minister of state. In March 2011, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Fisheries and Aquaculture. Trade Bilateral trade between El Salvador and India totaled US$74.72 million in 2015-16, recording a growth of 4.15% over the previous fiscal. India exported $68.54 million worth of goods to El Salvador, and imported $6.18 million. The main commodities exported by India to El Salvador are pharmaceuticals, fabrics, organic chemicals, plastic and plastic articles. The major commodities imported by India from El Salvador are wood, wood products, iron and steel. There have been several visits by trade and other delegations from El Salvador and India to each other's countries. Cultural relations El Salvador purchased an elephant from India in 1955 for the Parque Zoologico Nacional de San Salvador, the national zoo in San Salvador. The Indian elephant, named Manhewla (from the Sanskrit name, Manjula), subsequently became a national icon and is the only elephant that has ever lived in El Salvador.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1873 to 1875 by John Petrie. It is also known as Brisbane Passenger Station, Brisbane Terminal Station, and Brisbane Terminus. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000.  History  The first Roma Street railway station was constructed in 1873-1875 as the first Brisbane terminus for the Main Line railway and was the Brisbane terminus for the Southern and Western railway lines via Toowoomba. The building was designed by FDG Stanley, the Superintendent of Public Buildings in 1873 and built over the next two years by Brisbane builder, John Petrie. The Queensland Parliament passed the Railway Act in 1863, enabling the first railways to be constructed. A railway survey had been undertaken by the New South Wales Government in 1856 prior to the separation of Queensland in 1859, but it was the Moreton Bay Tramway Company who, on constructing a wooden-railed horse hauled tramway between Ipswich and Toowoomba in 1861, pioneered rail transportation to Queensland. Queensland's sparse population discouraged rail transportation as non-viable. The initial Main Line railway which ran between Ipswich and a small town near Ipswich, Bigge's Camp (or Grandchester as it is now known) was opened in 1865. This was the first stage of a four-stage project to provide railway connections into the major towns on the Darling Downs. The second stage was to link Ipswich through to Toowoomba via the Main Line in 1867. The final two stages were the Western railway line linking Toowoomba to Dalby in 1868 and the Southern railway line linking Toowoomba to Warwick in 1871. Terminating the railway at Ipswich meant that goods were then be transferred to ships at Ipswich to reach Brisbane or beyond. The Ipswich community was opposed to the extension of the railway to Brisbane, as goods would then be transferred to ships in Brisbane, diminishing Ipswich's role as a port. Despite Ipswich's opposition, the Queensland Government ordered a preliminary survey of a railway line between Ipswich and Brisbane which was completed in November 1865. By 1872 a report of the Royal Commission on Railway Construction was presented to Parliament which made a case for the extension of the South-West Railway into Brisbane. The case for the railway line was adopted and plans were immediately made for a survey which estimated the cost of the rail link to be , or per of line. Previously a decision was made to adopt a narrow gauge of 3 ft 6 in, rather than the wider gauge adopted in other states and this reflects the general attitude toward the construction of railway lines and stations in Queensland in these first years, that of providing adequate facilities economically. On 30 January 1873, the first sod was turned on the extension of the line to Brisbane by the Queensland Governor, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby. As part of the planning for the new line, a major station was planned at the Brisbane Terminal at Roma Street. This building was originally to be an imported iron station building from Britain designed by Sir C. Fox and Son. The downturn in the state's economy in the late 1860s, resulted in a smaller station which was built to a design of FDG Stanley in 1873-1875. The order for the iron building was cancelled, not, however, before certain elements were in transit from London; consequently a large iron carriage shed arrived and was dismantled for use on a number of projects. In October 1873, a tender notice appeared in the Queensland Government Gazette for the construction of the railway station in Brisbane. FDG Stanley who was the Superintendent of Buildings within the Public Works Department at the time, was the designer of the building. The tender of John Petrie was accepted in on 1 December 1873. The building was then built over the next two years. In the Brisbane Courier, \\"Summary for Europe\\", which appeared on 30 October 1873, detailed plans of the new Terminus Passenger Station were provided: > The Station will be erected in the Green Hills, just outside the western > fence of the Grammar School and facing Roma Street from which it will be > distant 100 yards. The general style of the building will be that known as > the Italian Gothic order of architecture. The material used...will be > pressed brick with cut stone facings, this being chosen on account of its > durability and as also affording the greatest consonant with economy. The > station will consist of a main building, two storeys high, flanked at each > end by a single storey wing...On the ground floor...will be the booking > offices, station master's offices, waiting rooms and other offices connected > with ordinary railway travel. The upper floor will be devoted to the offices > of the traffic and engineering staff...The plans have been designed by Mr > FDG Stanley, Superintendent of Public Buildings. Railway construction at Roma Street, circa 1873The line was opened as far as Oxley Point railway station (now known as Chelmer railway station) by February 1875, but the bridge across the Brisbane River to Indooroopilly was not constructed until later, and the trains were shunted across the river on punts. Despite its incomplete state, the line from Ipswich to Brisbane was officially opened on 14 June 1875. At the opening, the platform at Brisbane Passenger Station was half-paved and the rooms and corridors incomplete, the roofing over the platform was still in progress and the place lit temporarily . View from Roma Street, circa 1890 The station was designed to house staff and facilities associated with rail traffic, including the station master, booking office and waiting rooms. A large goods shed was erected at Roma Street in 1875-1876 and sidings were introduced to incorporate the new building. The cost of this work was . The next major addition to the station was a rail bridge over Countess Street also planned in 1876 when Parliament voted for construction of this and other improvements at the station. The bridge measured and was an iron-plate girder span on brick abutments and was constructed to avoid disturbing road traffic. Other improvements at this time include construction of a number of cattle yards. Roma Street railway station and the surrounding railyards has been dramatically altered over the years of its use. In 1911 the railyard was established at Roma Street and the entire site was replanned. The next major change occurred in the early 1940s when the Country Station was constructed between the original Terminal Station and Roma Street. The most recent, and most significant change to the railway station occurred in the 1980s when the transit centre, incorporating the Travelodge Hotel was constructed (now Centra). A number of sources suggest that the original carriage shed was erected as a temporary measure. By 1882 a new carriage shed was erected and the terminal station platforms extended. Also during this year the Sandgate railway line was opened to Sandgate further increasing traffic through Roma Street station. In 1889, the Brisbane Central railway station was opened and the original Brisbane Terminal Station became known as the Roma Street railway station. Construction of buildings, including a gas works, stores buildings and engine sheds continued as rail traffic increased. In 1911 a major re-organisation of the Roma Street railway station precinct was planned, involving the removal of locomotive and carriage facilities to the Mayne Rail Yards where a new marshalling yard was built. Roma Street continued to develop during the 1910s and 1920s as the major goods loading point. In 1914 an additional storey was added to the porte cochere of the station building increasing office accommodation on the first floor. On 30 November 1940 the Country Station was opened at Roma Street. This low-lying face brick building sat directly between the 1873-1875 building and Roma Street. For the first time the early railway station was flanked by platforms and was no longer able to be accessed via Roma Street directly. The new passenger station was designed to relieve congestion at Brisbane Central Station and made Roma Street Station the chief station for long distance travel. Trains travelling, southward however, still left from South Brisbane railway station prior to the construction of the Merivale Bridge in 1978. The 1940 station was planned amid a large garden setting some of which survives to this day and continued a tradition of substantial and attractive gardens surrounding railway stations in Queensland. When constructed the roof of the 1873-1875 station was clad with slate tiles, during the general refurbishment of the station area following the construction of the 1940 passenger station the roof of the early station was re-clad with corrugated fibrous sheeting. Platforms and awnings were constantly re-arranged at the Roma Street Station. In 1959 the early iron carriage shed was removed and was replaced with more modest awnings. During the 1980s the isolation of the original station building was further increased with the construction of the monolithic Brisbane Transit Centre which incorporated new railway facilities along with a hotel, offices and function centre. This development saw the demolition of the 1940 railway station. During the mid 1990s a further re-arrangement and extension of the platforms to the north and south of the early station building occurred. Several studies through the early 2000s, including by Mark Jones Architects and Bruce Buchanan, investigated the refurbishment of the original station building, which had fallen into serious disrepair. Eventually in 2012, Queensland Rail commissioned the architectural firm, Architectus to complete the design work of a rescue refurbishment of the external fabric. The work included a new slate tile roof to replace the asbestos sheeting. This matched the original roofing. Other work included dismantling of intrusive work of the mid 20th century and stripping on the paint from the brickwork exterior and a replacement pediment at the Western end. The Architectus work (builder Kane Constructions) restored the station building exterior to its former glory. Michael Kennedy was the heritage consultant for the project.  Description  Rear view of the station building, 2015 The 1873 Roma Street railway station is a substantial building constructed of rendered masonry situated between the new Roma Street railway station within the Travelodge (Centra) tower on Roma Street and the platform structures to the rear of this. The building retains some s platform awnings and is adjacent to early remnant garden areas. The 1873-1875 station is a two storeyed building lined to the north and south by platforms. When built the platforms were at the rear, northern edge of the building only. Platforms were introduced to the southern side from the 1940 renovation. At the eastern end of the station building is a large iron roofed and steel framed semi-open space which replaced an earlier similar structure. Several small buildings survive to the west of the station building surrounded by remnant gardens. The building when constructed was a loadbearing face brick structure with a central two storeyed section flanked by one storeyed wings. The corrugated fibrous cement roof of the station is hipped over the central part and separately hipped over the flanking bays which also feature dormer windows with brick surrounds to the south. The present roof replaced an earlier slate roof. The building has been painted externally. The building was designed with classical elements including symmetrical massing, southern arcade and porte cochere; round and square arched head windows, castellated parapet detailing, classically inspired mouldings, string course mouldings lining the entire building and pilasters separating openings. A description of the newly completed building described the style as \\"Italian Gothic\\", probably reflecting the face brick and stone dressed mouldings of the exterior and the classical elements over the building. The building is a substantial example of a late Victorian Italianate influence. The central part of the building is divided into three bays, a central bay projects from the southern face of the building and is lined on the ground floor of this face with a porte cochere. The porte cochere comprises rusticated corner columns and round intermediary columns supporting an arcade with castellated parapet. Since original construction a second storey has been added to the porte cochere. The southern face of the upper floor of this central bay is lined with five round arched window openings, with brick surrounds and moulded hoods. The central bay is flanked by side bays each with three round arched windows on the upper floor and a partially enclosed arcade on the ground floor. The windows along the southern side of the building are generally timber-framed double-hung sash windows and along the northern side are aluminium framed sliding windows. The northern face of the building was originally conceived as an internal wall, inside the original carriage shed. The northern face features a number of irregularly spaced windows and doors along the ground floor, and regularly space squared arched windows on the floor above. Internally, the building is arranged on the ground floor with a number of rooms openings from the original arcade along the southern side of the building and stair halls at the eastern and western ends of the building providing access to the upper floor. The upper floor is arranged around a substantial central hall articulated by moulded round archways, from which a number of large rooms open. The ground floor has a concrete floor covering the central bay of the building and timber boarded floors to the eastern and western ends. The arcade on this floor provides access to a large central hall, divided into two by a rendered brick partition and by a curved walled room on the northern side and originally used as a ticket office. The hall was used for waiting rooms and the separation reflects the division between first and second class passengers. Other rooms on the ground are smaller offices, some with timber boarded ceilings. Within these offices are many items of significant furniture which contribute to an understanding of the railway history of the building; including joinery pieces, special cupboards and an early station names board. Large public toilet facilities are found at each end of the ground floor of the building. The upper floor of the building was designed for use as staff offices and facilities. The two stairways providing access to the upper floor are found at the western and eastern ends of the floor. The eastern stair is a narrow dog- leg timber stairs on a steel frame which dates from about the mid-20th century. The western stair is an earlier timber dog leg stair. The central first floor hallway provides access to a number of large, well lit office spaces. Natural lighting from the windows lining the building is supplemented on both the northern and southern sides with a series of skylights, which though probably not original are certainly an early development of the building and reflect the use of the rooms as offices. The partitioning on the upper floor is constructed with lath and plaster walls and the ceilings are also lath and plaster. The upper floor has more decorative finishes than the lower floor with moulded archways along the hall, and cornices and skirting boards of various sizes in the halls and rooms. Early paint schemes are evident in many places of the upper floor.  Heritage listing  The 1873 Roma Street railway station building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Roma Street railway station was erected in 1873-1875 as the first Brisbane Terminal Station and demonstrates the development of the railway in Queensland, as the earliest Brisbane city station and as the head office of railway administration in the 1870s and 1880s who oversaw the construction of rail lines in Queensland. The building demonstrates the development of Queensland in the 1870s with the construction of major public buildings and the provision of essential public services. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Roma Street railway station demonstrates the principal characteristics of major railway stations in Queensland. The building in its form and layout provides evidence of its former use, with evidence of waiting halls, ticket offices, public facilities and offices. The building has architectural value as a substantial example of the public work of prominent Queensland architect, FDG Stanley. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has architectural value as a substantial example of the public work of prominent Queensland architect, FDG Stanley. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The 1873-1875 Roma Street railway station is of social value as an important remnant of an inner city railway station in public use for over 120 years. Because the context of the building has been gradually changed and the building is no longer appreciated as a discrete structure, the surviving railway station contributes to an understanding of the development of the site.

Park (December 30, 1877 ‚Äì July 11, 1969) was a pioneering American pediatrician who established the pediatric heart disease clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, along with other pediatric subspecialties. During his career, Park was not only known as the Chief-of-Pediatrics of the Harriet Lane Home for two decades, but also a well-published researcher on medical conditions such as rickets and lead poisoning. The contemporary pediatric department at Hopkins is still regulated in the same way that Park had once established. The Edwards A. Park Scholarship Fund at Johns Hopkins was built under his name upon his eightieth birthday by friends, colleagues and former students.  Early life  Park was born in Gloversville, New York on December 30, 1877. His father was a local Congregational minister. Park attended Yale University and earned his B.A. degree in 1900. After graduation, Park refused to follow his father into a religious occupation. He instead debated between a career in medicine and a career in teaching Greek. He eventually decided to pursue medicine shortly after graduating from Yale. Park first received his M.D. from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1905 and then went on to become an intern at the Roosevelt Hospital in New York from 1905-1907. He spent the next two years interning at the New York Foundling Hospital, working for six months in pediatrics where Dr. John Howland was an attending physician. Park also spent several months at the City Hospital on Blackwell Island, where he would cultivate pathological skills and insight crucial to his later research in crickets.  Career  = Early career = After completing his internships, Park first got a job in private practice from 1909 - 1912 where he worked for Dr. Theodore Janeway as an office assistant. It was with Dr. Janeway that Park published his first paper in 1910 that focused on the contractions of arteries, which they had studied in vitro. In 1912, Park wrote his first pediatrics paper while studying pathology at Welfare Island. During that summer, Park also went to Marburg, Germany to study under Dr. Schmidt, the world's leading expert in rickets at the time. While abroad, Park was offered a position by Dr. Howland to join his first pediatric staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Although Park initially declined because he was working with Dr. Janeway at that time and felt obliged to stay in the position, he later joined the small staff in the effort of creating a new full-time department of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins. = World War I = When World War I broke out in 1914, Red Cross sent Park to Le Havre, France to run an orphanage for Belgian children. With a confined staff of only three doctors, a nurse and an executive secretary, Park utilized very limited resources to establish a clinic and a small hospital in the local neighborhood. During this time, Park witnessed first-hand the effects of poverty and malnutrition on disease, which is why he later decided to hire Ruth Washington in the summer of 1918 to build a department of social service. = Johns Hopkins = In 1919, Park returned to the United States and, in particular: Baltimore, Maryland. Following his research with Dr. Howland, Park went to Yale where he would take on the role as the Professor of Pediatrics for seven years. In 1927, Dr. Howland's untimely death caused Park to return to Johns Hopkins to take over as the Professor of Pediatrics and Chief-of- Pediatrics. In 1946, Park was also named the Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics at the School of Medicine. As Chief-of-Pediatrics of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Park established multiple specialty clinics under pediatrics, with the tuberculosis, cardiac, endocrine, and psychiatric clinics bringing fame to the Harriet Lane Home. He was also known for his daily noon conferences with his staff where an intern, resident and sub-specialist would all review a case. After they presented Park would question all parts, reviewing all steps and small details. Of his questions, one student described them as being \\"asked softly, hesitantly, almost apologetically, but each one was apropos, pointed and searching\\" His attention to detail also applied to all publications that came from the Harriet Lane Home, as Park wrote about 30 papers over his twenty years as Chief-of-Pediatrics and reviewed over 100 papers written by his staff. However, Park's most notable achievement as pediatrician in chief stemmed from his well-rounded approach to combining pediatric treatment with holistic research, training, and community involvement.  The Harriet Lane Home  Dr. Park spent half of his life working at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. When Howland died in 1926, Park was inaugurated as the new Professor of Pediatrics who would oversee the operations of the Harriet Lane Home. Thus, Park became the successor of Howland and the third director of the Harriet Lane Home in the two decades that would follow (1926-1947). Only six months after settling into his new position, Park soon came to the realization that children in the Baltimore dispensaries were receiving significantly lower quality care as compared to children who could afford to be treated at the hospital. Frustrated at this social phenomenon, Park went to Dr. Edward Carter, who was then a cardiologist in the Department of Medicine. Park asked Carter whether he would be supportive of his starting a pediatric clinic. On 1 December 1927, Park successfully collaborated with the Rockefeller Institute and the Commonwealth Fund to establish a pediatric heart disease clinic at Johns Hopkins in the outpatient dispensary. Park's contributions to the Harriet Lane Home were indisputable in the history of Johns Hopkins medicine. Before Park's arrival, the Harriet Lane Home was merely an obscure clinic where pediatrics was viewed as a specialty that held very little status. Although the full-time system had recently begun to flourish in the United States, it was difficult for most of the hospitals and clinics to adhere entirely to its principles. Under Howland, the university started to pour in intellectual and financial investments to the full-time pediatric system, but Park ultimately played the transitional role in solidifying the longevity of the system. Park invoked concerns about access to and cost of pediatric health care and advocated for central focus surrounding a few particular diseases.  Research  213x213pxAlthough Park's initial research interests revolved around cardiovascular physiology and cardiac disease, his research later made the most impact in the field of rickets and the growth in bone that indicate the illness. During Park's time, rickets had been viewed as an enduring and often permanently damaging disease that was especially prominent in the case of infants. Before Park's initial arrival at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Howland and Dr. E.V. McCollum had already begun work on studying rickets - specifically studying the changes in calcium and potassium content of the blood. Dr. Park taught and worked in the Hunterian Lab where he studied histologic changes in the bone, characterizing normal versus abnormal changes in bone growth. He did so by varying dietary deficiencies and through his work discovered that vitamin D can be used to prevent rickets. This work, along with that done by Dr. E.V. McCollum, Dr. Simmonds and Dr. Shipley, led to a total of 23 publications over a brief fifteen-month period. Park's other research interests were reflected in his study of bone structure where growth has been malignantly halted by illness. Through x-ray examinations, he discovered that bone growth proceeds horizontally so that a dense horizontal line of bone builds up during a disease phase, despite the cartilage arrest. Park received the Goldberger Award for this study at the age of 85, and he also included his findings through years of bone growth research in the publication of his last paper in 1964.  Personal life and family  While working at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Park lived in Garrison, Maryland with his wife, Agnes Bevan, an English woman he had met in London in 1911. Together, they have three children, two sons and a daughter. Referred to as \\"Ned\\" by his friends and colleagues, Park was known for having people over to his home and summer home in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. There, Park continued his research and fished for salmon, designing the 'Park fly' to better catch them. It was at his summer home on the Margaree River that Park passed away in 1969 and was later buried.

She studies the processes involved in genetic variation, specializing in plant population biology and evolutionary quantitative genetics. Her work is particularly relevant in studying the effects of stressors such as climate instability and population fragmentation on evolutionary change in populations. She has developed and applied new statistical methods for her field and is considered a leading population geneticist. Shaw has been active on a number of editorial boards, most recently as chief editor of the journal Evolution (2013‚Äì2017). She has received several awards including the 2017 Sewall Wright Award from the American Society of Naturalists, given to a senior investigator who continues to make fundamental contributions to \\"the conceptual unification of the biological sciences\\".  Early Life  Shaw's parent were both chemists and she grew up in Pennsylvania. Shaw has stated that they fostered her interested in the natural world by going on nature walks and consulting field guides to identify plants and birds. Education Shaw received her B.A. in biology at Oberlin College. Her interest in the evolution of plants was sparked by a class in vertebrate anatomy taught by Warren Walker. She received her Ph.D. in botany and genetics at Duke University in 1983, working with Janis Antonovics. She then worked as a postdoc with Joseph Felsenstein at the University of Washington. Career Shaw was an assistant professor at the University of California, Riverside from 1987 to 1992. In 1993, she joined the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior at the University of Minnesota where she now heads the Ruth G. Shaw Research Group. In 2018, Shaw was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research Shaw is an evolutionary biologist, who studies evolutionary change in nature. She is concerned with stressors such as climate change and population fragmentation and their effects on evolutionary change in populations. In early work with David N. Reznick, Frank H. Shaw and Helen Rodd, Ruth Shaw examined the effects of predator fish on the experimental evolution of subsequent guppy generations. They studied guppy populations over an 11-year period. They found that descendant guppies who were not directly affected by predation evolved in ways that resembled the life histories of guppies who had lived in predator-free communities. They also found that guppies could evolve extremely quickly, at a rate thousands of darwins faster than the rates of evolutionary changes observed in the fossil record. In much of her work Shaw has focused on evolutionary processes in plant populations. She uses techniques from quantitative genetics and population biology as well as field experiments to study the evolution of plants such as Echinacea angustifolia. Through empirical studies, she examines evolutionary change in its ecological context. By studying Echinacea angustifolia, she has demonstrated that inbreeding, which frequently affects fragmented populations, can influence key functional traits. Traits related to plant structure, physiology and elemental composition are important to individual fitness and ecological dynamics in populations. With Margaret Bryan Davis and others, Shaw has examined Paleoclimate change in North American forests, from the Quaternary period onwards. Pollen granules and other plant remains, found in lake sediment cores, can show changes in populations in an area over time. In 2011, Davis, Shaw and Julie R. Etterson received the William Skinner Cooper Award from the Ecological Society of America for the paper \\"Evolutionary responses to changing climate\\". In this paper, they synthesized ecological and evolutionary research about plant populations and the effects of rapid climate change, challenging the paradigm that evolutionary responses in the Quaternary period were slow and ineffective. The evidence they presented suggests that evolutionary adaptation does occur in plant populations subjected to the stress of rapid environmental change. Shaw has also developed new statistical methods, such as aster modeling, with statistician Charles Geyer . Aster Modeling enables the analysis of life history data to obtain estimates of fitness and population growth rates. The importance of Shaw's work on quantitative genetics and analysis of fitness was recognized in 2009 when the American Society of Naturalists gave its President's Award to the paper Unifying Life‚ÄêHistory Analyses for Inference of Fitness and Population Growth. Shaw has also developed Quercus, a quantitative genetics software, that performs a maximum likelihood analysis of variance of quantitative genetic data.  Mentoring  Shaw advises graduate students in the departments of Applied Plant Sciences; Conservation Biology; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior; and Plant Biological Sciences at the University of Minnesota. Her students have assessed the effect of climate change on adaptation potential of native plants, the evolutionary consequences of gene flow from cultivated plants to naturally occurring plant relatives, and the evolutionary change in introduced species.

The August 2017 induction ceremony was ProRodeo's 38th annual event, and marked the first time in the event's history that the class of inductees included barrel racers from the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). James' horse, Gils Bay Boy, nicknamed Scamper, was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1996. By the end of 2017, James had won more World Barrel Racing Championships than any other barrel racer in the event's history. She and Scamper earned national recognition from the WPRA World Barrel Racing Championships after winning ten consecutive championship titles from 1984 to 1993. The duo also won the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) Barrel Racing Average title seven times in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1993, and 2002. She qualified for the NFR 19 times. James retired Scamper in 1993, and ten years later she retired from competition after winning her 11th WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship in 2002. Early history Charmayne James, born June 23, 1970, in Boerne, Texas, was raised in Clayton, New Mexico. She was three years old when she first started riding horses, and by age six she was running barrels. Her recollection of barrel racing is that it was the only thing she ever wanted to do. She began her rodeo career at a young age when she joined the Rabbit Ear 4-H Club. Barrel racing is the only event women compete in at Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) sponsored events, and is second only to bull riding as the most popular event. As a young girl, James rode Bardo in barrel racing competition. They had competed in amateur rodeos for about two years before Bardo shattered a bone in his leg, and had to be euthanized. James considered Bardo her best friend, which made finding a replacement for him difficult. She eventually set her sights on Gils Bay Boy, an American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) registered gelding her father had purchased as a four-year-old for $1,100 to sort feedlot cattle. In the beginning, James encountered some behavioral issues with the horse, but over time, she was able to train him for barrel racing competition. He became widely known as Scamper, a nickname originating from a comment her father made while watching them run barrels: \\"He sure wants to scamper around those barrels.\\" ProRodeo career By the end of 1983, James and Scamper had competed on the amateur circuit for approximately three years, and advanced to the pro circuit. James filled her permit for the WPRA following a win at a competition in Dodge City, Kansas. \\"Filling a permit\\" is when a contestant fulfills the requirements to become a WPRA card holder, which includes purchasing a permit and earning a minimum dollar amount at sanctioned rodeos. As a card holder, a contestant is allowed to compete in finals events and gain official ranking. In 1984, the pair began their first season competing at the professional level, and by season's end, James had won $53,499.00 and two championship titles, including 1984 WPRA World Champion Barrel Racer and NFR World Champion Barrel Racer. She was also named 1984 WPRA Rookie of the Year. In 1985, the pair earned $93,847 and their 2nd WPRA world championship title. They did it again in 1986, winning their 3rd WPRA world championship title and NFR Average with total earnings of $151,969, achieving professional rodeo's highest earnings ever in a single- event season. Another first came in 1987 at the NFR where the team won their 4th world championship with earnings exceeding $120,000. That same year, James became the first woman ever to wear the No. 1 back number in a National Finals Rodeo. The back number indicates a contestant's ranking in money earnings at the end of the regular season. In 1988, the pair won their 5th world championship with earnings of $130,540‚Äîthe most money earned that year by anyone in professional rodeo competition, exceeding the earnings won by the men's all-around world champion. In 1989, Scamper sustained a cut to his coronet band at the beginning of the NFR. James recalled how the wound forced her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few wins in the go-rounds but they still won the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, the pair qualified again for the NFR, with James having her sights set on a tenth WPRA world championship title. She recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure, and that she wanted to win so she could retire Scamper undefeated while he was still in his prime. The pair won both the 1993 NFR and WPRA world championship titles, securing Scamper's place in barrel racing history. In 1992, James was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, honoring not only her multiple consecutive wins, but also topping the men in earnings. James returned to barrel racing in 1992 riding her new horse Cruising on Six, nicknamed Cruiser, and won her 11th WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship title. Guy Clifton, sports writer for the Reno Gazette-Journal and ESPN.com remarked: \\"Anybody that doubted her abilities, she just proved her abilities by winning with another horse.\\" = The bridleless win = James and Scamper during the bridleless win In 1985, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR and won five go-rounds at the event. James recalled that it was Friday the 13th during the 7th go-round of the barrel racing competition when Scamper's bridle fell off his head during the run. As James and Scamper came in, Scamper caught his bridle on the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws that secure the bit and reins to the headstall. With no screws to keep the bridle intact, the headstall fell off the horse's head after rounding the first barrel, and was hanging from the horse's mouth as they ran toward the second barrel. James did what she could to keep the bit in his mouth, but had to turn his head loose as they approached the third barrel. Rounding the third barrel, Scamper spit the bit out of his mouth causing the bridle to drop to his chest, but he was intensely focused on the home stretch and kept running. All James had to control him was a single rein around his neck. The pair crossed the finish line clocking in at 14.4 seconds, winning the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship. Retirement James retired Scamper in 1993, except for an occasional race, and he died on July 4, 2012, at age 35. Scamper received the 1992 AQHA Silver Spur Award which is \\"the equine world's equivalent of the Academy Award\\". James announced her retirement from competition in 2003 after winning a record 11 WPRA World Championships. She began hosting barrel racing clinics. She also has trained horses for cutting and team roping as well as barrel racing. On December 6, 2004, James got married in the small town of Athens, Texas, which is about 1¬Ω hours outside Dallas. The groom was her long- time friend and business manager, Tony Garritano. The couple has two sons together. When James is not traveling to teach in her barrel racing clinics, she spends her time at home in Boerne, Texas. She splits her time between raising her sons or working with her colts. She came out of retirement to compete in RFD-TV's The American, referred to as the \\"world's richest one day rodeo\\", whose inaugural event was held in 2014. The event is held every year in February at AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and televised nationally on RFD-TV. In 2016, she again stepped out of retirement as a member of Elite Rodeo Athletes (ERA) to compete in \\"the inaugural ERA Premier Tour against 87 other world-class athletes that represent 135 world championship titles\\", held May 20‚Äì21 at Tingley Coliseum in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Clayton  Since breeding Scamper was not an option for genetic inheritability, James spent several years researching the possibility of cloning. She chose ViaGen, an animal genetics corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of the colt and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000.Brown, Liz. \\"Scamper Clone Offered for Commercial Breeding\\" The Horse, online edition, November 15, 2008 Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom have inherited Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration is not required to compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events. Career earnings The NFR takes place on 10 consecutive days. At the end of the NFR, there are two barrel racing champions: the World Champion, who completed the year by earning the most money during the season and the finals combined; and the Average champion, who won the NFR by having the best aggregate time. It is possible the two champions may be the same person.

In 1970 the Socialist Republic of Romania ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which banned them from developing and building their own nuclear weapons. However Nicolae Ceau»ôescu started the Danube Program in secret. From 1981 until 1989, the Danube Program was active, using nuclear reactors to create plutonium out of Highly Enriched Uranium, for the purpose of creating a nuclear bomb. In 1992, after the Romanian Revolution, the newly established Romanian Republic reported the infraction to the International Atomic Energy Agency voluntarily, who then reported it to the UN Security Council. Materials The Danube Program acquired Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) from multiple sources, most notably America's Atoms for Peace program, which gave highly enriched uranium to many countries. The project made use of a nuclear reactor, that had been given to them by the United States, to create plutonium from the HEU. Although the project succeeded in creating plutonium, it did not actually construct any nuclear bombs, although it is estimated that with the materials the project had, they could have made up to 240 plutonium bombs, assuming that of plutonium would be used for every bomb.

After two years of working on concepts for a more attractive squeegee, Hansen hired Beaverton, Oregon-based Ziba Design, founded by Sohrab Vossoughi in 1984. Hansen invested $10,000 of his own money to pay Ziba to design what would become the Cleret Glass Cleaner. The brand name Cleret is derived from \\"clear-it\\" and is intended to sound upscale.Michael Rose, \\"Hansen cleans up,\\" Portland Business Journal, vol. 8, no. 23, August 5‚Äì11, 1991, pp. 1, 11.

The company generated $14,000 in sales in 1989, and over $1 million in its first year officially on the market, with 80% of sales coming from high-end catalogs such as Hammacher Schlemmer. It had annual revenues of $16 million by its second year on the market.William B. Gartner and Marlene G. Bellamy, Creating the Enterprise, Mason, OH: Thomson Higher Education, 2009, chapter 8, p. 257. In 1990, Hansen moved Hanco out of his home and into an office at the Water Tower in Portland's Johns Landing neighborhood. Around that time, Hansen quit his job at Nike to focus on building Cleret, continuing to manage and design new products for the company. In 1991, Cleret expanded beyond the United States, as it was introduced in Canada, Europe and Japan. In 1989, while it was still a prototype, the squeegee was one of 12 products to win an Industrial Design Excellence Award from the Industrial Designers Society of America. The squeegee was sold at the gift shop of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1997, the original Cleret squeegee from 1989 would join the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution as a part of its Product Design and Decorative Arts collection.\\"Cleret Squeegee, 1989,\\" cooperhewitt.org, 1997. Products and design Ziba's designers determined that the traditional T-shape of a squeegee was not the most efficient for a wiping motion in a confined area such as a shower stall. After researching the way window washers and filling-station attendants would put their hands close to the blade and rarely use the handle, Ziba designed a plastic squeegee without a traditional handle; instead, it had a tubular rubber grip running parallel to curved twin blades, which moves across glass or mirrors with a wiping motion to reduce strain to the hand and wrist.Patricia Dane Rogers, \\"Great IDEAs,\\" The Washington Post, August 31, 1989. The dual blades leave a surface cleaner than a single blade squeegee.

He was the oldest son of Grigory Petrovsky. He was born in what is now Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine. He was promoted to Komkor from Komdiv in 1937. While in command of forces in Central Asia, he was removed from command and expelled from the army. He was not executed like many of his colleagues. In 1940, he was reinstated in the army. He was a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the Patriotic War. Less than a month after his death, his younger brother, Peter was executed on September 11, despite a request from his father for his release.  World War II  After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, began on 22 June 1941, the 63rd Rifle Corps was rushed to the front as part of the 21st Army of the Western Front, and fought in the defense of eastern Belarus against the German advance. On 6 July, the 63rd's 117th Rifle Division attacked across the Dnieper at night in what was planned as a reconnaissance-in-force. However, the attack surprised the XXIV Motorized Corps' 10th Motorized Division, and pushed the German troops back to the Bobruisk-Rogachev road. During the Battle of Smolensk, Petrovsky used his corps to temporarily halt the German advance in the Rogachev area, one of the first successful Soviet counterattacks of the war. The 13 July counterattack across the Dnieper penetrated 810 kilometers into the defenses of the LIII Army Corps' 52nd and 255th Infantry Division, and captured Rogachev and Zhlobin. However, its success was fleeting, as the 63rd's advance was soon halted, and within a week, Rogachev and Zhlobin had fallen to the German troops again. On 26 July, the army and the 63rd Corps were transferred to the new Central Front. In mid-August, troops from the German 2nd Army and 2nd Panzer Group attacked south from Rogachev towards the 21st Army positions around Gomel, encircling and destroying most of the army. Army commander Vasily Gordov requested that the 63rd Corps be allowed to withdraw to Gomel, but Stalin refused. While attempting to break out of the pocket, Petrovsky was killed while defending positions in the village of Staraya Rudnya. Around this time, he was given command of the 21st Army, but as a result of the combat situation Petrovsky was unable to assume command. In an uncommon action for the Eastern Front, he was buried with full military honors by German troops and a cross was erected over his grave with an inscription announcing his bravery.

He was last Spartocid ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom and ruled from 125 to c. 109 BC after the death of his brother Paerisades IV Philometor. With his death, ended a dynasty of Bosporan kings that had ruled the Bosporan Kingdom for over 3 centuries, starting in 438 BC with his ancestor Spartokos I. Reign and Death The kingdom had been under increasing pressure from the nearby Scythians, probably under the rulers Skilurus and Palacus. His elder brother may have been killed by the Scythians, as well as a probable relative named Spartokos VI, though his existence is disputed. Paerisades V succeeded his elder brother Paerisades IV in 125 BC, who was already under pressure from invading Scythians who may have caused his death. To improve his relationship with the Scythians, Paerisades V may have adopted an individual named Saumacus. Towards the end of Paerisades's reign, Diophantus, a general in the service of Mithridates VI of Pontus, began attacking the Scythians under Palacus and then made his way to the Bosporan Kingdom's capital of Panticapaeum. There, he entered into talks with Paerisades to bring the Bosporan Kingdom under the control of Mithridates VI in exchange for his survival. The Bosporan Kingdom was suffering at the time from an economic crisis as well as increasing pressure from the Scythians. Diophantus returned a year later to Paerisades's court to finalise the deal, when Saumacus, Paerisades's adoptive Scythian son, started a rebellion which ended in Paerisades's death and Diophantus barely being able to escape in time.McGing, Brian Charles.

It is the first in a series of three books titled the Manus Dei Trilogy. The novel follows protagonist Lazarus as he embarks on a mission to find his missing daughter, Elisha. She disappeared during a freak accident that erased most of Lazarus's memory of and leading up to the event. He uses a technology called the Manus Dei System that allows him to explore the afterlife in search of his memories he has forgotten in life. The journeys end up taking him to a desolate moon, called Heiron, where his daughter was last seen.  Background  The first draft of Plane Walker was written in 2012, published independently titled as Lazarus. Dunphey would go on to express his disappointment with the original draft, considering it rushed and lacking of patience within the narrative. Four years later, and after extensive professional edits, the book would be re-released as Plane Walker.  Plot  Set very far in the future, Plane Walker takes place in a universe where technology and religion are connected in more ways than one. A central point to all of the events in the novel is the Manus Dei System, created by scientist Hugh Zephyre. The mechanism can take one into the afterlife and back, visually recording the events as seen through the eyes of the traveler's soul. The novel follows Lazarus, a man with a dark past who lost his daughter in a freak accident. He finds the last Manus Dei System in the galaxy on the Venter Bestiae, a ship commanded by Jonah, Dinah, and Ezra. After traveling into the afterlife 37 times, Lazarus finally uncovers a memory of where his daughter was before the accident. The crew then embark on a mission to Heiron, a moon that has been crippled and destroyed by nuclear fallout, to rescue Lazarus's daughter, Elisha.  Reception  Plane Walker has received primarily positive reviews. Stuart Anderson of the Fifth Dimension compared the novel to \\"both cinematic and literary\\" inspirations such as, \\"Philip K. Dick, H.P. Lovecraft, Twelve Monkeys, John Carpenter, and Alien,\\" while calling the book \\"hugely enjoyable\\" and \\"a remarkable piece of writing.\\" Donovan's Bookshelf raved about the \\"philosophical reflections sprinkled throughout\\" the novel and concluded with calling the novel a \\"complex work of art.\\" Author Arley Dial called the novel, \\"a surrealistic nightmare reminiscent of the work of Thomas Ligotti.\\" Readers Favorite wrote a Five Star review, writing that the novel was \\"incredibly unique.\\" Book blog Jennifer's Book Nook wrote a review, calling the book \\"thought-provoking.\\" On a more critical side, science fiction magazine Amazing Stories called the novel \\"slow to start\\" and said it \\"focused too much on minutia\\" while praising the technical writing of the work.

For his courage in battle, he earned the moniker \\"red blooded.\\" Early life and career Little is known about Estrella's early life and career: he was born in Malolos, Bulacan in 1856; three years later, on 31 August 1859, the town of Malolos was divided into three independent towns: Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Estrella hailed from Santa Isabel. Military career Filipino revolutionaries exiled to Hong Kong. Estrella is in the back row, flanked by Isabelo Artacho, Antonio Montenegro, Gregorio del Pilar, and Isidro Torres. When the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896, Estrella was serving in the native contingent of the Spanish colonial armed forces. Soon enough, he was among the native officers who deserted the colonial armed forces and joined the revolutionaries. By 1897, he has distinguished himself in the battles at Perez Dasmari√±as and Naic. For his courage in these battles, he received the moniker red blooded from his fellow revolutionaries. This was the time when Governor General Camilo Garc√≠a de Polavieja renewed the Spanish offensive in Cavite, with his deputy Jos√© de Lachambre leading on the front line. Due to the overwhelming gains of the Spanish, Emilio Aguinaldo was forced to relocate his headquarters from Talisay, Batangas to Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel, Bulacan. On 15 November 1897, the provisional constitution for the Biak-na- Bato Republic was ratified, with Estrella as one of the signers. With the Spanish seeking a quick resolution to the war, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed on 14 December 1897 by Spanish Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera and the Republic of Biak-na-Bato President Emilio Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were given amnesty and monetary indemnity by the Spanish Government, in return for which the revolutionary government would go into exile in Hong Kong (later known as the Hong Kong Junta). Aguinaldo had decided to use the money to purchase advance firearms and ammunition later on return to the archipelago. Among those who were exiled was Estrella.Mabini, A., 1969, The Philippine Revolution, Republic of the Philippines dept. of Education, National Historical CommissionAlvarez, S.V., 1992, Recalling the Revolution, Madison: Center for Southeast Asia Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, On 19 May 1898, Aguinaldo decided to resume the revolution and returned to the Philippines through American aid. Among those who returned with him was Estrella. When the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War broke out on 4 February 1899, Estrella was one of the first generals to see action outside Manila. On 5 February, the Americans positioned themselves in the outskirts of San Roque (now part of Cavite City), which Filipino troops are being commanded by Estrella. Three days later, on 8 February, Second Lieutenant John Glass of the 1st Battalion of the California Heavy Artillery (California National Guard) was sent with an escort to demand Estrella the surrender and the evacuation of the town. Otherwise, artillery and gunboat bombardment would be done against them. By this time, the gunboats Manila and Callao have been positioned just outside the town to assist the offensive. On 9 February, the town mayor approached Commodore George Dewey to ask for more time to decide the matter. When Dewey refused, the Filipinos raised the white flag of surrender. However, this was only a deception to lure the Americans into attacking the town. When the Americans managed to occupy San Roque, the retreating Filipinos set the town on fire. In order to gain access to the area, the Americans had to flank it from the sea. Meanwhile, skirmishes were undertaken whenever the Americans caught up with the Filipinos. Estrella would continue leading Filipino troops for the rest of the year, even fighting alongside Brigadier General P√≠o del Pilar in Guadalupe, Makati (then part of Rizal). However, on 8 June 1900, Estrella was caught with P√≠o del Pilar by the American secret police (which utilized a native contingent headed by Captain Lara) at Guadalupe. Later life and death Estrella died in his hometown of Malolos, Bulacan on 19 October 1932, aged 76.

She often appropriates existing materials and objects and blurs the premise of non-fiction. Her work has been featured a number of national and international exhibitions. Aside from her artwork, Moyer also works as an associate professor at the University of Virginia (UVA).  Early life  Moyer received her BFA at the New York State School of Art and Design at Alfred in 1999. In 2005, Moyer received her MFA in studio practice at UNC Chapel Hill.  Career  After receiving her BFA, Moyer taught community documentary at Appalshop in Appalachian Kentucky. She began teaching at UVA in 2006. Moyer‚Äôs art is primarily video and print art. In an interview with Kiana Williams for Iris Magazine, a feminist magazine, at the University of Virginia, Moyer described her art making process as though it is her ‚Äújob to distill personal experience or interest into something that other people can understand or from which they can get something, whether it be a feeling, an insight, a question, anything.‚Äù Moyer's art reinterprets and makes observations through a personal lens based on her own experiences. When asked about her motivation when making her pieces, Moyer said her ‚Äúwork often springs from my idealism and an attempt to reconcile that idealism with the world we live in. I‚Äôd be trying to reconcile those thing even if I wasn‚Äôt making art‚Ä¶In the most unromantic way, I think art is often about compulsion. The arts are too uncertain if one has to consciously seek motivation. If someone isn‚Äôt compelled to make things, I think they‚Äôd be smart not to abandon their interest in art but to find another way to make a living in order to be comfortable. That said, sometimes it takes a while to recognize these things, whether one is compelled or not. The influences and community around you can make a huge difference‚Äù  Art Work  Much of Moyer‚Äôs work deals with feminism, the environment, culture, and themes of erasure. Her video series The Forcing for instance, deals directly with themes of environmental degradation, climate change, and issues dealing with the objectification of women in the form of viral trends and videos. Deer, commonly associated with femininity, play a crucial role in many of Moyer‚Äôs pieces. In The Forcing two does are featured entering a house through a dog door while a sound file of a rambunctious crowd is played and clips of a vicious crowd of photographers are spliced in, allowing Moyer to address issues of objectification, social media, and environmental degradation. By splicing in clips of a large crowd of paparazzi pushing and shoving one another to take photos of the deer in the viral clip, a metaphor for women on the internet, she is able to convey the issues of objectification of women on the internet. These themes are repeated in several her published books like Deerstains, where deer are Photoshopped out of photos leaving obvious, and sometimes less obvious evidence of the deer that was previously in the photo. The absence of the deer, a metaphor for women, conveys Moyers analysis of the erasure of women, their accomplishments and even existence, throughout history and society today. As with many of Moyers pieces, the what is not present within the piece is what is important. Its obviousness of its absence and the void it left in an otherwise complete artwork, makes existence and its place in the piece more powerful. In another piece, Paradise, a feature-length film, Moyer investigates the relationship between culture and nature. In this piece, Moyer visits iconic locations where tragedies or disasters took place such as the Ninth Ward in New Orleans. The absence of people throughout the videos conveys the starkness of the landscapes which were once sensationalized, but now largely forgotten about. The goal of the piece is to encourage the view to experience the event again in a new light, while viewers without prior knowledge can create their own narratives. The piece plays with contrast in the relationship between the viewer and their preconceptions of a sensationalized tragedy as well as the relationship between evidence of human society in the natural landscape  Art Projects  = Videos = * Paradise (2011) * The Teardrinkers at the Crow‚Äôs Nest (2013) * Comet Song (2015) * The Forcing (2015) * Paradise (2015) * The Forcing (no. 2) (2015) * study for unsettling (2016) * The Forcing (no. 4) (2016) * Terre Nullius (2016) * moments of silence (2016) * Solstice (2017) * Theforcing (no.6) (2017) = Books = * vault (2010) * real estate (2011) * Deerstains (2011) * bounty (2011) * The Unabomber‚Äôs Wife (2011) * Listy Silver (2015) * The Unabomber‚Äôs Ex-Wife (2017) = Other Projects = * Hateful (2015)  Exhibitions  = Solo and Two Person Exhibitions = * (2016) Athens Film Festival, Athens, OH, Paradise * (2016) Viking Cinema, Fj√∫k Arts Centre, H√∫sav√≠k, Iceland, Paradise * (2014) The Box, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH, Tar Creek * (2012) The Crow‚Äôs NestPreserve, National Lands Trust, Warwick, PA, The Teardrinkers * (2010) Lump Projects, Raleigh, NC, Black Damp = Group Exhibitions and Group Screenings = * (2017) Plecto Espacio de Arte Contempor√°neo, Medellin, Colombia, Frame & Frequency * (2017) Knockdown Center, Queens, New York, Nasty Women * (2016) Les Recontres Internationales, Ga√Æt√© Lyrique, Paris, Frances, Post-Traumatique * (2013) Center for Book and Paper, Columbia College, Chicago, IL, DIY (visits Chicago) * (2012) Holmfirth Arts Festival, Towser Zine Library, Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England * (2010) UN Climate Change Conference, Cancun, Mexico, Two Degrees of Separation  References  Year of birth missing (living people) Place of birth missing (living people) Living people American contemporary artists University of North Carolina alumni University of Virginia faculty ","title":"Lydia Moyer"},{"id":"53647609","text":"Amadeusz Is a Polish-language version of the given name Amadeus.
