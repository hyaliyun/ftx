Early life Johannes Elai Terserus was born in Leksand where his father, Elaus Ingelberti Terserus, was a vicar. His mother was Anna Danielsdotter Svinhufvud. At the age of four, Terserus lost his mother, and his father married Margareta Bure, the so-called Stormor i Dalom. When he was twelve years old, he also lost his father, but was cared for by his stepmother and her later husband, Uno Troilius. Education and career Terserus was sent to study in V√§ster√•s, where Bishop Johannes Rudbeckius took a special interest in his unusual statute and diligence, and whom he then accompanied on a visitation trip to Livland. He commenced studies in Uppsala in 1628 and ordained priest in 1631. In 1632 he became a lecturer in Greek in V√§ster√•s and the following year, with the support of Carl Gyllenhielm, Johan Ban√©r and Axel Oxenstierna, eh embarked on a study trip during which he visited the leading academies in Germany, France, England and the Netherlands. He returned to Sweden in 1637 and resumed his position as a lecturer and also became the principal of an upper secondary school and notary in the chapter of the court. In 1639 he was awarded the Master of Philosophy with first honors from Uppsala. That same year, he also became a theology lecturer in V√§ster√•s. In 1640 he was appointed as third theology professor at the Royal Academy of Turku and served as the university's rector in 1645. In 1647, during his stay in Stockholm, he taught Hebrew to Queen Kristina. In 1648 he was appointed second theology professor in Uppsala and became a Doctor of Theology. In 1649 he started to work on a critical edition of the Old Testament with basic text and Latin translation. He also participated in politics and became a member of the Riksdag in 1650. Bishop Eventually he lost the trust of Queen Kristina; however, he gained favor with Charles X Gustav, Kristina's successor, who the appointed him Bishop of Turku in 1658. He commenced his episcopacy in 1659, after having participating in a commission for the reorganization of the Church Order. Terserus was well-learned, sharp-minded, hardworking and busy. However, he was also difficult, self-centered, stubborn and self-righteous, and consequently acquired numerous enemies. In 1662 he published his Declaration on Catechism, which included the basic Christian teachings. But he was heavily criticized by Professor Enevald Svenonius, who was a defender of pure Lutheranism and accused of Terserus of Syncretism. Consequently, the Council intervened and appointed a commission to investigate the matter. Its decision resulted in the withdrawal of Terserus' writings; he was suspended from exercising his episcopal duties in Turku in 1664.\\"SVENONIUS, Enevald\\", Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland. Retrieved on 06 April 2019. He was then appointed vicar of Riddarholm Church in Stockholm in 1665, and in 1668 was appointed vicar of the Klara Church. In 1671, he was appointed Bishop of Link√∂ping. At first he remained silent and did not say anything related to his previous suspension from Turku, but in 1675, after he was commissioned to take part in the theology doctorate ceremony in the Riksdag, he broke his silence and once more defended his theological statements. This created great controversy, leading him to withdraw from his diocese. He died on 11 April 1678.\\"Svenonius, Enevaldus Svenonis (1617‚Äì1688)\\", Biografiakeskus. Retrieved on 06 April 2019.

Biography  Dad-windad served as the chief secretary, which was a powerful post but also a risky one, with the possibility of a harsh penalty or even death. On April 28 224, Dad-Windad took part in the climatic battle of Hormozdgan between the Arsacid and Sasanian forces. The forces of the Sasanian king Ardashir I numbered 10,000 cavalry, with some of them wearing flexible chain armor akin to that of the Romans. Artabanus V led a greater number of soldiers, who, however, were less disposed, due to wearing the inconvenient lamellar armor. Ardashir's son and heir, Shapur I, as portrayed in the Sasanian rock reliefs, also took part in the battle. Artabanus V was defeated and killed during the battle, which marked the end of the Parthian era and the start of 427-years of Sasanian rule. Dad-windad was afterwards executed by Ardashir I.

It is about a young woman who is kidnapped and transforms into a demon. Plot Gloria is kidnapped by a cult which, under a locust moon, performs an occult ritual while wearing grotesque masks before committing suicide. A locust moon is the appearance of the moon in late spring after the \\"Flower Moon\\" of May. Five years later, a traumatized Gloria is living with her mother, Ruth. Slowly recovering from her experience, Gloria attends a therapy group at her local church with her lover Joan. Joan tells Gloria she has something special planned for her birthday tomorrow. But on the night before her birthday, Gloria is kidnapped by Thomas, a man whose face is hideously scarred by fire, and taken to a remote cabin in the countryside. Joan launches an increasingly frenetic search for Gloria, and pulls a knife on a man who is indifferent to Gloria's kidnapping. When a police officer learns of Joan's violent behaviour, he suspects that she was involved in Gloria's kidnapping, which leads her to kill both him and the inconvenient witness Ruth. Thomas tells Gloria that he was one of the cultists who had kidnapped her five years ago, and that he was moved by her humanity, which caused him to abandon his beliefs on that night. He feigned suicide, and states that he kidnapped her to protect her from the remaining cultists, who intend to finish the ritual under the coming locust moon. The cultists believed that they had implanted the demon Abaddon, the \\"Taker of Souls\\", into Gloria's body and that it has been growing inside of her for the last five years. Under the light of the locust moon, Gloria becomes seriously ill and begs Thomas to take her to a hospital. Both Thomas and Gloria experience visions of Abaddon while various occurrences suggest a malevolent supernatural force is present in the cabin. As Gloria begins to grow wings, Thomas starts to believe she really is turning into Abaddon, and contemplates killing her before the transformation is complete. Joan is revealed to be the leader of the cult who kidnapped Gloria. Thomas tells Gloria that Joan is really his sadistic sister Gwendolyn who scarred him with fire. Gloria, whose appearance is increasingly inhuman as her metamorphosis processes, starts to lose herself mentally and begins to speak in the voice of Abaddon, saying she will kill him first and take his soul to hell. Gwendolyn learns from a man who witnessed the second kidnapping that the kidnapper had a scarred face, which leads her to deduce that it was Thomas. Gwendolyn goes to the cabin (which belonged to their parents), knocks out Thomas, taunts Gloria over her physical degeneration, and begins to perform an occult ritual before a chained Gloria. Thomas breaks free, kills Gwen and takes a seemingly dead Gloria outside under a rising sun. Gloria revives and attacks him, saying in the voice of Abaddon that she will take his soul to hell.

Chad Archibald directed the film, which was written by Jayme LaForest. The film was shot in Toronto, Erin and Guelph, Ontario. Distribution and release The Heretics premiered at the 11th edition of the Canadian Film Festival in Toronto, on 22 March 2017. Jason Anderson of the Toronto Star called it \\"a standout\\" among the new features. The eight-picture deal with Breakthrough had solidified Black Fawn's reputation, and their films were universally welcomed at horror film festivals. The Heretics was also screened at the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival. Toronto-based distributor A71 obtained the Canadian rights to the film, which was released at 15 Landmark Cinemas theatres across the country on 1 November 2017 as a special event screening, followed by a week-long national release beginning 3 November. Breakthrough Entertainment distributed the film internationally. A71 partnered with Black Fawn to release the film on DVD and Blu-ray in early 2018. Reception In a review, critic Ricky Church praised the acting and felt that the direction and special effects made the best use of the film's modest budget. The website CultureCrypt in a review stated: \\"Overall, The Heretics is a satisfying, if ultimately adequate, horror movie featuring cults, crazies, and a cabin in the woods. Even though it isn't a standout in Black Fawn and Chad Archibald's complete catalog, it isn't a weak film on its own merit\\". Critic Andrew Mack called The Heretics Archibald's \\"...best work to date. With a familiar narrative he still manages a couple surprises to keep it interesting. His cast contains a reliable stalwart and lets us know that there are a couple of femme fatales emerging on the horizon.\\" In a review, critic Josh Hancock called The Heretics a \\"stylish, well-made horror film\\" that told a \\"captivating story\\" with good performances from the cast. In a review on Horror Fuel website, the critic Dan XIII praised Kiri's performance, writing: \\"Kiri makes for a great lead who can go from vulnerable victim, to strong survivor, to off-kilter possessed with equal skill and aplomb, and make no mistake...this film is her showcase.\\" Critic Luke Rodriguez felt that the film would have benefited from additional takes of key scenes to provide more even performances. Nevertheless, he declared that: \\"The Heretics is a modern marvel of independent genre cinema. When you consider the confines that Chad Archibald and team had to work within to make this happen, and the final product that they delivered, it's hard to fathom how the hell it's even possible.\\" A review on the website Let the Movies Move Us stated: \\"The Heretics justifies the genre of horror, as some scenes, musical score and even the make-up do their job perfectly. The plot itself was a bit flat and uninspiring, which unfortunately was visible to the naked eye. The actors, however, do a decent job despite the screenplay, again, that was not that richly written. However, in spite of bumpy moments, The Heretics [...] is not a bad movie at all. And I am sure with good publicity it might reach a wider audience, who will appreciate it more than I did. It just happened that I was not the right one...\\" A review on the website Anatomy Of A Scream stated: \\"Where The Heretics lacks in character development, it makes up for in motivation. We never fully understand why Gloria has been chosen as the cult's vessel, but that's exactly what she is: a shiny vessel to deliver what they were promised. And that transformation is pretty impressive. The slimy black gunk of hell oozing out of Gloria is unsettling and disturbing while the mental gymnastics of what's really happening to her leaves you disoriented and creeped out.\\" In the Winnipeg Free Press, critic Randall King compared the film to the bigger- budget Ontario-shot horror The Void, writing that The Heretics is \\"comparatively stripped of cast, and outr√© visual effects, aiming instead for dramatic potency to push its concept over the top.\\" =Awards= Kiri was awarded the Best Actress prize at the Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival for her performance in The Heretics.

The genus Peltogyne is also known as Purpleheart, Morao, Nazareno, Violeta or Pau Roxo depending on the region in question. The Peltogyne genus is neotropical and is made up of 23 species. Peltogyne Mexicana is one of the northernmost examples of the Peltogyne genus, found in Guerrero, Mexico. Sotuyo, Solange. \\"El palo morado (Peltogyne mexicana), una leguminosa maderable con futuro incierto y parientes lejanos\\". Revista Digital Universitaria, Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico. Many of the vernacular names derive from the characteristic of the color of the wood, which is unusually purple in the center. However, the coloration darkens and intensifies with the exposure to air and ultraviolet (UV) light; if it is put in water for a few hours, the purple color changes to intense black. Peltogyne mexicana is considered a precious wood. Sotuyo, Solange. \\"El palo morado (Peltogyne mexicana), una leguminosa maderable con futuro incierto y parientes lejanos\\".

P. mexicana is a geographic outlier, with most other members of the Peltogyne genus found in South America].Sotuyo, Solange. \\"El palo morado (Peltogyne mexicana), una leguminosa maderable con futuro incierto y parientes lejanos\\". Revista Digital Universitaria, Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico. Accessed 25 April 2015. Wood This species is prized for its beautiful heartwood which, when cut, quickly turns from a light brown to a rich purple color. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light darkens the wood to a brown color with a slight hue of the original purple. This effect can be minimized by treating cut wood with a finish or sealant containing a UV inhibitor. The dry timber is very hard, stiff, and dense with a specific gravity of 0.86 (). Purpleheart is correspondingly difficult to work with. Uses and hazards Purpleheart is prized for use in fine inlay work especially on musical instruments, guitar fret boards, woodturning, cabinetry, flooring, and furniture. The timber is also valuable in applications that require toughness, such as truck decking. Exposure to the dust, generated by cutting and sanding purpleheart, can cause irritation and nausea, possibly due to the presence of dalbergione (neoflavonoid) compounds in the wood. This also makes purpleheart wood unsuitable to most people for use in jewelry.Peltogyne in BoDD - Botanical Dermatology Database Purpleheart is also a fairly expensive wood, which is why it is usually used in smaller-scale projects. State of conservation This species has a category of Endangered species (A) according to NOM-059-ECOL-2010, caused in part by overexploitation and deforestation and compounded by its slow growth.

First published in French in 1983, an English translation of the second edition was published by Verso Books in 2016.  Publication history  Revolutionary Yiddishland was published in 1983 as Le Yiddishland r√©volutionnaire by the publication house Balland. A second edition, revised by David Forest, contained additional notes and references, as well as a new introduction by the Brossat and Kleinberg, and was published by √âditions Syllepse in 2009. This edition was translated to English by David Fernbach and published by Verso Books in 2016.  Summary  The book chronicles the history of Jews in leftist political movements in Europe and Palestine in the 20th century, examining both the history of left-wing politics within Jewish communities and the history of Jews in the broader socialist and anti-fascist movements of the 20th century. In particular, the book focuses on a few episodes of this history in roughly chronological order: the first two chapters document the emergence of socialist politics in Jewish communities in Eastern Europe against a backdrop of religious traditionalism, rapid industrialization, anti-Jewish violence sanctioned by the Russian Empire, and the Bolshevik Revolution which led to the fall of the Russian Empire and the establishment of the Soviet Union. The third chapter documents the history of Jews who volunteered in the International Brigades that fought in the Spanish Civil War, and the fourth chronicles Jewish resistance movements against the Holocaust during World War II. Chapter five breaks the chronological order of the book, going back to detail the mixed experiences of Jews in the Soviet Union from the 1920s to the 1950s, and a final chapter documents the history of the Communist Party of Palestine and the various roles of Jewish leftists alternately supporting the Zionist movement and the establishment of the state of Israel, or fighting against it as anti-Zionists. Although Brossat and Klingberg are academics, Revolutionary Yiddishland is not an academic text, and openly sympathizes with the revolutionaries that comprise the book's focus. Largely, the book tends cleave to a socialist, anti-Stalinist, anti-Zionist perspective.Locker-Biletzki, Amir. \\"Revolutionary Yiddishland: A History of Jewish Radicalism by Alain Brossat and Sylvia Klingberg (review).\\" Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies, vol. 36 no. 2, 2018, pp. 84-87. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/sho.2018.0033  Reception  The English edition of the book met favorable reviews from left- wing publications. Critics praised the book's commitment to recording the biographies of activists and a collective history which would otherwise have disappeared from collective memory, while also criticizing the book for including what critics viewed as overly nostalgic depictions of early Labor Zionism. In a 1988 review of the original French edition, a writer for Dissidences praised the book overall, while lamenting that the book spends little time analyzing the history of libertarian socialist movements.Fr√©d√©ric Thomas, (06 d√©cembre 2012) \\"Alain Brossat et Sylvia Klingberg, Le yiddishland r√©volutionnaire, Paris, √âditions Syllepse, 2009, 291 p. \\", Dissidences (online), Histoires, Historiographies, , retrieved 06 avril 2019.

Whether or not you \\"get\\" this flagrantly anti-linear movie, there's no missing the artfulness behind it.\\" For the National Post, Stephen Cole panned the film, writing that \\"none of [its cast], amateurs all, show any aptitude for performing (Godson acts about as well as Sex Pistol Sid Vicious played bass), although inarticulate Yuen, who is forever pulling the hair out of his eyes, is an intriguing camera subject-hunk in the tradition of Warhol's Joe Dallesandro.\\" In his 2006 book The Romance of Transgression in Canada: Queering Sexualities, Nations, Cinemas, Thomas Waugh wrote that the film was essentially a postmodern update of John Greyson's 1996 film Lilies, \\"but this one substitutes upbeat prairie rave euphoria for Quebec martyr melodrama\\".Thomas Waugh, The Romance of Transgression in Canada: Queering Sexualities, Nations, Cinemas.

The Tafelberg mesa is in southeastern Cura√ßao, near the Santa Barbara beach. It is high, making it only the fourth-highest point on Cura√ßao behind the Christoffelberg and two intermediate peaks, all in the volcanic northwest of the island. It is formed mostly of the Quaternary limestone that forms the south-east of Cura√ßao, although there are also commercially-significant phosphate and calcareous sand deposits. Fossils of Pleistocene giant tortoises, Chelonoidis, of an estimated carapace length have been found in fill deposits. The vegetation of the area is sparse, owing to the endemic lack of water on Cura√ßao. Comparisons of grazed and inaccessibly ungrazed areas show that the natural vegetation was predominantly of the bromeliad Tillandsia flexuosa, but that this could not tolerate grazing and since the introduction of livestock by humans, primarily goats, has largely been replaced by annual grasses, prickly pear and shrubby acacias.  Mining  Phosphate mining in 1947 Phosphate mine in 1947 In 1955, before mining changed the shape of the hill Phosphate mining began at Santa Barbara in the 1870s, although by 1900 it had been abandoned and the island was in an economically near-derelict state. Mining stopped in 1891, largely owing to a dispute between the landowner and John Godden, the English operator of the mine, and the last exports were in 1895, after 175,000 tons had been exported. It re-opened though in 1913 and was still in operation at the time of visit in 1947. From 1914, the entire economy of Cura√ßao was re-invigorated by the construction of the to refine Venezuelan crude oil. The first railway on the island was built for phosphate traffic, a gravity-worked cable funicular from the mountain to the harbour on Fuikbaai near Nieuwpoort.See :File:Transport bij de fosfaatmijn van het bedrijf Cura√ßao bij de Tafelberg op Cura√ßao, Bestanddeelnr 252-7412.jpg Limestone is also mined in the area and with the great expansion and prosperity post-WWII, this was in demand for the production of cement and, with local sand, concrete for local construction, aided by cheap fuel as distillation waste from the refinery. By the 1960s, this had led to a perceptible change in the shape of the mountain when viewed from a distance. To preserve its appearance, mining since has adopted a 'hollow-tooth' strategy, where mining proceeds and has hollowed out much of the volume of the mountain, whilst preserving its outer periphery, at least for the remaining Northern face.

Many turbines are located in the corners of the irrigated crop circles to minimize the impact to agricultural production. The annual lease payments to the participating landowners total more than $2 million, and about 25 people are employed in ongoing operations and maintenance activities. Mortenson Construction built the facility from August 2015 to December 2016, employing about 350 workers. In addition to erection of the turbines, new infrastructure included access roadways, turbine foundations, electrical collection and transmission lines, and two high-voltage substations. The project was initiated in 2008 by Midwest Wind Energy Development Group, eventually completing much of the planning and approval work. Developer Geronimo Energy purchased the project in 2013, and secured the initial PPA with OPPD. BHE Renewables then purchased the project in early 2015, and announced that it would finance construction. Allianz Global Investors announced it was taking a $400 million interest in the project at the time of its completion. Electricity production data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that the facility operated at an average 43.5% capacity factor during its first two years of operation.

She had a mundane career in the Royal Navy escorting convoys until in 1812, shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812, she had the misfortune to encounter the frigate , which captured Alert. The US Navy used Alert as a storeship and a receiving ship until it had her broken up in 1829. Collier Oxford entered the Register of Shipping (RS) in 1804 with Middleton, master, F.Hurry, owner, and trade Newcastle‚ÄìLondon.RS (1804), \\"O\\" supple. pages. She was a collier, carrying coal from Newcastle-on-Tyne to various ports in the British Isles. Royal Navy The Royal Navy purchased Oxford in May 1804, for ¬£6805, and renamed her Alert. Perry & Co., Blackwall, fitted her between 27 May and 8 June. She then under went further fitting at Woolwich between 8 June and 9 August. Her refitting for naval service cost a further ¬£3730. Commander Donald Mackay commissioned Alert in June. The next month Commander James Johnstone replaced Mackay and sailed Alert for the North Seas and the Downs. Commander Robert Williams assumed command in October 1805, with Commander John Bushby succeeding him in 1807. Commander Williams returned to Alert in 1808. Commander Alexander Renney assumed command in March 1809. He sailed her to Newfoundland on 3 May 1809 and on 18 March 1810. In November 1811 Commander George Trollope replace Renny. Commander Thomas Lamb Poldue Laugharne assumed command of Alert in January 1812. On 5 April he sailed for Newfoundland. =Capture= Laugharne and Alert were cruising from Newfoundland searching for the American sloop when on 13 August they sighted a vessel at . They sailed towards the vessel and prepared to engage. When they got closer the vessel raised the American flag. Alert opened fire, but realizing that the American vessel was a frigate then sought to disengage. They were unable to escape the frigate, which fired on them. Outgunned and outnumbered, Laugharne was forced to strike; Alert had had three men wounded. Alert was the first British warship to surrender to the United States Navy during the War of 1812. =Cartel= Essex was already carrying a large number of prisoners, crew from merchantmen she had captured earlier. Furthermore, Porter had depleted his crew to provide prize crews. After Porter disarmed Alert, he and Laugharne agreed that Alert would carry all Porter's prisoners, naval and mercantile, to Canada to be exchanged for American prisoners of the British, and that she would then proceed to an American port with those freed prisoners. At St. John's, Newfoundland, Admiral Sir John Duckworth, then the senior officer of the Royal Navy in those waters, objected that Alert was not a true cartel as she had not departed from an American port. He argued that allowing ships dispatched at sea to be considered cartels would be tantamount to granting all prizes immunity from recapture and would give them ultimate safe conduct to a port friendly to the captor. However, in this instance, Duckworth felt himself honor-bound to respect Porter's conditions. Captain Laugharne and a small crew embarked some 200 American prisoners of war and sailed for New York where she delivered them safely in the early autumn. Alert was condemned by the New York Admiralty Court and sold to the United States Navy. =Courtmartial= A court martial was held at Halifax on 8 October to inquire into the circumstances of the loss of Alert. The court martial honourably acquitted Laugharne, the purser, and the master. It found the first lieutenant, Andrew Duncan, guilty of disobedience of orders and of not supporting his captain; it ordered him dismissed the service. The court martial board acquitted the remaining officers and men but expressed its disapprobation because they had all gone aft to plead with Laugharne to strike. US Navy The US Navy found Alert unfit for cruising and so instead used her as a storeship at the New York Navy Yard. In 1818 it began to use her as a receiving ship. She remained a receiving ship until 1829 when the Navy had her broken up at the Norfolk Navy Yard.DANFS: Alert I (sloop-of-war)) .

She is the Robert Mundheim Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Her work addresses issues in social welfare law and policy, as well as the relationship of the family, the workplace, and labor markets.  Early life  Wax was born and raised with her two sisters in a Jewish household in Troy, New York, where she attended public schools. Her parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe. Her father worked in the garment industry, and her mother was a teacher and an administrator in the government in Albany, New York.  Education  Wax attended and graduated from Yale University (B.S. in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, summa cum laude, 1975). She then attended Oxford University (Marshall Scholar in Philosophy, Physiology, and Psychology, Somerville College, 1976). She next attended both Harvard Medical School (M.D. 1981) and Harvard Law School (first year of law school, 1981). Wax practiced medicine from 1982 to 1987, doing a residency in neurology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and working as a consulting neurologist at a clinic in the Bronx and for a medical group in Brooklyn. She completed her legal education at Columbia Law School (J.D. 1987; Editor of the Columbia Law Review), working part-time to put herself through law school. Wax then clerked for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She was admitted to the New York State bar in 1988.

Her academic focus is on social welfare law and policy, and the relationship of the family, the workplace, and labor markets. Wax authored Race, Wrongs, and Remedies: Group Justice in the 21st Century (2009). = Controversies = Comments Wax has made controversial comments that have attracted national attention. In an August 2017 piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer titled \\"Paying the price for breakdown of the country's bourgeois culture\\", she wrote with Larry Alexander, the Warren Distinguished Professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, that the decline of \\"bourgeois values\\" (such as hard work, self-discipline, marriage, and respect for authority) since the 1950s had contributed to social ills as male labor force participation rates are down to Great Depression-era levels, opioid abuse is epidemic, half of all children are born to single mothers, and many college students lack basic skills, asserting that \\"all cultures are not equal. Or at least they are not equal in preparing people to be productive in an advanced economy.\\" She told The Daily Pennsylvanian that \\"everyone wants to go to countries ruled by white Europeans\\" because of their \\"superior\\" mores. In the same interview Wax strongly emphasized that she did not believe in the superiority of one race over another, but was describing the situation in various countries and cultures. In a September 2017 podcast interview with Professor Glenn Loury, Wax said: \\"Take Penn Law School, or some top 10 law school... Here's a very inconvenient fact ... I don't think I've ever seen a Black student graduate in the top quarter of the class, and rarely, rarely in the top half ... I can think of one or two students who scored in the top half in my required first year course,\\" and said that Penn Law has a racial diversity mandate for its law review.\\"The downside to social uplift,\\" Glenn Loury & Amy Wax, The Glenn Show (video). University of Pennsylvania Law School Dean Theodore Ruger responded, \\"Black students have graduated in the top of the class at Penn Law, and the Law Review does not have a diversity mandate. Rather, its editors are selected based on a competitive process.\\" In July 2019, at the Edmund Burke Foundation's inaugural National Conservatism conference, Wax said, \\"Perhaps the most important reason that the cultural case for immigration remains underexplored has to do with that b√™te noire, race. Let us be candid: Europe and the First World, to which the United States belongs, remains mostly white for now. And the Third World, although more mixed, contains a lot more non-white people. Embracing cultural distance, cultural distance nationalism, means in effect taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer non-whites.\\" She went on to explain that her ideas were about culture, and not about race, but the racial compositions of the societies in question led to most academics avoiding the topic entirely. Reactions A petition in August 2017 seeking to fire Wax gathered about 4,000 signatures. That same month, 33 of her fellow Penn Law faculty members signed an open letter condemning statements Wax made in her Philadelphia Inquirer piece and Daily Pennsylvanian interview.Guest Column by 33 Penn Law faculty members  \\"Open letter to the University of Pennsylvania community,\\" The Daily Pennsylvanian, August 30, 2017.

Asa Khalif, a leader of Black Lives Matter Pennsylvania, demanded that Wax be fired.\\"Fahrenheit 451 updated,\\" The New Criterion, April 2018. Khalif said he had notified the university that if Wax were not fired within a week he would begin disrupting university classes and other activities with a series of protests. As a result of these controversies, in March 2018, Ruger stripped Wax of her duties teaching curriculum courses to first-year students. In a March 2018 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal titled \\"The University of Denial; Aggressive suppression of the truth is a central feature of American higher education\\", Wax wrote: > The mindset that values openness understands that the truth can be > inconvenient and uncomfortable.... Hoarding and hiding information relevant > to such differences... violates basic principles of fair play... > Universities, like other institutions, scheme relentlessly to keep such > facts from view. Author and political analyst Mona Charen said that the op-ed on bourgeois values \\"contained not a particle of racism\\" and that \\"if the Left cannot distinguish reasoned academic arguments from vile racist insinuations, it will strengthen the very extremists it fears.\\" Political commentator Heather Mac Donald wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal in which she criticized the \\"hysterical response\\" to Wax's piece. University of Pennsylvania Law School Overseer Paul Levy resigned to protest what he termed Wax's \\"shameful treatment\\". Levy wrote in his letter of resignation: \\"Preventing Wax from teaching first-year students doesn't right academic or social wrongs.

It began forming in August, 1941 in the Urals Military District. It reached the fighting front in December, coming under command of the 29th Army in the vicinity of the Rzhev salient and it took part in the bloody and tragic battles for this heavily-fortified position until March, 1943, mostly as part of 30th Army. Following the German evacuation of the salient the 375th got a brief spell in reserve before being reassigned to Voronezh Front in the buildup to the Battle of Kursk. When the offensive began it held a crucial sector on the extreme left flank of 6th Guards Army where the II SS Panzer Corps attempted to break through south of the salient. Following the German defeat the division joined in the counteroffensive towards Kharkov in August and won its first battle honor. It continued to advance through Ukraine and into Romania over the next eight months, being brought to a halt east of Ia»ôi in the spring of 1944. In late August the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts crushed the defending German and Romanian forces, and on the last day of the month the 375th played a leading role in the capture of the Romanian capital, Bucharest; it won its second battle honor and two of its rifle regiments were awarded decorations. For the duration of the war the division fought its way through Romania and Hungary, finally advancing into Austria with 7th Guards Army. Its record of admirable service was capped with the award of the Order of the Red Banner soon following the German surrender, but it was nevertheless disbanded shortly thereafter.

Gen. Vasilii Grigorevich Vorontsov was assigned to command of the division on September 1, and he would remain in this post until February 27, 1942. The division was briefly assigned to the 28th Reserve Army in November, but when it arrived at the front in late December it came under command of the 29th Army in Kalinin Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 100 Battles for Rzhev The Sychevka-Vyasma Offensive Operation, which was planned \\"to encircle, and then capture or destroy the enemy's entire Mozhaisk - Gzhatsk - Vyasma grouping\\", began the fighting for what later became known as the Rzhev salient. On January 12, 1942, 29th Army entered a breach created by 39th Army in the German positions west of the city and began advancing in its direction.Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 26-28 However, at some point in January the 375th was transferred to 30th ArmyCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 26 and so avoided the fate of the 29th, which was encircled and mostly destroyed in February. After a complex regrouping 30th Army began attacking southwards, west of Rzhev, before the end of January in an attempt to join up with the 29th. During February and March the 30th was ordered into repeated attacks to help eliminate the German grouping around Olenino, with little success.Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, pp. 37, 43, 45. On p. 37 Gerasimova mentions two divisions from the 29th being attached to the 30th. On February 28 Maj. Gen. Nikolai Aleksandrovich Sokolov took over command of the division from General Vorontsov. =First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation= Flamethrower teams of the 1245th Rifle Regiment with FOG-2 stationary equipment, summer 1942According to STAVKA High Command Directive No. 170182 to the commander of Kalinin Front, dated March 22:As of May 1 the division was held in Kalinin Front reserves, where it remained as of June 1; by the start of July it was back in the lines as part of 58th Army, still in the same Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 82, 101, 122 The new offensive, which began on July 30 on Kalinin Front's sector, did not include 58th Army. On August 1 the Army only had the 375th and the 27th Guards Rifle Divisions under command, and was disbanded later in the month, at which point the division rejoined 30th Army, which was now in Western Front but still operating north of Rzhev.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 144, 168 The offensive had begun in a promising manner for 30th Army, which broke through on a 9 km front to a depth of 6 - 7 km on the first day. Then heavy rains began and continued for several days which caused the attack to literally bog down in the area of Polunino, north of Rzhev. The arrival of fresh forces, including the 375th, allowed the Army to finally take Polunino on August 21 and then to plan a new attempt to take Rzhev in cooperation with the rebuilt 29th Army. On August 25/26 the 30th reached the Volga 5 to 6 km west of the city and on the 29th established a bridgehead on the right bank, but over the following weeks was unable to actually capture and clear Rzhev. During August the Army lost more than 80,000 men in this fighting. Through September repeated attacks gained several blocks in the northeast of the city at the cost of nearly 20,000 more casualties. On October 1, 30th Army finally went over to the defense.Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, pp. 80, 87, 92, 94-95, 98-99 =Operation Mars= On October 4 General Sokolov died of an unstated illness. He was replaced two days later by Col. Pyotr Dmitrievich Govorunenko, who would remain in command until December 6, 1943. Due to the very heavy losses it had suffered in the summer fighting 30th Army was not given an offensive role in the Second Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation (Operation Mars). However in the last stages of the offensive, after the Red Army attacks had failed on all other sectors, the 39th Army was still making limited gains in its diversionary efforts in the Molodoi Tud sector northeast of Olenino. By the second week of December Gen. G. K. Zhukov was looking for any success anywhere in his collapsing offensive and on December 8 ordered his 39th and 30th Armies once again to crush the enemy Olenino grouping, while the 30th was also to break through on a sector from Koshkino to Burgovo and capture Rzhev by the 23rd. In preparation the 375th, with the 380th and 220th Rifle Divisions in support, pounded the German defenses south of the Volga. From December 9 to 12 this effort failed to make any progress, while 39th Army had gained some ground near the village of Gonchuki. Therefore the 220th and 16th Guards Rifle Divisions were transferred to this sector, bringing the attacks from the Volga bridgeheads to an effective halt. Meanwhile German counterattacks had cut off a large Soviet mobile group south of Gonchuki and late on the 12th the 375th was also moved westward to help restore the situation. On the next day the division, joined by the 380th, the 49th Mechanized Brigade, plus several tank brigades and regiments, struck the defenses of the German 87th Infantry Division between Koshkino and Burgovo. While the tanks managed to penetrate the forward line in several places, enemy fire separated the infantry support, leading to just minor gains. Intense fighting continued until December 17, with the \\"damaged\\" 375th being shifted to the Gonchuki sector. Finally General Zhukov ordered this last gasp of Operation Mars to stop on December 23.David M. Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 266-74 Battle of Kursk On the first day of 1943 the 375th remained part of 30th Army in Western FrontCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 13 but this would soon change. At this time soon-to-be Marshal Zhukov was planning Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda, an ambitious plan to drive Army Group North away from Leningrad. Under STAVKA Order No. 46026 of January 31, the division is listed as one of ten to be redeployed to Northwestern Front. Before this could get underway, on February 5 STAVKA issued a new directive to establish the Central Front by February 15 under command of Col. Gen. K. K. Rokossovski, with the 375th as one of the rifle divisions assigned. Within days it became part of the 21st Army, and by February 23 it was unloaded from its trains and was in the Kalinino region about 15 km east of Livny.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 399, 258-59, 265, 287 The STAVKA issued a directive on March 7 for a combined offensive by Central, Briansk and Western Fronts in the direction of Oryol. Rokossovski ordered four divisions of 21st Army, including the 375th, to begin to advance on March 10, in cooperation with the new 70th Army. By this time, however, the German 2nd and 2nd Panzer Armies were regaining their balance and starting to cover the massive gap in the front. 21st Army reached the Fatezh area by the 11th, but by now news was arriving that Army Group South's offensive against Voronezh Front was threatening to retake Kharkov, and the Army was redirected to the south to join that Front.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp. 338-39, 354-55, 364-65 21st Army was redesignated as the 6th Guards Army on April 16, and by the end of the month the 375th would be assigned to the new 23rd Guards Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 111 =Operation Citadel= In the buildup to the German summer offensive, the 375th was given a particularly challenging task; it formed the left flank of the first echelon of 6th Guards Army, tying in with the right flank 81st Guards Rifle Division of 7th Guards Army. Since unit boundaries are usually seen as weak points in any defense, the Front commander, Army Gen. N. F. Vatutin, aimed to turn this to his advantage by heavily fortifying and reinforcing the two flank divisions in anticipation of the enemy attack. They were deployed with swampy terrain, the confluence of the Northern and Lipovyi Donets Rivers, in their rear, and by the start of the offensive had 19-23 artillery pieces (76mm calibre or larger) per kilometre, greater than any other sector of the front. And the entire boundary was backstopped by 69th Army in third echelon.Valeriy Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, p. 27 As the anticipated attack grew closer, the Soviet forces became desperate for hard information on the start date. Reconnaissance patrols were sent out by all the front-line divisions, without results. Finally, before noon on July 4, word came up the line of communications that a patrol of the 375th had captured a combat engineer of the 168th Infantry Division who was lifting mines between the front lines, and revealed that his division was to go on the offensive on the morning of July 5. He also stated he had seen many tanks in Belgorod.Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, p. 180 On July 5, the first day of the offensive, the 375th faced the 3rd SS Panzer Division of II SS Panzer Corps. Despite the German objective to \\"crush\\" the Soviet defenses and seize crossings over the Lipovyi Donets, Vatutin's plan was working: the 3rd SS made almost no progress while the division continued to hold its deeply fortified positions. Among other assets the 375th had a platoon of tank-hunting dogs attached, but had no opportunity to deploy them. On the second day the 3rd SS again struck the division's positions beginning at 0600 hours but made few gains while the remainder of the Panzer Corps advanced as much as 20 km on the Prokhorovka axis. In order to stem this advance General Vatutin proposed a counterattack to begin on July 8 and to involve the 375th and many other forces, specifically the 1st Tank Army, but this was premature and never actually took place.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 91-92, 102, 111, 116-18, 132-33, 139-40 As the SS panzers continued to push towards Prokhorovka and Army Detachment Kempf began developing its advance against 7th Guards Army in the direction of Melikhovo on July 9, Vatutin became concerned that 69th Army could become encircled, and before noon ordered several divisions, including the 375th, to reinforce that Army along with several artillery units and maintain the defense of the Korocha axis. The 35th Guards Rifle Corps, which had only been formed in the past few weeks, took both the 375th and the 81st Guards under command. By the end of the day the enemy began closing a ring around the two divisions, plus two regiments of 92nd Guards Rifle Division, and 69th Army was forced at 2200 hours to begin withdrawing these forces to new lines. At 0145 on July 10 Colonel Govorunenko received the following coded telegram:The sector now occupied by the division was part of the second Army- level defensive belt created during the spring. These reserve positions were important for both maintaining the physical defense but also the psychological defense in that the contingencies had been anticipated. A further order issued at 2330 hours withdrew the 375th into the 69th Army reserve.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, pp. 178-79, 247-49, 251 As this withdrawal was taking place on July 11, 6th Panzer Division was finally able to push beyond Melikhovo and by that night seized a bridgehead over the Northern Donets at Rzhavets. This advance threatened the potential encirclement of the 48th Rifle Corps of 69th Army. The Corps leadership reacted quickly and already at 2245 hours Colonel Govorunenko was ordered to send one battalion with two antitank guns to Ryndinka \\"in order to cover Shakhovo from the direction of Kurakova and Rzhavets.\\" By the morning of the 12th it appeared that Kempf's III Panzer Corps could be breaking through 69th Army into the rear of the 5th Guards Tank Army at Prokhorovka and Govorunenko was directed to commit one rifle regiment to a composite force to liquidate the breakthrough. 11th Guards Mechanized Brigade attacked Ryndinka from the north while the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 1243rd Regiment held defensive positions southeast of Shakhovo and supported the attack with fire.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, pp. 408, 413, 417, 421 By this time it was clear that the plan for Operation Citadel had failed, and the forces of Army Group South would have to retreat. However, 48th Corps, clinging to its small piece of ground between the Northern and Lipovyi Donets, was still highly vulnerable to encirclement. Eliminating the Corps would be a consolation prize for the Germans and would secure a baseline for the inevitable withdrawal. As of July 10 the 48th Corps had about 40,000 personnel under command, but by the morning of the 13th had suffered considerable losses, especially in the antitank forces that faced 4th Panzer Army and III Panzer Corps. These German divisions launched converging attacks on the night of July 13/14. The 375th with the 183rd were holding the area south of the Belenikhino Station. On the evening of July 14 the situation of 48th Corps had become critical; it was mostly encircled, was suffering shortages of ammunition and antitank weapons, and communications with higher headquarters were being continually interrupted. By dawn on July 15 the pocket was closed but not solidly; four Soviet divisions, including the 375th, plus reinforcements were loosely held in an area of 126 square kilometres.Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, pp. 304-05, 307 While Vatutin understood the situation and wished to maintain the position of the 48th Corps as a springboard for a counteroffensive, he didn't have enough strength. By the evening of July 14 there was only one option: to withdraw from the pocket as fast as possible. This did not go without complications, in particular for the 375th, which was the last to withdraw, covering the other divisions. Colonel Govorunenko wrote:On July 28 the division reported that as of July 20, 2,718 of its men were missing in action, all but a few of whom were killed or captured in the breakout.Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, pp. 307-09 As of August 1 it remained in 48th Corps of 69th Army, which was now under command of Steppe Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 195 =Operation Rumyantsev= The 375th was sufficiently rebuilt by August 3 to be able to take part in the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation and played a role in the liberation of both of those cities, being awarded the name of the second as a battle honor:By September 1 the division had been moved to the 76th Rifle Corps in the reserves of Steppe Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 224 On the same date Colonel Govorunenko was promoted to the rank of major general. Advance in Ukraine Later in the month the 375th was again reassigned, this time to the 74th Rifle Corps of 53rd Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 252 By the end of the day on September 28 much of this Army had reached the east bank of the Dniepr between the mouth of the Psyol River and the village of Drobetskovka. On the following day elements of the Army liberated the city of Kremenchug, while its left-flank forces seized Kryachok Island as well as an unnamed island at marker 65.7 and 60.9. On the night of September 30/October 1 the 53rd forced the Dniepr with elements of two rifle divisions and took a small bridgehead in the area southeast of Chikalovka, which was fought over throughout the day. The fighting for this bridgehead continued over the next few days as further forces were ferried across. During a regrouping on the night of October 5/6 the village of Uspenskoye was transferred from 37th Army to the 53rd.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, pp. 267, 270, 275-77, 279 On October 20 Steppe Front became the 2nd Ukrainian Front. By the end of the month the 375th had been reassigned to the 75th Rifle Corps, still in 53rd Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 280 By November 12 part of 53rd Army was in the bridgehead in the Dneprodzerzhinsk area, while the remainder was defending along the left (east) bank of the Dniepr.Soviet General Staff, Battle of the Dnepr, p. 291 On December 6, General Govorunenko was wounded in action, and was replaced by Col. Pyotr Ivanovich Sviridov. This officer was in turn replaced on December 21 by Maj. Gen. Akim Vasilevich Yakshin, who had been serving as commander of the 1243rd Rifle Regiment. In the buildup to the Battle of the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket the division was reassigned to the 20th Guards Rifle Corps in 4th Guards Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 100Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 17 Prior to the start of the offensive, on January 15, 1944, General Yashkin was removed from command and replaced the next day by Col. Nikita Efimovich Tsygankov. During the offensive, which began on January 24, 4th Guards Army formed part of the inner ring of encirclement around the trapped German forces. By the beginning of February the 375th had been shifted yet again, now to the 21st Guards Rifle Corps of the same Army. By the beginning of March the division was back in the 53rd Army, now in the 49th Rifle Corps, and would remain under those commands for most of the rest of the year.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 46, 76 On March 10, Maj. Gen. Vasilii Dmitrievich Karpukhin took command of the 375th, and would remain in this position for the duration of the war. =First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= By April 1, after advancing through western Ukraine, 2nd Ukrainian Front was beginning to reach the Dniestr River. The 21st Guards Corps, supported on the left by 49th Corps, crossed the river on April 1 and 2 and began advancing against the 3rd Panzer Division's bridgehead defenses north of Susleni from the northeast and east. While this advance continued the 49th Corps attacked 3rd Panzer's right wing through April 4 and 5, but the 375th was in second echelon to the 1st Guards Airborne and 110th Guards Rifle Divisions and did not see much of this fighting. Susleni was taken on April 7, which drove the panzer troops south to even stronger defenses. On the 11th the continued joint operation of the two Soviet Corps captured the town of Molovata on the west bank; this gave room for the 375th to be regrouped across the Dniestr and also rendered the bridgehead held by XXXX Panzer Corps north of the RƒÉut River untenable. It was abandoned overnight on April 12/13, while the 49th Corps took over a sector from Furceni on the RƒÉut to Golerkani on the Dniestr.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 83-86 The next objective for 53rd Army was the German bridgehead east of the Dniestr on the approaches to the cities of DubƒÉsari and Grigoriopol. 49th Corps had begun this advance on March 31, but had then been diverted to the fighting on the west bank. On April 13, with all three of the Corps' divisions west of the river, supported by 25th Guards Rifle Division, the advance resumed with heavy attacks on the German 282nd Infantry Division on the Golerkani sector. After two days of heavy fighting the German force withdrew southward to new defenses west of DubƒÉsari, but also received reinforcements from the 10th Panzergrenadier Division and Corps Detachment \\"F\\" which contained the Soviet advance. By this time the divisions of 53rd Army had fewer than 5,000 personnel each, and on April 18 the Front command ordered the Army over to the defense.Glantz, Red Storm, pp. 86, 88-89. Note that Glantz mistakenly refers to the Dniepr River on p. 86. On May 6 the 53rd Army received orders to take part in a new offensive on Chi»ôinƒÉu that was to be primarily conducted by forces of 3rd Ukrainian Front. 49th Corps was to commit one division, while the 375th and one other division were to remain on the defense on the Army's front westward to south of Orhei. In the event, the defeat inflicted on the right flank forces of 2nd Ukrainian Front in the T√¢rgu Frumos area caused this offensive to be postponed and eventually cancelled.Glantz, Red Storm, pp. 285-86, 288-90 Advance Into the Balkans In the buildup to the Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive in early August the 53rd Army was regrouped out of the front line into Front reserves. 49th Corps was ordered to move from the Front's left flank to the center which required four daily marches. The plan called for the Army to be part of the exploitation force which would be released once the shock formations penetrated the German-Romanian front. Once this occurred the Army was to advance in the general direction of Vaslui and Foc»ôani. The offensive opened on August 20, and on the next day at 1900 hours the 53rd began moving up to the positions that had been vacated by the advancing 52nd Army. The Army was then ordered to move to the area south of the road from Podu Iloaiei to Ia»ôi overnight on August 22/23. In the following days minimal forces of the 53rd Army were committed to the reduction of the trapped Axis grouping while its main effort focused on Bucharest and the oilfields at Ploie»ôti.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 24-25, 30, 73, 104, 113 On August 31 the 375th played a leading role in the capture of the Romanian capital and was recognized as follows:In addition the 1243rd Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and the 1245th received the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree. Following its advance through Romania, on October 28 the left flank forces of 2nd Ukrainian Front, including 53rd Army, began an operation to defeat the German-Hungarian forces in and around Budapest. The main drive was carried out by 7th Guards and 46th Armies while the 53rd provided flank security. On October 29 the Army advanced up to 13 km and reached the outskirts of Polg√°r. By the morning of November 4 the 27th Army relieved the 53rd along the front from Polg√°r to Tiszaf√ºred while it regrouped to force the Tisza River three days later. November 11 the Army's right flank corps began fighting for the southern outskirts of F√ºzesabony; the town did not finally fall until the 15th after which the Army commander was ordered to develop the offensive in the direction of Verpel√©t. On November 20 the 53rd reached the southeastern slopes of the M√°tra Mountains between Gy√∂ngy√∂s and Eger where the Axis forces were able to organize a powerful defense which brought the advance to a halt until November 26. Two days later the 24th Guards Rifle Corps was transferred from 7th Guards Army,Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 24, 29, 32, 34, 41 and the 375th was transferred to this Corps by the end of the month.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 350 At the start of the second stage of the Budapest operation on December 5 the 53rd Army was holding positions from Eger to L≈ërinci, still facing the defenses in the M√°tra. The attack began at 1015 hours but during the day the Army advanced just 2 - 4 km in the difficult terrain. During the third stage, beginning on December 10, the 53rd advanced very little. On December 19 the Army was given the task of reaching the line from Veƒæk√Ω Krt√≠≈° to Nemce to ≈Ωeliezovce in southern Slovakia.Soviet General Staff, Budapest Operation, pp. 43-44, 50, 52 During this month the 375th was again assigned to the 49th Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 23 but was finally moved to the 27th Guards Rifle Corps in 7th Guards Army in January, 1945.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 100-01 In late April, 2nd Ukrainian Front continued to clear German forces from central Austria and southern Bohemia. On April 22 the commander of 27th Guards Corps, Maj. Gen. Evgenii Stepanovich Alekhin, was severely wounded in a sudden enemy air strike while directing combat in the fighting positions of his troops, in the vicinity of Mikulov. Alekhin was carried to an aid station of the 375th but died there of his wounds at 1800 hours. His adjutant, Petchenko, and his driver, Koshman, were killed in the same attack.Aleksander A.

The nickname is \\" Super MZ \\" (Super MZ). It is a successor to the MZ-2000 / 2200 and a direct successor to the MZ-80B. From the previous generation, MZ-2000, it was a model that was given significant functions along with faster speed processors. It is also the final model of the entire 8-bit MZ series with its own architecture, and it is one of the models sometimes called the best 8-bit machines, along with the 6809 FM77AV and the MB-S1. In the Japanese computer magazines, it was also called the phoenix (Phoenix). Its successor is the Sharp MZ-2861, which has a compatible mode and a newly developed 16-bit mode. The development code is LEY and can be found in the circuit diagram etc.  Overview  Clean Design As with the standard MZ model, the main unit does not have the system program on onboard ROM. However, while the old model included only the IPL, a program for controlling advanced hardware is included as an IOCS, and a number of repairs have been made. One of the functions is one that can call a specific location, so an incompatible element is specified for an application that addresses the module in the ROM and calls it directly without calling the function as a reference. 2 types of BASIC attached The instruction set BASIC-S25, which the typical MZ user was familiar with, and the BASIC-M25, which has a Microsoft- type instruction set that was already at the forefront of the BASIC environment at that time, were prepared. It is not a conventional model, and Hu-BASIC adopted in the company's departmental series, but has become another implementation of BASIC. CPU clock improvement The MZ-2500 is equipped with the Z80A and operates at 4 MHz, but the MZ-2500 is equipped with the Z80B, and except for some, it has 6 MHz operation with one wait during M1 cycle. Memory management enhancements While the old model only allowed you to assign a specific address to another space by bank switching in order to open a window with text and graphics VRAM, the MZ-2500 is equipped with a memory controller like the MB-S1 etc. It was designed to be able to allocate an arbitrary space in units of 8 KB for a memory space divided into eight. This has made it possible to manage 256 KB of main memory and 128 KB of graphics VRAM, and by enabling free allocation, the software can be mapped by mapping video memory in the same arrangement as other models. The porting of the design address space is 512 KB. Various ROMs and RAMs are arranged in this space. Equipped with Argo Key Due to the above-mentioned increase in the degree of freedom of memory mapping and capacity, a function called an algo function has been added to BASIC. A key with the mark of the Argo, which is a symbol of the series, is prepared and assigned a function to call the built-in application. In addition, the Argo ship which is the original mark is correct \\"Argo\\", but the spelling in the utility is the notation of \\"Algo\\" which came from \\" Algorithm \\". Close to the resident program, apart from the loaded program, it was possible to start a calculator or the like by key operation as a standard. Significant enhancement of CRTC In the standard model, the display peripheral which was a specification that the CPU directly writes to VRAM mapped to the memory space for each plane without having one ALU has been greatly strengthened in the same machine. The number of colors corresponds to an output of 256 colors in the 320x200 mode and 16 colors in the maximum 640x400 mode. Although not specified as a specification, it is also possible to output at a resolution of 320x400 by installing an additional video memory from the design specification of a custom chip. In addition, simultaneous writing is supported for multiple planes, which enables high-speed drawing even for colors across planes. The palette board has evidence added later in design, and is designed to output specified values in 4096 colors as a palette by interrupting the circuit using a high-speed memory when outputting 16 colors. Also, from the implementation, the existence can not be determined from the software side. In addition to them, having a PCG has made it possible to reduce the definition of external characters as well as the background composition processing in games. In addition to the above display functions, the text screen is vertically smooth scroll. The graphics screen supports vertical and horizontal smooth scrolling. However, since the 256 color mode is not a packed pixel but an array of stacked planes, the display is not suitable for moving anything. Even in this era, the speed of access to the graphic VRAM itself is not fast because there is no mechanism such as cycle steel. In addition, the execution of the program on the graphic VRAM is not guaranteed, and at the time of read modify write, 2 Wait is included. Loading of kanji text VRAM Like Sharp's PC-9800 series and X1turbo, it is equipped with Kanji text VRAM. It is possible to display the font up to the second JIS standard only by writing the display code. Processing is much lighter than transferring a font image as a graphic from a kanji ROM, and even though it is an 8-bit machine, it has achieved a more comfortable handling of Japanese than models of the same price range. Data recorder installation Similar to conventional models, a software-controllable data recorder is attached. The head itself was in stereo, and one channel was available as a data recorder and the other as an audio track. During the late 1980s to early 1990s, the Japanese home computer market shifted to floppy-based software supply, and the tape drive was used only to the extent that some software required a device to play back recorded audio. It was also possible to use it as an answering machine as well as for voice recording. The tape recorder was installed for compatibility with the old model, and was removed in the MZ-2520, which is an inexpensive version in which does not have the MZ-80B / 2000 mode. Communication-aware design The MZ-2500 included a serial port and dedicated modem phone socket for \\"personal computer communication\\" i.e. to connect to data services online such as BBSes. Terminal software was also included as standard. The combination of the dedicated devices made it possible to use the built-in data recorder also as an answering machine.  Hardware  * With significant additional functions, support for older models is provided by the mode switch. * In MZ-2000 / 2200, there was a part incompatible with MZ-80B, but in MZ-2500, it became possible to use all the assets of the old model of the series by preparing MZ-80B mode . * In addition, there is a mode to operate 80 B mode and 2000 mode at 6 MHz as a hidden function, but the reproduction of sound to which CPU speed directly acts and the handling of data recorder are incompatible. * The MZ-80B has a green display, but in the 80B mode, the screen is drawn in black and white. * The same peripheral devices as the previous model can continue to be used, but the 16-bit board can not be used because of the difference in physical shape and design. * The 3.5-inch FDD has a large vertical width. The operation noise is also relatively large. * The appearance is configured as a keyboard connected with curled cord to the main body of rectangular parallelepiped, and except for MZ-2520, a kangaroo pocket is prepared on the front panel, a resolution switch at startup, and a switch for MZ-2000 / 80B mode, There are slide volume for volume, IPL and RESET button. * The joystick is compatible with the ATARI specification, and the mouse is MZ-5500 or X series. * Since the control of FDD follows the implementation of the old model, since it is necessary to prohibit the interrupt and transfer by software, processing such as accessing without stopping BGM can not be performed. Four types of models had been released. The following two models were released as initial models. * MZ-2511 A model with one built-in FDD. Standard price 168,000 yen. * MZ-2521 A model with two built-in FDDs. Standard price 198,000 yen. After that, a minor change was made under the name of Super MZ V2 as a model change. * MZ-2531 A model that added an optional dictionary ROM and additional main memory to the MZ-2521 and added a TV control. Standard price 199,800 yen. Furthermore, the following models have been released as low-cost versions. The design of the successor MZ-2861 followed that of this model. * MZ-2520 MZ-2521 specification, remove the data recorder, the compatibility mode of the old model. Standard price 159,800 yen. Specification * CPU : Z80B 6 MHz / 4 MHz * RAM : * With the main 128 KB standard option, 256 KB can be expanded. * GVRAM: 64 KB included. Up to 128 KB can be added. * CGRAM: 14 KB Text-VRAM and PCG (Programmable Character Generator) installed. * ROM: * IPL / IOCS 32KB * TELENET 16 KB voice communication interface (MZ-1E26) attached (option) * Kanji font ROM 256KB-JIS first level, second level * Dictionary ROM 256 KB (option)-Built-in dictionary for kana-kanji conversion similar to that of the dedicated word processor . * When the pallet board is installed (option) 16 colors can be displayed in 4096 colors. * Sound source: YAMAHA YM2203 One built-in. (FM sound source 3ch + SSG sound source 3ch, 8 octaves each + noise 1Ch) Although BEEP also exists, the combination is difficult because it needs to be directly controlled by Z80. In addition, voice can be uttered by optional voice board. * FDD * The MZ-2520 / 2521/2531 has two 3.5-inch 2DDs * Only one MZ-2511 is built in. * Voice recorder * Button operation and software control possible-Electromagnetic mechanism * 2-track independent head Analog recording and playback possible * Data transfer method: Sharp PWM method Data transfer speed: 2000 bits / second * Power supply: AC100V 50 / 60 Hz power consumption 50W * Operating environment: Temperature 10 ¬∞C-35 ¬∞C, humidity 20%-80% (non-condensing) * External dimensions * Body: Width 350 √ó depth 345 √ó height 128 (mm) * Keyboard: Width 410 √ó depth 196 √ó height 38 (mm) * Weight * Body: Model 20 (MZ-2511) 7.9 kg * Body: Model 30 (MZ-2521) 8.6 kg * Keyboard: 1.4 kg * Display ability * text 80 lines x 25 lines / 20 lines / 12 lines color 8 colors 40 lines x 25 lines / 20 lines / 12 lines Maximum color (64 colors) * Graphic VRAM 128 KB time 640 √ó 400 (4 colors) 1 screen 640 √ó 200 (16 colors) 1 screen 320 √ó 200 (16 colors) 2 screens 320 √ó 200 (256 colors) 1 screen * Graphic VRAM 256 KB time 640 √ó 400 (16 colors) 1 screen 640 √ó 200 (16 colors) 2 screens 320 √ó 200 (16 colors) 4 screens In addition to 320 x 200 (256 colors) 2 screens, it is out of specification 320 √ó 400 (256 colors) 1 screen  Installed interface  * Printer : Centronics standard SHARP specification 25-pin D-Sub connector x 1 port. * Serial port : RS-232C compliant 25-pin D-Sub x 1 port (A), 9-pin D-Sub x 1 port (B). * External FDD terminal SHARP specification 37-pin D-Sub x 1 port. * Joystick: ATARI 9-pin D-Sub x 2 port. * Keyboard : Proprietary specification 8-pin mini DIN connector x 2 ports (exclusive connection of the lower right part of the front panel and the front right side). * Mouse : SHARP specification 5-pin mini DIN connector x 2 ports (exclusive connection of the lower right part of the front panel and the front right side). * Display output terminal CRT : Color (analog / digital switching) 8-pin DIN connector x 1 port, monochrome (analog / digital switching) 5 pin DIN connector x 1 port. * Display TV control terminal: SHARP standard 8-pin DIN x 1 port. * Expansion slot x 2 (optional). * Internal connector for voice board. * Voice connector: External connector for dedicated modem phone. 8 pin mini DIN x 1 port. * Audio connector: Audio input / output stereo mini jack (monaural)  Other  * Common to MZ-2500 ** The keyboard has been changed from the conventional arrangement so that the cursor keys are arranged from the horizontal row in the direction of the arrow. The position is located on the ten keys where the keys are densely packed, but it is taller than other keys and can be identified. * MZ-2511 / 2521/2531 ** Kangaroo pocket volumes and buttons are prone to contact failure due to aging. * MZ-2531 (Super MZ V2) ** The MZ-2521 (early model) incorporates an additional VRAM, a dictionary ROM, and a television control circuit. ** The television control circuitry is located at the location of the dictionary ROM, and the board layout has been slightly modified. ** As for the appearance, three lines were drawn at the position of the FDD on the front panel, and the color of the eject button was darkened, and the printing described as MZ-2500 on the top plate disappeared. ** Bundled software BASIC has become V2. ** The company's X1tuboZ can display 4096 colors as standard, but 16 of 4096 colors can be used even with the optional color palette board. * MZ-2520 ** The specifications are equivalent to the MZ-2521 (early model), but the difference in appearance is that the front kangaroo pocket has disappeared, the button attached to the panel has been changed, and the FDD has become thinner. In addition, MZ-2000 / 80B mode, data recorder, one RS-232C port, connector of expansion FDD is deleted, and circuit of replacement of drive No. with built-in FDD etc. is deleted with deletion of terminal of FDD. The As a result, some incompatible software may not start. In addition, pallet board became non-compliant. ** The keyboard connector, MZ-2861 and MZ-25x1 have different shapes, and although the signals are the same, they can not be physically exchanged. * By activating the IPL while pressing a specific key, you can make detailed specifications. ** Official (owner's manual, MZ-2511 / 2521 included) ***/ Key: Loads and executes a program from the ROM located in the I / O space. ***E key: Replace the built- in FDD with (FD3, FD4) and the external FDD with (FD1, FD2) ***R key: RS-232C baud rate (in 2000 and 80 B mode, it can be specified from 19200 bit/s to 150 bit/s. 9600 bit/s automatically if not pressed) ***C key: Forced activation from cassette deck (even in MZ-2500 mode) ***1 key: Force activation from FD1. ***2 key: Forced activation from FD2. ***3 key: Force boot from FD3. ***4 key: Force boot from FD4. ** Informal (information at the time of MZ-2511 / 2521 release) [3] and later models have some of the functionality removed. *** B key: Perform test (RAM-check) on main RAM and graphic RAM (46 blocks). The judgment result (No / Good) is displayed for each block. *** G key: Do not clear graphic RAM (do not fill in black). Due to the hardware structure, there is no guarantee that all pixels are completely held. *** X key: MZ-80B mode (Mode switch is at MZ-2500 position) *** Z key: MZ-2000 mode (Mode switch is at MZ-2500 position)  Software  During its development and before its release Sharp made a software creation request to videogames developers. However unlike typical video game system releases there were no major software releases available at launch for the MZ-2500 at the time. Although the MZ-2500's high portability by memory mapping design encouraged porting from other models, there were few products that made use of its unique functions and performance. The MZ series had the habit of building for a heavy user base for many years, many of which were homebrew software programs because no commercial software was readily available for the platform. Although there were many commercial software programs available on other system platforms, and despite the MZ-2500 had gained a large share in the market, it did not change the situation for the MZ-2500 series, and commercial software releases for the system eventually fell. In addition, Nintendo released their own software for the platform, and Namco (later Bandai Namco Games) ported several software programs from Radio News (microcomputer software). Attached Software * BASIC M25 / S25 BASIC-M25 (MZ-6Z002) is an instruction-type interpreter according to Microsoft -like BASIC, and BASIC-S25 (MZ-6Z003) is BASIC which cherishes the flow of Sharp genuine BASIC derived from PET. These BASICs were included in the same system floppy and could be selected by starting while pressing the HELP key . Converters were also prepared for programs created only in BASIC, and even with the new BASIC, it was possible to convert programs of the previous model incompletely. If the internal codes of BASIC S 25 and M 25 are equivalent to each other, the same instruction is assigned to the intermediate code. Although not as special as X-BASIC, it is possible to use labels including Kanji, as well as line numbers, in addition to input in abbreviations derived from Hu-BASIC. Indents are compressed and managed in intermediate code, and nesting, conditional branching, etc. can be described over multiple lines, etc. For BASIC, a highly readable, flexible, and more conscious of structurability It was possible to write. The Algo function can be set at boot time, and since it was not genuinely registered tools etc., there weren't many published software, but Oh! MZ showed some examples. Depending on the screen mode, smooth scrolling is used in processes involving scrolling, such as directory display and program list display, so that the contents can be easily tracked without stopping the screen. Although there are various factors such as the degree of optimization of the comparison object, in the benchmark in BASIC, it can be said that the interpreter's own speed was high as at that time, such as thinning to PC-9800 series using 8086 of 8 MHz. * Telephone software (MZ-6Z010) Simple communication software. The serial port terminal was attached as standard considering the use of PC communication. System software * P- CP / M (MZ-6Z001) A portable version of Personal CP / M, which is rare in Japan. * MSX-DOS DOS to run Multiplan. It is not sold alone but can read and write MS-DOS format files, but it is a subset of the MSX OS of the same name. * S-OS \\"SWORD\\" The common system of Z80 published in Oh! MZ magazine. On many Z80 models, the same binary ran the same application for the same system. The MZ-2500 supports kanji conversion, kanji output, high- resolution display font, etc. in addition to the standard specifications, and an algo function is also available. Since 2DD disks can not support the entire area according to specifications, they are effectively used by allocating 512 KB to the file system and writing the main part of the system to the remaining part. Other than the MZ-2520, the MZ-80B / 2000/2200 version can also be used. * FENIX An OS designed and implemented at the end of the year. There are not so many users as the application is only development tools. Designed specifically for the same model, it is possible to call the IOCS, and it is basically possible to start up a standalone binary. Management is performed in memory block units, and if EMM is implemented, it can be swapped to it, and by using it together, it can manage an area of up to 1 MiB in appearance. The command shell has been adopted for the UNIX-like flow. Game software * Xevious Development, porting by Radio News Agency. By corresponding to the palette board and smooth scroll, the metallic expression by the color scheme using the gradation unique to the game and the smooth scroll of the background are realized. As described above, since the gradation by the palette board supports a large amount, in the 8-color and 16-color modes, there is no big difference between the other models and the still screen, and it can not be said that it is a beautiful screen. Although there is no sprite function, the processing of background composition is reduced, so the airborne objects also show relatively smooth movement, and Ande Genesis also moves independently from the background. Although there are some transcription errors in BGM, the data compression is also on memory, and the data of the main game and SuperXEVIOUS which is the high difficulty version of the game are also prepared. Until the release of the X68000 version, it was considered to be the most faithful version by PC porting standards. * Pacman Development and port by Radio News Agency. The start, the title part is described by BASIC, the game itself is described by an assembler, the character's algorithm, the coffee break, etc. are changed to be all you like. The charge for the port is the same as MZ-2000 / 2200 version. * Moon child Role playing game by HOT-B. Although the game did not come up as a game, the MZ-2500 version uses the audio track of the data recorder and the head extension function to play back narration and audio at the title and event. The program is used with BASIC and is the only commercially available software that uses a data recorder. Since the ending staff roll relies on BASIC, it scrolls smoothly while stopping line by line due to the display amount and speed. In addition, the BGM output is produced at a small volume relative to the average volume of software using other FM sound sources, in balance with the reproduction volume of the data recorder. * Laydock A port of a game developed for MSX2 with T & E software. Since there is no sprite function, the movement unit of the character is 3 dot units and is drawn in the 320 √ó 200 dot 16 color mode. Because there is no palette board for the port to which the software is ported and the original model is capable of multi-color display, it will be a slightly obscured screen including the title screen. In the MZ-2520, a non-compliant seal was affixed to the product due to a change in the hardware implementation of the FDD. * Daemon Crystal A ported version of the series for MZ-1500, which has been released by Radio News Agency. Few software that works in 256 color mode. * SPACEBLASTER SG Published in Oh! MZ magazine. A port of the MZ-700 game to \\"Argo function\\". Since the attributes can not be specified separately by characters and background, the same screen is configured by the PCG definition. There is a difference in color development.  Coterie  There were also free porting of commercial software by volunteers and activities such as disk magazines. * Hoshibako A coterie based disc magazine. ‚òÜ The notation of DUST BOX was also used. Starting from BASIC, you can run documents and programs from your own shell, the documents are decorated by coloring, blinking, etc., and an editor for editing is also provided. In addition to programs and data submitted by readers, many works by the proponent himself were also posted. In response to the EMM board from the middle issue, when connection was detected at startup, the contents of the floppy were transferred in advance and the diskless operation was performed. By the extension of MML, the BGM performance program which assumed the interruption of the sound effect, the implementation of the pseudo sprite, etc. were also performed. Due to the busyness of the author, the issue was irregular, and the distribution was made by sending raw disks or sending fixed-price small exchange. In the second half, 3D racing games and two-player fighting games with large characters were also announced using text VRAM and tiling patterns. The leader is still active as a game programmer at AM2 lab of SEGA.  Peripheral Equipment  Mainly, genuine products are described below. The joystick port is Atari's specifications, and the mouse has an interface compatible with X1 and X68000, so hardware with these specifications can also be used. The serial port is also RS-232C compliant, so a general serial connection modem can be used. * MZ-1F07 Genuine 5.25 inches FDD. Expansion is possible by connecting to the back interface. It is also possible to prioritize and recognize the expansion side for compatibility with the old model. * MZ-1D22 (dedicated analog display) The dimensions were matched to the width of the main body, so it could be mounted on the main body. * MZ-1D24 (Dedicated analog display TV) A dedicated display TV corresponding to the TV control added in MZ-2531. The vertical width is made to line up when the body is placed vertically with the stand. A dedicated display TV corresponding to the TV control added in MZ-2531. * MZ-1D26 (Dedicated analog display TV) Analog connection monitor dedicated to the MZ-2500 series with the television reception function omitted * MZ-1E26 (voice communication board) A board that made it possible to use an answering machine instead by using a modem phone etc. * MZ-1E32 (Parallel port for MZ-1V01 connection) * MZ-1E35 (ADPCM board) A board equipped with Y8950 ( MSX-AUDIO ) that enables ADPCM recording and playback. Although it is hardware for MZ-2861, since it is an interface board on the 8 bit side, it can also be used with MZ-2500. * MZ-1E30 (HDD I / F) * MZ-1F23 (20 MB HDD) * MZ-1R24 (Dictionary ROM board) It incorporates a dictionary derived from Shoin, and enables continuous phrase conversion in the main unit. * MZ-1R37 (640 KB EMM board) A 640 KB memory board mapped to I / O space. * MZ-1U09 (expansion slot) Two-slot expansion slot. In fact, it was a metal frame, a slot installed in it, and a flat cable, and compatible products were also sold from Ibit Electronics. * MZ-1M08 (voice board) This is a voice synthesis board released as an option for the MZ-1500, but it is also available on this unit. 34 types of fixed messages Fixed messages, pronunciation for each note, and a few melodies are recorded as ROM and are generated by playing them. The fixed messages are pronounced in monotones, so although the connection between sounds is unnatural, it can be heard more clearly than formant synthesis speech synthesis. Refer to the section of MZ-1500 for details. Although English pronunciation is built into the chip, only Japanese voice connected outside the chip is supported by BASIC. * MZ-1M10 (4096 color pallet board) Internally added analog pallet board. * MZ-1X29 (Genuine mouse) * MZ-1X30 (modem phone) Dedicated modem phone. A device that integrates a 300 b.ps modem and a telephone. By using the MZ-1E26 in combination, the main unit could also be used as an answering machine. * XE-1AJ / CZ-8NJ2 Atari company digital / analog joystick. The former is that the button by the radio newspaper company (microcomputer software) is orange. With the design intact, the button was black and Sharp sold it as a genuine X68000 product, and the latter was called Cyberstick. There is no correspondence in the commercial software, but the driver is posted on the waste bin and can be input even in the analog mode. * XE-1AP Space-saving compatible products of the above Cyber Stick. It has a connection mode of the mega drive etc. It was also called a horseshoe crab because of its shape. * MZ-2500 with Hitachi HD64180. Board with MIDI interface for the MZ-2500, produced on the same base, provided improved sound. It has a 10 MHz version of HD64180, 512 KB of RAM, and 2 KB of shared RAM, and the main unit writes data to the shared memory and uses it.

The group formed in 2005 to fight against Rwandan Hutu groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) as part of the Kivu conflict. The group was founded by Pastor Jean Musumbu, who had defected from the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) in response to massacres by the FDLR. Ra√Øa Mutomboki is said to use a 'snowballing' recruitment strategy whereby a village is defended or liberated from FDLR or related forces and the males from that village are initiated into the group. The group emerged and reemerged as a reaction to the Congolese Army's relative absence in North and South Kivu. In 2011, the group was reinvigorated when infighting in the Congolese army caused them to withdraw from the fight in eastern provinces. The group's existence is largely a result of the failure of the \\"policy of disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration\\" that was part of the Sun City Agreement that ended the Second Congo War. By 2012, Ra√Øa Mutomboki had stood accused by a United Nations Security Council panel of experts of the killing of more than 260 civilians. Paul Ngumbi Wangozi, known as Sisawa, had reportedly been a leader of Ra√Øa Mutomboki up until his death in battle with the Congolese army in September 2014. A year later, his widow Cynthia surrendered along with 71 Ra√Øa Mutomboki members to Congolese army forces. In September 2018, Ra√Øa Mutomboki militiamen allegedly gang raped 17 women in the Lubila region of South Kivu. Child soldiers were said to be involved in the incident. The assault was said to be led by Masudi Alimasi Kokodikoko, leader of a faction of Ra√Øa Mutomboki at this time. In 2018, a second leader of a Ra√Øa Mutomboki faction, Isaac Chirambiza, was arrested by army forces on accusation of systematic rapes. In April 2019, Kokodikoko was arrested by the army for the September 2018 gang rapes. They were accused of voter intimidation in the 2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election.

Curtis published two Western novels in the late 1880s. The second of these, The Administratrix, is the first cowboy novel outside of the dime novel tradition, preceding Owen Wister's The Virginian by more than a decade. Curtis was instrumental in making women's suffrage part of the Populist platform.  Early life and background  Emma Ghent was born to Ira Keith Ghent and Mary Palmer Ghent in 1860, in Frankfort, Indiana. Her father was a farmer. She graduated from Frankfort High School in 1877. Emma Ghent married James Curtis, a rancher, on January 2, 1882, in Ca√±on City, Colorado. The couple had two children.  Career  = Writing = Illustration from Emma Ghent Curtis's \\"In the Dark of the Moon\\" by alt=Curtis published her first novel, The Fate of a Fool, in 1888. Set in Colorado, the novel explores the negative effects of sex work on both men and women. Gessia, a music teacher, marries a handsome and well-off rancher, only to discover that he previously patronized the local brothel. The couple spend much of the novel arguing about the social ramifications of sex work. In the end, Gessia dies of exhaustion, full of shame regarding the \\"impurity\\" of her husband. Curtis's second novel, The Administratrix, followed in 1889. Mary, the novel's protagonist, is a schoolteacher who moves from Indiana to Colorado. She falls in love with a cowboy named Jim, who is a vocal advocate for women's rights. When Jim is murdered, Mary crossdresses as a cowboy in order to find his killers and get revenge. This novel was the first outside of the dime novel tradition to feature a cowboy as the main character. These would be Curtis's only two novels. She published a short story titled \\"In the Dark of the Moon\\" in a special issue of The Century Magazine celebrating Western writers, as well as many poems in magazines and newspapers. In her poetry, Curtis explored issues of women's and universal suffrage, including the hypocrisy she perceived in a black male activist's opposition to women's suffrage. = Educational administration = Curtis served on the Board of Control for the State Industrial School for Boys, a juvenile corrections facility located in Jefferson County, Colorado, from 1893 to 1896. The school was established by the state in 1881, and served to teach industrial skills like farming, masonry, blacksmithing, and printing to boys aged 7‚Äì16 who had been convicted of crimes. As a board member, Curtis signed the school's biennial reports, which detailed how allocated funds had been used and requests for additional funds for necessary improvements. = Populism and suffrage = Curtis was an active member of the People's Party and a labor suffragist who emphasized the importance of women union members' efforts in canvassing for the vote. She published a newspaper, The Royal Gorge, to promote women's suffrage. She attended Populist conventions in 1891 in Cincinnati and 1892 in St. Louis and Omaha as a delegate. At the Omaha convention, Curtis and other suffragists succeeded in making women's suffrage a part of the party's platform and in getting more women elected as party delegates. Curtis actively participated in the campaign for women's suffrage in Colorado; in 1893, the state became the first to grant women the right to vote by referendum. Curtis ran for Colorado state senator in 1894, and in 1898 she was chosen as the People's Party's nominee for Colorado Superintendent of Public Instruction.  Death and legacy  Emma Ghent Curtis died in Ca√±on City, Colorado, on February 9, 1918. In the 21st century, scholars of Western fiction have recognized Curtis as part of a tradition of women's Western writing. Victoria Lamont argues that the cowboy novel, previously thought to have started with Owen Wister's The Virginian, in fact began with Curtis's The Administratrix, published more than 10 years earlier.

Biography David Ignatoff was born to a poor Hasidic family in Brusilov, where he received a traditional religious education. He went to Kiev in 1903, where he became active in the Iskra faction of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party and was arrested for revolutionary activities. He emigrated to New York in 1906, finding work as a factory worker and union leader. Ignatoff published his first story, \\"Ervachung,\\" in Der yugend in 1907, and his novel Tsvey kreftn was published in 1908. He helped found the literary group Di Yunge and, together with I. J. Schwartz, edited and published the literary annual Literatur in 1910. Ignatoff founded the avant-garde literary quarterly Shriftn in 1912, which he edited until 1926. He also edited the annual Velt-ayn, Velt-oys (1916). Ignatoff's \\"Der giber\\" ('The Hero'), a biblical story based on the legend of Yifta·∏•, was published in the first Shriftn. In 1918 he released Dos Farborgene Likht ('The Hidden Light', 1918), a collection of tales based on the stories of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov.

He is currently an honorary professor at the Department of Linguistics and English Language of Lancaster University, United Kingdom. His research focuses on applied linguistics with a special focus on literacy, and academic writing. Barton's research also concentrates on the qualitative methodology such as ethnography in applied linguistics.  Career  Barton has been a Professor of Language and Literacies at the Lancaster University since 1993. He also served as the Director of the Lancaster Literacy Research Centre, which is a core partner in the National Research and Development Centre for Adult Literacy and Numeracy. On 26 January 2006, Barton's opinion on an article entitled The struggle to keep basic skills up to scratch was published on The Guardian. He said that \\"It is insulting to adults who have problems reading and writing to compare them to children. Adults with problems have the knowledge and experience of the world, and, mostly, lead normal lives. The comparison with children is silly - I wish I could surf the internet, programme the video and download music as quickly as a 12-year-old\\". Barton was a visiting Professor at the University of Stavanger, Norway. Barton is the Life President of the Lancaster Literacy Research Centre at Lancaster University. Research Barton's research focuses on all aspects of language online, including the interaction of words and images, multilingual issues, changes to vernacular practices and learning. Barton's book, Literacy: An introduction to the ecology of written language, has been published twice. First it was published in 1994 and later in 2007. Michael Stubbs said that literacy emphasises the social approaches to literacy, as opposed to the merely psychological approaches which dominated the field of literacy for many years. In his book entitled Local literacies: reading and writing in one community, Barton and his co-author (Hamilton) focused on a particular community in Britain by analysing how people use literacy in their everyday lives. Their exploration provides a description of literacy at one segment in time, and also explores the nature and significance of communication to people, households and communities. Between 2002 and 2009, Barton's research was funded by the Department for Education and Skills as part of a national research and development consortium, the National Research and Development Centre for Adult Literacy and Numeracy (NRDC) to support the major government initiative Skills for Life. In an article entitled Redefining Vernacular Literacies in the Age of Web 2.0, published in Applied Linguistics in 2013, Barton and Lee examined the characteristics of vernacular literacies on Web 2.0, focusing on the writing activities performed on the photo-sharing website Flickr.com. Their study showed that people draw upon a large array of multi-lingual and multi-modal resources to project new global identities. The writing practices found on Flickr are often changing and new ones are formed out of existing ones. In a research article entitled Researching writing across the lifespan: The value of literacy studies for highlighting social and contextual aspects of change, published in Writing and Pedagogy in 2019, Barton and his colleagues (Karin Tusting, Sharon McCulloch, Uta Papen, Diane Potts) argued that shifts in material, social and institutional dimensions of context have a huge effect on what individuals write and on the writing practices that they develop. They also emphasised the role of changing tools for writing and values around writing, and the importance of transformations in identity and relationships. In addition, they argued that the tradition of literacy studies research, drawn on by all the projects described in their journal article, provides the theoretical and methodological resources to approach such aspects of academic writing development across the lifespan. Publications Barton has publications in several journals such as Applied Linguistics, TESOL Quarterly, Writing & Pedagogy, Discourse, Context and Media, Journal of the European Association of Languages for Specific Purposes, Journal of Child Language, Situated literacies: Reading and writing in context, and Language and education.

Career  Bygate was a lecturer at the University of Reading between 1986 and 1994 and at the University of Leeds between 1994 and 2003. He was an Advisory Professor to the English Department of Hong Kong Institute of Education between 2003 and 2004.

Between 2006 and 2009 he was the coordinator of the BAAL 'Language Learning and Teaching' Special Interest Group. Between 1998 and 2004 Bygate served as the co-editor for the Applied Linguistics and he has been a member of the editorial boards of Applied Linguistics, Language Teaching Research, and Language Teaching. In September 2003 he was appointed as a Professor of Applied Linguistics and Language Education at the Department of Linguistics and English Language at Lancaster University. In 2008 he was elected as a President of AILA (Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquee), International Association of Applied Linguistics in English, for a 3-year term. On 9 June 2011, Bygate gave a plenary at Sorbonne Nouvelle conference in Paris. In 2011 Bygate presided over the 16th AILA World Congress in Beijing, China. Research Bygate argued that the most significant trend in applied linguistics is the emergence of the field as a generic discipline, involving several subareas, all characterised by the aim of developing theoretical and empirical studies of language as a key element in real world problems. Bygate brought together a wide-ranging set of papers, each from a quite distinct area of applied linguistics in article published in Applied Linguistics. Bygate in an article, published in The Language Learning Journal, provided an outline of the origins, the current shape and the potential directions of task-based language teaching (TBLT) as an approach to language pedagogy. Publications Bygate has publications in several major journals such as Applied Linguistics, AILA Review, and The Language Learning Journal.  Bibliography  =Books= *Bygate, M., Van den Branden, K.

Top: The Annunciation. Middle: Isaias and Balaam. Bottom: Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee Madonna and Child, parish church, Olang Simon von Taisten, originally known as Simon Mareigl or Marenkl (c.1450/55, Taisten - c.1515) was a Tyrolean painter in the Late Gothic style. He created numerous frescoes, panel paintings and altarpieces in Gorizia, the Puster Valley, Lienz District and Carinthia.  Biography  His original name refers to an estate near where he was born (Marenklhof). His initial artistic education came from , a painter and woodcutter. After his death in 1474, Simon moved to the workshop of und Michael Pacher, where he became acquainted with contemporary trends in art. While there, he and his brother, Veit (?-c.1520), collaborated with a woodcarving shop to create altarpieces. His earliest works are in the Benedictine monastery in Sonnenburg. His habit of dating his works make it easy to trace his activities. In 1479, he was working in the church at Vierschach (Innichen), in 1481 in Olang and Taisten then, after 1484, at the pilgrimage church in Obermauern (Virgen), creating 29 scenes of the Passion of Jesus and the martyrdom of St. Sebastian. In 1490, he was painting more Passion scenes in Taisten. The years 1491/92 saw him doing frescoes in Niederdorf. From 1495 to 1500, he was back in Obermauern painting a church choir. In 1505, he did some work in Dietenheim (Bruneck) and 1506 found him decorating the chapel at Burg Bruck in Lienz; to sum up his most important works. Many of them included portraits or the coats-of-arms of their sponsors. Towards the end of the 1480s, it is possible to see some Italian influence in his work. This suggests a visit to Friuli or even Padua, made more likely by his business relationship with Count Leonhard of Gorizia and his wife , originally from Mantua. Although best known for his religious frescoes, he also engaged in some non-religious work. This is testified to in a letter from 1507, in which Simon addresses King (later Emperor) Maximilian I, requesting payment for some work he had done in the main square of Lienz; enumerating types of vehicles, costumes etc., apparently done for a celebration of some sort, as they had disappeared.Archiv Museum Schloss Bruck, Sammlung Oberforcher, OG1, Abteilung diverse, K√ºnstler, Karte ‚ÄûSimon von Taisten 1‚Äú, Abschrift der Originalquelle: Gesch√§fte von Hof 1507, Tiroler Landesarchiv, fol. 105..

The building is of special interest and has a Grade II listing on the National Heritage List for England. The main building was constructed in 1855 but some of it dates back to the 18th and perhaps the 17th century. The Hall was, in its early years, in the ownership of ancestors of Charles Darwin. It is now a boutique hotel and event venue. Architecture Cleatham Hall main house dates to 1855; it is south-facing, of 2-stories and 5-bays and is in the Classical Revival style. English Heritage, following Pevsner, speculate that the architect was J. M. Hooker of Tunbridge Wells; the practice of Hooker & Wheeler were responsible for the design of the parish church in nearby Manton, and John Marshall Hooker was the architect of the vicerage. 19th-century sections of the hall are of rendered brick construction, whilst earlier sections are limestone rubble, and later sections in yellow brick. The hall's central bay is demarcated by full-height pilasters with a central recessed channel. The panelled door and ground-floor sash- windows are surmounted by hoods with moulded cornices supported by carved consoles. First-floor windows are surmounted by pediments, again with cornices and consoles. A string course on brackets divides the stories. The roof is of slate and lead, with brick stacks. The roof-line is defined by a moulded cornice and parapet supported by triglyphs and modillions, and with friezes in panels above the pilasters. The right-side garden elevation is of similar style, and has a full-height canted bay window. The left-side elevation is more plain yellow-brick construction. The interior features a geometrical stone staircase with slender cast-iron balusters and decorated with moulded cornices and wall-niches. Ground-floor rooms have plaster cornices and ceiling roses, dado rails, and panelled doors, window shutters and shutter boxes. The hall is sited in a estate, with a walled-garden to the north, and outbuildings including an 1802 coach-house designed by William Fowler.

Charles Darwin describes these ancestors in the following terms. :\\"The second William Darwin (born 1620) served as Captain-Lieutenant in Sir W. Pelham's troop of horse, and fought for the king. His estate was sequestrated by the Parliament, but he was afterwards pardoned on payment of a heavy fine. In a petition to Charles II he speaks of his almost utter ruin from having adhered to the royal cause, and it appears that he had become a barrister. This circumstance probably led to his marrying the daughter of Erasmus Earle, Sergeant-at-law; and hence Erasmus Darwin derived his Christian name. :\\"The eldest son from this marriage, William (born 1655), married the heiress of Robert Waring, of Wilsford, in the county of Nottingham. This lady also inherited the manor of Elston, which has remained ever since in the family.

Production The Defected had been in the making since as early as 2016, when TVB announced its plans for more collaboration projects with Chinese media giants iQIYI and Tencent. Chu Kang-ki pitched the story to producer So Man-chung at around that same time, who immediately expressed interest in working on the show. For the next two years, Chu and his wife Lau Siu-kwan worked on perfecting the script. The duo drew many inspirations for the story from the Gallant Garden, a public cemetery for civil servants, specifically the 55 Hong Kong police officers buried at the cemetery. The Gallant Garden is also a setting that appears frequently throughout the show. Chu said the story of The Defected is a homage to 90's era Hong Kong police films and television dramas, in which bravery and honour were central themes. Casting began soon after the script for The Defected was completed. Kara Wai was the first choice to play Man Hei-wah, an ambitious and ruthless police official who vies to become the first female commissioner of police. Benjamin Yuen lost 20 pounds for his role as Sheung Sing.

Hip hop artists have spoken out in their lyrics against perceived social injustices such as police brutality, poverty, mass incarceration, and the war on drugs. The relationship between hip hop music and social injustice can be seen most clearly in two subgenres of hip hop, gangsta rap and conscious rap. Political hip hop has been criticized in the past as divisive and promoting separatism due to some hip hop artists' pro- black and anti-establishment lyrical content. Musicologist Robert Walser disputes this, arguing that many white youth who are exposed to hip hop as children are more likely to have positive relationships with African Americans and resist racism from their parents or other sources out of respect for black artists they admire.  History and background  = Social injustice in American history = = History of hip hop music = = Social injustice in music = Music has long had a close relationship with politics and social injustice. Before the advent of recording technology and popular music, classical composers during the French Revolution composed music to support the democratic ideals of the revolution. An example of this is Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, originally entitled Bonaparte and dedicated to the French emperor Napoleon I, which was renamed Eroica after Beethoven felt Napoleon had forsaken the ideals of the Revolution. Similarly, Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi's third opera Nabucco, which is based on the Biblical books of Jeremiah and Daniel, served as a rallying cry and anthem of sorts to the Risorgimento movement of Italian unification against the occupying Austrian empire.  Social injustice in popular music  American folk music has a long tradition of music dealing with social injustice, a tradition which only became more popular and widespread with the advent of recording technology and the development of popular music. Some early music of this kind includes \\"Strange Fruit\\" by Billie Holiday and \\"The Bourgeois Blues\\" by Lead Belly, which decried injustices against the African American community. Protest music took on a new form in the 1960s and 70s with the advent of psychedelia and punk rock. Notable artists in this genre such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Sam Cooke composed and released music that opposed the Vietnam War, supported the civil rights movement, and advocated for world peace. Many of these artists were involved in or influential towards the \\"hippie\\" movement of these decades. Since the 1980s and the rise in popularity of hip hop music, much of American hip hop music has come from this genre.  Gangsta rap  Gangsta rap, pioneered in the mid 1980s in Los Angeles, is characterized by explicit, often violent lyrics in opposition to police brutality, mass incarceration, and systemic racism. Despite its socially conscious elements, exemplified by songs like Ice-T's \\"6 in the Mornin'\\" and N.W.A's \\"Fuck tha Police\\", the genre often tended to utilize extensive profanity and mysoginistic lyrics, negatively affecting the public perception of the genre. As the genre developed, more Southern California artists such as 2Pac and Snoop Dogg emerged and brought the genre to mainstream success with hits like \\"Gin and Juice\\" and \\"California Love\\". The gangsta rap phenomenon spread across the United States, with similar styles of music emerging in New York City by artists like Mobb Deep, Nas, and the Wu- Tang Clan. The politically outspoken element of gangsta rap exists to this day. A particularly potent example of this is YG's 2017 album Still Brazy, which features tracks like \\"FDT\\", \\"Police Get Away Wit Murder\\", and \\"Blacks & Browns\\" which denounce systemic racism and police brutality and advocate for unity between minority groups. While in the media the genre was referred to as gangsta rap, some artists within the sub-genre referred to it as \\"reality rap\\", feeling that the explicit and violent nature was a reflection of the reality that they lived in or had grown up in.Cooper, Brittney, et al. PBS, Public Broadcasting Service, www.pbs.org/video/black-america-mlk-and-still-i- rise-part-2/.  Conscious rap  Conscious rap, also known as backpack rap or alternative hip hop, is a subgenre of hip hop which primarily features lyrical themes that highlight social injustice facing underprivileged communities in a more nuanced and subtle fashion than gangsta rap. Conscious rap has its roots in the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 70s, with both poets and musicians such as The Last Poets and Watts Prophets kickstarting the movement of both artistic and political lyrics. Throughout the 80s and 90s many record labels were hesitant to sign conscious or political rappers due to their fears that it was a sub-genre without a large audience and that the strong progressive opinions voiced in the lyrics could have negative repercussions for the label from conservative politicians and commentators who disagreed with the stances expressed in the music. The first artists to gain popularity included Nas, A Tribe Called Quest, and Public Enemy, although the latter is often classified under Gangsta rap rather than conscious rap. Many of the most prominent figures in conscious hip hop emerged in the early 2000s in Chicago and New York, with artists like Mos Def, Lupe Fiasco, Talib Kweli, and Common bringing the genre to a wider audience. Conscious hip hop has continued to find success in the mainstream in recent years, as artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Logic, and Joey Bada$$ have achieved mainstream success while promoting socially conscious messages.  Notable artists  = Public Enemy = New York City based rap crew Public Enemy was one of the first hip hop artists to be both popular in the hip hop community and outspoken about political and racial issues. Their lyrics contain criticism of law enforcement (\\"Fight the Power\\", \\"911 is a Joke\\") and white Americans and modern racism (\\"Fear of a Black Planet\\", etc.), and promote social change with regard to the treatment of African Americans by the white community (\\"Revolutionary Generation\\"). Public Enemy's lyrics were meant to be shocking and hostile, as they went against the norm for American culture at the time and cultivated an image in the media as a \\"gangsta group\\". Chuck D has also been outspoken about his views on capitalism and its link with racism, economic exploitation, oppression of minorities in the United States, and has called for unification within the black community. \\"They'll tell you capitalism sees no color, but at the same time the ones that all feel they have something in common with each other become the most powerful block right there, and it stomps upon those that don't fit that mold. And the only way that you can exist within that mold is that you have to put together a 'posse,' or a team to be able to penetrate that structure. [...] we [black Americans] as a constituency have to stick together and realize that we all have something in common with each other.\\" = N.W.A = N.W.A was a Los Angeles rap group made up of future hip hop legends such as Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and MC Ren. As pioneers of the gangsta rap subgenre along with Ice T, N.W.A. is best known for its politically charged, profanity filled singles \\"Fuck tha Police\\" and \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" which painted stark portraits of violence in the poverty- stricken ghettos of Compton, California and the prevalence of police brutality. However, the misogyny and profanity in the group‚Äôs lyrics as well as their image as violent and dangerous negatively affected the public perception of N.W.A., gangsta rap, and all hip hop music in general. Their debut studio album, Straight Outta Compton, was banned from radio stations and received virtually no promotion from any major media source, yet has gone on to received triple-platinum certification from the RIAA and is widely considered one of the most influential albums of all time. A 2015 biopic film, also entitled Straight Outta Compton, helped solidify N.W.A.'s cultural legacy that culminated with an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. = 2Pac = Tupac Shakur, more commonly known by his stage name 2Pac, is one of the best-selling artists of all time and has influenced countless hip hop artists, making his social commentary in his lyrics all the more visible. Shakur's parents were both members of the Black Panther Party, and Tupac's lyrical content had a relatively wide range which included violent and aggressive gangsta rap (\\"Hit 'Em Up\\", \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\", \\"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\\") to emotionally-charged conscious rap (\\"Changes\\", \\"Trapped\\", \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\", \\"Brenda's Got a Baby\\"). A few of these songs in particular serve as strong denunciations of social injustice. Tupac has been an influence to hip hop artists since his death as both a musical artist and as an icon of social justice. Artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Tory Lanez, J. Cole, and Eminem have all cited Shakur as an influence on their music and their message. = Kanye West = Chicago based rapper, singer, producer, and fashion designer Kanye West, who rose to prominence in the early 2000s and has since amassed tremendous critical acclaim and commercial success, has been known for his outspoken opinions and lyrics on racial and social issues since his debut album The College Dropout. The album featured lyrical topics such as the dangers of consumerism, poverty, racism, mass incarceration, and the downsides of higher education.‚ÄúWest, Kanye.‚Äù Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia, Jan. 2018, p. 1; EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=funk&AN;=we031675&site;=eds- live&scope;=site. On a single from The College Dropout, \\"All Falls Down\\", West criticized the police and the lack of social mobility in the U.S. Multi- platinum Grammy winning rapper Kanye West has repeatedly spoken out against social injustice in his lyrics and in various public statements. Since the mid-2000s, West has continued to comment on social injustice in his music. Notable examples include 2013's \\"New Slaves\\", which comments on the racism West has encountered as an African American in the European-dominated field of high fashion and 2005's \\"Crack Music\\" which comments on the War on Drugs, the American crack epidemic, and references the Black Panthers. West has been spoken out against social injustice outside of music as well. He infamously made headlines in 2005 for his remark \\"George Bush doesn't care about black people\\" during a live broadcast relief concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. West's comment is usually attributed to his frustration with Bush and FEMA's perceived slow response to the disaster while the majority-black residents of urban New Orleans suffered. That same year, West spoke out against homophobia in hip hop culture during an MTV interview. = Lupe Fiasco = Chicago artist Lupe Fiasco has long been one of the most outspoken conscious rappers since his debut album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor in 2006. Fiasco's lyrics include topics such as mass incarceration (\\"Prisoner 1 & 2\\"), poverty in African American ghettos (\\"Hurt Me Soul\\", \\"Deliver\\"), child soldiers in Africa (\\"Little Weapon\\"), the Syrian Refugee crisis (\\"Alan Forever\\"), misogyny (\\"Bitch Bad\\"), and systemic racism throughout American history (\\"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free)\\"). In an interview with Bill O'Reilly in 2011, Fiasco talked about the nature of his music and its political influence, saying, \\"My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, the root cause of terrorism is the stuff the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists.\\" In January 2013, Fiasco was removed from the stage of a pre-inauguration concert in Washington, D.C. after performing the politically charged song \\"Words I never said\\" for 30 minutes. The song includes lyrics that are critical of Obama such as \\"Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn‚Äôt say st [sic], That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either.\\" = J. Cole = North Carolina native J. Cole's 2011 debut album Cole World: The Sideline Story features socially conscious lyrics on tracks such as \\"Lights Please\\" and \\"Lost Ones\\". Cole, along with Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West have played the biggest role in bringing conscious hip hop to a global audience in recent years. Cole's third album 2014 Forest Hills Drive was the first conscious hip hop album (and one of the first hip hop albums) to go double platinum without any features from other artists. Throughout his career, J. Cole's music have taken a more conscious tone, most notably on his 2017 album KOD, which features anti-drug themes (\\"Once an Addict (Interlude\\") and commentary on the American tax system (\\"Brackets\\"). = Meek Mill = Meek Mill performing at the BET Awards in 2018 Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill has become a symbol for prison reform in recent years. While most of his music prior to 2018 is not categorized as conscious, political, or gangsta rap, the tone of his music changed after serving six months of a two to four-year sentence for violating parole. Since being released, his music has taken a political turn, with songs like \\"What's Free\\", \\"Oodles O' Noodles Babies\\", and \\"Stay Woke\\" calling out the criminal justice system for systemic racism and discussing the effect of poverty on black youths across America. Meek Mill's case was allegedly mishandled on multiple occasions, with Judge Genece Brinkley under investigation by the FBI for partial treatment of Mill's case and one of the officers involved in the 2007 arrest under investigation for corruption as well. Meek's activism is not limited to lyrics; he has publicly advocated for prison reform on platforms such as CNN. = Kendrick Lamar = Conscious rapper Kendrick Lamar has seen tremendous success in the mainstream in recent years. Kendrick Lamar has been one of the 2010s' most famous conscious rappers, discussing a wide range of topics in his lyrics from domestic violence (\\"No Makeup [Her Vice]\\"), the American crack epidemic (\\"ADHD\\"), gang violence (\\"m.A.A.d. city\\"), African American identity (\\"The Blacker the Berry\\"), racism (\\"Complexion\\"), and gun violence (\\"XXX.\\"). Lamar's 2015 hit \\"Alright\\" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, symbolizing hope and optimism in the face of discrimination and persecution.Williams, Leah, et al. PBS, Public Broadcasting Service, www.pbs.org/video/black-america-mlk-and-still-i-rise-part-2/. Lamar was at the center of a recent controversy regarding a set of lyrics from his 2015 song \\"Alright\\" in which he states: \\"And we hate po po, wanna kill us dead in the streets for sure.\\" This line was read in a Fox News segment featuring Geraldo Rivera, Dana Perino, Eric Bolling, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, during which Rivera responded, \\"[. . .]this is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years\\". Lamar then responded to this comment in his 2017 songs \\"DNA.\\" and \\"YAH.\\", denouncing the perceived ignorance in his statement. = Joey Badass = Brooklyn rapper Joey Badass's 2017 sophomore album, All-Amerikkkan Badass, is largely political, criticizing Donald Trump (\\"Rockabye Baby\\"), police brutality (\\"Land of the Free\\"), and systemic racism (\\"Y U Don't Love Me? (Miss Amerikkka\\")\\"). The Brooklyn native has achieved critical acclaim as well commercial success following a more traditional \\"boom bap\\" musical style and lyrics involving social injustice.  Hip hop and LGBTQ+ issues  Hip hop music has had a controversial relationship with the LGBTQ+ community. Homophobia in the form of slurs and violent lyrics towards LGBTQ+ individuals has existed in hip hop music for decades. Most infamously, Eminem, the best-selling hip hop artist of all time, has been accused of homophobia numerous times due to his use of homophobic slurs in his lyrics such as these from his 2001 song \\"Criminal\\" from The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem has addressed his use of the homophobic slurs \\"fag\\" and \\"faggot\\" in his lyrics, claiming that he doesn't use it to specifically demean homosexuals but instead to insult one's manhood. He also famously performed his hit song \\"Stan\\" with openly gay singer Elton John at the 2001 Grammy Awards in an attempt to publicly reconcile with the LGBT community. However, in more recent years hip hop has developed a more inclusive attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community. Several hip hop artists have spoken out against homophobia and in support of LGBTQ+ rights, with the most popular instance of this being Seattle-based hip hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis's Grammy-nominated single \\"Same Love\\" from 2012. The single has gone triple platinum in the U.S. and 9x Platinum in other English speaking countries, and focuses on common misconceptions about homosexuality. Macklemore specifically focuses on the effect of social media and the internet on homophobia and LGBTQ+ intolerance, as well as the hip hop community's historical intolerance of the LGBTQ+ community. In recent years, more hip hop artists have come out as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Artists such as Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, Kevin Abstract, Young M.A., ILoveMakonnen, Taylor Bennett, and Lil Peep have been open about their LGBTQ identities and made the genre more inclusive and accepting. L.A. based hip hop group Brockhampton rose to prominence in hip hop in 2017. The group's frontman Kevin Abstract is openly gay and has talked in interviews about his desire to make a change in the perception of homosexuality in the hip hop community through normalizing it. \\"I don‚Äôt want to be a queer icon,\\" Abstract told NME in an interview in 2018. \\"I want to be an icon. [...] In order to make a change, I have to exist in a traditionally homophobic space such as hip-hop. If I were to just be this queer rapper, who only spoke to queer kids, I don‚Äôt think I could as effectively make a change for another young, black queer kid growing up in Texas.\\"  Donald Trump and hip hop  Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States, has had a long and complicated relationship with hip hop. Prior to 2015, many references to Donald Trump were made in hip hop music, mostly celebrating his status as a symbol of wealth, power, and machismo. However, since his incendiary 2016 presidential campaign, references to the president in hip hop have been overwhelmingly negative, criticizing Trump's perceived racist views. References in YG's \\"FDT\\", Joey Bada$$'s \\"Rockabye Baby\\" and \\"Land of the Free\\", Eminem's \\"Campaign Speech\\" and 2017 BET cypher, Denzel Curry's \\"Sirens\\", Joyner Lucas' \\"I'm Not Racist\\" and many more all criticize or even threaten Trump for his divisive rhetoric and alleged racist views and policies. However, a prominent example of support for Donald Trump within the hip hop community has come from rapper and producer Kanye West, who has voiced his support for Trump during rants within his concerts, multiple tweets including pictures wearing Trump's signature MAGA hat, and even lyrics on his song \\"Ye Vs. The People.\\" West has since distanced himself from politics and implied withdrawing support for Trump.

Known for essays, historical writings, biographies and translations, Menon was the first to translate Tagore's works into Malayalam. He was a judge at the Kerala High Court and was a recipient of the title, Sahitya Kushalan, conferred on him by the Rajah of Cochin. Kerala Sahitya Akademi honoured him with the distinguished fellowship in 1971.  Biography  Maharaja's College, Ernakulam Puthezhath Raman Menon was born in an ancient Nair family on 19 October 1891 at Manaloor, in Thrissur district of the South Indian state of Kerala to Kodaykkattu Parameshwara Menon and Pappi Amma. After completing school education at Mission High School, Thrissur, he did his regular college education at Maharaja's College, Ernakulam and Madras Christian College before securing a degree in law to start a career as a lawyer at Thrissur. Later, he became a special prosecutor at the Magistrate Court in Thrissur and went on to hold such positions as those of a District Judge and Sarvadhikaryakkar to end his official career as a judge of the Kerala High Court. Menon, who served as the president of the Kerala Sahitya Akademi for five years from 1961 to 1966, was married to Moothedathu Janaki Amma, who was the foster daughter of one of his uncles. He died on 22 September 1973, at the age of 81.  Legacy and honours  Menon's entry into literature was by publishing humorous satires but later, he wrote general essays, biographies, historical books and translations. He was the first to translate the works of Rabindranath Tagore into Malayalam. His book, Sakthan Thampuran - Historical Novel, published in 1942, is one of the small number of books which detail the life of Sakthan Thampuran, the erstwhile Rajah of Cochin. His essays on Thrissur was later compiled as a book, Thrissur Trichur which has details about the cultural history of the place, its literary milieu and about Thrissur Pooram. He was also associated with Kairali magazine, where he worked alongside G. Sankara Kurup and Joseph Mundassery, though there were rumours of a rift between Kurup and Menon due to a remark made by Menon that no Malayalam writers deserved the Jnanapith Award, later won by Kurup in 1965. Menon, whose autobiography was titled Kazhchappadukal, was conferred with the title of Sahitya Kushalan by the Rajah of Cochin. In 1971, he was inducted as a distinguished fellow by the Kerala Sahitya Akademi.

He did, however, continue to practice painting in his father's workshop when he could spare the time. At the age of eighteen, he painted a scene depicting the Capuchins of Villarrubia de los Ojos, which was shown publicly before being taken to them.

He was married to Luc√≠a Barrag√°n, also from a family of the minor nobility, and associated with intellectuals such as Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca.

After visiting the Australian Blue Asbestos mine at Wittenoom in 1948 and being \\"appalled\\" at the dusty conditions, Saint wrote a letter to the commissioner of the Public Health Department of Western Australia, Dr Cecil Cook, warning of the serious health risk to the workers, including the likelihood they would develop asbestosis. The most notable excerpt from Saint's 1948 letter is perhaps: \\"The asbestos mine at Wittenoom, let the record state, operates without any sort of dust extractor whatsoever. In a year or two, ABA will produce the richest and most lethal crop of asbestosis cases in the world's literature\\". In a Four Corners interview, Saint said he also spoke directly with mine management to express his concerns in \\"no uncertain terms\\" about what he believed to be an extremely hazardous occupational situation for the miners. Saint said that although they listened politely, they didn't commit themselves to addressing the issue. Despite advising what the likely consequences would be to the workers of the mine, Saint's warnings were ignored.Melville, Kirsti (7 February 2019) How mesothelioma devastated this Indigenous community in the Pilbara, Earshot, ABC Radio National.

Asked if he believed there were people who should be blamed for the emerging disaster, Saint said proportioning blame was for the courts to decide, but added that he felt sad that no action was taken at the time by people in positions of responsibility. After successfully obtaining membership into the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1950, Saint joined the staff of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne in February 1951. While at the institute, Saint focused on gastroenterology and published papers on chronic alcoholism.

Saint relocated to Queensland in 1968, where he commenced the role of full-time dean of the University of Queensland's Faculty of Medicine. During this time, Saint helped with the expansion of the National Health and Medical Research Council.

He is formerly the Acting Deputy Inspector- General of Police of Malaysia (DIGP) and Director of the Special Branch (SB) of the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM). Education Abdul Hamid graduated from the National University of Malaysia (UKM) with a degree in policing science in 2001. In 2008, he also attended the University of Birmingham as a Chevening Scholar. 1MDB scandal In 18 August 2015, Abdul Hamid was removed from his post as deputy director (I) of the SB and transferred to the Prime Minister's Department having served in the PDRM for 37 years. He was supposed to helm a newly created 'Security and Transnational' division at the Prime Minister's Department. However, he created a controversy by refusing to clock in at the Prime Minister's Department and suggesting that it was part of a cover-up into the investigations of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. Alleging that his transfer was the consequence of publicly showing support towards former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad, a vocal critic of then Prime Minister Najib Razak, he insisted that he will not back down from criticising the handling of the 1MDB investigations despite becoming the target of clandestine operations by 'friendly' agencies. He was removed almost simultaneously with the then Attorney General of Malaysia, Abdul Gani Patail, SB director, Akhil Bulat, and the Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission (MACC), Abu Kassim Mohamed, and his deputy, Mohamad Shukri Abdull. On 21 May 2018, following Najib's and Barisan Nasional's (BN) defeat in the 2018 Malaysian general election, Abdul Hamid, together with Abdul Gani, Abu Kassim and Mohd Shukri, were appointed to the 1MDB special investigation task force by the newly elected Pakatan Harapan (PH) government. Two days later, Abdul Hamid was reappointed to the SB, but as its new director, following the expedited retirement of Mohamad Mokhtar Mohd Shariff. Deputy Inspector-General On 15 March 2019, following Noor Rashid Ibrahim's retirement from the PDRM, Abdul Hamid took over acting duties of the DIG. He was also widely expected to take over as Malaysia's top cop with current Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mohamad Fuzi Harun due to retire in May 2019. Following the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia's (SUHAKAM) announcement that its findings concluded that the SB was responsible for the disappearances of Amri Che Mat and Raymond Koh in 2016 and 2017 respectively, and still missing as of 2019, Abdul Hamid rapped SUHAKAM for causing negative impact towards the PDRM. He added that he was confident that IGP Mohamad Fuzi, then SB director, would provide an answer to the allegations. In April 2019, Abdul Hamid called for members of the PDRM to be impartial towards any race or religion in carrying out their duties. Following events of the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, Abdul Hamid directed the PDRM to step up security levels at worship and diplomatic compounds around the nation. Shortly after, the acting DIG informed the press that the PDRM arrested a controversial preacher linked to Zakir Naik for allegedly insulting Hinduism after receiving nearly 800 reports made against the former. Inspector-General of Police Following IGP Mohamad Fuzi Harun's imminent retirement on 4 May 2019, Prime Minister Mahathir indicated to the press that Abdul Hamid will be confirmed as Malaysia's 12th IGP following approval from the King (Yang di-Pertuan Agong). However, some reports suggests that the appointment has not been finalised yet. This was shortly after rumours circulated that there was a lack of consensus of Abdul Hamid's appointment within the PDRM. Minister of Home Affairs, Muhyiddin Yassin, announced on 2 May 2019 that Abdul Hamid will indeed succeed Mohamad Fuzi as IGP for an initial two-year term beginning 4 May 2019. It was reported that deputy director (I) of SB, Ramli Hassan, will succeed Abdul Hamid as director in an acting capacity when the latter takes office as IGP. On 6 May 2019, Abdul Hamid confirmed that former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng had been extradited to the United States to face charges there in relation to the 1MDB scandal. Following a meeting with the National Governance, Integrity and Anti-Corruption Centre (GIACC), Abdul Hamid announced that the PDRM has agreed to the long-awaited introduction of the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission (IPCMC). This was following recent comments from outgoing IGP, Mohamad Fuzi, voicing his opposition to the IPCMC. The IPCMC previously received vocal support from Abdul Hamid and was first recommended 14 years ago by the Royal Commission to Enhance the Operation and Management of the Royal Malaysia Force. Soon after, he ordered the PDRM's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Integrity and Standards Compliance Department (ISCD) to investigate reports that two members of the PDRM had extorted money from a civilian. Abdul Hamid gained prominence for making impromptu visits to police stations. He later publicly warned members of the PDRM to sever any ties they may have with crime syndicates across the country \\"before it's too late\\". On the same day, he told fugitive Low Taek Jho, publicly known as Jho Low, wanted for various corruption charges related to the 1MDB scandal, to return to Malaysia to face charges and added that the PDRM will ensure of the latter's safety after Abdul Hamid himself declared that the PDRM had new leads in Low's whereabouts. On 30 May 2019, Abdul Hamid told reporters that he expected Jho Low to be arrested soon. Following his previous call to his fellow officers to distance themselves from criminals and corruption just slightly more than a week before, Abdul Hamid issued another stern warning in early June 2019 to his colleagues after reports emerged that several officers in charge of police districts (OCPDs) solicited funds for Eid al-Fitr celebrations. He also remarked that any officers involved will face immediate transfers. He also urged the public to exercise patience regarding Jho Low's return after messages reading that the fugitive had been arrested went viral on social media but revealed that the PDRM has become aware of Low's whereabouts. On 10 June 2019, Abdul Hamid urged the government to increase the salaries of lower- ranked policemen as a means to cover living costs and also in an attempt to increase integrity. Later, he reiterated that the PDRM was in the midst of thrashing out a deal with an unnamed Asian country, where Low is residing, to facilitate the latter's return to Malaysia. Whilst he also added that he was hugely disappointed with the former IGP, Khalid Abu Bakar, for acting \\"unprofessionally\\" by following alleged political decisions to remove then-SB director Akhil Bulat and Abdul Hamid himself back in 2015, Abdul Hamid refused to divulge what he meant in a vaguely worded sentence he addressed, in an open letter, to another of his predecessors, IGP Mohamad Fuzi.

Her work has been exhibited in places like Colombo, Tehran, Cairo, Bangkok and Tokyo, apart from India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Her paintings usually contain classical themes while her techniques also show a mix of realism. There are a lot of references to Buddhism that can be found in her art.  Early life and education  Atasi Barua was born on 4 September 1921 the daughter of Sarojbasini Devi and Asit Kumar Haldar in West Bengal. She was the great-grand niece of Rabindranath Tagore who in fact named her. She was born at Shantiniketan. She studied at La Martiniere College in Lucknow.  Career in art  She started painting at an young age, to cope with the early demise of her mother. Her father, who was a well-known painter himself, constantly encouraged and motivated her passion. She trained herself in various techniques and soon become a talented artist. After her marriage to Dr Arabinda Barua who was a Buddhist scholar, her exposure to Buddhism gave her immense inspiration, which can be seen from her paintings. Her paintings revolve around portraying the life of Buddha, the cave paintings of Ajanta, and many other themes. She won cash reward at the 11th Annual Exhibition of the Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata, after which she started getting international attention for her paintings. Her paintings were also held in solo exhibitions in Kolkata, where she was praised by many critics like O. C. Ganguly and Abani C. Banerjee. She and her husband traveled a lot and attended many conferences in South Asia. She also made portraits of many well-known personalities and scholars that she met, and also got them signed. Some of them are Jamini Roy, Nandalal Bose, B. R. Ambedkar, Ho Chi Minh, O. C. Gangooly, Nabanita Dev Sen and Kalidas Nag. The majority of her artwork were line drawings. Drawing inspiration from Lord Buddha‚Äôs life, she chronicled his life in 12 paintings after she was requested to do so by the Maha Bodhi Society who then published them in a pictorial book. She was also commissioned by the Digambar Jain Temple to do a series of paintings on the 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanatha.

When the East Eranad Education Society was formed in 1964, Moulavi became the founder president of the society; the society, which started Dr. Gafoor Memorial MES Mampad College in 1965, was handed over the Muslim Educational Society (MES) in 1967. Maulavi died on 27 April 1993, at the age of 88, at Kozhikode.  Legacy and honours  Maulavi published twelve books on Islamic studies, including a reportedly controversial book, Islamile Dhanavitharanapadhathi (Distribution of Wealth in Islam Tradition). He was the first to publish a complete translation of the Quran into Malayalam which he published in 1963, at a time when translation of Quran was considered a blasphemy. He wrote on many contentious issues such as divorce and maintenance among Muslims and his book, Mahathaya Mappila Sahitya Paramparyam (The glorious Mappila Literary Heritage) is a comprehensive work on the Muslim literature in Kerala with details about the contribution of Muslims in the development of Arabic-Malayalam literature. He served as a member of the Kerala Sahitya Akademi for five years from 1959 to 1964. In 1989, he was inducted as a distinguished fellow by the academy. His birth centenary was celebrated in Kozhikode in 2005 and an exhibition of all his writings were organized as a part of it.

It is one of many such tombs that have been identified in Portugal. The Anta was a communal grave consisting of a sepulchral chamber with a polygonal shape. The remains of the tomb consist of six cretaceous limestone slabs that originated in the area, which has several sizeable limestone outcrops. Five of these slabs are believed to have been part of the burial chamber and the sixth part of the corridor. Near the monument there are other slabs of limestone, one of which of could have been the roof of the chamber. Based on earlier identification by Mesquita Figueiredo and Carlos Ribeiro (1813-82), the German archaeologists Georg and Vera Leisner visited the Anta of Carcavelos in 1944 as part of preparing a systematic inventory of the Neolithic tombs of the Lisbon area. They produced drawings but did not carry out any excavations. Hastened as a result of looting at the site, the first excavations were carried out in 1986 and continued again from 1991-94, under the supervision of Gustavo Marques of the Loures municipality. Further intermittent excavation was carried out in 1998 and again in 2005-06 by Florbela Est√™v√£o and Rui Boaventura. From the studies carried out in 1994, many bones were collected, with over 80 adult males and females believed to have been buried there. Various objects were also found such as flint arrowheads, smooth and decorated bell-shaped ceramics, dishes, cylindrical idols, and objects of adornment. The items collected came mainly from the interior of the chamber, but some were also found close to the site. In general, the number of items found was significantly lower than those found at other comparable sites in the area, such as the Anta do Monte Abra√£o. The evaluation of items found suggested a probable initial use of the dolmen as being in the last centuries of the 4th millennium BCE, with an intensification in its use between 3000 and 2600 BCE, this period having been identified using radiocarbon dating on an adult femur and jaw. Preliminary microscopic analysis of human bones indicates cut marks. This suggests that the bodies could have been disarticulated and/or defleshed prior to burial in the dolmen, which thus served as an ossuary rather than as a repository of bodies. However, archaeologists recognise that further work is required to confirm this.

Countries that allow openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve Countries that allow homosexuals to serve in the military Conceptions and categories of sexual orientation are not universal. Language contained in the following entries, as much as possible, reflects local usage or official doctrine. =Albania= Gays and lesbians have been allowed to serve in the Military of Albania since 2008. =Argentina= As of 2009, the Argentine government has officially ended the ban on homosexuals in the Argentine Armed Forces. A new military justice system was put into effect which decriminalizes homosexuality among uniformed members, and moves crimes committed exclusively within the military to the public justice sphere [previously there had been a separate military court system]. Under the old system, homosexuals were not permitted to have access to a military career, at the same time as this sexual orientation was penalized. And, while there are no publicly known former sanctions against homosexuals under the old policy, this does not mean that men and women with that sexual orientation have not been disciplined, and perhaps separated from the armed forces under a mantle of silence. In fact, with this new system, homosexuals who wish to train in the forces should encounter no impediment, nor any military retaliation. =Australia= Uniformed Australian Defence Force personnel marching in the 2013 Sydney Mardi Gras Australia has allowed homosexuals to serve openly since 1992.\\"Australia Ends a Prohibition On Homosexuals in Military\\", The New York Times, November 24, 1992Suzanne B.

In Belgium, the military accepts gay men and lesbians into service. However, if the behaviour of an individual who is gay or lesbian causes problems, that individual is subject to discipline or discharge. In some cases, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been too open with their sexuality. The Belgian military also continues to reserve the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail.Military Culture: Europe glbtq: An encyclopaedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender & queer culture. =Bermuda= The Military of Bermuda does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation, as it is formed by random lottery-style conscription. Officially, members of the Bermuda Regiment are prohibited from discriminating against or harassing soldiers on the basis of sexual orientation; such activities, however, are tolerated by officers, to the extent that one conscript described the Regiment as \\"the most homophobic environment that exists\\". =Bolivia= The Armed Forces of Bolivia announced in 2013 that LGBT citizens would be allowed to serve beginning in 2015. =Brazil= There is no law forbidding lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people from serving in the Brazilian Armed Forces. Sexual orientation and gender identity cannot be an obstacle for entry into the police force or the military in Brazil, and some trans women and travestis should make conscription, like some Brazilian male citizens. All sexual acts are disallowed between members of the forces, be they heterosexual or homosexual. LGBT people and Military service The Constitution of Brazil prohibits any form of discrimination in the country. The Brazilian Armed Forces does not permit desertion, sexual acts or congeners in the military, whether heterosexual or homosexual. They claim that it is not a homophobic rule, but a rule of discipline that also includes the opposite sex. Final feliz na caserna In 2008, during the disappearance of a military gay couple, the Ministry of Defence of Brazil spoke: \\"the sergeant is to be questioned about alleged desertion from the military and there is no question of discrimination.\\" The two soldiers said they had been in a stable relationship for ten years in the Brazilian military. No information currently exists as to whether military personnel can have their same-sex relationships recognized by the military, despite the fact that federal government employees can receive benefits for their same-sex spouses. Following the Supreme Federal Tribunal decision in favor of civil unions, Defense Minister Nelson Jobim guaranteed the Ministry's compliance with the decision and mentioned that spousal benefits can be accorded to same-sex spouses of military personnel. According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) in 2012, 63.7% of Brazilians support the entry of LGBTs in the Brazilian Armed Forces, and do not see it as a problem. =Bulgaria= Bulgaria's Protection Against Discrimination Act of 2006 protects individuals from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in relation to recruitment to the military. =Canada= As of 1992, lesbians, gays and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly in the military. A study of gays and lesbians in the Canadian military has found that after Canada's 1992 decision to allow homosexuals to serve openly in its armed forces, military performance did not decline.Suzanne B.

Its title is \\"Effects of the 1992 Lifting of Restrictions on Gay and Lesbian Service in the Canadian Forces; Appraising the Evidence\\". * Lifting of restrictions on gay and lesbian service in the Canadian Forces has not led to any change in military performance, unit cohesion, or discipline. * Self-identified gay, lesbian, and transsexual members of the Canadian Forces contacted for the study describe good working relationships with peers. * The number of military women who experienced sexual harassment dropped 46% after the ban was lifted. While there were several reasons why harassment declined, one factor was that after the ban was lifted women were free to report assaults without fear that they would be accused of being a lesbian. * Before Canada lifted its gay ban, a 1985 survey of 6,500 male soldiers found that 62% said that they would refuse to share showers, undress or sleep in the same room as a gay soldier. After the ban was lifted, follow-up studies found no increase in disciplinary, performance, recruitment, sexual misconduct, or resignation problems. * None of the 905 assault cases in the Canadian Forces from November, 1992 (when the ban was lifted) until August, 1995 involved gay bashing or could be attributed to the sexual orientation of one of the parties.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/world/canadian-military-can-t-bar- homosexuals-a-court-rules.html?pagewanted=1 A news article by Canadian journalist, Jon Tattrie, reported on the changed attitude towards the presence of homosexual members of the Canadian Forces in his article \\"Being Gay in the Military\\" (Metro Ottawa), quoting Canadian Forces spokesperson Rana Sioufi as saying: \\"Members who are same-sex partners are entitled to the same respect and dignity as heterosexual married couples or common-law partners.\\"Tattrie, Jon (20 August 2010). \\"Being Gay in the Military\\" .

On August 13, 2014, The Defense Ministry ordered the creation of a new committee to monitor inclusion and tackle discrimination in the armed forces, a move hailed as a \\"historic\\" step by gay rights campaigners. Marcos Robledo, defense undersecretary, announced the formation of a Diversity and Anti-Discrimination Committee with the aim to eradicate arbitrary discrimination in the military. The resolution, signed by Defense Minister Jorge Burgos, established the government as responsible for creating a more inclusive armed services. Few days later, a sailor in Chile became the first serving member of the Chilean armed forces to announce he is gay. Mauricio Ruiz, 24, told a televised news conference his decision had \\"not been easy\\", but he wanted to help fight discrimination against homosexuals. Mr Ruiz said that what was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or her willingness to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean armed. Mauricio Ruiz said homosexuals had \\"no reason to hide\\". \\"We can do anything, be marines or in any branch (of the military). We can do whatever profession, and we deserve as much respect as anyone else,\\" he told reporters in the Chilean capital, Santiago. \\"In life there's nothing better than to be yourself, to be authentic, to look at people in the eye and for those people to know who you are.\\" Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Movement for Integration and Homosexual Liberation, expressed his gratitude to the Chilean Navy. \\"(The Navy is) telling the country and the members of the institution particularly that it is possible for gays and lesbians to be part of the armed forces and that they aren't going to suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation within these institutions,\\" Mr Jimenez said. =Colombia= In 1999 the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled that the prohibition of homosexuals from serving in the armed forces is unconstitutional and members of the LGBT community may serve openly. =Croatia= LGBT persons are not banned from participation in military service. Ministry of Defence has no internal rules regard LGBT persons, but it follows regulation at the state level which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some media reports have suggested that most gay men serving in the military generally decide to keep their sexual orientation private, but there have also been reports suggesting that the Croatian Armed Forces take discrimination very seriously and will not tolerate homophobia among its personnel. =Cyprus= Homosexuals used to be banned from serving in the Cypriot Military. However, the 2011 National Guard Law does not include a ban. =Czech Republic= =Denmark= Denmark allows homosexuals to serve openly. There are prominent openly gay military leaders in the Danish Armed Forces and there are no reported cases of threats to gays, morale, or national security. A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Armed Forces show strength and are respected.Sexual Orientation Discrimination in Denmark. ‚Äì a study of the experiences and perceptions of six homosexual men in the Danish Armed Forces Associated professor Ina Borup, NHV ‚Äî Nordic School of Public Health, Jan 2010. =Estonia= Estonia allows homosexuals to serve openly in the Military of Estonia. =Finland= Finland allows homosexuals to serve openly in the Finnish Defence Forces. =France= France allows homosexuals to serve openly. Although homosexuals are not banned, they may face greater challenges than their heterosexual counterparts. Commanders and psychiatrists who believe gay and lesbian personnel are disrupting their units can discharge them. =Germany= The German Bundeswehr ruled that it is forbidden to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The \\"Working Committee of Homosexual Employees in the Military Forces\\"A.H.s.A.B. ‚Äì Arbeitskreis homosexueller Angeh√∂riger der Bundeswehr (Site is only in German) is the organization that represents the interests of gay men and lesbians in the armed forces. Heterosexuals and homosexuals alike are allowed to engage in sexual activity while in the military service as long as it does not interfere with the performance of their duties. Lesbian and gay soldiers are also entitled to enter civil unions as defined by Germany's domestic \\"partnership\\" law. The Bundeswehr maintained a \\"glass ceiling\\" policy that effectively banned homosexuals from becoming officers until 2000. First Lieutenant Winfried Stecher, an army officer demoted for his homosexuality, filed a lawsuit against former Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. Scharping vowed to fight the claim in court, claiming that homosexuality \\"raises serious doubts about suitability and excludes employment in all functions pertaining to leadership.\\" However, before the case went to trial, the Defense Ministry reversed the discriminatory policy. While the German government declined to issue an official explanation for the reversal, it is widely believed that Scharping was overruled by then Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der and then Vice- Chancellor Joschka Fischer. Currently, according to general military orders given in the year 2000, tolerance towards all sexual orientations is considered to be part of the duty of military personnel. Sexual relationships and acts amongst soldiers outside service times, regardless of the sexual orientation, are defined to be \\"irrelevant\\", regardless of the rank and function of the soldier(s) involved, while harassment or the abuse of functions is considered a transgression, as well as the performance of sexual acts in active service.Cf. two orders of 2000: ; and =Greece= While the Presidential Decree 133 (of 2002) allowed people to avoid the draft for deep psycho-sexual problems, it did not ban homosexuals from the army. The newer 2005 law 3421 has removed even the wording that could be misconstrued as offensive to homosexuals. In recent years, the Hellenic army has been shortening the length of conscription and hiring more and more professional soldiers and there hasn't been any incident of someone being fired for homosexuality. =Ireland= =Israel= A policy in 1983 allowed prospective Israeli soldiers to be questioned about their sexual orientation. Scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan suggested that the prospective soldiers' responses affected what military unit they would be assigned to. However, the 1993 policy was put into effect to remove the 1983 policy.Eyal Ben-Ari, Danny Kaplan, \\"Brothers and Others in Arms: Managing Gay Identity in Combat Units of the Israel Army,\\" Sage Publications (2000):400. Israel Defense Forces policies allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly and without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation.Second Thoughts on Gays in the Military, By JOHN M. SHALIKASHVILI, January 2, 2007. This was put into effect in 1993 after an IDF reserves officer testified before the Knesset claiming that his rank had been revoked, and that he had been barred from researching sensitive topics in military intelligence, solely because of his sexual identity.Suzanne B. Goldberg, \\"Open Service and Our Allies: A Report on the Inclusion of Openly Gay and Lesbian Servicemembers in U.S. Allies' Armed Forces,\\" William & Mary Journal of Women & Law (2011) v 17 pp 547-90 online Homosexuals serve openly in the military, including special units, without any discrimination.The chief of staff's policy states that it is strictly forbidden to harm or hurt anyone's dignity or feeling based on their gender or sexual orientation in any way, including signs, slogans, pictures, poems, lectures, any means of guidance, propaganda, publishing, voicing, and utterance. Moreover, homosexuals in the IDF have additional rights, such as the right to take a shower alone if they want to. According to a University of California, Santa Barbara study, a brigadier general stated that Israelis show a \\"great tolerance\\" for gay soldiers. Consul David Saranga at the Israeli Consulate in New York, who was interviewed by the St. Petersburg Times, said, \\"It's a non-issue. You can be a very good officer, a creative one, a brave one, and be gay at the same time.\\" In a comprehensive review of interviews with all known experts on homosexuality in the IDF in 2004,Did Lifting the Gay Ban Undermine Military Performance? Palm Centre, Jun 04. researchers were not able to find any data suggesting that Israel's decision to lift its gay ban undermined operational effectiveness, combat readiness, unit cohesion or morale. In this security-conscious country where the military is considered to be essential to the continued existence of the nation, the decision to include sexual minorities has not harmed IDF effectiveness. While no official statistics are available for harassment rates of sexual minorities in the IDF, scholars, military officials and representatives of gay organizations alike assert that vicious harassment is rare. A study published by the Israel Gay Youth Movement in January 2012 found that half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia., \\"Does viral IDF Gay Pride photo show full picture?\\" By Yaakov Katz, Jerusalem Post, June 12, 2012 Even though the law states that gay soldiers cannot be discriminated against by the Israeli military, does not mean it does not occur between soldiers. Ben-Ari and Kaplan, the scholars who wrote ‚ÄúSexual Orientation and Military Service‚Äù, discovered that gay Israeli soldiers faced discrimination from their fellow military men because they were viewed as mentally ill, lonely, and insecure.Ben-Ari, Kaplan, \\"Brothers and Others in Army,\\" 402. Ben- Ari and Kaplan cited a study about how an Israeli soldier's sexual partner preference influenced the way they were treated. The study conveyed that soldiers bonded in the Israeli military through homophobic remarks and sexualizing women. There was another study that scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan created that determined how gay Israeli soldiers responded to the macho man stereotype in the military. Gay soldiers either isolated themselves from the rest of the soldiers or attempted to adapt to heterosexual norms. In the end, gay soldiers' military performance was not affected by their response but their integration into the military was affected.Ben-Ari, Kaplan, \\"Brothers and Others in Army,\\" 421 =Italy= The Armed Forces of Italy cannot deny men or women of homosexual orientation to serve within their ranks, as this would be a violation of Constitutional rights. In the past, homosexual conduct was grounds for being discharged from the Italian armed forces for reason of insanity, and feigning homosexuality was a very popular way to obtain medical rejection and skip draft. =Japan= Japan does not have any rules applying to homosexuals serving in the Self-Defense Forces. The Japan Self-Defense Forces, when being asked about their policy toward gays and lesbians following the U.S. debate during the Bill Clinton presidency, answered that it was not an issue, and individuals within the forces indicated that as long as same-sex relations did not lead to fights or other trouble, there were few, if any, barriers to their inclusion in the armed services. =Latvia= Latvia allows homosexuals to serve openly. =Lithuania= Lithuania allows lesbian, gay, and bisexual people to serve openly. =Luxembourg= Luxembourg allows homosexuals to serve openly. =Malta= =Mexico= =Netherlands= In 1974, the Netherlands was the first country to ban discrimination against gays in the military.Shilts, p. 572 The Dutch government considered homosexuality grounds for dismissal until 1974, when the Association of Dutch Homosexuals convinced the Minister of Defense that gays posed no threat to national security. The Dutch military formed a working group called Homosexuality and Armed Forces to improve the climate for sexual minorities. In the 1980s, this group became the Homosexuality and Armed Forces Foundation, a trade union that continues to represent gay and lesbian personnel to the Ministry of Defense. =New Zealand= =Norway= Norway allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces. Norway, like most of Scandinavia, is very liberal in regards to LGBT-rights and it also became the first country in the world to enact an anti-discrimination law protecting homosexuals in certain areas. The Norwegian government states: Anyone who in written or verbal form is threatening, scorning, persecuting, or spiteful toward a gay or lesbian person will be punished with fines or prison of up to two years.Gays in arms: can gays in the military work? In countries around the world, they already do Washington Monthly, Nov 1992. =Peru= =Philippines= The Philippine government has officially ended, as of 2010, the ban on gays in the military. In July 2012, the Philippine Military Academy announced that it has welcomed openly gay and lesbian applicants into its fold, giving them the opportunity to serve in the military. =Poland= =Portugal= Portugal allows all citizens to serve openly in the military regardless of sexual orientation, as the constitution explicitly forbids any discrimination on that basis, therefore openly allowing lesbians and gays to serve in the military. In April 2016, Portugal's armed forces chief General Carlos Jer√≥nimo resigned, days after being summoned to explain comments about gay soldiers made by the deputy head of the military college. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa accepted the resignation of Jer√≥nimo, who took up the post of chief of staff in 2014. The resignation came after Ant√≥nio Grilo, deputy head of the military college, admitted advising parents of young military students in the Portuguese army to withdraw their sons if they were gay \\"to protect them from the other students\\". Defence Minister Azeredo Lopes considered any discrimination \\"absolutely unacceptable\\". =Romania= Homosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the Romanian army. According to the Ministry of Defence's recruitment policy, \\"it is the right of every Romanian citizen to take part in the military structures of our country, regardless of their sexual orientation.\\" =Russia= =San Marino= The Sammarinese Armed Forces does not explicitly ban LGBT people from serving. The code of conduct of the police force prohibits unfair discrimination in recruitment. Furthermore, police officials are trained to properly respond to and identify discrimination, whether in public or within the police force itself. Decreto Delegato 11 febbraio 2015 N.13 - Codice di condotta per gli appartenenti ai Corpi di Polizia =Serbia= In May 2010, the head of the Serbian military (Vojska Srbije) announced that the Serbian Army would accept homosexuals to join. However, this news was not widely covered by media.Vesti.rs Serbian news and information website, http://www.vesti.rs/Vesti/Homoseksualci-mogu-u-profesionalnu-vojsku.html =Singapore= =Slovakia= =Slovenia= Slovenia allows individuals to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation. =South Africa= =Spain= Homosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the Spanish Army. As of 2009, after the case of Aitor G.R, the courts also ruled that transgender individuals are also permitted to serve in the military.Transexuales en el Ej√©rcito Espa√±ol, Miguel Ruiz, February 10, 2009 =Sweden= Sweden allows homosexuals to serve openly and was amongst the first nations in the world to allow LGBT people to do so. Gay men could serve openly even before homosexuality was demedicalized (in 1979), as there was no ban on homosexuality in the nation's military. Since 1987 all kind of discrimination, military employment included, due to sexual orientation is banned by constitution. Since 2008 this ban also includes transgender people. The Swedish Armed Forces states that it actively work for an environment where individuals do not feel it to be necessary to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2015, they launched a Pride campaign featuring a soldier in uniform with the rainbow flag badget to her arm. The text's bold letters translates to \\"Some things you should not have to camouflage,\\" followed by the text \\"Equality is an essential ingredient in a democracy,\\" say the Swedish Armed Forces. \\"In the military, we treat them with respect and see the differences of others as a fortress. We are an inclusive organisation where all the people who serve and contribute feel welcome and respected.\\" =Switzerland= Swiss military officers participating at Europride 2009 in Zurich Switzerland's military policies also allow for gay men and lesbians to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation. =Taiwan= Taiwan repealed its ban on conscripting gay people into the military in 2002. Following an announcement by the Republic of China Armed Forces that it would end a policy banning gays from guarding high level officials and government installations, scholars and military officials said the decision signaled a bold step for an Asian military force. The policy change was announced after a local newspaper revealed the discriminatory practice, prompting protest demonstrations in Taipei, the nation's capital. Col. Liu of the ROC Naval Attache said that ending the ban on gays in the military police was \\"a good thing for a democratic society like ours. I don't think this is really a big deal,\\" he said. \\"It just means Taiwanese society is more open and there are different choices now. If you're gay and you can do the job, that's fine.\\" =Thailand= In 2005, the Thai armed forces lifted its ban on LGBT serving in the military. Prior to this reform, LGBT people were exempted as suffering from a \\"mental disorder\\" law of 1954. =Ukraine= =United Kingdom= Until 2000, the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) policy was to continue the long standing ban on homosexuals joining any of the Armed Forces. Since March 2014, UK military same-sex couples can get married (as well as UK civilians), under the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. This law does not apply to Northern Ireland only. =United States= A US Navy sailor kissing her fianc√©, who is also a member of the Navy, after disembarking at the end of a deployment in December 2011 Homosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the United States military. Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the U.S. Congress voted to repeal the policy. The first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the gay rights movements of the 1970s and 1980s, including the famed \\"Copy\\" Berg case, the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with socially liberal efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and socially conservative groups wishing to reinforce it by statute. A legislative policy was enacted in a 1993 bill signed by President Bill Clinton. The new policy continued the ban under which homosexuals were prohibited from serving in the military and their discharge was required. The main change that the new policy made was to prohibit investigation into a member's sexual orientation without suspicion. The new policy was known as \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" and was seen as a compromise between the two political efforts. Pressure to overturn the ban continued to build throughout the 1990s and 2000s, as public opposition to gay rights waned. In December 2010, a Democratically controlled House and a Democratically controlled Senate passed and President Barack Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 which created a future pathway to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. Under the terms of the bill, the \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" policy remained in place until the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60 days waiting period. In early 2011, military leaders began issuing training plans for the expected repeal of the ban. A court order on July 6, 2011, required the Pentagon to immediately suspend the ban, which the government complied with. The legislative repeal of the ban took effect on September 20, 2011. One year after repeal, a study published by the Palm Center found that openly gay service has not resulted in a negative net impact to the U.S. military. Per the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor, lawful same-sex spouses are afforded the same rights as heterosexual spouses. =Uruguay= Homosexuals were prohibited from serving in the Uruguayan armed forces under the 1973‚Äì1985 military dictatorship, however this prohibition was lifted in 2009 when a new decree was signed by Defence Minister Jose Bayardi which provided that sexual orientation would no longer be considered a reason to prevent people from entering the armed forces.Huffington Post: Uruguay To Lift Ban On Gays In The Military, 14 May 2009, Countries with ambiguous policies =North Korea= =South Korea= Civil rights for homosexual citizens are guaranteed in South Korea under the Korean Human Rights Committee Law, but in practice homosexuals may still face discrimination during military service, which is mandatory for all male citizens. Conscripts are profiled at the time of enlistment and homosexuals may be categorized as having a \\"mental handicap\\" or \\"personality disorder\\", which may lead to a dishonourable discharge. Article 92 of the Military Penal Code categorizes sexual relations between members of the same sex as \\"sexual harassment\\", regardless of whether it is consensual. Consensual sex between homosexuals may be regarded as \\"reciprocal rape\\", punishable by up to a year's imprisonment for both parties. These laws and practices have faced legal challenges during recent years. South Korea is the only developed nation that doesn't allow LGBT individuals to serve. Council of Europe In multiple cases‚ÄîLustig-Prean and Beckett v UK (1999), Smith and Grady v UK (1999), Perkin and R v UK (2002) and Beck, Copp and Bazeley v UK (2002)‚Äîthe European Court of Human Rights found that barring homosexual and bisexual individuals from military service violates article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2010, ten European Union countries still did not allow homosexuals to serve openly: Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, and Cyprus.

Some early films satirized and mocked suffragists and Suffragettes as \\"unwomanly\\" \\"man- haters,\\" or sensationalized documentary footage. Suffragists countered these depictions by releasing narrative films and newsreels that argued for their cause. After women won the vote in countries with a national cinema, women's suffrage became a historical event depicted in both fiction and nonfiction films.  General  = Early silent films, 1898‚Äì1915 = Renewed campaigns for women's suffrage in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States coincided with the invention of the motion picture and the creation of the film industries in these same countries. Because of this, women's suffrage was a topic in some of the earliest narrative films. Film scholar Martin F. Norden views \\"suffrage films\\" as a distinct genre that had its \\"one and only heyday during the years prior to World War I\\".Norden, M. F. (1986). \\"A good travesty upon the suffragette movement\\": Women's suffrage films as genre. Journal of Popular Film and Television, 13(4), 171. Like most films of the silent era, very few of these motion pictures survive,Sloan, p. 413. though descriptions from film magazines of the time help us understand their content and messages. Early comedies and melodramas lampooned or attacked women's suffrage. Comedies created laughable suffragist characters, while melodramas showed suffragists ruining their lives, families, and communities. These films \\"echoed the vehement cries of politicians, journalists, and preachers who feared that woman suffrage would spell the death of femininity and the family.\\"Sloan, p. 412. Less than three years after the invention of narrative cinema, George Albert Smith satirized suffragists in his silent short film The Lady Barber (1898). In this comedy, a woman suffragist takes over a barbershop and begins cutting the hair of the \\"bewildered\\" male customers. Many such films explored what might happen if men and women switched gender roles, or if women took on the activities and responsibilities of men; examples include Alice Guy- Blach√©'s Les R√©sultats du f√©minisme (1906); She Would Be a Business Man (1910); and Georges M√©li√®s's Fire! Fire! Fire! (1911). While Guy-Blach√©'s film used satire to demonstrate the sexism and abuse women face in a society ruled by men, films like Fire! Fire! Fire!, The Reformation of the Suffragettes (1911), and A Lively Affair (1912) showed women humiliated into abandoning the suffrage movement after trying to do the work of men. A Busy Day (1914) Comedies also used cross-dressing to parody suffragists. In the 1899 film Women's Rights, two men dressed as women unknowingly have their skirts nailed to a fence. Charlie Chaplin played a woman in the 1914 short film A Busy Day (originally titled A Militant Suffragette). Other films depicted women in male attire, including The Suffragette's Dream (1909), M√©li√®s's For the Cause of Suffrage (1909), and A Cure for Suffragettes (1913, written by Anita Loos).Stamp, p. 164. Carrie Nation may have been the first suffragist to be the subject of a film, though it was her hatchet-wielding temperance actions that were caricatured in The Kansas Saloon Smashers and Why Mr. Nation Wants a Divorce (both released in 1901). Not all early films were anti-suffrage. In 1911 and 1912, Alma Webster Powell published two pro-suffrage photoplays. One of these, The First Woman Jury in America, was made into a film starring Flora Finch.\\"First Woman Jury in America\\". The Moving Picture World: 892. March 9, 1912. Our Mutual Girl, a weekly serial that began in 1914 to promote Mutual Film, had several pro-suffrage chapters; in one, the heroine attended a suffrage meeting in Times Square and was introduced to Harriot Stanton Blatch and Inez Milholland.  Newsreels  Documentary news footage of suffrage demonstrations could present the movement in a positive or negative light. In 1908, British suffragettes invited news cameras to film a rally in Hyde Park, London; the footage became the first news coverage of women's suffrage on film.Sloan, p. 415.Stamp, p. 170. But newsreels could also present documentary footage of the suffrage movement in a sensationalized manner. For example, the newsreel Suffragettes Again (1913) showed firefighters attempting to put out a large fire supposedly set by British suffragettes. News cameras documented suffragist Emily Davison's 1913 suicide and her funeral.Sloan, p. 416.Newsreel footage of suffragist Emily Davison's death (1913) Fictional comedies like How Women Win (1911) and Was He a Suffragette (1912) incorporated documentary or newsreel footage of real suffrage demonstrations, as did Votes for Women, the 1912 melodrama produced by suffragists.Stamp, p. 154. Thomas Edison recorded speeches by prominent American suffragists for his Kinetophone, an early system for synchronized sound, in 1913, but the resulting film is lost.  Films by suffragist organizations  Inspired by Suffrage drama and other public performances,Sloan, p. 423. the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and the Women's Political Union (WPU) both produced films featuring suffragist heroines as social reformers who take on corrupt politicians. High-profile suffragists from their respective organizations made appearances in two of these films: Jane Addams and Anna Howard Shaw appeared in NAWSA's Votes for Women (1912), while Emmeline Pankhurst and Harriot Stanton Blatch appeared in WPU's 80 Million Women Want‚Äì? (1913). Chicago suffragists shot and screened footage to show first-time voters how to cast a ballot.Stammp, p. 171. In 1914, NAWSA member Ruth Hanna McCormick released the pro-suffrage melodrama Your Girl and Mine.Sloan, p. 431. But suffragists found filmmaking too expensive to be sustainable and thus stopped making films after this.Image and caption from a New York Tribune article about the pro-suffrage film Your Girl and Mine (1914) = Later silent films, 1915‚Äì1919 = Though suffrage organizations did not make any official films after 1914, early Hollywood studios and filmmakers continued to comment on the campaign for women's suffrage in their films. Dorothy Davenport starred in Mothers of Men (1917), a melodrama that depicted a future where a suffragist holds an important political office. The Woman in Politics (1916), One Law for Both (1917), and Woman (1918) continued to \\"applaud suffragists' long persistent efforts for political equality.\\"Sloan, p. 435. = Historical depictions, 1932‚Äìpresent = In the 1930s, American films began to look back at the campaign for women's suffrage in the U.S. and U.K. Fox Film Corporation released The Cry of the World, a documentary about the devastation of World War I that touched on women's suffrage and prohibition, in 1932. Subsequent historical depictions of women's suffrage included documentaries like This is America (1933), The Golden Twenties (1950), and 50 Years Before Your Eyes (1950); dramas such as The Man Who Dared (1933), Rendezvous (1935), Lillian Russell (1940), and Adventure in Baltimore (1949); musicals like The Shocking Miss Pilgrim (1947) and One Sunday Afternoon (1948); comedies including The Strawberry Blonde (1941) and The First Traveling Saleslady (1956); and westerns like The Lady from Cheyenne (1941), Cattle Queen (1951), and Rails Into Laramie (1954). Laura E. Nym Mayhall has argued that mid-twentieth- century depictions of suffragists like Mrs. Banks in the internationally- distributed blockbuster Mary Poppins (1964) were part of a campaign to soften the history of suffragettes. Twenty-first century films like Iron Jawed Angels (2004) and Suffragette (2015) have reincorporated the radicalism of the British suffrage movement.\\"Iron Jawed Angels Review\\". TV Plex. February 17, 2004.  By country  = Canada = The NAWSA-produced American pro-suffrage film Your Girl and Mine was shown by the Montreal Suffrage Association shortly after its 1914 release.Sloan, p. 434. In 1958, the National Film Board of Canada released Women on the March, a documentary about the women's suffrage movement, women's political activism, and the United Nations. = France = Two of France's legendary film pioneers, Alice Guy-Blach√© and Georges M√©li√®s, each made films on the topic of women's suffrage in the first decade of the twentieth century. Guy-Blach√©'s Les R√©sultats du f√©minisme (1906) depicts a world of gender-role reversal, in which men are sexually harassed by women, while M√©li√®s's For the Cause of Suffrage (1909) and Fire! Fire! Fire! (1911) use gender-role reversal and crossdressing to mock suffragists. = Germany = Color poster for Die Suffragette (1913) Die Suffragette (1913, English: The Suffragette), also released as The Militant Suffragette, starred Asta Nielsen as a British suffragette who becomes involved in a plot to murder a politician. The film was distributed in Germany, America, England, Brazil, and Sweden. = Switzerland = The Divine Order (2017) is a Swiss comedy-drama about the referendum that granted women's suffrage in Switzerland in 1971. = United Kingdom = The earliest comedies about suffragists, The Lady Barber (1898) and Women's Rights (1899), were produced in Britain before the term \\"suffragette\\" was coined. In 1908, British suffragettes invited news cameras to film a demonstration in Hyde Park, resulting in the first nonfiction film footage of the suffrage movement. Britain continued to make both fiction and nonfiction films about and featuring suffragettes, including Mass Meeting of Suffragettes (1910) and Milling the Militants (1913). Suffragettes were frequently featured in films made in other countries as well: \\"The British suffrage movement, which was the most violent, garnered the most interest among filmmakers‚Äîeven fictional scenarios made by studios in other countries, such as Germany, Sweden and the USA, were often set in England to capitalize on the colorful protestors, who embraced the term 'suffragette'.\\" See, for example, Die Suffragette (1913, English: The Suffragette), a German film in which Asta Nielsen plays a British suffragette. The 2015 film Suffragette is a historical drama about the British movement. = United States = American film pioneer Thomas Edison's Edison Studios made early silent films satirizing both suffragists and anti-suffragists. These include The Senator and the Suffragette (1910) and A Suffragette in Spite of Himself (1911). Films like Coon Town Suffragettes (1911) mocked both the suffrage movement and African- Americans. But some American movie makers, especially women, were publicly in favor of suffrage. Mary Pickford was photographed reading a British \\"Votes for Women\\" publication. Women like Lois Weber and Bess Meredyth who worked at Universal Pictures and lived in Universal City, California, the studio's unincorporated community, ran for public office on a \\"suffrage ticket\\" that garnered publicity in 1913. alt= Florence Lawrence participated in the Woman suffrage parade of 1913 on horseback, where she was filmed in Kinemacolor. Screenwriter Frances Marion participated in the October 23, 1915 parade that brought more than 30,000 supporters of women's suffrage onto the streets of New York City. Actress Fan Bourke opened The Princess, a 500-seat \\"votes for women\\" movie theatre, in New Rochelle, New York in late 1915.

Early life John Young grew up on a farm for cattle and sheep in New South Wales. As a boy, he began egg-collecting with his brothers as a hobby. While in his twenties, Young held several jobs, including as an electrician, truck driver, and a fencer. Career In the 1990s, Young created John Young Wildlife Enterprises. The company ran birding tours and also produced wildlife films with the aim of documenting rare species of birds. In 2006, Young claimed to have photographed a new species of parrot in southern Queensland, calling it the blue-fronted fig parrot. A forensic expert suspected that some color of the bird's plumage had been altered, changing its brow from red to blue. Young maintains that he did not alter the colors, stating that he only lightened or darkened parts of the images. Young says he deleted the original photographs of the bird, which were requested by the forensic expert. In 2016, Young was hired as a senior biologist for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC). He resigned from his position in September 2018. =Night parrot controversy= In 2013, Young reported that he had sighted and photographed the night parrot, an endangered Australian bird. Live night parrots had not been definitively documented since 1912, though two dead ones were found in 1991 and 2006. However, the appearance of mesh in one of Young's photos raised questions as to how he was able to get pictures and videos of such a secretive bird. Young denied that he captured the individual, which would have been illegal. In 2019, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy published a report determining that some of Young's supposed observations were not credible. They determined that night parrot calls recorded by Young at Kalamurina Sanctuary were the result of playing publicly available call files near the detector rather than calls from an actual bird. Experts determined that an alleged night parrot nest photographed by Young contained fake eggs made of plaster or clay. As a result of their report, the AWC also retracted Young's findings related to the buff- breasted buttonquail, another endangered Australian bird.

Background After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals immediately began squabbling over his huge empire. Soon it degenerated into open warfare, with each general attempting to claim a portion of Alexander's vast empire. One of the most talented successor generals (Diadochi) was Antigonus Monophthalmus, so called because of an eye he lost in a siege. During the early years of warfare between the Diadochi, he faced Eumenes, a capable general who had already crushed Craterus. After the First War of the Diadochi , the war against Perdiccas, ended in 321 BC, the second partition of the Empire, the Partition of Triparadisus, took place. It stipulated that Antipater became the new regent of the Empire and Antigonus strategos of Asia charged him with hunting down and defeating the remnants of the Perdiccan faction. Antigonus took command of the Royal Army and after being reinforced with more reliable troops from Antipater's European army he moved against their enemies in Asia Minor.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.72. He first marched against Eumenes in Cappadocia but had to leave a substantial force to watch Alketas who was in Pisidia in his rear. Therefore, Antigonos was only able to take 10,000 infantry (half of them Macedonians), 2,000 cavalry and thirty elephants against Eumenes, who had some 20,000 infantry and 5,000 horse.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.75.

Because of his position, Antigonus could give or refuse battle at will. Unbeknownst to Eumenes, Antigonus got in touch with his cavalry officer Apollonides, who was willing to change sides.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XVIII 40,5‚Äì8; Plutarch, Eumenes, 9,2. Battle One day Antigonus drew up his phalanx twice as long as usual, hereby tricked his opponent into thinking he had twice as much infantry as he in fact had, this was combined with the treachery of Apollonides' cavalry. In this way Eumenes' army was put to flight. Not content with this, Antigonus sent his cavalry to capture Eumenes' baggage. There were thus three elements in Antigonus's battle tactics, and the result was a brilliant victory, in which his smaller army slew about 8,000 of the enemyDiodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XVIII 40,8 and most of the rest went over to him.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XVIII 41,1 Aftermath Eumenes escaped with a substantial body of troops, he captured and killed the traitor Apollonides, evaded the pursuit of Antigonus's forces, and doubled back to the battlefield, where he buried his dead. Eventually Antigonus caught up with Eumenes, who was forced to take refuge in a stronghold called Nora with his closest followers, some 600‚Äì700 in number.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.77. There Antigonus invested him closely, but the fortress was well stocked and virtually impregnable. Antigonus left the siege of Nora to a subordinate and marched with the bulk of his army to deal with the remaining Perdiccans: Alketas, Polemon, Dokimos and Attalos.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XVIII 44, 1‚Äì2.

The palace was one of the first renaissance buildings in the middle of Germany. Today, there is only one wing remaining, the 'Johannbau, which offers room to the City History Museum of Dessau. A four winged palace was constructed in the start of the 16th century on the place of burnt down castle. Under the architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff the palace was changed into an 18th-century three-winged palace. The palace was heavily damaged during the Second World War, and its ruins were largely demolished in the times of the DDR. Only one wing, the Johannbau, is remaining. After restorations between 1990 and 1997, and between 2001 and 2005, the Johannbau has been opened for the public and houses now the museum for the history of Dessau.

(born 8 April 1949 in Louren√ßo Marques) is a Mozambican human rights activist and president of the Mozambique Human Rights League.  Life  = Youth = Maria Alice Mabota was born in 1949 in the Miss√£o Jos√© mission, current Hospital Geral Jos√© Macamo. Typically, families with so- called \\"indigenous\\" status - as was the family of Mabota - did not register children immediately at birth. For this reason, her age was estimated in comparison of physiognomy with other children. Mabota occasionally lived with her father in Machava 15. The first elementary school attended by Mabota at the Miss√£o de S√£o Roque Mission Station in Matutu√≠ne, about 100 kilometers from the capital. However, as usual for Mozambicans with \\"indigenous\\" status, they were only able to complete elementary school there. At times, she also lived with her uncle on the opposite side of the capital, in Catembe. There Mabota was also baptized in 1966. = Further education = In 1967/68, Mabota's mother came from the South African underground, where she had reportedly worked for the Mozambican FRELIMO Liberation Front. Mabota's mother insisted that her daughter continued to pursue her education. Then she went to the secondary school in the evening and worked during the day as a cleaner in various institutions.Alice Mabota In 1973 she began working at the Instituto de Investiga√ß√£o Agron√≥mica of the Colonial Agricultural Authority (the later Ministry of Agriculture), but left this work in 1980 due to personal differences. She rejected a job offer of the Mozambican secret service Servi√ßos de Informa√ß√£o e Seguran√ßa do Estado (SISE). She finished her seventh grade at the Francisco Manyanga secondary school, her ninth grade at the Josina Machel secondary school in central Maputo. As a result, she obtained her access to a higher education, but could not bring herself to study medicine - since she did not want to see any corpses, according to her own statement - nor international relations, - since she could not speak English or French. She then gave Portuguese lessons at the secondary school Francisco Manyanga for the time being, when David Simango was head of the school. Later, she worked at the Patroc√≠nio e Assist√™ncia Jur√≠dica (IPAJ) and at the state realty administration Administra√ß√£o do Parque Imobili√°rio do Estado (APIE). = Founding of the Human Rights League = A major change in Mabota's life was in 1993 when she attended a Vienna Conference on Human Rights, where she stayed for 45 days. This motivated her to be very committed to human rights in Mozambique. Back in Vienna in 1995, together with other Mozambican activists and intellectuals, she founded the Liga dos Direitos Humanos de Mo√ßambique, in English \\"Human Rights League\\", based on the Guinea-Bissau model. Alice Mabota talking with Douglas Griffiths, US ambassador to Mozambique from 2012 to 2016. Since then Alice Mabota has chaired the Human Rights League and has established herself as one of Mozambique's civil society most popular voices . Especially in the 2010s, she criticized the increasing polarization of Mozambican politics between FRELIMO and RENAMO. The Human Rights League, along with other organizations of Mozambican civil society, organized several protest marches for peace, equality and against corruption in the Mozambican capital. In the course of this, she received numerous death threats and also public insults, which are attributed to the radical FRELIMO wing. The Mozambican criminal police also interrogated her, as she was accused of presidential defamation. In 2010, Mabota received the United States government-sponsored International Women of Courage Award.However, the US Department of State does not cite her as a laureate, but many (independent) sources report the award ceremony at the US Embassy in Maputo, Mozambique. In 2014, Mabota temporarily considered running for the presidential election, but eventually withdrew. She eventually decided to run for president in the 2019 elections.

The theorem can also be thought of as a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem  Theorem  For a triangle \\\\triangle ABC with sides a, b, c consider three lines, which are perpendicular to the triangle sides and intersect in a common point F. If P_a, P_b, P_c are the pedal points of those three perpendiculars on the sides a, b, c, then the following equation holds: : AP_c^2+BP_a^2+CP_b^2=BP_c^2+CP_a^2+AP_b^2 The converse of the statement above is true as well, that is if the equation holds for the pedal points of three perpendiculars on the three triangle sides then they intersect in a common point. Therefore, the equation provides a necessary and sufficient condition.  Special cases  If the triangle \\\\triangle ABC has a right angle in C and the intersection point F is located on either A or B, then the equation above yields the Pythagorean theorem. For instance if F coincides with A then this yields AP_b=0, AP_c=0, CP_a=0, CP_b=b, BP_a=a and BP_c=c. Therefore, the equation above transforms into the Pythagorean theorem a^2 + b^2 =c^2. Another corollary is the property of perpendicular bisectors of a triangle to intersect in a common point. In the case of perpendicular bisectors you have AP_c = BP_c, BP_a = CP_a and CP_b = AP_b and therefore the equation above holds. which means all three perpendicular bisectors intersect in the same point.

During the Russian colonization of Budzhak, the Gagauz people moved there, however they started to stabilize their presence in the future territory of the Republic of Moldova. They are not distributed equally in the territory of Moldova. They live primarily in south Moldova, particularly in the autonomous territorial unit of Gagauzia. They follow a primarily rural lifestyle.  Population  Their share in the ethnic composition of the country gradually increases. They compose the majority of Gagauzia's population (83.8%), while in Taraclia District, which is inhabited primarily by Bulgarians, they compose the 9,0% of the total population. In Bessarabsky District they compose the 7,4% of the district's population, but their share gradually decreases here. In Cahul district, they have a small presence (2,7% of the district's population). In the rest of Moldova their share is lower than 1%. The internal migration of Gagauz in Moldova is low. The most Gagauz who leave Gagauzia migrate in Russia.  Ethnolinguistic features  Due to their concentration in the areas around the border between Moldova and Ukraine, modern Gagauz people marry primarily with other Gagauz; thus keeping a high degree of ethnic stability. However, in the recent past, the situation was somewhat different. In the early 20th century, the ratio of Gagauz and Bulgarians in the population of Comrat was approximately 2:1. In the late 20th century, due to assimilation and higher fertility rates within the Gagauz, the ratio was 1:14. Nowadays, similar ratios between Gagauz and Bulgarians are preserved in some villages. For practical reasons, a contemporary Gagauz usually speaks at least two languages. In their daily life they use Gagauz and Russian, but many can speak Romanian as well.

It is the band's second studio album and third overall release under the name SWMRS after changing their name in late 2014. The album has been described as more mature and politically charged than the band's previous records. The album sees the band embrace wider musical influences including hip-hop and grime. Background The band started recording the album in early 2018 with producer Rich Costey who has previously worked with artists such as Muse, Franz Ferdinand, Jane's Addiction, Frank Turner, Death Cab for Cutie, Biffy Clyro and At the Drive-In. The first song to be released from the album was the title track \\"Berkeley's on Fire\\" which was released as a single on August 17, 2018. The song was inspired by an incident in early 2017 where \\"150 masked agitators\\" rioted at UC Berkeley over a planned appearance from British polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos. The release of the track coincided with the band announcing the third of their \\"Uncool Halloween\\" festival performances.

Critical reception  Berkeley's on Fire received almost unanimous praise upon release with critics praising the band's maturity and improvement since their previous record. Neil Z. Yeung with AllMusic compared the albums use of \\"cool grooves and jangly bounce\\" to English musician Rat Boy. Yeung also described the album as sounding \\"like a band that's hitting their stride with a catchy blend of punk-indebted styles delivered with the conviction of a more seasoned act.\\" Stephen Ackroyd from Dork described the song \\"Lose, Lose Lose\\" as being \\"Mentos in Diet Coke levels of explosive.\\" Jake Richardson from Kerrang! praised the album's diversity from \\"the riffy, Hives-esque rock of Hellboy, Bad Allergies' acoustic tenderness\\" to \\"the all-out mania of Lose Lose Lose.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.

On April 9, 1863, the Russian Emperor signed the Charter of the first Saint-Petersburg Society of Mutual credit. On March 17, 1864, the Society started operating. Now small Russian traders were saved the need to take loans from foreign banks. The first Society of mutual credit had triggered similar organizations throughout the empire.

But it had soon turned out that the places they occupied were not enough for keeping financial papers and assets. In 1887 the Board suggested that the General Assembly give them a loan of 500,000 Rubles to construct a building for the Society. The construction was charged with Count Paul-Jules de Suzor. The Assembly commissioned a Board member Mikhail Nikitich Kobyzev (Michel Kobyseff) and Count Suzor to Europe in order to study the organization of bank and credit. Upon their return, Suzor's project was approved and the construction was supervised by Kobyzev. In 1890 the Society moved into the new building. The new building was organized by the most advanced trends in banking of that time. From the European trip, Kobyzev brought the idea of safe-deposit boxes, which was successfully implemented in Russia. The deposit boxes turned out to be so popular that the Society had to rent more places in order to set up new ones.

It harvests some of the most durable and productive wind resources in the country, and became the second largest wind generating facility in the state upon completion of the first two construction phases in early 2017. The facility allowed the Kansas City Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to obtain more than 45% of its electricity needs from renewable sources. Details The project was developed by the Kansas-based firm Tradewind Energy, which previously built a strategic partnership with the Italian-controlled firm Enel Green Power North America (EGPNA) that resulted in the construction of several wind farms throughout the state, including the Smoky Hills Wind Farm. The electricity and tax credits from the first 200 MW phase are contracted with Google Inc., and those from the second 200 MW phase are contracted with the Kansas City BPU. A third 200 MW phase is also planned for development. The facility spans about 60,000 acres of farm and grazing land in the southwest region of the state near the town of Minneola. It includes 200 Vestas V110-2.0 MW wind turbines for which many components were manufactured in Colorado. Construction of the facility started in April 2016 and employed about 350 local workers. Phase I was completed year end 2016 and phase II in late March 2017. The ongoing operation and maintenance activities employ about 15 people. Construction was financed by Enel Green Power North America Renewable Energy Partners, an equally owned joint venture between EGPNA and GE Capital‚Äôs Energy Financial Services. EGPNA obtained further investor financing through tax equity agreements with other U.S. financial institutions including Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Chase, and MetLife. In early 2019, EGPNA acquired Tradewind Energy and its portfolio of future projects under development. It also purchased GE's interest in their joint venture facilities, including the operating Cimmaron Bend Wind Farm.

Mai-Mai groups are militia unique to the eastern DRC, formed ostensibly to defend villages from attacks from Rwandan forces and Rwandan backed rebel groups. However, Mai-Mai groups have been accused of sexual violence, looting, and fighting all sides including fellow militias, the DRC army, and even the United Nations. The NDC was formed in 2009 by former minerals trader Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, an ethnic Nyanga. Sheka claims the group was formed to liberate the mines of Walikale Territory in North Kivu. According to the UN, Sheka commanded a mass rape of at least 387 women, men, and children over a three day span in Walikale in 2010. This was said to be a punishment for the villagers collaborating with Congo government forces. In 2011, Sheka was added to a United Nations Security Council sanctions list and a warrant was issued for his arrest in the DRC. In 2017, Sheka surrendered to the DRC in North Kivu. As of April 2019, his trial is still on-going. The UN Security Council has documented numerous cases of the NDC recruiting child soldiers. According to a 2014 report, at least 33 children separated from the group. They said their roles included carrying ammunition and acting as talisman, as well as \\"combatants, cooks, marijuana farmers and tax collectors.\\" The children were held to the group through a mixture of threats to their family or the payment of $10‚Äì12 per month.

It was shortly found to have spread from several species of birds from several countries worldwide to humans between mid 1929 and early 1930. Diagnosed by its clinical features and link to birds, it affected around 750 to 800 people globally, with a mortality of 15%. Its mode of transmission to humans by mouth-to-beak contact or inhaling dried bird secretions and droppings was not known at the time. The cause, Chlamydia psittaci, which usually remains dormant in birds until activated by stress of capture and confinement, was discovered after the pandemic. Cases were reported in mid 1929, in Birmingham, United Kingdom, and linked to parrots from Buenos Aires, Argentina, where an ongoing outbreak of the disease had led to cautioning bird owners to declare their sick parrots. The origin of the outbreak in the Argentine city of C√≥rdoba was traced to an import of 5,000 parrots from Brazil. Although the Argentine parrot trade was stopped, a number of birds were illegally sold on to visitors to its seaports, with the consequence that psittacosis was transmitted to several countries. In November 1929, reports of cases among an Argentine theatrical group in C√≥rdoba made it into the local press. In January 1930, when cases of an atypical pneumonia in one family, with the death of their parrot, appeared in Maryland, United States, a link was made to the story of the theatrical group, and \\"parrot fever\\" made headlines in the American press. Following further cases, bans on parrot trades were implemented, and subsequently cases were reported in several other countries, including Germany, France and Australia. The origin was understood to have been the importation of green Amazon parrots from South America. Later, the principal source of the disease in the U.S. was domestic lovebirds raised in Californian aviaries, and sold to mainly housewives and widows. The impact of the outbreak on the U.S. Hygienic Laboratory, with 16 of its workers affected, including two deaths, led to the formation of the National Institute of Health. Background In 1880, physician Jakob Ritter described a cluster of seven people with atypical pneumonia connected to his brother's household in Germany. The outbreak was at the time not linked to sick exotic birds: 12 finches and parrots confined in the study of the house in Uster, Switzerland. Three of the seven affected people died, including Ritter's brother and the metal-worker who visited the home to fix the bird cage. Ritter detailed the natural history of the disease, and, noting its similar features to typhoid and typhus, he called the disease \\"pneumotyphus\\" and proposed that the birds might be the vectors. Subsequently, further similar outbreaks with a coincidence of exposure to birds appeared in other parts of Europe, including Paris in the 1890s, where it killed one in three affected people. The outbreaks ended following bans in bird trading. Subsequently, greater efforts were made to find the cause of the disease, but without success. The disease in birds was named psittacosis in 1895 by Antonin Morange. Prior to the 1929 outbreak of psittacosis in the United States, the last known cases were in 1917, found in captive birds in the basement of a department store in Pennsylvania. The causative pathogen, C. psittaci, was not discovered until the 1960s. Origin and global spread alt= alt= There were multiple origins, involving several countries and several species of birds. Affected people typically experienced headache, poor sleep, fatigue and a cough trailing several days of fever. Some subsequently became delirious and semi-conscious, after which some died, and others recovered with a prolonged convalescent period. Initial outbreaks were linked to exotic birds from South America. The source of the C√≥rdoba outbreak was traced to an import of 5,000 parrots from Brazil. The birds had been confined in unsanitary and crowded containers. Although the Argentine parrot trade was stopped, a number of birds were sold on to visitors to its seaports, and psittacosis, also known as parrot fever, was transmitted to several countries. Its mode of transmission to humans by mouth-to-beak contact or inhaling dried bird secretions and droppings was not known at the time. Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States were the most severely affected with more than 100 cases each. Implicated birds included green Amazon parrots, canaries, lovebirds and shell parakeets. By early 1930, the disease was reported in humans in several countries around the world, accelerated by the popular hobby of domestic bird-keeping at the time. Many cases and clusters had links with sick parrots. Around 750 to 800 people were affected. The average mortality was 15%, with a total of more than 100 deaths. The majority of cases in the U.S. were found in 1931 to be linked to endemic psittacosis in California, associated with the increasingly popular trade of breeding lovebirds for sale chiefly to housewives and widows. Africa =Algiers= In Algiers, four deaths were attributed to the disease in the week ending 8 February 1930. The following week, three further cases were reported. Europe When cases appeared in Amsterdam, Netherlands Health Department asked that steamships that call at South American seaports refuse to take on board parrots. =Germany= Cases in Germany were reported, with some uncertainty, from July 1929, in Berlin, Hamburg, Liegnitz, Munich, Glauchau and D√¥beln. It resulted in the banning of the importation of parrots. By the end of the pandemic in early 1930, Germany had the largest number of cases, with 215 affected, of which 45 died. Parrot-owners were found abandoning their birds at the Berlin zoo, and in response the zoo closed its gates.Meyer, K. F. (1934) Recent Studies on Psttacosis. American Journal of Public Health. George Williams Hooper Foundation, University of California, and California State Department of Public Health, San Francisco, California. pp. 571‚Äì579 Of 35 parakeets involved in the German cases, 30 had no disease. =United Kingdom= Cases were reported in Birmingham, United Kingdom, in mid 1929. In December 1929, a ship's carpenter attended the London Hospital with a typhoid-like illness. He had previously purchased two parrots from Buenos Aires, which had died en route to London. By March 1930, 100 suspected cases were reported across the UK. One case was linked to a visit to a pub, where there was noted to be a sick parrot.Psittacosis; Ministry of Health Report. The British Medical Journal. 13 December 1930, pp. 10018-1019 Research into the cause was commenced by Samuel Bedson at the London Hospital. In the UK, the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930 was created following consideration by the permanent committee of the Office international d'hygi√®ne publique. It prohibited the trade of parrots unless for research. North America In 1929, around 500,000 canaries and nearly 50,000 parrots were imported to the United States from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Cuba, Trinidad, Salvador, Mexico and Japan. Most birds entered the U.S. via New York, except budgerigars, which entered via San Francisco and Los Angeles. =Early January 1930= In early January 1930, an outbreak of \\"mysterious pneumonias\\" in the United States came to media attention when cases in three members of one family were traced to the previous Christmas importation of parrots from South America. 10 days before Christmas, Simon Martin, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Annapolis, Maryland, bought a parrot in Baltimore for his wife, who subsequently, along with their daughter and son- in-law, became seriously ill. Their new parrot's feathers had become dirty and ruffled by Christmas Eve, and on Christmas Day it died. The wife of the family physician made a link to a newspaper article about \\"parrot fever\\" in Buenos Aires. In consequence, Martin's physician sent a telegram to the United States Public Health Service (PHS) in Washington DC, requesting for advice on parrot fever. The story came to the attention of Surgeon General Hugh S. Cumming, who received similar messages from Baltimore, New York, Ohio and California. The task of solving the cause of parrot fever was signposted to George W. McCoy, the director of PHS's Hygienic Laboratory and a renowned bacteriologist who had discovered tularaemia, and his deputy, Charlie Armstrong, neither of whom had ever heard of parrot fever. On 8 January 1930, The Washington Post reported \\"parrot disease baffles experts\\" and headlines of \\"Parrot Fever Hits Trio at Annapolis\\". On the same day, the outbreak made headlines in the Los Angeles Times with \\"two women and man in Annapolis believed to have 'parrot fever'\\". On 11 January, the same paper reported \\"Parrot Disease Fatal to Seven\\", and the Chicago Daily Tribune put on their front page \\"Baltimore woman dies\\". By 15 January, 50 cases were reported nationwide. The following day, the Baltimore Sun announced that \\"Woman's Case Brings Parrot Victims to 19\\". During this time, one of the first deaths was particularly alarming. The victim was a woman in Toledo, Ohio, who had been given three Cuban parrots by her husband. Cumming warned to stay away from imported parrots, whilst sailors at sea were ordered by one U.S. Navy admiral to throw overboard their parrots. Some were encouraged by one health commissioner to kill their pet parrots, and some abandoned them on the streets. Reports soon began to follow from the eastern coast of the U. S., with Baltimore, New York City and Los Angeles, involving other birds such as shell parakeets (Australian budgerigars). The director of the Bureau of Communicable Diseases, Daniel S. Hatfield, ordered the confiscation of all birds at Baltimore pet stores. =Late January 1930= Six major pet dealers in the U.S. stood to make a loss of $5 million per year as a result of an executive order issued by President Herbert Hoover on 24 January prohibiting \\"the immediate importation of parrots into the United States, its possessions and dependencies from any foreign port\\", until research could find the cause and mode of transmission. This decision came following Armstrong's initial research, which showed that healthy parrots being infected by sick ones and that some could become asymptomatic carriers. The following day, Armstrong's assistant, Henry \\"Shorty\\" Anderson, became ill. =February 1930= Henry \\"Shorty\\" Anderson (right) Two of the 16 people that developed the illness from exposure at the National Hygiene Laboratory died, including, on 8 February, Anderson. The following day, bacteriologist William Royal Stokes died, only weeks after commencing research on the parrot dropping samples given to him by Armstrong. By this time, Armstrong was ill himself but survived. They had failed to isolate the causative infectious agent, and McCoy was subsequently forced to kill the birds and fumigate the Hygienic Laboratory. =Later= 43 of the 74 foci in the U.S. were traced to contact with Amazon parrots. Links were traced to Japan, Caribbean, Germany, Central America and South America. Between November 1929 and May 1930, the U.S. recorded 169 cases, of which 33 died. New York was the centre of the East Coast bird trade. However, the principal ports of entry for Australian budgerigars was San Francisco and Los Angeles. Later, it was discovered that the main source was domestic lovebirds raised in hundreds of independent Californian aviaries by breeders who were supplementing their incomes following the recent Wall Street Crash. The winter of 1929 was also witnessing an influenza epidemic and there were fears of a recurrence of Spanish flu,which added to the depressive effects. In this context, peddlers travelled door-to-door with ‚Äúlovebirds‚Äù for housewives and widows. As a result, most victims in the U.S. were women. The realisation and connections of the various outbreaks may not have become apparent had it not been for the press. Likewise, the \\"hysteria\\" and heightened public concern surrounding the pandemic may not have occurred had it not been for headlines such as ‚ÄúKilled By A Pet Parrot.‚Äù The establishment of the National Institutes of Health is directly linked to the outbreak that occurred in Maryland. Its story was retold in Paul de Kruif's, Men Against Death (1933). South America Florencio Parravicini 1913 The first reports of the disease were recorded in July 1929, in C√≥rdoba, Argentina. During the summer and autumn of 1929, C√≥rdoba and Tucum√°n in Argentina, reported over 100 cases of a severe atypical pneumonia linked to a large shipment of birds from Brazil. One of the outbreaks occurred among an Argentine theatrical group in October 1929, after they had purchased an Amazon parrot in Buenos Aires. Two of the actors died from the illness. Florencio Parravicini, the main male actor, contracted the disease and according to the Hearst, recovered after suffering significantly for 17 days. Cases in Argentina followed a number of auctions that took place in several cities, with owners selling a number of sick birds as quickly as possible. In response, the Argentine parrot trade was stopped and pet owners were cautioned by authorities to look out for sick birds and report them. However, dishonest traders continued to sell sick birds to visitors to its seaports. The cases were reported in an Argentinian journal in November 1929 and later picked up by sensational American press. Countries affected There were no reported cases in Brazil. The disease was reported in: *Algeria *Argentina *Australia *Austria *Canada *Czechoslovakia *Denmark *Egypt *France *Germany *Honolulu *Italy *Japan *Mexico *Netherlands *Poland *Spain *Sweden *Switzerland *United Kingdom *United States Birds involved Meyer later demonstrated that psittacosis could be transmitted by around 50 species of birds.

Described as \\"the noblest, fairest, and bravest of Timur‚Äôs descendants\\", Bayqara Mirza is best known for his rebellions against his uncle/stepfather Shah Rukh. He also had an interest in the arts, a trait inherited by his famous grandson and partial namesake Sultan Husayn Bayqara of Herat. Background Bayqara Mirza was born 1392 and was the youngest son of Umar Shaikh Mirza I by his wife, the Mongol princess Malikat Agha. His father, the eldest of the four sons of Timur, died in 1394 when Bayqara was about two years old. His mother, a daughter of the Khan of Moghulistan, Khizr Khoja, was subsequently remarried to Umar Shaikh's younger brother Shah Rukh. Rebellions When Timur died in 1405, Bayqara and his brothers were duty-bound to support their stepfather's bid for the throne in the ensuing dynastic struggle. However, within a few years of the latter's victory, Bayqara's brother Iskandar Mirza revolted, proclaiming himself Sultan in Isfahan in 1412. Shah Rukh led an expedition against his stepson, with Bayqara and another brother, Rustam, in his baggage train. After a short siege, Iskandar was captured and blinded. His former lands were partitioned between his siblings, with Bayqara being given an area which included Hamadan, Nahavand and Kurdistan, as well as custody of his rebellious elder brother. Bayqara Mirza himself launched two unsuccessful rebellions against Shah Rukh, the first being in Fars in 1414. The second was instigated when Sa'd-i Waqqas, son of Bayqara's late cousin Muhammad Sultan, defected to the Qara Qoyunlu in the spring of 1415. Taking advantage of the disturbance caused by this, Bayqara was persuaded by Iskandar to declare independence. The latter was soon apprehended and executed by Rustam, though Bayqara himself continued in his campaign. His forces, burgeoned by nobles who had been loyal to Iskandar, met those of Shah Rukh's son Ibrahim Sultan outside the city of Shiraz. Bayqara routed his cousin's army and was welcomed into the city, having enjoyed support among the populace. In preparation for his stepfather's inevitable retaliation, the prince quickly organised paramilitary forces as well as an armed cavalry of five thousand. When the emperor's army arrived outside Shiraz, the inhabitants lost confidence and asked Bayqara to surrender in order to save the city from destruction, to which he relented in December 1415. Shah Rukh withdrew his forces, though several nobles loyal to his stepsons were executed. Bayqara himself was spared, though only through the intercession of his cousin and friend Baysunghur. Instead, he was exiled to Qandahar, to live under the surveillance of another relation, Qaidu son of Pir Muhammad. Later life There is uncertainty regarding the events of the remainder of Bayqara's life. One version states that he joined Qaidu in starting another rebellion, while another narrates that he had rebelled against Qaidu. Both accounts conclude with Bayqara being captured by the emperor and being sent to Samarqand. Alternatively, the historian Daulatshah said that the prince went voluntarily to Shah Rukh's camp in 1416, from where he was dispatched to his cousin Ulugh Beg, who later had him poisoned. However, the historian Fasih states that a man thought to be Bayqara was caught by Shah Rukh's men in Khorasan in 1422. After being questioned about his identity, the man was executed, despite uncertainty about whether he really was the prince. There are some thoughts that the confusion regarding Bayqara's death were a result of Shah Rukh's reluctance to receive blame for it from his wife, the prince's mother Malikat Agha, who had already lost two of her sons by that point. There are also suggestions of intrigue against Bayqara and his brothers by the emperor's chief consort Gawhar Shad.

Starting from the Middle Ages the permanent residence of the nobility in the region gradually declined, which caused the disappearance of their noble cuisine over time. As the common people suffered from poverty, their culinary tradition adapted to use cheap and simple foods. Bread, vegetables and pasta have the leading role in the cuisine. Fruits, fish and wine are consumed frequently as well, but meat plays a minor role. The food of Apulia is known as a prime example of cucina povera or 'cuisine of the poor', but this characterizes its simplicity rather than its quality. More so, the plain dishes allow the quality of their local and seasonal ingredients to take center stage.  History  After the period of Magna Graecia, Apulia never had political autonomy. It was always a peripheral region of a larger state. From the Middle Ages until the Italian unification in the 19th century Apulia was controlled by the Kingdom of Naples and later the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. It was governed from Naples in Campania, the capital of both kingdoms. The nobility, which owned large tracts of land in Apulia, preferred to live in Naples. If they spent any time in Apulia, it was for brief inspections of their properties and the collection of profits. As a consequence the cuisine of the nobility started to disappear in Apulia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The cuisine of the monasteries, which were present in large numbers in Apulia, never became part of the local tradition. As charitable institutions which supported the poor, the food they served them was limited to soups. Because of these factors, the cuisine of common people defines the gastronomy of Apulia. Historically Apulia was a poor region, which meant that ingredients had to be affordable, local and seasonal. Due to this frugality vegetables attained an important role. Dishes are plain and simple, without elaborate preparations. The food of Apulia is often characterized as peasant food or cucina povera, the 'cuisine of the poor'. In spite of this, the dishes are richer and more complex than the number of ingredients and the simplicity of the cooking methods would suggest. The first cookbook on Apulian cuisine was Il Libro della Cocina from 1504, which covered the cooking of the nobility. It contains some recipes which are not Apulian, but which became part of the local tradition over time. This demonstrates that Apulians were eager to adopt cooking practices from other regions and integrate them into their own cuisine. In modern times Apulian cuisine distinguishes between appetizers, first and second courses. Separate courses are a relatively new addition to the cuisine, because in the past a meal used to consist of a single dish. Many dishes now served as appetizers were inspired by single dishes which made up an entire meal. Some dishes which are now served as first courses can still be quite filling and rich in ingredients, which reflect their use as a single dish for the entire meal.  Ingredients and dishes  = Snacks and appetizers = Panzerotto is a turnover, traditionally deep- fried and often filled with mozzarella and tomato. Focaccia Barese with tomatoes and olives. Many foods which are eaten as a snack or appetizer are based on bread. The puccia (plural pucce) is a small, flat and round bread which may or may not have olives mixed through its dough. The version with olives is eaten as is, but the version without olives is sliced open and stuffed with many kinds of vegetables, meat or seafood. The panzerotto is a turnover filled with various stuffings. A combination of tomatoes and mozzarella is popular. They are similar to the calzone of Naples, but are smaller and use a softer dough. They can be baked in the oven like calzone, but deep frying is traditional. Focaccia Barese is a local variation of focaccia originating from Bari, which is covered with tomatoes, oregano and optionally olives, with olive oil drizzled on top. The rustico which is popular in the area of Lecce doesn't use bread but puff pastry as a base. The pastry is filled with b√©chamel sauce, mozzarella and tomato sauce and then baked in the oven. Scagliozzi may be the only popular way to eat polenta in Apulia. Polenta is prepared normally and then allowed to cool and dry. It is then cut in slices and deep fried. Pettole are deep-fried croquettes made from a liquid batter of flour with yeast, which may include boiled potatoes. There are both flavoured versions with small pieces of fish or vegetables and sweet versions. Taralli are popular toroidal crackers made with flour, olive oil, white wine and salt along with other ingredients. The classical version uses fennel seeds, but they come in many variations and can be savoury or sweet. They are eaten as is or dunked in wine. = Bread = Pane di Altamura is bread made entirely of durum flour. Bread is a very important part of the Apulian diet. The vast majority of wheat cultivated in Puglia is durum wheat, with minimal production of common wheat. For this reason many types of bread are made entirely or partially with durum wheat. The most highly regarded breads are Pane di Altamura, Pane di Laterza and Pane di Monte Sant'Angelo. Pane di Altamura was granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status in the European Union (EU) and is made entirely with durum wheat flour, just like Pane di Laterza. Pane di Monte Sant'Angelo stands out because it is traditionally made with only common wheat flour. Frisella is a bread with a long shelf life, making it a suitable alternative to fresh bread. It has a toroidal shape with a hole in the center, which facilitated stringing them together for storage and transport. The dough is made with either wheat, durum or barley flour. After a first stage of baking in the oven, the friselle is cut horizontally and then baked in the oven again until they are completely dry. Before consumption the friselle is soaked in water until it is still crisp but not mushy. It is then eaten with a variety of toppings. Instead of disposing of stale bread, Apulians have invented many dishes to make it palatable. Cialledda, also called aquasale, is one of these. After soaking bread in water to soften it, it is combined with tomatoes, olive oil and salt. The dish pancotto is similar, but more elaborate with more ingredients. Stale bread is also used to make dry breadcrumbs which can be used a garnish for several dishes. = Cheese = Pallone di Gravina is an aged cow's milk cheese. The cheese from Apulia which is most popular internationally is the fresh cheese burrata. This cheese consists of an outer shell of mozzarella which is filled with stracciatella and cream. Only burrata di Andria is protected under the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status by the EU, so the generic name is also used for burrata produced outside Apulia. The PDO cheeses of Apulia are the aged caciocavallo Silano, canestrato Pugliese and fresh mozzarella di bufala Campana. Other cheeses include caciocavallo podolico, cacioricotta Pugliese, pallone di Gravina and several varieties of ricotta, of which ricotta forte has an especially strong flavor. = Fruit = Just like other regions in Southern Italy, olive oil is the principal cooking fat. While table olives are now frequently served as appetizers, they were even more important in the past as they were often the only available food next to bread. Apulia is Italy's largest producer of olive oil and table olives, with many local varieties. No less than five of these oils and one table olive, respectively the Collina di Brindisi, Dauno, Terra di Bari, Terra d'Otranto, Terre Tarentine and La Bella della Daunia, are protected under the PDO status. Many different sweet fruits are enjoyed as a dessert at the end of a meal. The arancia del Gargano and clementine del Golfo di Taranto are respectively an orange and clementine which enjoy PDO status. The limone femminello del Gargano is a lemon which was granted PGI status. The fruit of the prickly pear cactus which dots the countryside is consumed as well. = Soups = Soups are especially popular as winter dishes, with a main role for vegetables along with legumes and short pasta shapes. Bread is often included as well, either on the side or included in the soup. The bread dishes cialledda and pancotto may also be prepared in the form of a soup if a vegetable broth is added. A soup from the Salento is called cecamariti, literally meaning 'blinding the husband'. The dish received its name from its impressive appearance, which conceals its easy preparation. There are also fish soups, which feature a rich broth due to the addition of small fish with bones included. = Pasta = Orecchiette is the emblematic pasta shape of Apulia. Eggs are an essential ingredient for pasta in Northern Italy, but in Apulia and other regions of Southern Italy only semolina and water is used. This was done mainly for economic reasons, because eggs were considered too valuable for an everyday dish like pasta. Omitting eggs from pasta dough allowed their use in other dishes. Orechiette is considered the signature pasta shape of Apulia, but there are many other shapes as well. These include cavatelli, capunti (typical of the Murgia plateau), troccoli (from the Daunia), lagane and sagne. Orrechiette is frequently combined with fried cime di rape in orrechiette con le cime di rape. Next to the familiar combinations of pasta with tomato sauces, meat and seafood, there are some typically Apulian pairings with vegetables. For example, the dish ciceri e tria uses chickpeas and lagane con pur√© di fave uses broad bean puree. Pasta can also be made with grano arso, 'burnt grain'. In the past the remaining ears of grains would be gathered from the grain fields after the grain harvest, when the grain stubbles were burnt to clear the field. While this used to be done out of extreme poverty or frugality, pasta made with grano arso is now considered a delicacy. = Vegetables = The broad bean and the cime di rape are the typical vegetables of Apulia. The broad bean has been the staple food in the region for thousands of years. In its dried and split form it is the main ingredient of the famous dish fave e cicoria. Other frequently used vegetables include fennel, zucchini, artichoke, bell pepper, cauliflower, eggplant, wild leaf chicory, the cardoncello mushroom and broccoli. The carciofo Brindisino and lenticchia di Altamura are respectively artichokes and lentils which have attained the PGI status from the EU. Many vegetables are preserved with the sott'olio method, meaning 'under the oil'. First vegetables are boiled in white wine vinegar. After they are combined with spices and herbs they are placed in jars. The vegetables are then covered by filling the jar with olive oil, so that they are not in contact with air. This allows the vegetables to be preserved for up to year and also enhances their flavor. Lampascioni preserved sott'olio in olive oil. Apulian cooking also uses some less widely known vegetables. The tassel hyacinth grows widespread in the wild and is used for its bulb. Known as lampascioni in Apulia, these are usually boiled in water and seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, salt and black pepper. They can also be grilled or deep-fried. The black chickpea (ceci neri) was consumed more often before the 1950s, but production dropped as it was replaced by more profitable crops and legumes with shorter cooking times. Today production is centered in the Murgia plateau. Because they have a stronger taste than the white variety, they are often just boiled in water and served with oil, possibly combined with a small type of pasta. The grass pea (cicerchia) used to be popular in cookbooks of the 1600s, but has since fallen out of favor because the plant provides a limited yield. In recent times the crop has been rediscovered and is cultivated in the Alta Murgia and the Salento. It is used in soups and stews. = Seafood = Scapece from Gallipoli is fried fish preserved in red wine vinegar with breadcrumbs and saffron. Because it is a peninsula, Apulia has a long coastline and the sea is never far away. This has made seafood an important part of its cuisine. The large variety of seafood that is available includes sea bream, octopus, prawns, oysters, anchovies, mussels and clams. The region has been compared with Japan for its love of raw fish. One of the more popular dishes is tiella, a slow-cooked dish layered with rice, potatoes and mussels. This version originates from Bari, but there is plenty of local variation in the recipe, with different versions originating from Foggia, Taranto and the Salento. Some of these don't even include seafood. Scapece is a fish dish from Gallipoli, Apulia which is notable for its Middle Eastern origin and preservation method. Similar to escabeche, fish is fried and then preserved in red wine vinegar with breadcrumbs and saffron to greatly extend its shelf life. Some dishes use dried and salted cod (baccal√†), one of the very few imported ingredients. = Meat = In the past meat was a scarcity due to its expense. For this reason, it is not an important component of the cuisine of Apulia. Beef was lacking almost entirely from the diet in the past, because cattle was used for farm work or reared for milk. It was slaughtered only when it was very old. Likewise, the prevalence of horse meat is explained by the slaughter of lame horses which were no longer able to work. Lamb, poultry and rabbit (often reared on farms) and to a lesser degree game were the main sources of meat. A farm used to raise a single pig, of which every part would be used when it was slaughtered. Some of its meat would be consumed directly, but most of it would be preserved as ham, sausages and salami. The Apulian recipe for rag√π differs from the version prepared in other Italian regions. Traditionally it uses sun- dried tomato pulp (conserva) as a base, which is then fried in olive oil with some water, fresh tomatoes and optionally chili pepper and red wine. Then meat roulades (braciole or involtini) are added, which can be used together with the sauce to dress pasta dishes. Apart from quality cuts of meat, there are also recipes which call for offal in the form of roulades and pig's trotters. = Sweets = A torta pasticciotto filled with almonds and figs. Apulia is not known for its sweet treats because its inhabitants generally prefer savoury foods. Sweets are traditionally reserved for festivals and religious holidays and share the plain character of its cuisine in general. The ingredients for sweets are influenced by the Middle East and include almonds, figs, hazelnuts, pistachios and spices. The traditional sweetener is honey, which is still frequently used. Fresh soft ricotta is used as well.  Wine  In 2017 Apulia overtook Veneto as the largest wine producing region in Italy, with a total production of 9.070.112 hectoliters. It has been producing grapes with a high alcohol content for ages, which were used by other regions in Italy and France for mixing with their own wines. Since the 1990s Apulian winemakers have started taking more risks and using more innovative winemaking techniques. Today it produces wines with many different indigenous grape varieties. The most well-known wine internationally is Primitivo di Manduria, but there are many other varieties such as the Negroamaro, Bombino Bianco, Pampanuto, Verdeca, Bianco d'Alessano and Susumaniello.

In this article, the term RF (radio frequency) covers the frequency range \\"Medium Frequencies\\" up to \\"Microwave Frequencies\\", i.e. from 100 kHz to 20 GHz.Frenzel L.E.‚Äù Principles of Electronic Communication Systems‚Äù, 3rd Ed.,McGraw Hill, 2008 The key electrical parameters for an RF chain are system gain, noise figure (or noise factor) and overload level.Egan W.F., \\"Practical RF System Design\\", Wiley, 2003 Other important parameters, related to these properties, are sensitivity (the minimum signal level which can be resolved at the output of the chain); dynamic range (the total range of signals that the chain can handle from a maximum level down to smallest level that can be reliably processed) and spurious signal levels (unwanted signals produced by devices such as mixers and non-linear amplifiers). In addition, there may be concerns regarding the immunity to incoming interference or, conversely, the amount of undesirable radiation emanating from the chain. The tolerance of a system to mechanical vibration may be important too. Furthermore, the physical properties of the chain, such as size, weight and power consumption may also be important considerations. An addition to considering the performance of the RF chain, the signal and signal-to-noise requirements of the various signal processing components, which may follow it, are discussed because they often determine the target figures for a chain. Parameter sets Each two-port network in an RF chain can be described by a parameter set, which relates the voltages and currents appearing at the terminals of that network.Matthaei G., Young L., Jones E.M.T., ‚Äú Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures‚Äù,McGraw Hill 1964, Artech House 1980 Examples are: impedance parameters, i.e. z-parameters; admittance parameters, i.e. y-parameters or, for high frequency situations, scattering parameters, i.e. S-parameters.Agilent Technologies Inc., \\"s-Parameter Design\\", Application note AN154, 2006. Find at: http://sss-mag.com/pdf/AN154.pdfOrfanidis S.J., ‚Äú Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas‚Äù, Rutgers University, 1999 Scattering parameters avoid the need for ports to be open or short-circuited, which are difficult requirements to achieve at microwave frequencies. Two-port network In theory, if the parameter set is known for each of the components in an RF chain, then the response of the chain can be calculated precisely, whatever the configuration. Unfortunately, acquiring the detailed information required to carry out this procedure is usually an onerous task, especially when more than two or three components are in cascade. A simpler approach is to assume the chain is a cascade of impedance matched components and then, subsequently, to apply a tolerance spread for mismatch effects (see later). A system spreadsheet A system spreadsheet has been a popular way of displaying the important parameters of a chain, in a stage-by-stage manner, for the frequency range of interest. It has the advantage of highlighting key performance figures and also pin-pointing where possible problem areas may occur within the chain, which are not always apparent from a consideration of overall results. Such a chart can be compiled manually or, more conveniently, by means of a computer programAnalog Devices, ‚Äú ADIsimRF Signal Chain Calculator‚Äù.

Key spreadsheet topics For the parameters considered below, the chain is assumed to contain a cascade of devices, which are (nominally) impedance matched. The procedures given here allow all calculations to be displayed in the spreadsheet in sequence and no macros are used. Although this makes for a longer spreadsheet, no calculations are hidden from the user. For convenience, the spread sheet columns, show the frequency in sub-bands, with bandwidths sufficiently narrow to ensure that any gain ripple is sufficiently characterized. Adding Stage 'n' to the cascade Consider the nth stage in a chain of RF devices. The cumulative gain, noise figure, 1 dB compression pointFrenzel L., ‚Äú What's the difference between the third order intercept and the 1-dB compression points? ‚Äù Find at: http://electronicdesign.com/what-s-difference-between-third-order-intercept- and-1-db-compression-point and output thermal noise power for the preceding (n-1) devices are given by Gcumn - 1, Fcumn - 1, Pcumn - 1 and Ncumn - 1, respectively. We wish to determine the new cumulative figures, when the nth stage is included, i.e. the values of Gcumn, Fcumn, Pcumn and Ncumn, given that the nth stage has values of Gn, Fn, P1n for its gain, noise figure and 1 dB compression point, respectively. =Cumulative gain= The cumulative gain, Gcumn after n stages, is given by :Gcum_n = Gcum_{n-1} \\\\times G_n and Gcumn(dB) is given by :Gcum_n(dB) = Gcum_{n - 1}(dB) + G_n(dB) where Gcumn-1(dB) is the total gain of the first (n-1) stages and Gn(dB) is the gain of the nth stage. Conversion equations between dBs and linear terms are: :G = 10^{G(dB)/10} = \\\\exp \\\\big (0.23026 \\\\times G(dB) \\\\big ) and : G(dB) = 10 \\\\times \\\\log_{10}G = 4.6429 \\\\times \\\\ln(G) =Cumulative noise factor (Noise Figure)= The cumulative noise factor, after n stages of the overall cascade, Fcumn is given by :Fcum_n = Fcum_{n - 1} +\\\\frac{F_n -1}{Gcum_{n-1}} where Fcumn-1 is the noise factor of the first (n-1) stages, Fn is the noise factor of the nth stage, and Gcumn is the overall gain of n stages. The cumulative noise figure is then :NFcum_n(dB) = 10 \\\\times log_{10}(Fcum_n) = 4.6429 \\\\times ln(Fcum_n) *Note 1: the use of an amplifier with high gain for the first stage will ensure that the noise figure degradations by later stages will be small or negligible. This will be best for system sensitivity, see later. *Note 2: for a passive (lossy) section of the chain, the noise figure of the section equals the loss of that section.Brooker G., ‚ÄúSensors for Ranging and Imaging‚Äù, Chapter 9, Sci Tech Publ. 2009, YesDee Publ. 2012Pozar D.M., ‚ÄúMicrowave Engineering‚Äù, Wiley, 4th Ed., 2012. So, for example, a 3 dB attenuator has a noise figure of 3 dB. =Cumulative 1dB compression point= For spreadsheet purposes, it is convenient to refer the 1 dB compression pointRF Cafe, ‚Äú Cascaded 1 dB Compression Point (P1dB)‚Äù. Find at: www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/p1db.htm to the input of the RF chain, i.e. P1cumn(input), : P1cum_n(input) = \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\frac{1}{P1cum_{n-1}(input)} + \\\\frac{Gcum_n}{P1_n(input)}} where P1cumn-1 is the 1 dB compression point at the input of the first (n-1) stages, P1n is the 1 dB compression point for the nth stage, referred to its input and Gcumn is the overall gain including the nth stage. The units are [mW] or [Watt]. *Note: for the best result, i.e. a system tolerant to high level signals, is achieved with a low front end gain. This is in conflict with the need for a low overall noise factor, which requires a high first-stage gain. *Note 2: The 1 dB compression point is abbreviated as P1dB, iP1dB, or oP1dB. It is referenced to input or output power level measured in [dBm]. Overall system performance can be practically evaluated by the 1 dB compression method. Related parameters, such as IP3 or IM3 are helpful fictive numbers used to evaluate the system. The device would burn, applying IP3 input level. Accuracy of the measurement with spectrum analyzer is (HP/Agilent specs: +-1.0 dB, and +-0.5 dB custom device). Don't chase fractions of dB. In linear systems, this all results in AGC. = Cumulative noise power = The thermal noise power present at the input of an RF chain,Connor F.R., ‚Äú Noise‚Äù, Edward Arnold, 2nd Ed. 1982Terman F.E.,‚Äú Electronic and Radio Engineering‚Äù, 4th. Ed., 1955Vizmuller P., ‚Äú RF Design Guide‚Äù, Artech House, 1955 is a maximum in a resistively matched system, and is equal to kTB, where k is Boltzmann's constant (= 1.38044 √ó 10‚àí23 J/K), T is the absolute temperature, in kelvins and B is the bandwidth in Hz. At a temperature of 17 ¬∞C (‚â° 290 K), kTB = 4.003 √ó 10‚àí15 W/MHz ‚â° -114 dBm for 1 MHz bandwidth. The thermal noise after n stages of an RF chain, with total gain GT and noise figure FT is given by :Ncum_n = kTB \\\\times Fcum_n \\\\times Gcum_n where k = Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in kelvins and B is the bandwidth in hertz, or :Ncum_n(dBm/Mhz) = -114 +Fcum_n(dB) + Gcum_n(dB) where Ncumn(dBm) is the total noise power in dBm per 1 MHz of bandwidth, In receivers, the cumulative gain is set to ensure that the output noise power of the chain at an appropriate level for the signal processing stages that follow. For example, the noise level at the input to an analog-to-digital converter (A/D) must not be at too low a level, otherwise the noise (and any signals within it) is not properly characterized (see the section on A/Ds, later). On the other hand, too high a level results in the loss of dynamic range. Other related system properties With the basic parameters of the chain determined, other related properties can be derived. =Second and third order intercept points = Sometimes performance at high signal levels is defined by means of the ‚Äúsecond-order intercept point (I2)‚Äù and the ‚Äúthird- order intercept point (I3)‚Äù, rather than by the 1 dB compression point. These are notional signal levels which occur in two-signal testing and correspond to the theoretical points where second and third order inter-modulation products achieve the same power level as the output signal. The figure illustrates the situation. Compression and IM Products In practice, the intercept levels are never achieved because an amplifier has gone into limiting before they are reached, but they are useful theoretical points from which to predict intercept levels at lower input powers. In dB terms, they decrease at twice the rate (IP2) and three times the rate (IP3) of the fundamental signals. When products, stage to stage, add incoherently, the cumulative results for these products are derived by similar equations to that for the 1 dB compression point. : I2cum_n(input) = \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\frac{1}{I2cum_{n-1}(input)} + \\\\frac{Gcum_n}{I2_n(input)}} where I2cumn-1 is the second order intercept point at the input of the first (n-1) stages, I2n is the third order intercept point for the nth stage, referred to its input and Gcumn is the overall gain including the nth stage. Similarly, : I3cum_n(input) = \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\frac{1}{I3cum_{n-1}(input)} + \\\\frac{Gcum_n}{I3_n(input)}} where I3cumn-1 is the third order intercept point at the input of the first (n-1) stages, I3n is the third order intercept point for the nth stage, referred to its input. The cumulative intercept points are useful when determining the ‚Äúspurious free dynamic range‚Äù of a system. There is an approximate relationship between the third order intercept level and the 1 dB compression level which isEast P.W., ‚Äú Microwave System Design Tools and EW Applications‚Äù, 2nd ed., Artech House 2008 :IP3(dB) \\\\approx P1(dB) + 11(dB) Although only an approximation, the relationship is found to apply to a large number of amplifiers. = Signal-to- noise ratio = In the spread sheet, the total frequency band of interest B(Hz) is divided into M sub-bands (spreadsheet columns) of B/M (Hz) each, and for each sub-band (m = 1 to M) the thermal noise power is derived, as described above. In practice, these results will differ slightly, from column to column, if the system has gain ripple. The signal-to-noise ratio (S:N) is the peak signal power of the pulse (Psig) divided by the total noise power (Pnoise) from the M frequency bins, i.e. : \\\\frac{S}{N} = \\\\frac{P_{sig}}{ \\\\sum_{m=1}^M P_{noise}(m)} This is the S:N ratio at RF frequencies. It can be related to the video S:N ratio as shown next.  Relating RF and video S:N ratios  For spreadsheet purposes it can useful to find the RF signal to noise ratio which corresponds to a desired video signal to noise figure after demodulation or detection. As an RF chain usually has sufficient gain for any noise contribution from the detector diode to be ignored, the video S:N can be shown to be : \\\\Big ( \\\\frac {S}{N} \\\\Big )_{vid} = \\\\frac {G^2.P_S^2}{4.G^2.P_S.kTF'B_V + 2(kTF'G)^2.(B_V.B_R- B_v^2/2)} where *PS =input RF signal power; *8BV and BR are the video and RF bandwidths; *F' = F -1/G where G is the chain gain and F the effective noise figure; *k = Boltzmann's constant; and *T = the ambient temperature [If there is significant gain variation across the band, then it can be divided into M sub- bands and results summed for these sub-bands, as described earlier.] From the above equation, as the noise power in the RF band is PN = kTBRF‚Äô, a relationship between RF and Video S:N ratios can be found. : \\\\Big ( \\\\frac {S}{N} \\\\Big )_{vid} = \\\\frac {\\\\Big ( \\\\frac {S}{N} \\\\Big )_{rf}^2}{4. \\\\Big ( \\\\frac{S}{N} \\\\Big)_{rf} . \\\\frac{B_V}{B_R} +2. \\\\frac{B_V}{B_R} - \\\\Big ( \\\\frac{B_V}{B_R} \\\\Big ) ^2} (This result can be found elsewhereLipsky S.E., \\"Microwave Passive Direction Finding\\", Wiley, N.Y., 1987). Inverting the relationship gives the RF signal-to-noise ratio required to achieve a given video S:N ratio: : \\\\Big ( \\\\frac {S}{N} \\\\Big )_{rf} = \\\\frac{B_V}{B_R}. \\\\Bigg [ 2.\\\\Big( \\\\frac{S}{N} \\\\Big )_{vid} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt { 4. \\\\Big (\\\\frac{S}{N} \\\\Big )_{vid}^2 + \\\\Big( \\\\frac{S}{N} \\\\Big )_{vid} . \\\\Big ( 2. \\\\frac{B_R}{B_V} -1 \\\\Big )} \\\\Bigg ] =Signal sensitivity= Signal sensitivity is important for receiving systems and refers to the minimum signal level at the input that is necessary to give a signal that can be resolved reliably by the detection process at the end of the RF chain. This parameter is less important in the case of repeaters and transmitter drivers where signal levels tend to be higher and other concerns such as stage overload and spurious signal generation tend to be more relevant. Determining a value for system sensitivity can be difficult and depends on many things, including the method of detection, the signal coding method, the bandwidth of the RF channel, and whether or not digital processing is involved. Two important parameters used in assessing sensitivity performance of a system areBlake L.V., \\" Prediction of Radar Range\\", Ch.2, Radar Handbook, Ed. Skolnik M.L., McGraw-Hill, 1970 the \\"Probability of Detection\\" and the \\"False Alarm Rate\\". Statistical methods are often used in the decision process (see TsuiTsui J.B., \\" Microwave Receivers with Electronic Warfare Applications\\", Kreiger Pub. Co., USA, 1992 and SkolnikSkolnik M.I., \\"Introduction to Radar Systems\\", McGraw Hill Kogakusha, 2nd Ed. 1980, 1962). Tangential sensitivity Tangential Sensitivity Tangential sensitivity, (TSS), defines that input power which results in a video signal to noise ratio of approximately 8 dB from the detector. The thumbnail shows an example of a typical detected pulse at the TSS limit, with the pulse + noise sitting at a level just clear of the noise floor. The TSS level is too low a value for reliable pulse detection in a practical scenario, but it can be determined with sufficient accuracy in bench tests on a receiver to give a quick guide figure for system performance. In a wideband receiver, with a square-law detector, the TSS value at the chain input terminals is given by, :TSS(dBm) = 114 + 10.logF_T +10.log \\\\Big ( 6.31 B_V = 2.5 \\\\sqrt {2.B_V B_R - B_V^2} \\\\Big ) From this, the S:N of the RF signal, at the input to the detector can be obtained when the video output is at TSS. :\\\\Big (\\\\frac{S}{N} \\\\Big )_R(dB) =10.log \\\\Bigg [ \\\\frac{B_V}{B_R} \\\\Bigg(6.31 + 2.5 \\\\sqrt{2. \\\\frac{B_R}{B_V} -1} \\\\Bigg) \\\\Bigg ] This equation shows that the S:N at RF is typically less than unity, in wideband systems, when the video output is at TSS. For example, if BR/BV = 500 then the equation gives (S:N)R = 0.17 (‚âà -7.7 dB). (Note: a similar result is obtained by using the equation relating RF and video S:N ratios, given in the previous section). The thumbnail shows the simulated video output (at TSS) corresponding to an RF pulse in wideband noise with S:N = 0.17 and a bandwidth ratio of 500. A S:N guideline figure for pulse detection The sensitivity of a system may be taken as the \\"minimum detectable signal\\". This is that level of signal that exceeds a threshold value by a suitable margin (If the level is set too low, noise spikes will exceed it too frequently and if the signal+noise does not exceed it by a sufficient margin then it may fall below the threshold giving pulse termination prematurely. So, in determining the minimum detectable signal, it is necessary to choose the \\"false alarm rate\\" and \\"probability of detection\\" values appropriate to the system requirement. To aid the designer, graphs are available, to help determine the necessary S:N ratio at the detector.Skolnik M.I., \\" Radar Handbook\\", McGraw Hill 1970Blake L.V., \\" A Guide to Basic Pulse-Radar Maximum-Range Calculation, Part 1\\", Naval Res. Lab. Report No. 6930, Washington D.C. Find at: www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/701321.pdf In the case of pulse detection of a signal in noise, following the detector in a wideband receiver, where the RF bandwidth greatly exceeds the video bandwidth, a guideline figure for reliable performance a S:N (at video) is 16 to 18 dB. This is a useful figure for use in spreadsheets, and it corresponds to a probability of detection of over 99% for a Swerling 1 targetSwerling P., \\" Detection of Fluctuating Pulsed Signals in the Presence of Noise\\", IRE Trans., Vol.IT-3, Sept. 1957, pp.175-178ucdavis \\" Detection of Signals in Noise\\" , Find at: http://123.physics.ucdavis.edu/week_5_files/filters/matched_fiter.pdf and at Semantics Scholar at: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/67e5/45a70152ebce11c9e7fdef90e88f37742474.pdf , (both from G. Brooker, \\"Sensors and Signals\\", Univ. Sydney, 2007) (Although lower values of S:N can give acceptable \\"Probability of Detection\\" and \\"False Alarm Rate\\" figures, the measurement of pulse lengths become less reliable because noise spikes on pulses may extend below the chosen threshold level). Pulses with 18 & 15dB S:N As examples, thumbnails show simulated examples of a detected pulse, in noise, where S:N = 18 dB and 15 dB. As can be seen, if the S:N falls to 15 dB or lower, it becomes difficult to set a threshold level for pulse detection, that is clear of the noise floor, and yet does not result in early termination. The video S:N ratio can be related to the RF S:N ratio, as shown earlier. In scenarios, such as radar pulse detection, integration over several pulses may occur and a lower value of S:N then becomes acceptable. In general, system sensitivity and pulse detection theory are specialized topics and often involve statistical procedures not easily adapted for spreadsheets. Mismatches In the past, devices in an RF chain have often been inter- connected by short transmission lines, such as coaxial cable,The Microwave Engineer's Handbook, ‚ÄúCoaxial Lines‚Äù, Horizon House ‚Äì Microwaves Inc., 1966, but published annuallyPalmer R.C., ‚Äú Introduction to RF Circuit Design for Communication Systems‚Äù, R.C.

Almost invariably, mismatches occur at the various interfaces. Standard equations for a transmission line, terminated in a mismatch, areRagan G.L. (ed.), ‚ÄúMicrowave Transmission Circuits‚Äù, MIT Rad. Series, Vol. 9, McGraw-Hill 1948, Dover 1965 *Voltage Reflection coefficient = Œì , where Œì = (ZI ‚Äì Z0)/( ZI \\\\+ Z0) *Return loss(power) = 20.log Œì VSWR = (1 + Œì)/(1 - Œì) (see Standing wave ratio) *Mismatch loss = -10.log(1 - Œì2) Reflections in a Transmission Line =The response of a mismatched transmission line= If a transmission line is mismatched at both ends, multiple-reflected signals can be present on the line, resulting in ripple on the frequency response, as seen at the load. Where only first time round echoes are considered (i.e. multiple reflections are ignored), the output response is given by : V_{out} = V_1( 1 + \\\\alpha ^2 . \\\\rho _1 . \\\\rho _2 . e^{j.2* \\\\pi . f . 2T_d} ) Response of a mismatched cable Where * Œ± is the loss for a single pass through the cable, * œÅ1 and œÅ2 are the voltage reflection coefficients of the terminations, * f is the frequency, * Td is the (single pass) propagation delay of the cable A typical plot is shown in the thumbnail. This response has a ripple component with a peak-to-peak value ŒîA, given by : \\\\Delta A = 2. \\\\frac{1 + \\\\rho_1 . \\\\rho_2}{1 - \\\\rho_1 . \\\\rho_2} The frequency difference from peak-to-peak (or trough-to-trough) of the ripple is given by ŒîŒ© where : \\\\Delta \\\\Omega = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{T_d} =The response of multiple mismatches= An RF chain may contain many inter-stage links of various lengths. The overall result is obtained using : \\\\text{Overall Result} = \\\\prod_{n=1}^N Vout_n This can give an overall response which is far from flat. As an example, a random collection of 25 cascaded (but separated) links give the result shown. Here, a random selection of path delays are assumed, with Œ± taken as unity and œÅ1 and œÅ2 taking the typical value 0.15 (a return loss ‚âà 16 dB), for the frequency range 10 to 20 GHz The Response of Multiple Mismatches For this example, calibration at 50 MHz intervals would be advisable, in order to characterize this response. The ripple amplitude would be reduced if the mismatches œÅ1 and œÅ2 were improved but, especially if the lengths of the interconnecting links were made shorter. An RF chain, made up of surface mounted components, interconnected by stripline, which can be made physically small, may achieve less than 0.5 dB ripple. The use of integrated circuits would give lower ripple still, (see, for example Monolithic microwave integrated circuits). Mixers The presence of a mixer in an RF chain complicates the spreadsheet because the frequency range at the output differs from that at the input. In addition, because mixers are non-linear devices, they introduce many inter- modulation products, which are undesirable, especially in wide-band systems. For an input signal at frequency Fsig and a local oscillator frequency Flo , the output frequencies of a mixer are given by : \\\\text{Mixer Output} = n\\\\times F_{lo} \\\\pm \\\\ m\\\\times F{sig} where m and n are integers. Usually, for a mixer, the desired output is the frequency with n = m = 1. The other outputs are often referred to as ‚Äúspurs‚Äù and are usually unwanted. Frequency plans are often drawn up, often as a separate spreadsheet, to minimize the consequences of these unwanted signalsFlores J.L., ‚Äú The Distances Chart: A New Approach to Spurs Calculation‚Äù.

Find at: https://docplayer.net/3629684-Rf-system-design-peter- kinget-bell-laboratories-lucent-technologies-murray-hill-nj-usa.html Some general points regarding mixer performance are: # Products with m and n small tend to have the largest amplitude so they require the most attention and, if possible, should fall outside the operational pass-band. Products when m and n are high tend to be of smaller amplitude and, often, can be ignored. # Down- converters are best realized with FLO set high, i.e. FLO > FSig. # In receivers, image frequency signals are less troublesome if the IF (intermediate frequency) is set very high. # Local oscillator leakage can be minimized by using double-balanced mixers # Presenting large amplitude signals to a mixer should be avoided in order to avoid high level spurs. Consequently, it is poor practice to have high gain prior to a mixer (a requirement which may conflict with a need for a low overall noise figure). In any case, the LO power applied to the mixer should greatly exceed the signal power. In a typical mixer, the 1 dB compression point is between 5 and 10 dB below the local oscillator power.Browne J., ‚Äú Understanding Dynamic Range‚Äù, Microwaves and RF, Feb. 2011. Find at: www.mwrf.com/test-and-measurement/understanding- dynamic-range Note that the approximate relationship between IP3 and P1 differs from that for amplifiers. For mixers, a very approximate expression is: :IP3(dB) \\\\approx P1(dB) + 15(dB) As this is very approximate, it is advisable to refer to the specification of the mixer in question, for clarification.  Dynamic range  Dynamic Range (DR) is that range of input powers from that of a just detectable signal up to a level at which the chain overloads. DR is given by :D_R = P_{max} - P_{sens} where Pmax is the Maximum Signal Power, discussed earlier, and Psens is the smallest input power for signal detection (see Sensitivity, discussed earlier)..  Field strength, antenna gain and signal power for receiver antennas  (Several assumptions are made for the equations that follow. Firstly, if the incoming signal is polarized, then the antenna is rotated to match that polarization, secondly, it is assumed that the antenna output impedance is matched to that of the chain input port and, thirdly, when gain is quoted, this is the maximum gain of the antenna (sometimes referred to as the boresight gain)) When the power density of an incoming signal is Pinc then the power at the antenna terminals is PR is given by :P_R = A_{eff} \\\\times P_{inc} Where Aeff is the effective area of the antenna (or the Antenna aperture). Power density, which is in watts per metre squared, can be related to Electric Field Strength ER, given in volts per metre, by :E_R = \\\\sqrt{P_{inc}.120 \\\\pi} The gain of the antenna is related to the effective aperture by.Connor F.R., ‚Äú Antennas‚Äù, Edward Arnold, 1972 :G = A_{eff}. \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi}{ \\\\lambda ^2} In practice, the effective aperture of the antenna is smaller than the actual physical area. For a dish, the effective area is about 0.5 to 0.6 times the actual area, and for a rectangular horn antenna it is about 0.7 to 0.8 times the actual area. For a dipole there is no actual physical area, but as a half-wave dipole has a power gain of 1.62 and the effective area can be inferred from that.  Front- end losses  Front end losses are those losses which occur prior to the first active device of a receiver chain. They often arise because of the operational requirements of a particular system, but should be minimized, where possible, to ensure the best possible system sensitivity. These losses add to the effective noise figure of the first amplifier stage, dB for dB. Some losses are a consequence of the system construction, such as antenna to receiver feeder loss and, may include waveguide-to-coax. transition loss. Other losses arise from the necessity to include devices to protect the chain from high incident powers. For example, a radar system requires a transmit-receive (TR) cellKeller E.W. & Townsend M.A., ‚Äú Transmit-Receive Devices‚Äù, Chapter XI, Principles of Radar, ed.

Similarly, a front end limiterSkolnik M.I., ‚Äú Solid-state limiters‚Äù, Chapter 9, Introduction to Radar Systems, McGraw-Hill 1962,1980, p.363 is needed, on a ship, to protect the chain from the emissions of high-power transmitters located close by. In addition, the system may include a band-pass filter at its input, to protect it from out-of-band signals, and this device will have some pass-band loss.  Signal and S:N requirements of signal processing devices  = Detectors (diodes) = Detector diodes for RF and Microwaves may be point contact diodes, Schottky diodes, Gallium Arsenide or p-n junction devices.Bayliss R., ‚Äú Microwave Diodes...Why Schottky-barrier?

At low powers, diodes have a square-law characteristic, i.e. the output voltage is proportional to the input power, but at higher powers (above about -15dBm) the device becomes linear, with the output voltage proportional to the input voltage.

Normally the RF amplifier will produce a minimum of 10 dB limiting at the lowest specified signal input level. If the RF S:N ratio is too low, the output of the longest delay line correlator (which sets the frequency resolution of the IFM) will become degraded and noisy. At high S:N ratios (+10dBm), the measured frequency accuracy approaches the correlator-limited rms error, but at approximately -3dBm SNR, ambiguity errors appear, causing large measurement inaccuracies.Sullivan W.B., ‚Äú Design Optimization Improves IFM/DFD Receiver Accuracy‚Äù, Microwaves & RF, vol. 31, no. 9, Sept. 1992, p. 96-99 The lowest input power level of a typical DDU is about -75dBm, and with a receiver noise figure of 10 dB, it gives a frequency accuracy of approximately 1 MHz They have dynamic ranges of 65 to 75 dB and cover frequency bands such as 2 ‚Äì 6 GHz, 6‚Äì18 GHz and some wideband devices cover 2 ‚Äì 18 GHz.Sullivan W.B., ‚Äú Ultra-Wideband IFM Receiver Fulfils Design Requirements‚Äù, MSN & CT, April 1985Keshavamurthy T.

As the A/D operates with sampled signals, it is necessary for the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem to be satisfied, if data is not to be lost. As shown earlier, a low-amplitude RF pulse immersed in wideband noise, can be detected by a square-law diode detector. Similarly spread spectrum signals can be recovered from below the noise floor by compression. Consequently, to ensure no loss of data, the chain gain should be high enough to ensure that thermal noise will activate the A/D adequately, so that any signals present within the noise, can be recovered correctly by the detection or compression process. Typically, the rms noise voltage present the input to the A/D should be one or two bits of the A/D range, but no lower. On the other hand, having excessive chain gain so that the noise floor is unnecessarily high, will result in the loss of dynamic range. Consider, as an example, a chirp signal with time-bandwidth product of 200 and of amplitude of ¬Ω LSB which is embedded in noise with an rms voltage of 1 LSB, present at the input to an A/D. he digitized, quantised output, relative to the mean value, is similar to the example in the left-hand figure below.

It was a municipality in its own right before the fusion of the Belgian municipalities in 1977.  Heritage  The village has one of the oldest churches of Walloon Brabant, which dominates the whole valley. Indeed, the Saint-Martin church is an outstanding example of a rural medieval sanctuary preserved in the purity of its forms and its original proportions. The oldest part, the central nave, goes back to the Carolingian dynasty (10th century). The thickness of its walls varies from 1.6m to 1.8m. The square pillars without capitals, the horseshoe arches and the wide and low nave present the building as an early Christian basilica. There is also a 17th-century baroque pulpit, a baptismal font of blue stone from the same time, Style Louis XIV confessionals, as well as a wrought iron communion bench Louis XV. The church is located close to the municipal school of Tourinnes-la-Grosse. The name Tourinnes-la-Grosse is explained by the existence of its \\"big tower\\", lower and wider than most of the church towers. Since 1946, this church has been registered as a monument; in 2002 it was listed among the exceptional built heritage of Wallonia. In 1938, a calvary was erected next to the presbytery.

Takeuchi supervised the production of the project and seiy≈´s from the anime series returned to reprise their roles, with mangaka and Knuckle Bash designer Junya Inoue serving as one of the game's graphic designers.  Gameplay  Sailor Moon battling against Castor and Pollux, the game's first bosses. As with previously released Sailor Moon titles on Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game where players take control either of the five original Sailor Soldiers across eight stages, each one set in a different location, and fight against an assortment of enemies and villains from the series in order to defeat Queen Beryl and the Dark Kingdom. Similar to Golden Axe, each Soldier has a special attack of their own that deals damage to all enemies on-screen at once depending on the number of crystals collected along the way, which up to a dozen can be fought at one time. These special attacks also trigger special animations for each of the Soldier depending on the number of crystals used as well. Unlike other titles based on the franchise, most of the fighting is physical rather than magical and the Soldier can run and perform dashing attacks. Each Soldier also has different attributes during gameplay, encouraging players to select their preferred character. At certain difficult points during battle, Tuxedo Mask will show up and throw a rose, which is a bonus drop that restores health for the players and damages the enemies as well.  Development and release  Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon was the first title to be developed by Gazelle, which was one of the offshoot companies formed after the closure of Toaplan due to bankruptcy, along with CAVE and Takumi Corporation. Sailor Moon author Naoko Takeuchi was involved during the production as supervisor and seiy≈´s from the anime series returned to reprise their respective roles. Mangaka and Knuckle Bash designer Junya Inoue was also involved during its production as one of the graphic designers. There are two versions of the game released: 95/03/22 and 95/03/22B. The latter of which fixes a bug with the boss battle against Tuxedo Mask.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, Game Machine listed Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon on their May 1, 1995 issue as being the eleventh most-successful arcade game of the year, outperforming titles such as Virtua Fighter. Spanish magazine GamesTech praised the visuals. In a retrospective review, Todd Ciolek of Anime News Network criticized several aspects such as the lack of sub-weapon and length. J.A. Laraque of Obsolete Gamer gave an overall mixed review of the game, criticizing the music and sound effects, while regarding it as a \\"rip-off of Final Fight with little girls in school uniforms.\\" Kotaku included it among the best looking beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. Argentinian website Malditos Nerds ranked it as number two on their top Sailor Moon games.

Otsuya is best known for having conspired against the Oda clan and fought against her nephew, Oda Nobunaga.

After days of resistance, T≈çyama Kaget≈ç, the commander of the castle's garrison, fell ill and died. Lady Otsuya became the female lord of Iwamura castle. Toyama used to be subordinate to Takeda, but at that time Nobunaga Oda's aunt Lady Otsuya had a hostile relationship with Takeda. She didn't surrender for months and continued to defend the castle until March 6, 1573 when she made an agreement with the Takeda clan. Akiyama Nobutomo negotiated the castle's surrender with Lady Otsuya, and she settled in a peace treaty without bloodshed and ceased attacks. The adopted son of Otsuya and the official keeper of the castle, a seven-year-old lord called Gob≈çmaru (Oda Katsunaga) was taken to the Takeda home in the province of Kai as a hostage. In accordance with the surrender treaty, Lady Otsuya married Akiyama. Otsuya surrendered the castle to the Takeda and became a member of it and an enemy of Nobunaga. On March 15, 800 soldiers led by Baba Nobuharu, who were attacking Iwamura Castle, attacked the Oda Army and Oda Nobunaga pulled 10,000 soldiers. When Nobunaga learned that the soldiers at Iwamura's castle, led by his aunt, had attacked the troops of the Oda clan, he decided to counterattack. On April 12, 1573 Shingen died, and on December 22 of the same year, the Battle of Mikatagahara took place, an event that led Lady Otsuya to lead the defense of Iwamura Castle once again. The Iwamura Castle was a battlefield from 1572 to 1575. When Oda army defeated the army of Shingen's son, Takeda Katsuyori, in the Battle of Nagashino, Oda Nobutada and others surrounded Iwamura castle. In 1575, Oda Nobunaga decided to attack and take his aunt's castle, but she defended it against Oda's fierce assault for a half a year. After six months of battle, she left the castle to respond to Oda's false plea for peace. However Nobunaga reneged on his word and had Otsuya and Nobutomo crucified as traitors on December 23, 1575.

Vla≈°iƒá cheese or Travnik cheese (Vla≈°iƒá's cheese = / Travnik's cheese = ) is brined mostly low- fat white cheese made of sheep-milk. Cheese originating from the mountain of Vla≈°iƒá, just above the town of Travnik in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. Depending of amount of brine (salty water) cheese is kept in, its texture and taste can vary but is mostly dry and quite salty. History The toponym Vla≈°iƒá (mountain name) derived from the name Vlasi (Serbo-Croatian for Vlachs), historically used in Bosnia and Herzegovina for its transhumant population. Academics like late Marko Vego believe that the Vlachs, as remnant of the Roman Empire, came up with a recipe for the trademarks of product of the mountain and the region, namely the Vla≈°iƒá cheese, sometime around 1000 AD or earlier. Henceforth, by perfecting the recipe, the Vlachs passed on the tradition to other cattle breeders from the surrounding mountains. Production and characteristic Vla≈°iƒá cheese is a white cheese that matures in brine. It is originally made from fresh sheep milk, but of recently also cow milk is used, or a mix of both varieties, and then left to ripen for two to three months. Cheese is brined and mostly low-fat. It's a white in color, and can either have small irregular holes scattered in it, or be solid without holes. Depending of amount of brine (salty water) cheese is kept in its texture and taste can vary, but drained it turns mostly dry and quite salty in taste. The milk has a special flavor that comes from the variety of different herbs that sheep are eating while grazing on Vla≈°iƒá and the surrounding mountain. Popularity and consumption Today, the cheese is produced throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, but is regarded as particular traditions of the region of Central Bosnia, Vla≈°iƒá mountain and town of Travnik. In addition to the cheese, two other particular trademarks of the region exist, the Tornjak dog and Pramenka sheep. The Tornjak is believed to have existed for more than a millennia, bred to guard people and its livestock from wolves and bears. Its etymology is connected to Neo-Latin torni acca (\\"turn here\\"). The Vla≈°iƒá cheese was awarded many prizes over the years, with gold medal won at 12th International Exhibition of Cheese in Austria (Die internationale K√§siade) in 2014 among most recent ones.

He showed considerable promise as a juvenile when he was undefeated in three start including the Listed ANZAC Day Stakes. As a three- year-old he proved himself one of the best horses of his generation in Australia over sprint distances, taking the HDF McNeil Stakes and the Coolmore Stud Stakes as well as being placed in both the Rubiton Stakes and the Newmarket Handicap. In the summer of 2018 he was relocated to Europe where he won both his races, namely the Greenlands Stakes in Ireland and the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. Background Merchant Navy is a bay horse foaled at the Segenhoe Stud in New South Wales by Chris Barham, a chiropractor from Toowoomba. As a yearling he was consigned to the Inglis 2016 Easter Yearling Sale and was bought for A$350,000 by the trainer Ciaron Maher. The colt entered the ownership of a group headed by Seymour Bloodstock and was taken into training by Maher. He was ridden in most of his Australian races by Mark Zahra. His sire, the Australian stallion Fastnet Rock, was a sprinter whose victories included the Lightning Stakes and the Oakleigh Plate. He sired many leading horses including Shoals and Atlantic Jewel in the Southern hemisphere before moving to the Coolmore Stud in Ireland. His European progeny have included Fascinating Rock and Qualify. Merchant Navy's dam, Legally Bay,showed good racing ability, winning the Group 3 Sweet Embrace Stakes in 2003. She was descended from Pirouette, a half-sister to the AJC Derby winner Innocent King. Racing career =2016/17: two-year-old season= Merchant Navy began his racing career in a maiden race over 1200 metres at Pakenham Park on 2 March in which he started at odds of 5/2 and won by one and three quarter lengths. A month later at Sandown Racecourse the colt started odds on favourite for a handicap race over 1400 metres and won again, beating the Godolphin runner Platinum by a length. Luke Nolen took the ride when the colt was stepped up in class for the ANZAC Day Stakes at Flemington Racecourse on 25 April. Carrying top weight of 57.5 kg he completed an unbeaten first season as he came home a length in front of the favourite Casino Fourteen. =2017/18: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Merchant Navy started 5/2 favourite for the Group 3 HDF McNeil Stakes over 1200 metres at Caulfield Racecourse on 2 September. He came from the rear of the field to take the lead in the closing stages to win by a head from Booker. After the race Maher said \\"He‚Äôs a very exciting colt... He put the writing on the wall with his trials and the way he‚Äôs furnished during his spell and he‚Äôs now a well-rounded racehorse\\". Three weeks later he was strongly fancied for the Group 1 Golden Rose Stakes at Rosehill Racecourse but never looked likely to win and came home tenth of the fourteen runners behind Trapeze Artist. Two days after the race Ciaron Maher received a six-month suspension after it was revealed that several of his trainees were owned by the \\"convicted conman\\" Peter Foster, and his training duties were given over to Aaron Purcell. On his first start for his new trainer Merchant Navy, wearing blinkers for the first time, was made an 18/1 outsider for the Coolmore Stud Stakes, a Group 1 race for three-year-olds over 1200 metres at Flemington on 4 November. The more fancied runners included Trapeze Artist, Invincible Star (Thoroughbred Club Stakes), Catchy (Blue Diamond Stakes), Viridine (Roman Consul Stakes), Houtzen (Scarborough Stakes) and Kementari. After racing towards the rear of the 20-runner field Merchant Navy was switched to the inside, produced a strong late run and won by a head and a short head from Invincible Star and Formality. Zahra commented \\"I always felt he was going to be in the finish, I just need to find him some clear air. I could see a lot of room back to the inside and went there and he started to picked up. Once I got past the Godolphin horse (Viridine) and back to the inside of the leader, he just took off\\". In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Merchant Navy was given a rating of 117, making him the 129th best racehorse in the world and the second best three-year-old in Australia. After a break of over three months Merchant Navy returned on 10 February at Caulfield when he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Rubiton Stakes. He started favourite but despite producing a strong finish he came home third behind Super Cash and Flamberge. On 10 March the colt headed the betting for the Newmarket Handicap at Flemington when he was ridden by Chad Schofield. He was restrained towards the rear before producing his customary late charge but he was beaten a short head and a head by his older rivals Redkirk Warrior and Brave Smash in a three-way photo finish. =2018: four-year-old season= In the spring of 2018, Merchant Navy moved to the northern hemisphere and joined the stable of Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle in Ireland. His relocation followed his partial acquisition by John Magnier's Coolmore Stud and he henceforth raced for a partnership including Susan Magnier, Derrick Smith and Michael Tabor as well as the \\"Merchant Navy Syndicate\\". His first run in Europe came in the Group 3 Greenlands Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 26 May in which he was ridden by Ryan Moore and started the 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Brando (Prix Maurice de Gheest) and Tasleet (Duke of York Stakes). He started slowly but moved up into third place entering the final furlong before staying on strongly to take the lead in the closing stages and win by a length from Spirit of Valor. At Royal Ascot on 23 June Merchant Navy contested the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and started at odds of 4/1 in a twelve-runner field. Harry Angel started favourite, while the other runners included Redkirk Warrior, The Tin Man, Librisa Breeze (British Champions Sprint Stakes), City Light (Prix de Saint-Georges), Bound For Nowhere (Shakertown Stakes), D'Bai (John of Gaunt Stakes) and Spirit of Valor. Partnered by Moore, Merchant Navy tracked the leaders before making a forward move approaching the final furlong but was hampered when the early leader Bound For Nowhere hung to the left. He gained the advantage in the final strides but was strongly challenged by the French horse City Light and the pair crossed the line together. Although City Light appeared to have won the race the photo finish revealed that Merchant Navy had hung on to prevail by a short head. After the race O'Brien said \\"We thought it was kind of an impossible task for him... I can‚Äôt tell you how happy we are. He is relaxed, genuine, a good mover and has a good mind. He is very docile. He has no problem in any way. He is really a joy to do anything with\\". Less than a week after his win at Ascot it was announced that Merchant Navy had been retired from racing to become a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Merchant Navy was given a rating of 118, making him the 78th best racehorse in the world and the fifth best sprinter in Europe.

But less than a week later resigned, saying that \\"he could not sit on the same Board as BidEnergy Board adviser Zac Rosenberg. The Age reported that after Baillieu wrote to all shareholders, Candy Cub was forced to issue a new ASX release clarifying Baillieu‚Äôs reasons for leaving the Board were not ‚Äúpersonal reasons‚Äù and in fact due to a breakdown in relationship with co-director Zac Rosenberg. On 15 September it was reported that Baillieu became Chairman of Candy Club and made an investment of $3 million. Candy Club was the best performing stock on the ASX that day - up 74% on the news of Baillieu's appointment.  Notable Legal Matters  Baillieu uses Herbert Smith Freehills as his legal advisors of choice and below are some of his legal matters. = Poppy King 1998 = Baillieu was hired by Poppy King to be her \\"Mr Fixit\\" in her battle with her business partners. The Age reported that at one stage they applied for intervention orders, but then withdrew them. = Aconex 2007 = Baillieu was involved in a dispute over a $12 million share purchase that was later settled out of Court. Aconex's CEO Leigh Jasper and Baillieu worked together at McKinsey in the 1990s. = Martin Hosking 2011 = Baillieu was involved in a dispute seeking removal of Redbubble CEO Martin Hosking as Chairman of Aconex. At one point, Baillieu threatened to bankrupt Hosking and later Hosking resigned as Chairman of Aconex. = Allens Arthur Robinson 2011 = Baillieu raised concerns about Aliens Arthur Robinson's conflict of interest in being legal advisers while Michael Robinson sat on the Board. Michael Robinson's profile was removed from the Allens Arthur Robinson website and later reinstated. = IR-exchange 2019 = Baillieu said the IRexchange Prospectus was \\"extraordinarily misleading and deceptive\\" and sought to recover a $1 million investment by issuing proceedings in the Federal Court. \\"Their prospectus, in my opinion, could put them all in jail because they've made extraordinarily misleading and deceptive statements,\\" Mr Baillieu said. Baillieu also informed ASIC and following Baillieu's legal claims the company offered to refund investors and ASIC stopped the irexchange Prospectus. Baillieu said a new funder would have to pay off the $17 million of convertible notes \\"and who would want to do that\\"? Ultimately irexchange paid him $1.23 million and Baillieu said \\"This is a huge win for me ‚Äì they're giving me absolutely everything I wanted.\\" On 23 October irexchange had gone into administration after a syndicate of investors filed a legal action in the NSW Federal Court. Irexchange was accused of misleading its shareholders in further actions of seven different investors with legal actions similar to Baillieu‚Äôs. On 2 December Irexchange went to winding-up leaving shareholders and creditors with nothing. = Misuse of the Baillieu name 2019 = Baillieu has attacked the rebrand of stockbroking firm Baillieu Holst, to trade as Baillieu. According to Baillieu, \\"their rebrand was so dishonest, so unethical and so unlawful that we cannot accept their use of 'Baillieu' at all, they've forfeited it.\\" He further said, \\"trademarks are no defence to deception, and hence irrelevant. The Baillieu name has a good reputation, earned over 165 years. [Baillieu 1889] are, in my opinion, impostors with a poor reputation,\\" and also \\"Starting legal proceedings would elevate [Baillieu 1889]. They want their position to be taken seriously, and the legal proceedings would be a way of elevating where they are now to be a worthy opponent, and we don't consider them a worthy opponent,\\" and \\"These guys really don't get a message easily ‚Ä¶ [My emails] certainly haven't been threatening to them, or intimidatory. They've been strident, and occasionally colourful,\\" The Australian Financial Review reported that \\"it is understood almost a dozen Baillieu family members, including Baillieu, contacted the company alleging the name change was inappropriate and describing the company as \\"impostors\\". The Baillieu family was reported to be ‚Äúabsolutely furious‚Äù about it. After that the Sorrento Sailing Couta Boat Cllub, where the rebrand was launched, removed Baillieu Limited's umbrellas and covered up their sign.  Texta over signage at 360 Collins Street  The Age described Baillieu as \\"a bandit with a black pen\\" and said the \\"corporate lawyer and company director took a novel approach....to press the point\\" and that \\"he walked into the foyer of 360 Collins Street and used a black Texta to black out the [Baillieu 1889] name on the building's nameplate.\\" Baillieu said \\"security made no attempt to stop him, and that he was simply righting what was wrong, which is the misleading use of the family name.\\" The Australian Financial Review reported that \\"the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of this whole affair is undoubtedly Baillieu having last week used black texta to scribble out his family name from the firm's Collins Street placards. Using removable marker, it seems, so you can't technically call it vandalism\\". The Sydney Morning Herald described Baillieu as \\"Full-time rich-lister, part-time vigilante.\\" and that \\"Baillieu says security made no attempt to stop him, and that he was simply fighting a crime - the theft of his family name\\". Baillieu \\"made an easy confession that he personally crossed out the word 'Baillieu' from its Collins street offices. In broad daylight and with Baillieu making sure to stay within the bounds of the law by making his defacements only in removable marker.\\" On 14 June 2019 following a campaign of legal pressure from the 'pugnacious' Baillieu and his lawyers Herbert Smith Freehills urging them to change their name, the stockbrokers agreed to change their name to E.L.&C.; Baillieu with effect from 17 June to coincide with their move from 360 Collins Street to 55 Collins Street. = BidEnergy 2019 = Baillieu was sacked as Chairman of BidEnergy on 21 February 2019. A text message was sent by BidEnergy MD Guy Maine to Baillieu's wife at 12:08 am that night. The share price fell by 32.8% the day after Baillieu's sacking. On 5 March he raised questions about the new Chairman's credentials and the Australian Securities Exchange began an investigation. He also said, \\"he will be taking further legal action, alleging BidEnergy's directors' decision to remove him from the chairman role was in breach of their duties under the Corporations Act.\\" Later, The Australian reported on 1 May that Baillieu wrote a letter to all shareholders alleging that the new Chairman Andrew Dyer had made false and misleading claims about his credentials to the Australian Stock Exchange. Baillieu apologized to all shareholders for Mr Dyer's appointment to the Board. The stock fell 11% on news of Baillieu's letter. Baillieu later sold all of his shares and said that he'd been punched in the back of the head by them and it was all terribly upsetting that they‚Äôd a meeting without him and that the MD had sent a text harassing his wife in the middle of the night. Billionaire Alex Waislitz snapped up 5.85% of BidEnergy even as Baillieu wrote a letter to shareholders saying he had been wrongfully ousted in a 'secret scheme. The Age reported on 19 June that Andrew Dyer, the new BidEnergy Chair who ousted Baillieu, was taking Baillieu to Court to seek an Intervention Order to try to stop Baillieu writing to BidEnergy shareholders about Dyer's leadership. According to documents filed at the Supreme Court of Victoria on 23 July 2019, Baillieu commenced legal proceedings against BidEnergy in an action used by shareholders to sue directors, known as a derivative action. The Age reported on 6 August that \\"Baillieu described BidEnergy MD as \\"an absolute beginner\\" at large business to business sales and \\"he doesn't solicit or listen to or like coaching or feedback\\". On 25 August it was reported that Baillieu was claiming that Andrew Dyer was attempting to blackmail him in a \\"corporate war\\" over Baillieu's removal as Chairman of BidEnergy. It was also reported that Baillieu had called Dyer \\"a maggot\\" in the Melbourne Club. On 4 September in a court hearing Baillieu's counsel Ian Hill QC accused Dyer of \\"an abuse of process\\" and \\"misleading the courts in an attempt to protect his reputation\\" ever since Dyer removed Baillieu as BidEnergy Chairnan. The hearing was delayed until January. It was reported Baillieu was suing to recoup $4.6 million lost on sale of a parcel of shares. = Updater 2019 = The Australian Financial Review reported that Baillieu had a $20 million stake \\"grew suspicious about the raise's progress. He sought a detailed explanation from MD David Greenberg about why its taken so long while foreshadowing the commencement of legal action to give him access to the company's books if he wasn't satisfied.\\" Later he said ‚ÄúMy very strong suspicion is the capital raise is well off track ... and then I‚Äôve turned up acting a little bit assertive and they‚Äôve just had a light bulb go off and have thought, ‚Äòholy smoke, we‚Äôve got to deliver this bad news. Let‚Äôs deliver bad news that it is his fault. It‚Äôs insane.‚Äù And he further said he had a \\"constructive and amicable\\" discussion with Updater CEO David Greenberg and \\"I can confirm that there was absolutely no suggestion by him that I have done anything to disrupt the capital raising.\\" Baillieu, described the delisting as a \\"fizzer\\". ‚ÄúWould I prefer the delisting had never happened? Absolutely. We‚Äôve lost liquidity for an indefinite period of time. The two key criteria for delisting ‚Äì the valuation and timing for a deal ‚Äì have both been missed, unless something amazing turns up,‚Äù he told *AFR Weekend*. Mr Baillieu said following the investor phone call on Friday, he told chief executive David Greenberg he will not be signing the proposed confidentiality agreement. ‚ÄúI may be left with no alternative but exercise of my Delaware shareholder rights.‚Äù Updater said on 9 November that it had reduced operating costs and had decided that a really large scale growth round was too ‚Äúrisky‚Äù but was hoping for a deal by the end of the year. On 19 December a debt funding deal valuing the business at $1.1 billion was announced. It was also reported that Baillieu had sold his stake in the company.

Life and career Greenall was born on 8 July 1953 in Marylebone, London, the eldest son of Edward Gilbert Greenall, 3rd Baron Daresbury. He was schooled at Eton College before attending Magdalene College, Cambridge and later the London Business School. From 1982 he was a director, and from 1992-1997 managing director, of the family business, Greenall's, as it evolved from a diversified brewery into De Vere; after serving as chief executive from 1997 and chairman from 2000, he left DeVere in 2006 when the company was sold.Who's Who 2009 page 567. Upon the death of his father on 9 September 1996 Greenall succeeded to the peerage as the 4th Baron Daresbury, also inheriting as 5th Baronet Greenall, of Walton, Chester. He therefore became a member of the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the British Parliament, sitting as a hereditary peer. Lord Daresbury was removed from the House with the passage and commencement of the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the right of all but ninety-two hereditary peers to sit; Daresbury was not one of the remaining minority. A keen horseracing enthusiast, and himself a rider, Daresbury was appointed to the chairmanship of Aintree, home of the Grand National, Britain's richest horserace, in 1989 at the age of 35.

Don Glaciation  The Don Glaciation shows evidence of the most extensive ice sheet on the East European Plain, extending into the drainage basin of the middle and lower Don River in Russia, reaching 50 degrees north latitude. This glaciation occurred before the Muchkap interglacial and the Oka and Dnieper glaciations of Eastern Europe.AvJ. Ehlers and P.L.

Marine Isotope Stage 16  MIS 16 is a major glacial stage identified through measurements of oxygene isotopes in deep sea core samples (marine isotope stage) of Cromerian age, approximately 676-621 ka ago. In terms of global ice volume, it ranks as one of the two most extreme glaciations of the Quaternary, on par with MIS 12. However, in terms of sea water temperatures it is a much more modest glaciation, of similar climate intensity to the neighbouring Cromerian glaciations MIS 14 and MIS 18. The atmospheric concentration of was below 180 ppm for 3 ka during MIS 16, the lowest of the last eight glacial cycles.  Correlations  Don and MIS 16 are usually correlated to each other. This is based on assumption that the most widespread evidence for glaciation in the Cromerian ought to be associated with the largest glaciation on the global scene. However, the time resolution of current age determinations is insufficient for a clear distinction between MIS 14, MIS 16 and MIS 18. It is unclear why the major glaciation of MIS 16 has left very little evidence in the geological records of Western Europe. MIS 16 is believed to correspond to Pre-Illinoian D in North America.J.

History  The abbey was founded in 1251 and richly endowed by Duke John I of Brittany, as penance for his earlier destruction of the Priory of Saint-Pabu and annexation of its lands during the construction of the Ch√¢teau de Suscinio. The new abbey was a daughter house of Buzay Abbey (of the filiation of Clairvaux), from where the first monks came. Among its temporal endowments were the saltpans of the Gu√©rande peninsula. The abbey was rebuilt in the 17th century. In 1791, in the French Revolution, it was dissolved. The premises were subsequently used as a barracks. The site passed into private hands in 1801, after which most of the buildings were demolished. The remaining parts are now used by a rehabilitation centre.  Description  Of the church, rebuilt in the early 18th century by the architect Olivier Delourme, there remain only the tower and part of the former transept converted into a chapel that contains the remains of the tombs of Duke John I (d. 1286) and of Isabella of Castile (d. 1328), the second wife of Duke John III of Brittany. Also extant are the 18th- century guest lodgings, some service buildings and the precinct wall of 1699.  Sources  * Bernard Peugniez, 2001: Routier cistercien. Abbayes et sites.

It is a monotypic genus and the only species is Janaria mirabilis, commonly known as staghorn hydrocoral. It is a colonial species and lives on a shell occupied by a hermit crab. It is native to the tropical and semitropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Description Janaria mirabilis is similar in appearance to a colonial coral, but comes from a quite separate group of cnidarians. The adult hydrocoral can be up to high and a similar width. It consists of a single horizontal branch and three or four vertical branches. The branches are straight or slightly curved and have blunt tips which are half as wide as the branches, the colour usually being cream or pale tan. The branches are calcified and each bears numerous polyps, the animal having been described as resembling a \\"fuzzy glove of feeding polyps\\". Distribution This hydrocoral is native to the tropical and semitropical eastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from Baja California Sur to Panama, including the Gulf of California. It occurs at depths between . Ecology A juvenile Janaria mirabilis will settle on a mollusc shell occupied by a hermit crab in the genus Manucomplanus. Here it buds and grows into a colony, sending out side branches, and at the same time exuding chemicals which erode the mollusc shell. Eventually the mollusc shell is dissolved away and the hydrocoral takes up residence on the exposed carapace and abdomen of the crab. The association is mutually beneficial as the crab receives protection from predators that are deterred by the hydrocoral's stinging cells, while the hydrocoral benefits from being moved to new feeding areas by the mobile crab. A single hermit crab can carry a mobile home weighing nearly thirty times its own weight. The tissues of the hydrocoral contain symbiotic zooxanthellae harboured within which provide additional nutrients for the colony. The hydrocoral often has epiphytic invertebrates such as barnacles living on its surface.

Name  Ahmad b. Mahmud b. Abi Bakr al-Sabuni al- Bukhari, known as Nur al-Din Abu Muhammad.  Birth and Death  He was born in Bukhara probably at the beginning of sixth / twelfth century, and died in the same city on 16 Safar 580 / May 30, 1184, and was buried in the Graveyard of the Seven Judges ().  Life  There is not much information about his life. He seems to have belonged to a respected family in Bukhara, where he spent much of his life. He received his education in the same city and became a leading defender of the Maturidite theology of his time. He had made a trip to Mecca to perform hajj and on his way to Mecca, he visited Khurasan and Iraq and had discussions with the scholars of these regions. He also had lively discussions with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, a leading representative of Ash'arite theology of his time. According to al-Razi's report, at the end of these discussions, Sabuni said that all his knowledge of kalam was based on the work of Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi; he also admitted to his own weakness in the science but said he was too old to start again.  Books  Al-Sabuni wrote a number of works, some of which are still in manuscript. In his al-Muntaqa min 'ismat al-Anbiya' (), he summarizes the work of Muhammad b. Yahya al-Bashaghiri () called Kashf al-Ghawamid fi Ahwal al-Anbiya' () or 'Ismat al-Anbiya' (). It starts by saying God sending a prophet is the result of His wise purpose, that prophets must be human, and that some of them are superior to others. Then after discussing their number and their infallibility, he goes on to discuss each individual prophet, starting with Adam and ending with the last prophet Muhammad. His al-Kifaya fi al-Hidaya () is a longer version of his al-Bidaya fi Usul al-Din (). As he states in the introduction of the latter work, some of his friends found the Kifaya too long and asked him to summarize it, and consequently he wrote al-Bidaya. Through these works, al-Sabuni closely follows and defends the views of al-Maturidi. The al-Bidaya begins with a discussion of the sources of knowledge. Then, al-Sabuni tries to establish first the createdness (huduth) of the world, then the existence of its Creator. This is followed by a discussion of God's attributes.

Pulpit Peak is a mountain summit located one km south of Hector Lake in Banff National Park, in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada. Its nearest higher peak is Lilliput Mountain, to the southwest. Pulpit Peak is situated east of the Waputik Icefield, and is a member of the Waputik Mountains. Pulpit Peak can be seen from the Icefields Parkway towering above Hector Lake. History Pulpit Peak was named in 1898 by Charles Sproull Thompson (1869-1921), who participated in numerous first ascents in the Canadian Rockies. He believed the peak resembled a pulpit in a church. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Pulpit Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Pulpit Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Pulpit Peak drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

Born in China to foreign missionaries, Hoy returned there in 1922 with a commission from W. L. Abbott to continue collecting specimens for the institution. His successful collecting in that region included becoming the first occidental researcher to obtain a species of rare river dolphin, but his works were curtailed by complications arising from childhood illness ‚Äì while convalescing from a self-inflicted gunshot injury ‚Äì and he died there in 1923.  Biography  Charles M. Hoy was the son of Christian missionaries from the United States of America, active in Japan and China.  Works  Hoy was instructed in the techniques of zoological field work during several months at the Smithsonian Institution, and was then directed by W. L. Abbott to undertake a collecting expedition to Australia. He assembled extensive collections and notes on Australian fauna, mostly birds and mammals, obtained at widely separated locations around the continent. The information and material he obtained on his excursions from 1919 to 1922 provides valuable details in the aftermath of what is regarded as extraordinary decline in mammalian fauna in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The season and locations of Hoy's field work have been determined in his excursions to New South Wales during 1919, South Australia from 1919 to early 1920, another journey through the south and north of Western Australia during 1920 and continuing to the Northern Territory later that year. In 1921 he travelled out from Sydney to Tasmania then Queensland and is noted as back at that city in April of the next year, preparing for his return journey to the United States. Charles Hoy's Australian ventures assembled small collections of marine animals and reptile and amphibian species, but the greater part his work was in amassing a collection of around one thousand specimens of birds and a similar number of mammals. The final number of mammalian species totalled around one hundred, collected at fourteen locations around the continent. While in Australia he regularly provided reports to the museum curator Garrett S. Miller and was accompanied by local researchers such as Ellis Le Geyt Troughton. Most of the visits to regions were undertaken by sea voyages, with short excursions to local areas near the ports. When Hoy was in Western Australia, his failure to find species at Perth, previously noted as common around the Swan River settlement by John Gilbert and others, saw him directed to the Busselton and Margaret River area. After returning to the United States in 1922, Hoy was commissioned by the US national museum to return to China. Prior to his death in China , he became the first occidental researcher to obtain a baiji, the river dolphin Lipotes vexillifer, a rare species that was later declared extinct.  Legacy  The legacy of Charles Hoy's works was recognised in the names of newly described animals by his contemporaries. The results of his field world in Australia were re√´xamined in the twenty first century to supplement the small amount of contemporary surveys or research undertaken at the time of his expeditions. Charles Hoy is said to have become the first broadly informed worker in the field of Australian fauna, in his own summary of the expedition around the continent he says, \\"according to the Australian Museum authorities, and others who should know, there is no one in all Australia who is an authority on Australian mammals or even the mammals of one state!‚Äù. The records and collections Hoy made have recognised limitations, he did not often venture far from camps, visit a variety of habitat in the regions he visited, or necessarily add to series of a species he obtained elsewhere, but it was enhanced by documenting the knowledge of local peoples and in its overview of the continent around 1920. Hoy was also the author of 'The Present Status of the Australian Mammal Fauna', published in the Journal of Mammalogy in 1923, an important article that was not noticed until a literature review on the same topic at the end of that century. After investigation by an Australian researcher of the material deposited by Charles Hoy at the US Museum of Natural History, the records and interviews in his unpublished papers and letters were revealed and examined. The anecdotal and incidental material in his field notes had been disregarded by earlier researchers, containing little of use to the reductive approach of his contemporaries, but a valuable source of information to the pluralistic methods of the ecologists and others examining the catastrophic decline of Australian mammals. Hoy's informants of population declines included both the colonial and indigenous peoples of the regions he visited, who also assisted in locating or providing specimens of those mammal species which persisted. These papers were published by the Australia's CSIRO as Field notes, correspondence and specimen list of museum collector Charles Hoy. In his own work, Charles Hoy identified the recent absences and rarity of reportedly common species and proposed explanations to account for the disappearances. The factors he determined were not any deliberate actions of 'man', instead proposing the primary cause was the indirectly introduced and feral animals ‚Äì rabbits, foxes and cats ‚Äì and presented this as a greater threat than alterations to fire regimes, land clearing and pastoralism; Hoy placed the least concern on the threat posed by people capturing and killing animals. In his assessment of the population declines of Australia animals, which he had identified in his report, his forecast of their trajectory was pessimistic, ‚ÄúIt is only a matter of time before the Australian fauna is extinct and if nothing is done now it will soon be too late.‚Äù.

The Nutri-score, also known as the 5-Colour Nutrition label or 5-CNL, is a nutrition label that was selected by the French government in March 2017 to be displayed on food products after it was compared against several labels proposed by industry or retailers. It relies on the computation of a nutrient profiling system derived from the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency nutrient profiling system (FSA score). It has also been recommended by Belgian, Spanish, German and Dutch authorities as well as the European Commission and the World Health Organization. It was created by Sant√© Publique France, the French public health agency, based on the work of Pr. Serge Hercberg from University of Paris 13 Nord. When compared with other Front-of-Package labels, Nutri-Score emerged as the most efficient in conveying information on the nutritional quality of foods. Delhaize crunchy muesli price and Nutri-Score  Calculation  A Nutri-score for a particular food item is given in one of five classification letters, with 'A' being a preferable score and 'E' being a detrimental score. The calculation of the score involves only seven different parameters of nutrient information per 100g of food which are usually available on food packagings. High content of fruits and vegetables, fibers, and protein promote a preferable score, while high content of energy, sugar, saturated fatty acids, and sodium promote a detrimental score.  Adoption of the Nutri-score  EU laws don't allow countries to unilaterally impose their own food labelling system, therefore they can only give recommendations. The Nutri-score has been officially recommended by health authorities in France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain . In Portugal, Switzerland, Slovenia and Austria, some food companies such as Nestl√©, Auchan or Danone announced that they would use the Nutri-score although it wasn't officially recommended by the authorities. thumbAdoption of the Nutri-Score in Europe (December 2019):  See also  * Food labelling and advertising law (Chile)  References  Nutrition Food law Food and drink in Europe ","title":"Nutri-score"},{"id":"60430196","text":"Ruellia pedunculata, the stalked wild petunia, is a wild petunia with blue or violet flowers that appear in the spring.

Education  Ilse Fehling was born on April 25, 1896 in Danzig-Langfuhr, Germany. In 1919, Fehling enrolled at the Reimann School in Berlin, where she studied art and fashion design. While in Berlin, she additionally studied at the city's Kunstgewerbeschule. In 1920, Fehling matriculated at the Bauhaus Weimar, where her work involved theatre. At the school she studied under a number of prominent artists including Oskar Schlemmer, Paul Klee, and Gertrud Grunow. Out of her work at the school, Fehling's best known is the rotating round puppet stage she designed and later patented.  Career  In 1923, she left the Bauhaus for Berlin to work as a freelance sculptor and stage designer. Fehling married Henry S. Witting the same year. In 1928, Fehling gave birth to a daughter, Gaby; she divorced Witting a year later. Fehling received the Rome Prize from the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1932; she later studied in Rome using a grant associated with the award. In the following years, her work took influences from Cubism. Following the Nazi rise to power, Fehling's work was deemed degenerate and its exhibition was banned. Much of her work was lost due to bombing and confiscation during World War II. Ilse Fehling worked as a costume designer for a number of Nazi propaganda films, including Der Herrscher.

It presents the history of Spain from the time of the sons of Noah and their dispersal down to the Arab conquest in 711.Ann Christys, \\"Chronica Gothorum Pseudoisidoriana\\", in Graeme Dunphy and Cristian Bratu (eds.), Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle (Brill, 2016), consulted online on 6 April 2019. The Chronica survives in a single manuscript, now BN lat. 6113 in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. In the 16th century, the manuscript was acquired by Pierre Pithou, who brought it to Paris. The Chronica is found on folios 27‚Äì48 under the title Cronica Gothorum a Sancto Isidoro edita.Ann Christys, \\"'How Can I Trust You since You are A Christian and I am a Moor?' The Multiple Identities of the Chronicle of Pseudo-Isidore\\", in Richard Corradini, Rob Meens, Christina P√∂ssel and Philip Shaw (eds.), Texts and Identities in the Early Middle Ages (Vienna: Verlag der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2006), pp. 359‚Äì372. Theodor Mommsen prepared the first critical edition of the Chronica in 1894 and gave it the name (pseudoisidoriana) by which is now most widely known.Gonz√°lez Mu√±oz 2000, p. 11. While the Chronica relies heavily on the works of Isidore of Seville, it was not compiled by him. It is in fact a translation of an Arabic translation of a collection of originally Latin works. Its identified sources are the Chronicon of Jerome, the Seven Books of History Against the Pagans of Orosius, the Historia Gothorum of Isidore, the Cosmographia of Julius Honorius, the Chronicon of John of Biclar and the anonymous Mozarabic Chronicle. All of these have been garbled and interpolated in the stages of transmission before reaching their final Latin form. Toponyms and personal names, in particular, are frequently based on their Arabic forms. The Arabic translation of Orosius was also used by A·∏•mad al-RƒÅzƒ´ (died 955) in his history of Spain, which likewise survives only in translation. The Chronica is of little to no use to the historian for the period it covers, although it sheds light on it the time and place of its composition. Internal evidence suggests that it was written in the 12th century, since it mentions Morocco, a name which did not appear before 1090, since it derives from the city of Marrakesh, founded in 1055. The compiler also included a description of the ports of the western Mediterranean in which he mentions Saint Nicholas of Bari. The relics of the saint did not arrive in Bari until 1087.Patrick Gautire Dalch√©, \\"Notes sur la Chronica Pseudo-Isidoriana,\\" Anuario de Estudios Medievales 14 (1984): 13‚Äì32. The Arabic original of the Chronica was almost certainly compiled in Spain, where the translation was likely also made by a writer working in the Visigothic script. It was later copied in France, most likely at the monastery of Aniane.Ann Christys, \\"Expanding/Expounding the Chronicle of Pseudo-Isidore: Paris, BN lat. 6113\\", in Richard Corradini, Max Diesenberger and Meta Niederkorn-Bruck (eds.), Zwischen Niederschrift und Wiederschrift: Fr√ºhmittelalterliche Hagiographie und Historiographie im Spannungsfeld von Kompendien√ºberlieferung und Editionstechnik (Vienna: Verlag der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2010), pp. 79‚Äì92. The Chronica has a unique perspective among Latin sources on the Arab conquest of 711. It emphasis how ·π¨ƒÅri·∏≥ ibn ZiyƒÅd brought peace to the peninsula after the civil wars that plagued the last years of the Visigothic Kingdom. It is also the earliest source to provide a name to the daughter of Count Julian who, according to legend, was raped by King Roderic. It names her Oliba, although this was subsequently forgotten. Later accounts call her La Cava.James Donald Fogelquist, \\"Pedro de Corral's Reconfiguration of La Cava in the Cr√≥nica del Rey don Rodrigo\\", eHumanista: Monographs in Humanities 3 (2007): 13‚Äì16.

The geographical coordinates of the Authority's headquarters are 0¬∞19'12.0\\"N, 32¬∞35'19.0\\"E (Latitude:0.320000; Longitude:32.588611). Overview The NPA was created by the Ugandan Parliament in 2002. The mission of the NPA is to produce comprehensive economic development plans for the country. NPA is also mandated to coordinate development planning in the entire country, and to advise the executive branch on the best policies and strategies for the development of the country. The agency is charged with the economic evaluation of public projects and programs, in collaboration with civil society and the private sector. It is also responsible for the development of local expertise in development planning nationally, and at district level. One of the immediate planning goals is Uganda's attainment of middle-income status, with an annual per capita income of US$1,036 or higher. Originally planned for 2020, more realistic evaluation puts that event in the 2025 to 2030 time frame. Governance For a period of ten years, Dr Wilberforce Kisamba Mugerwa, an agricultural economist and former cabinet minister in the central government, served as the Executive Chairman of NPA.

She specialises in the characterisation of polymer, biopolymer and peptides, using neutron and x-ray scattering, as well as the development of functionalised nanostructures for regenerative medicine and toxicology testing. Early life and education Miller studied Chemistry at the University of Strathclyde and graduated in 1997. She was an undergraduate exchange student at Franklin & Marshall College. Miller joined Durham University as a post graduate student, earning a PhD in 2000 under the supervision of Randal Richards. Miller worked on graft copolymers, which included polynorbornene and polyethylene oxide, and studied their organisation at air-water interfaces. After completing her doctorate, Miller moved to New Hall College at the University of Cambridge, where she was appointed a Junior Research Fellow and she worked with Athene Donald on cellulose. She was inspired to have a career in research during this fellowship. Research and career Miller joined the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) in 2002. She was made a full Professor in 2014. She continued to investigate the behaviour of molecules at different interfaces, including the air-liquid and liquid-liquid interface. Surfactants and polymers can be used to promote or inhibit the crystallisation of small molecules, for example the use of hydroxyl based polymers in the crystallisation of ice cream. To mimic how fish use macromolecules to stop their blood freezing, Miller combines antifreeze proteins with ice crystals. In 2004 Miller established the University of Manchester Polymers & Peptides Research Group. Here she works on the characterisation of polymer, biopolymer and peptides, using neutron and x-ray scattering. The in-depth characterisation of these materials allows Miller to tailor them for specific applications. Miller also works in biomedical engineering, creating three-dimensional scaffolds through the control of proteins and peptides. She explores the relationship between mesoscopic structure, material properties and cell response. She has studied how proteins self-assemble, including what causes them to unfold and form fibril structures. The morphology (roughness, porosity) and mechanical properties (such as Young's modulus and viscosity) can be controlled through self-assembly. The self-assembling peptides can be conjugated with polymers that are sensitive to pH and temperature. Through the synthesis of short peptides with various amino acid sequences the Miller group are studying the self-assembly of Beta sheets. She has developed a biocompatible, biodegradable cardiac patch, created from a thick porous scaffold coated with a material that mimics the extracellular matrix. She also studies the degradation mechanism of these materials. Miller was awarded a small grant from the University of Manchester to develop the synthesis of peptide-based hydrogels. The synthetic peptide hydrogels were so successful that she set up the spin- out company PeptiGelDesign, a group which worked to commercialise hydrogel technologies. Since 2008 PeptiGelDesign have raised over ¬£6 million in funding. Recognising the reach and potential of PeptiGelDesign, the company relaunched as Manchester BIOGEL in 2018, continuing to offer peptide-based hydrogels amongst other biomaterials. The hydrogels can be used to improve the quality of drug toxicity testing, DNA sensing and regenerative medicine. =Awards and honours= Her awards and honours include; *1995 University of Strathclyde William Marr Dux Award *1996 University of Strathclyde Dean's Honours Award *1996 University of Strathclyde Hackman Scholarship Research Award *1997 Sir George Beilby Memorial Medal *1999 Imperial Chemical Industries-Dupont Prize *2001 New Hall Junior Research Fellowship *2004 Exxon Mobil Teaching Fellowship *2008 Institute of Physics Polymer Physics Group and American Physical Society Division of Polymer Physics Young Researchers Award *2008 Royal Society of Chemistry Macro Group UK Young Researchers Medal *2014 Philip Leverhulme Prize for Engineering *2014 Finalist for the WISE Campaign Research Award =Personal life= Miller is married to Alberto Saiani, a materials scientist at the University of Manchester.
