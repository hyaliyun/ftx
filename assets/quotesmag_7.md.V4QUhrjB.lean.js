Career  Digby has a Natural Sciences B.A. (Hons.) from Cambridge and a PhD in astronomy from the University of Edinburgh with a thesis assessing the formation of the galaxy through low-mass stars. He has jointly published numerous papers relating to the detection of dark matter, the luminosity of stars, and exoplanet imaging and spectroscopy. In 2003 he was appointed as the NASA Michelson Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Astrophysics, American Museum of Natural History, New York where his research contributed to the design and construction of a coronagraph to directly image planets around other stars. Digby moved to New Zealand in 2006. He spent several years with the New Zealand meteorological service as a research scientist in the Forecasting Research group, then he began a PhD in Conservation Biology at Victoria University of Wellington in 2009. His thesis is titled Whistling in the Dark: An Acoustic Study of Little Spotted Kiwi. He combines all his skills in his present work using acoustic monitoring to track the behaviour of birds in the wild. He works for New Zealand Department of Conservation in recovery programs for the KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç and Takahƒì, two endangered birds endemic to New Zealand, and believes he has the perfect job: Digby is keen to spread the conservation message: he returned to his alma mater, Cambridge University, to talk about his current projects in July 2016, he has published extensively in the scientific and popular press including New Scientist, and local newspapers and radio. He was invited to speak at the New Zealand Skeptics Conference in Queenstown in December 2016.  Kiwi research  The Kiwi, a flightless bird with a long beak was the subject of Digby's PhD. His discovery that the birds harmonise their calls to defend their territory is claimed to be the first example of vocal coordination in birds. During his study, Digby used sound recorders and video cameras to track incubation. Unexpectedly, one breeding pair that produced two chicks were found to be the Little Spotted Kiwi, the smallest kiwi and very vulnerable.  KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç recovery project  Kakapo Pura on Codfish Island..Kakapo Recovery is a project of the New Zealand Department of Conservation utilising the skills of scientists, rangers and volunteers to protect and boost the numbers of the endangered Kakapo, a flightless parrot. From only 18 individuals in the 1970s, the projects breeding and research program has boosted numbers to a population 209 adults living on a predator- free islands (2020). Since February 2016, surviving kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç are kept on three predator-free islands, Whenua Hou/Codfish, Anchor and Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier islands, where they are closely monitored. In 2016 a record 47 chicks hatched and 33 were fledged. Digby promoted the idea to crowd fund a project to sequence the genome of every living adult kakapo as well as the genomes of 55 long-dead museum specimens from around the world. This will be the first time genomes will be sequenced for an entire species population and will allow the breeding program to be refined and improved. Takahe in Zealandia in Wellington.  Takahƒì recovery project  The Takahƒì is a stout, flightless bird which was thought extinct but found again in 1948 in the remote Murchison Mountains, Fiordland. Conservation efforts have continued but the birds still remain critically endangered with currently 300 adults known. Digby is the scientist on the Takahƒì Recovery project giving advice on topics such as population dynamics, genetics, predator-prey interactions, avian diseases, and trials of new transmitters.

It includes a duet by the unusual pairing of Crosby and Bowie on \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\". It was Crosby's final Christmas special, recorded just five weeks before his death on October 14, 1977. The special was introduced by his widow Kathryn Crosby and was broadcast in the United States on CBS on November 30, 1977, and in the United Kingdom on ITV on December 24, 1977. Overview Bing Crosby is surprised to receive a letter from a long-lost relative, Sir Percival Crosby, inviting the family to spend Christmas in England. Bing, his wife Kathryn and their three children ‚Äì Harry, Mary and Nathaniel ‚Äì fly off to Britain, reviewing their family history in song and hoping that the invitation is not a case of \\"mistaken identity\\". At Sir Percy's grand home, they meet Hudson, the butler; Mrs. Bridges, the cook; and Rose, the maid ‚Äì all of whom are portrayed by Stanley Baxter. Sir Percy's neighbor, David Bowie, stops by to play the piano, and Bing and Bowie chat about their musical tastes before singing a duet of \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\". Kathryn chats with Mrs. Bridges in the kitchen as the children continue looking for written proof of their relation to Sir Percy. Meanwhile, in the library, Bing is surprised to encounter the house's former owner, Charles Dickens, played by Ron Moody. They are soon joined by Twiggy, who comments on Dickens' wide array of memorable characters and several of Dickens' heroes and villains including Ebenezer Scrooge and Tiny Tim (from A Christmas Carol), Fagin and The Artful Dodger (from Oliver Twist), Nell Trent and Daniel Quilp (from The Old Curiosity Shop), then the trio sing \\"What Would You Be Without Me?\\" (from The Roar of the Greasepaint ‚Äì The Smell of the Crowd). Twiggy and Mary search the house's attic and find some Crosby family artifacts, and Bing and Twiggy sing \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\". Bing introduces David Bowie's music video to his current single \\"Heroes\\" from his album of the same name. Afterwards, Sir Percy (also played by Moody) finally arrives home and performs a rendition of \\"Side by Side by Side\\" with Bing and Kathryn. The family ghost, a court jester named Leslie who resembles an old pal of Bing's, stops by to crack a few jokes, and the Trinity Boys Choir soon arrives to join the family and guests on a medley featuring \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"Sleigh Ride\\", \\"Winter Wonderland\\", \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\", \\"Silver Bells\\", \\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\\" and \\"Carol of the Bells\\". The special concludes with Bing alone in the living room wishing the audience \\"hope and optimism\\" for the new year followed by the swan song performance of \\"White Christmas\\", his signature tune and the biggest hit of his career.Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas at Paley Center for Media Cast =The Crosby Family= *Bing Crosby *Kathryn Crosby *Harry Crosby *Mary Crosby *Nathaniel Crosby =Special Guests= *Twiggy ‚Äì Herself/Tiny Tim/The Artful Dodger/Nell Trent *David Bowie ‚Äì Himself *Ron Moody ‚Äì Charles Dickens/Ebenezer Scrooge/Fagin/Daniel Quilp/Sir Percival Crosby *Stanley Baxter ‚Äì Hudson/Mrs. Bridges/Rose/Leslie Townes Hope *Trinity Boys Choir Songs *\\"Crosby Ancestry Song\\" ‚Äì Bing Crosby and family *\\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" ‚Äì Bing Crosby and David Bowie *\\"Where Would You Be Without Me?\\" ‚Äì Bing Crosby, Twiggy and Ron Moody *\\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" ‚Äì Bing Crosby and Twiggy *\\"Heroes\\" (music video) ‚Äì David Bowie *\\"Side by Side by Side\\" ‚Äì Bing Crosby, Kathryn Crosby and Ron Moody *Trinity Boys Choir Christmas Medley: **\\"Jingle Bells\\" **\\"Sleigh Ride\\" **\\"Winter Wonderland\\" **\\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" **\\"Silver Bells\\" **\\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\\" **\\"Carol of the Bells\\" *\\"White Christmas\\" ‚Äì Bing Crosby \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" The recording of \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" by Crosby and Bowie is the special's musical highlight and has become a Christmas classic in the United States and United Kingdom and has been referred to by The Washington Post as \\"one of the most successful duets in Christmas music history\\". Originally, the song selected for them to sing as a duet was \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" but Bowie did not feel comfortable with the song and felt that his voice did not adapt well to it. Within an hour, the composer/lyricists Buz Kohan, Larry Grossman and Ian Fraser quickly came up with lyrics to \\"Peace on Earth\\" as a counterpart to Crosby and \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\". Crosby and Bowie met for the first time on the morning of the taping on September 11, 1977 at Elstree Studios; they rehearsed for an hour and recorded the song in just three takes. A few days after the taping, Crosby praised Bowie as a \\"clean-cut kid and a real fine asset to the show. He sings well, has a great voice and reads lines well\\". The track was eventually released as an official single in three different formats: *November 27, 1982: RCA Records first released \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" as a both a standard 7\\" single (backed with Bowie's \\"Fantastic Voyage\\") and as a 12-inch vinyl picture disc single. This first official commercial release of the track peaked at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. *November 14, 1995: Oglio Records released a special multimedia CD single of \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" which contained both standard full-length audio version and the full-length music video of the footage from the 1977 Christmas special accessible via CD-ROM drives. *November 9, 2010: Collector's Choice Music released a 7-inch single edition of \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" on red-colored vinyl in the United States, limited to 2,000 copies. The single proved to be one of Bowie's fastest selling singles, having sold 250,000 copies within its first month and being certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry one month after its release. The single has total estimated sales of 445,424 in the UK, giving Bowie one of his most successful singles. In the United States and Canada, \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" has since become a yearly staple on radio stations during the Christmas season. Production The special was taped September 11, 1977 at Elstree Studios in London, England. Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas would turn out to be the second posthumous music special CBS would air in 1977, airing a month after Elvis Presley's last television appearance, Elvis in Concert.

Career Tania Lineham taught science at James Hargest College in Invercargill, New Zealand, from 1990. She was awarded a Royal Society of New Zealand Science and Technology Teacher Fellowship in 1999 and the Prime Minister‚Äôs Science Teacher Prize in 2015. She had been a member of the Southland Science and Technology Fair Committee since 1991 and chief judge in 2014 and 2015. Lineham co-authored the Year Ten Science Study Guide for New Zealand students.  1999 Royal Society NZ Science and Technology Fellowship  The Royal Society administers these fellowships to enable up to 25 teachers each year to be released from school to participate in programmes with industry and research institutions. Lineham was one of 18 recipients and worked with the Southland Regional Council in their Adopt a Stream Program. The program encouraged schools to adopt a section of stream. Specially developed classroom and field activities and materials increased students' understanding and awareness of river issues. Lineham in teaching mode ‚Äì 2016  2015 Prime Minister‚Äôs Science Teacher Prize  Lineham won the Prime Minister's Science Teacher Prize in 2015. The New Zealand Government introduced these prizes in 2009 to raise the profile and prestige of science among New Zealanders. The Prime Minister‚Äôs Science Teacher Prize is awarded to \\"A registered teacher who has been teaching science, mathematics, technology, p≈´taiao, hangarau or pƒÅngarau learning areas of the New Zealand curriculum to school-age children in a primary, intermediate or secondary New Zealand registered school.\\" The award was for a number of aspects of Lineham's work: her mentoring of gifted and able students, but also for her efforts to make science valuable and engaging to all students. Her students have excelled in local, national and international science events. In addition she was recognised for her professional development and collegiate sharing.  Teaching philosophy  Lineham believed that students have to be engaged, and to do that, science has to be fun. Explosions and fizzing chemicals are part of the strategy to engage students. She maintained that one of the crucial skills teachers should nurture in 21st century students is the ability to think critically. During a 2015 podcast on Radio NZ Lineham explained that she and her colleagues had developed a science curriculum at James Hargest College to give students tools to make informed decisions, to critically analyse pseudoscience, to be able to identify hoaxes on the internet and to be good digital citizens. Lineham spoke at the New Zealand Skeptics Conference in Queenstown in December 2016.  Personal life  Lineham suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic disease that damages the liver. She received a liver transplant on Christmas Eve, 1995 in Brisbane, Australia. In rare cases the disease also affects the transplant organ and in 2017, twenty-two years after the first transplant she needed another. Lineham died on 11 April 2018, just three months after her second liver transplant.

This means that the golden surface shines strongly when the light hits it directly. It will also reflect the colour of light being shined. What this means is that it will look different under cold white light as compared to more natural soft yellow light. Heating and treatment There are no known heating or treatment methods for golden sheen sapphire. Testing of heat treatment on sample batches has resulted in diminishment of the gold sheen effect, reducing the appeal of the gemstone.

During World War II, Estonia was occupied by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941. After the war, Estonia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in September 1944. Mexico was one of the few countries that did not recognize the Soviet annexation of Estonia. In August 1991, Estonia obtained its independence after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Mexico soon recognized the independence of Estonia on 5 September 1991 and re-established diplomatic relations with the country on 5 December 1991. Since then, Mexico has been accredited to Estonia from its embassy in Helsinki, Finland and Estonia has been accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, D.C., United States.

Barely twelve years old, Ulrich also lost his mother, which made the boy practically destitute. Nevertheless, he first came to the Catholic High School St. Matthias in Breslau, where he received scholarship support and free instruction, but had to carry out church music. He worked as an alto there and had to play the organ at the Gymnasiumgottesdienst. Here he also received the first lessons in continuo by then organist Moritz Brosig. To the great grief of his guardian Kotzoldt and his kin, he neglected other subjects for the sake of music, so he was transferred to Glogau in 1846 to complete grammar school. In the same year, he successfully completed his AbiturientenexamenMendel-Reissmann Musikalisches Conversations-Lexikon, Volume 10. Oppenheim, Berlin 1878, p.370 and moved to Berlin to study music there. The Wroclaw University Music Director, Mosewius, who taught him to sing, and his patrons, had recommended the young Ulrich to the then most famous Berlin music professor, Adolf Bernhard Marx. However, he did not accept him as a student, allegedly only because he could not pay him the desired fee. On the recommendation of Giacomo Meyerbeer, who was then Director General of the Berlin Opera, he studied with the highly respected musical theorist and composition teacher Siegfried Dehn at the Stern Conservatory for more than two years. =Living and creating= Dealing with Siegfried Dehn was fruitful to Hugo Ulrich. Ulrich's B minor Symphony, which appeared in 1852, soon made the round of the concerts of Germany, and with his Symphonie Triomphale he won the grand prize of the Royal Belgian Academy in Brussels in 1853. When he attended the public premiere in Brussels on September 27, 1853, he received the enthusiastic applause of the public; the same success was received by this symphony at every performance in other places. From then on, the new composer's new creations were eagerly awaited. In September, 1855, he was finally destined to travel to the land of his longing, to Italy, which he entered with great plans for new works. He lived in Venice, Turin, Genoa, Rome and Milan. Inspired by the \\"land of wonders\\", he soon began to work again: an opera: \\"Bertran de Born,\\" to which Max Ring had written the text, occupied him seriously, among others, until external circumstances brought him back to Germany. In March 1858 he returned to Berlin, but soon lost the joy of his youth almost entirely, probably because of the excessive self-demands, which put him under great pressure because of his earlier successes. Between February 1859 and April 1862, he taught compositionList of Teachers at the Stern Conservatory (1850-1936). at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, where he had previously studied himself.He was demonstrably taught by Dehn, but does not appear in the student lists of the Stern's Conservatory. Among his most famous pupils was Hermann Goetz. However, he soon gave up teaching completely because his incipient kidney disease was going to make teaching more difficult. From then on, he devoted himself chiefly to arrangements for piano, in which he worked in his apartment in Berlin, to be sent to his publishers Leupertz in Breslau and C. F. Peters in Leipzig. He was still able to finish most of his opera and also began a third symphony in G major, which however was not completed. Ulrich died at the age of 45 (after Mendel-Reissmann) on 23 March 1872.Mendel-Reissmann Musikalisches Conversations-Lexikon, Volume 10. Oppenheim, Berlin 1878, p.371. On the other hand, other sources indicate May 23, 1872, as his date of death.Riemann, Hugo. Musiklexikon. Hesse, Berlin. 1916. He was buried in Berlin-Wedding at the Catholic cemetery in Liesenstra√üe. =Reception= Hugo Ulrich was regarded by his contemporaries as \\"one of the most gifted contemporary composers\\",Mendel- Reissmann Musikalisches Conversations-Lexikon, Volume 10. Oppenheim, Berlin 1878, p.369 according to Hermann Mendel. In his Musikalischen Konversationslexikon there is an extensive article devoted to Ulrich, which until now remained the most detailed account of Ulrich's life. Today, Hugo Ulrich is mainly known for his numerous (more than 200) piano arrangements for two and four hands of various works, including complete sets of symphonies and quartets by Haydn and Mozart in practical home editions.

The total area consists of five hundreds islands, with more than 1,000km of coastline. A large tidal flat, an important habitat for marine animals and rare migratory birds, also supports fishing and salt production for local people. Ecology There are four distinct ecological zones in the reserve. The temperate evergreen broadleaf forest includes dominant species such as Castanopsis cuspidata, silver magnolia, and camellia trees. There are also herbaceous plants such as Ardisia japonica, Hedera rhombea, Saeri trees, and Kalopanax pictus. The dune vegetation zone includes Ischaemum anthephoroides, Zoysia macrostachya, Vitex rotundifolia, Calystegia soldanella, Messerschmidia sibirica, and a colony of Carex kobomugi on Jeungdo Island. Several unusual species, including Phragmites communis and Vitex rotundifolia are distributed throughout the dunes. There are a number of uninhabited islands that contain evergreen coniferous forest zones. This zone includes a colony of Japanese black pine trees on the seashores and hill sides. The tidal flat zone includes wetland and coastal areas. Phragmites reed communities are dominant in wetland areas. In the coastal area, various saltmarsh plants are developing such as halophyte communities. Many biological organisms are in the inter-tidal zone. The surface of the tidal flat is an important habitat for diatoms and plankton. Due to the complexity of ecological circulation and the food chain, many shells and invertebrate are found here. The biosphere reserves has two sites that are part of the RAMSAR Wetland Convention, Jangdo Island High Moor and Jeungdo Tidal Flat. Socio- economic characteristics Research is being conducted in order to develop areas for mountain climbing and recreation. Businesses based on indigenous knowledge are conducted within the tidal flats and Dadohae National Park. Sun dried salt is a local specialty that is produced in the tidal flats. Eco- friendly fishery and fish breeding is conducted in the transitional areas.

He is a director of VetSouth, one of two clinical research clinics in the South Island and Adjunct Senior Lecturer in Dairy Cattle Medicine at Massey University. In 2013 he was a finalist in the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.  Career  Bryan qualified as a veterinarian in Glasgow, Scotland in 1988 and worked in intensive dairy practice in the North of England. He moved to Waikato, New Zealand in 1995. In he 2004 gained his Masters in Epidemiology from Massey University in Palmerston North. Bryan moved to New Zealand in 1995 and to his current practice in 1997. Bryan identified that many rural practices had difficulty in retaining staff. From 1997 when he joined Central Southland Vets in Winton, heading up the dairy side of the practice, to 2001, when he became a director, the practice had doubled in veterinarian numbers and quadrupled in dairy farm numbers. He is the Managing Director of VetSouth. VetSouth was formed in 2005 when the Winton practice joined with a practice in nearby Gore. Creating VetSouth was about elevating rural vet practice with the dual effect of being able to retain the best staff in a rural setting and to ensure that farmers receive first rate veterinary services. The size also makes it possible for the practice to both participate in research and to more readily test new ideas such as improving the measurement of body condition scores (BCS) in dairy cows. Bryan was aware of the XLvet concept from the UK that bought together the most progressive vet practices working together to provide veterinary services. Bryan brought the concept to New Zealand. With significant resources available, Bryan and VetSouth have been instrumental in developing Welfarm in conjunction with XLvets. Welfarm is a program that measures the wellbeing of dairy cows. In 2014/15 the program ran with 150 farms and 84,325 cows. With these numbers, it is possible now to do accurate benchmarking that should lead to better outcomes for the cows, the farms and the industry. It was planned that the program with the support of the New Zealand Veterinary Association would go national. As of December 2016 the program is still to be implemented. Bryan's veterinary service created an app called Disease and Mortality Incident Tracker, or dam-iT, to capture disease and mortality data in production animals. This project will provide a baseline of normal mortality rates on NZ farms as there are no national disease statistics. Creation of the app was partly prompted by deaths on HT [herbicide tolerant] swedes and fodder beet in 2014 and following years. VetSouth has been running the Welfarm pilot for 3 years and have identified the use of antibiotics as an issue to address. The New Zealand Veterinary Association, which Bryan is a board member, has recently announced that they are aiming to phase out the use of non- essential antibiotic usage by 2030.Their strategic intent is that ‚Äúby 2030, NZ Inc would not need antibiotics for the maintenance of animal health and welfare‚Äù. In 2018 Bryan was active in discussion around the management of Mycoplasma bovis. Bryan is active in the veterinary and general communities promoting animal welfare and good veterinary practices. He is active in community building and in promoting the welfare of veterinarians in general. He spoke at the 2015 Pan Pacific Veterinary Conference and at the NZ Skeptics Conference in 2016.

The Japanese arms export ban, known as the three arms exports ban,Êï∞Á†îÂá∫ÁâàÁ∑®ÈõÜÈÉ® „ÄéÊñ∞Ë™≤Á®ã 4„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∏ÊºîÁøí„Éé„Éº„Éà Áèæ‰ª£Á§æ‰ºö Ëß£Á≠îÁ∑®„Äè Êï∞Á†îÂá∫Áâà„ÄÅ2012Âπ¥„ÄÅ18È†Å„ÄÇ is a de facto law that governs Japanese export of military hardware outside of the country.https://www.ndl.go.jp/jp/diet/publication/issue/pdf/0726.pdf The basis of the ban is the Three Principles on Arms Exports adopted by the National Diet of Japan in 1967 dealing with situations in which arms cannot be exported from Japan. The three principles are that arms exports were not allowed to go to: # Communist bloc countries # Countries under arms exports embargo under United Nations Security Council resolutions # Countries involved in or likely to be involved in international conflicts History =After World War II= After the end of World War II, Japan exported some Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck (Ky≈´) jeeps as part of war reparations to the Philippines and to South Vietnam. =Vietnam war= As it had done during the Korean War in the 1950s, during the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Japan sold a large amount of materials to American forces. In 1966, it was reported by the Xinhua News Agency that up to 92% of the napalm being used in Vietnam was manufactured in Japan, and Nippon Yushi Corporation in Aichi prefecture was the suspected manufacturer. The company denied it was producing napalm, but the secretary-general of the plant's union stated that \\"almost anyone\\" could produce napalm using the chemicals produced by the company. Mainichi Shimbun found no proof that napalm bombs were being produced in Japan, but in 1966 the United States did ask for 4,000 Korean War-era napalm bombs at a former US Air Force base to be handed back. =Tightening of restrictions= In 1976, the government of Japan announced that arms exports not restricted by the three principles would also be restrained. Aside from some technology transfers to the United States, Japan banned all arms exports. However, after the Japan Air Self-Defense Force retired their Lockheed F-104J/DJ Starfighter aircraft, thirty-six of them were provided to the Taiwanese Air Force. =Loosening of restrictions= On April 1, 2014, the total ban on arms exports was ended by the government of Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe under the Three Principles on Arms Exports to Three Principles on Defense Equipment Transfers according to the guidelines of the National Security Strategy adopted on December 17, 2013. Following this, Japan made moves to sell S≈çry≈´-class submarines to Australia and Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft to the United Kingdom, but these attempts were not successful. The SDF Law was amended to allow the sale of JSDF equipment at prices lower than the JSDF's original purchase price. Arms exports =United States= Two retired MH-53E helicopters of the Japan Maritime Self- Defense Force were sold to the United States Navy in 2015 for their components. The United States was running short of parts for its own fleet of the aging aircraft. On December 24, 2018, it was announced that Tokyo was seriously considering selling their F-15s to Washington in order to acquire funds to purchase F-35s. Washington would consider selling the F-15s to friendly countries with weak air forces. =Philippines= The JMSDF planned to lease at least five TC-90 aircraft to the Philippines to conduct maritime patrols. From November 2016, to November 2017, six Philippine Navy pilots were trained to fly the aircraft at Tokushima Airport. Maintenance staff were also trained. Two aircraft were transferred free of charge in March 2017, and three more were to be transferred in 2018. The aircraft were ultimately donated rather than leased. The Ground Self-Defense Force retired its UH-1H helicopters in 2012. The Philippines had planned to buy 16 new Bell 412 EPI helicopters from Canada, but the deal collapsed. Canada was concerned about how the helicopters would be used. In 2017, Japan offered to supply around 40,000 spare parts for UH-1H aircraft to the Philippines. In 2018 it was announced that Japan would supply the parts to the Philippines free of charge. In March 2019, it was reported that an initial delivery of parts to the Philippine Air Force had been made and more parts were to arrive in August 2019. According to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, the Philippines is the first nation in the ASEAN nation to get military equipment from Japan. =India= There are also efforts to sell the ShinMaywa US-2 military flying boats to India. =New Zealand= New Zealand expressed interest in the Kawasaki C-2 aircraft and the Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft. New Zealand chose the P-8 Poseidon rather than the Kawasaki P-1. =Thailand= In 2016, efforts to sell an air-defense radar manufactured by Mitsubishi to Thailand were unsuccessful. =United Arab Emirates= There were attempts to sell the C-2 to the United Arab Emirates.

He is the Chairman of Omnicom Media Group MENA, the media services division of the Omnicom Group. He worked within the advertising industry at Omnicom Group's agency BBDO after he received his MBA in 1988. In 2002, he went from the creative to the media side of Omnicom Group to launch OMD, a media communications group. It develops marketing campaigns using digital, mobile, and television advertising and, more recently, employing performance marketing. Omnicom has been ranked one of the best places to work in the United Arab Emirates for several years. Khouri sits on boards that support the organisation's corporate social responsibility program. He has received several awards and honors from Forbes Middle East and Arabian Business, and he is considered an influential marketing executive in the Arab world.  Early life and education Born on May 8, 1964, Khouri lived on the east side of Beirut, where his father worked as a chef. The Lebanese Civil War broke out when he was 11-years-old, but he stayed in Beirut because his family did not have the money to relocate. From a young age, Khouri sold firecrackers, canned food, drinks, and clothing to make pocket money. During the raids, there was a food shortage, so he started to sell tuna and beef in his neighborhood. With the proceeds, he bought clothes, which he later sold at a profit. He attended the American University of Beirut (AUB), where he received a BBA in 1986 and an MBA in business and finance in 1988. On his way to classes at AUB, he was often in danger due to snipers in the area and he once escaped a kidnapping attempt. While attending the university, Khouri worked at a financial trading company, which dealt with trading currencies, securities and bonds.  Career  = Early career = After graduation, Khouri went to Cyprus to work for Lance de Masi at BBDO, an advertising agency that is part of the Omnicom Group. He pursued this job because he found it more interesting than finance, and the move would take him away from the civil war. Also, the banking industry had become unstable due to the global financial crisis of the late 1980s. He travelled frequently for TV commercial shoots to New York, Los Angeles and London for clients like Yves Saint Laurent and Pepsi. In 1992, Khouri moved to Dubai, where he worked at Impact BBDO in a senior role. He returned to Beirut in 1996 and for the next four years served as the associate managing partner of Impact BBDO. =Omnicom= Khouri returned to Dubai in 2001 and later established OMD (Optimum Media Direction), by unbundling Omnicom's media departments within its full-service agencies. The company develops advertising campaigns for its clients. Arabian Business states that \\"Khouri ditched a glamorous job in the advertising industry to set up the media agency OMD.\\" This occurred when media was a minor consideration in communication planning. With the wider use of technology, media became an important element in planning advertising campaigns. Starcom was the leading media agency in the Middle East until 2005, when OMD took the lead. The global roll-out of Omnicom Media Group's other media brand, PHD, by early 2006, saw the addition of an office in Dubai to the existing ones in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The Omnicom Media Group MENA (Middle East and North Africa), a regional holding company, was established. It reports to the Omnicom Media Group in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which is based in London. In 2006, Khouri moved from his regional managing director role at OMD to assume the leadership of the Omnicom Media Group MENA. In 2007, Khouri was made regional managing director of Omnicom Media Group and was subsequently appointed as CEO in 2010. The company had eight offices in six countries; and employed 450 people by 2012. By the following year, it had launched Resolution, which specializes in social and mobile advertising and programmatic buying, which are forms of performance marketing. It uses OMD Predicts and PHD BrainScape to share intellectual property. Omnicom grew more than 30% in 2013 to $2.5 billion. In 2016, OMG opened a Dubai operation for the holding's latest agency brand, Hearts & Science, with the Egyptian food company Americana as its first client. In 2018, the group had grown to 24 offices in 16 countries, with some 700 staff. It has actively been investing in data analytics, including technology, software and infrastructure, and data acquisition; content; and programmatic trading. Khouri explained in an interview how the media agency role had moved from buying media cheaply to generating tangible business performance. In 2019, he was promoted to Chairman of the Group. Khouri is a regular commentator on industry trends and one of the leading media executives in the Middle East. In a 2019 interview, he warned the Middle Eastern marketing industry about the growing share of advertising investments going to global digital platforms and its impact on the local media ecosystem. The group also shares and promotes its intellectual property and thought leadership with its stakeholders, notably by staging events like OMD Predicts and PHD BrainScape and publishing white papers. =Workplace strategies= In 2012 and 2013, Omnicom Media Group MENA was named as one of the best places to work, according to the annual list issued by the Great Place to Work institute (GPTW) in the United Arab Emirates. The company maintained its ranking as the third best place to work from 2014 to 2016. In 2017, the company progressed further to reach the second place in the ranking. Khouri credits the organization's success to their \\"team's happiness at work.\\" Khouri supports improving the rate at which women are employed within the industry and the Middle East. The rate at which women are employed for top positions also varies by country within the region. It is his goal to have an equal number of women and men in senior positions in his organization by 2020. =Industry organisations= Omnicom developed its corporate social responsibility (CSR) program‚Äîbased upon community, environmental, and corporate behaviour objectives‚Äîand supports several arts and educational institutions. The company received the Best First Time Sustainability Report award for its inaugural Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) report at the recently held at the Asia Sustainability Reporting Awards in 2016. Khouri became a board member of Injaz-UAE, an organisation dedicated to educating students about workforce readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy, and START, a non-profit organisation established by Art Dubai and the Al Madad Foundation. He has also served as a board member of the United Arab Emirates chapter of the International Advertising Association (IAA). In 2017, he was named to the board of the UAE affiliate of Endeavor, the global non-profit organization that supports high-impact entrepreneurs. = Awards and honors = He was awarded Media CEO of the year by CEO Middle East magazine in 2008. He was ranked 78th in Top 100 Global Meets Local by Forbes in 2013. Two years later, Forbes ranked him 25th in the same Top 100 list. In 2016, he was 52nd on the list and 40th in 2019. He was named as one of the most admired CEO's in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) by CEO Middle East magazine in 2009. In 2011, he ranked 2nd in the 50 most powerful people in media by Communicate magazine. Khouri ranked 31st in the 500 most powerful Arabs in 2011 and was 23rd in the list by Arabian Business of 2013. Later in the year, Khouri also received the award for ‚ÄòMedia and Marketing CEO of the Year‚Äô at the Gulf Business Industry Awards. LinkedIn included Elie Khouri in its UAE 2016 Power Profiles list. In recognition for the company's consistent performance in the UAE ranking, the Great Place to Work Institute gave Elie Khouri its inaugural Leader of the Year Award in 2017.  Personal life  =Family= Khouri is divorced and has three daughters. =Art= Khouri is an art patron and collector. His international collection includes contemporary paintings, sculptures and design objects. Some of the works from his collection are displayed at Omnicom Media Group MENA headquarters in Dubai. He supports the Association for the Promotion and Exhibition of the Arts in Lebanon (APEAL), a non-profit organisation dedicated to showcasing and encouraging Lebanese artists. Khouri is a member of the Tate Middle East North Africa Acquisitions Committee and the MoMA Director's Council, as well as an Art Dubai patron.

Censorship in Guatemala remains a problem in the country today. Guatemalan news reporters have faced government led censorship and other types of censorship, often in the form of intimidation, since the beginning of the Guatemalan Civil War. In Guatemala today, reporters often must contend with legal harassment, threats, and in the worst cases, assault or murder, originating from the government, large businesses, and the cartels. Newspapers and radio stations face the most harassment in the country, as television in Guatemala is owned almost exclusively by Angel Gonz√°lez Gonz√°lez, a conservative foreign businessman, whose success in the country is due to cooperation with the government.Rockwell, Rick J., and Noreene Janus. \\"Chapter 5.\\" Media Power in Central America. Urbana: U of Illinois, 2003. N. pag. Print. These aggressions, combined with the government's lack of response or punishment for perpetrators, have led to a culture of self-censorship for reporters in the country. Censorship during the Guatemalan Civil War The Guatemalan Civil War, fought from 1960‚Äì1996, put into power a series of dictators who tried to control the media through a combination of censorship laws and violence. During the thirty-six years of violence in the country, three hundred and twenty four journalists were killed, while a hundred and twenty-six are still missing. So far, no one has been held accountable for any of these deaths or disappearances, although the Guatemalan government has been implicated in the cases of both Irma Flaquer and Jorge Carpio Nicolle. Another form of censorship used during the 1980s was defamation, when \\"government agents would accuse certain journalists as destabilizers of democracy, connections with cartels, or just attempt to humiliate them, as tactics to disqualify their integrity and morality as journalists.\\" In 1987, the government of General Efra√≠n R√≠os Montts‚Äô ordered the censorship of any news relating to leftist guerrillas or \\"commentaries related to subversive activities occurring in the country.\\" In May 1993, President Jorge Serrano ordered the censorship of both daily newspapers and broadcast media.Buckman, Robert. \\"Returning To The Fold?.\\" Editor & Publisher 127.14 (1994): 18. MasterFILE Premier. Web. 27 Oct. 2016. In protest, newspapers would run their stories with the blacked out marks made by the censors that the President had installed at their companies, although some accepted the presidents offer of self-censorship. Self-censorship was prevalent to journalists in Guatemala, due to the violence faced by those who would criticize the government. Juan Lopez, the President of Guatemalan Federation of Radio Stations in 1991, said of self-censorship regarding his programs, \\"of course self-censorship govern all our programs: we want to avoid provoking reprisals at all cost. There are certain subjects we can‚Äôt take on board.\\"Hopkinson, Amanda. \\"Guatemala: Expanding the Air Waves.\\" Index on Censorship 20.9 (1991): 28. Censorship from 1996-present From the end of the war to present, many of the modes of censorship in Guatemala have remained the same, though journalists and human rights activists believe that freedom of the press is stronger now then it was during the war. Censorship in the form of intimidation is still prevalent in Guatemala, where there have been 24 murdered journalists between 2000‚Äì2013, all unsolved. In March 2015, protests were held in Guatemala City and Mazatenago in retaliation to three journalists who were murdered in connection to a money laundering scandal one of the journalists was investigating. CERIGUA reported 117 cases of violence against journalists in November 2015, up from 74 cases the previous year, specifying, \\"that police and political parties were among the primary aggressors.\\"@FreedomHouseDC. \\"Guatemala\\" Freedom House. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Oct. 2016. Censorship also comes in the form of legal threats in present-day Guatemala, where the government uses legal restrictions under Article 35 to target media organizations and the journalists that work for them. Journalists often face libel and defamation cases, though politicians will uses bribery, money laundering, and trafficking to take journalists to court \\"with the express purpose of harassment.\\" Jos√© Rub√©n Zamora, along with facing numerous physical threats throughout his career, had criminal charges filed against him by the president and vice president for his coverage of the government.Rodriguez, George. \\"'Enough,' Says Guatemala Journalist Group, Citing Pre-election Threats -.\\" The Tico Times  Costa Rica News  Travel  Real Estate.

The government also formed Foundation Against Media Terrorism in 2015, which \\"journalists interpreted as an attempt to increase control over the press.\\" Amid complaints from human rights‚Äô groups, the foundation was disbanded in the same year. Also in Guatemala, \\"there is an unspoken collective censorship on three topics: cartels, organized crime, and corporate companies. Those topics are off limits for the main reason of personal safety.\\" This self-censorship is out of fear of retaliation by powerful groups in Guatemala. Red zones in the countryside also exist in Guatemala, areas controlled by the cartels where no is allowed to enter unless given permission, including journalists. Mention of cartel groups by journalists often comes with threats or harassment.  Notes  References *Buckman, Robert. \\"Returning To The Fold?.\\" Editor & Publisher 127.14 (1994): 18.

Although it only lasted 3‚Äì4 years, it left a deep impact and impression. Local people have dubbed the years from 1992 to 1995 in different ways, such as \\"hungry\\", \\"cold\\", and \\"bad\\", but the most common title used is \\"the dark.\\" During this period, the population of Armenia and Artsakh had to make do with well water, candles, and cut wood for their needs. Many creative solutions came to exist to deal with the severe lack of electricity (1‚Äì2 hours a day) and lack of other basic resources.  The Energy Crisis  On 20 February 1988, the Karabakh movement officially started as the Supreme Council of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, which was ethnically Armenian, voted to request to transfer its jurisdiction from Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. On 7 December of the same year, an earthquake of 6.9 magnitude occurred centered in the town of Spitak in Armenia, leaving 25,000 people dead and 500,000 people homeless. The Metsamor NPP, which was 100 km away from the epicenter of the earthquake, had had a safe shutdown, and had no damages according to the authorities and the IAEA. However, due to the panic that was raised afterwards and protests by the Green party of Armenia, it was officially decided to shut down both units of Metsamor, the only nuclear power plant of Armenia providing about 36% of the electricity needs of the country at the time. Unit 1 of ANPP was shut down in February 1989 and Unit 2 followed in March 1989. Armenian independence from the Soviet Union came on September 21, 1991, when the war over Nagorno- Karabakh was in full fledge. Armenia's energy supply during the Soviet Union was designed as an integrated part of the Trans-Caucasus electrical grid. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and because of the lack of internal energy supply, Armenia faced a critical situation.\\" Turkey and Azerbaijan closed their borders with Armenia, putting a fuel embargo on the country. Azerbaijan blocked a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan which was flowing through Azerbaijan, effectively cutting off about 90% of the natural gas supply of the country. During the clash, which lasted until May 1994, Azerbaijan blockaded roads, rail lines and energy supplies, leading to severe energy shortages in Armenia. Attempt was made to direct gas pipelines from Georgia to Armenia. However, Georgia's internal conflicts lent themselves to failure of the project on multiple occasions. From late January to mid-March 1993, Azerbaijani saboteurs blew up the gas pipeline that was crossing Marneuli, a region of Georgia populated with Azerbaijani, seven times. With thermal and nuclear power stations unable to function, Armenia was left to rely almost entirely on its hydro power resources, at a great environmental expense to one of the country's greatest natural resources, Lake Sevan. There was also the issue of providing daily subsistence to the public besides energy, as the whole country was short of bread. People had to wait in queues for a very long time, because there was no bread, and sometimes the queues could last for a few days. Many basic necessities such as sugar and eggs were also in scarcity. By the winter of 1994‚Äì95, Yerevan residents had access to electricity for only 1‚Äì2 hours a day. Each district had its own set time for electricity availability.  Recovery  The energy crisis ended when Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 was brought back online in October 1995, making it the only reactor in the world that was restarted after closing. The restart of the NPP increased the electricity available to the public to 10‚Äì12 hours a day. The electricity supply then increased to 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. The bombing of pipelines by Azerbaijanis coming from Georgia also stopped afterwards as it did not have the same effect as before, since Armenia was not as reliant on the pipeline system anymore.Sargsyan, Gevorg; Hankinson, Denzel; Balabanyan, Ani (2006). \\"From Crisis to Stability in the Armenian Power Sector Lessons Learned from Armenia‚Äôs Energy Reform Experience\\" (PDF). The World Bank. Retrieved 11 December 2016. Furthermore, other power plants, such as Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant, Vorotan Cascade and Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade, provided daily load capacity, while Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant provided base load capacity. Thermal power plants operated to provide electricity in winter when electricity demand was peak, as it was quite a cold winter in Armenia. Although these times have passed, Armenia still relies on imported resources like gas and oil, which had collapsed the whole electricity production system in the 1990s. All the imported gas and oil is supplied from Russia via Georgia. Only a small amount of gas is supplied by Iran.Gharabegian, Areg (8 October 2006). \\"Electricity Production In Armenia\\" (PDF). reporter.am. Retrieved 11 December 2016.  Aftermath  The Armenian electricity system reached 3914 MW of installed (full) capacity. However, only 2845 MW (73%) is currently operating. Electricity is mainly produced from 3 sources: nuclear (34%), thermal (32%) and hydro (34%). Over the past few years this number has increased as many new power plants have been constructed. Currently, Gas- powered turbines provide 25% of Armenia's electricity. These turbines not only produce a large amount of electricity, but they are also very efficient, which in turn has reduced the price for 1 kWh from 400 AMD to 160-170 AMD. There are also a few small power plants with a capacity of 50 MW. One is Yerevan Thermoelectric Plant, which produces electricity mainly for Nairit Chemical Plant. The other is Vanadzor Thermoelectric Plant, which is not currently operational, but will operate for Vanadzor Chemical Plant when it opens. Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant produces approximately 440 MW of electricity at full capacity, but only 1 of the units (the 2nd unit) is operating. The largest portion of electricity production comes from hydropower plants. The largest hydropower plants in Armenia are Sevan-Hrazdan and Vorotan cascades, which can produce up to 960 MW of electricity. The Armenian electricity sector was in a real crisis from 1990‚Äì1995, but people were able to survive in such conditions, and now have a reliable electricity supply system.

It is taken by mouth, but can also be given by injection into muscle. Side effects of DMAU include mild weight gain and mild decreases in levels of HDL (\\"good\\") cholesterol.https://www.livescience.com/62062-male-birth-control- pill-dmau.html It may also cause low estrogen levels and associated symptoms such as reduced sexual function and decreased bone mineral density. DMAU is an AAS, and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone. It is also a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. Due to its androgenic and progestogenic activity, DMAU has antigonadotropic effects. These effects result in reversible suppression of sperm production and are responsible for the contraceptive effects of DMAU in men. The medication has no estrogenic activity. DMAU is a prodrug of dimethandrolone. DMAU was first described in 2002. It was developed by the Contraceptive Development Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, an agency in the United States government. Medical uses DMAU is an experimental medication and is not currently approved for medical use. It is under development for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive, specifically as a birth control pill for men. The medication has been found to profoundly and rapidly reversibly suppress testicular testosterone production in men when taken by mouth once per day for a month.https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/2018/dimethandrolone- undecanoate-shows-promise-as-a-male-birth-control-pill The circulating levels of testosterone achieved with oral DMAU were equivalent to those seen on average with surgical castration (13.4 ng/dL for DMAU, 15 ng/dL for castration). Following discontinuation of DMAU, testosterone levels began to recover within days and reached normal levels within a month. Testicular testosterone production is essential for spermatogenesis and fertility in men. Suppression of spermatogenesis and the actual contraceptive effects of DMAU in men have not yet been clinically assessed, but future studies are being planned to confirm the contraceptive effectiveness of the medication. In addition to male contraception, there has also been interest in the potential use of DMAU in androgen replacement therapy for low testosterone levels in men. Side effects In a clinical study, DMAU was found to be well tolerated when administered to men for a month. Side effects included mild weight gain (between 3 and 9 pounds) and mild decreases in levels of HDL (\\"good\\") cholesterol. No major or serious side effects were observed.https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-male-birth-control- pill-safe-does-it- work-n858076http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/sc-hlth-male- birth-control-pill-0328-story.html Because DMAU is not 5Œ±-reduced, in contrast to testosterone, it may have less risk of scalp hair loss. =Low estrogen levels= Because DMAU suppresses testosterone levels and by extension estrogen levels in men but has no estrogenic activity of its own, it may pose a risk of symptoms of low estrogen levels such as sexual dysfunction (e.g., decreased sex drive, reduced erectile function) and osteoporosis. Reduced sexual function and decreased bone mineral density have been observed with the closely related medication trestolone, which has low estrogenicity similarly to DMAU. =Liver toxicity= Unlike testosterone but similarly to 17Œ±-alkyated AAS like methyltestosterone (17Œ±-methyltestosterone), DMAU has been found to produce some effects indicative of potential liver toxicity when it was administered orally to animals. However, the effects were significantly less than those of methyltestosterone. Both DMAU and trestolone (7Œ±-methyl-19-nortestosterone) showed potential signs of liver toxicity whereas 11Œ≤-methyl-19-nortestosterone 17Œ≤-dodecylcarbonate showed few to no such effects, suggesting that the C7Œ± methyl group of DMAU and trestolone could be an important contributing factor to their liver toxicity potential. In any case, however, in a clinical study, DMAU was found to be safe in terms of liver and kidney function when administered to men for a month. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= DMAU is an androgen ester, specifically an ester of dimethandrolone, and acts as a prodrug of dimethandrolone in the body. As such, it is an AAS, or an agonist of the androgen receptor, and is also a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptor. Due to these activities, DMAU has potent antigonadotropic effects, and is able to powerfully suppress testosterone levels.https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/endo/71838 This results in suppression of spermatogenesis and is responsible for its hormonal contraceptive effects in men. The medication is not aromatized and has no estrogenic activity. In addition, it is not a substrate for 5Œ±-reductase and hence is not potentiated or inactivated in tissues that express 5Œ±-reductase like skin, hair follicles, and the prostate gland. As such, DMAU may have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects and androgen-dependent conditions such as acne, pattern scalp hair loss, body hair growth, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostate cancer relative to testosterone and certain other AAS. =Pharmacokinetics= A pharmacokinetic study of DMAU in men found that only 2 to 3% of the drug was hydrolyzed into dimethandrolone when it was administered orally in the form of powder in capsules. In contrast, hydrolysis of testosterone undecanoate into testosterone is rapid and appears to be complete. The difference in conversion efficiency with DMAU relative to testosterone undecanoate is attributed to steric hindrance in DMAU caused by its additional C7Œ± and C11Œ≤ methyl groups. Although the hydrolysis of DMAU into dimethandrolone was very limited, it was still sufficient to produce dose-dependent biological effects at the dosages assessed, including reversible suppression of luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels. A subsequent pharmacokinetic study found that the conversion of DMAU into dimethandrolone was improved when the drug was delivered orally in castor oil/benzyl benzoate or a self-emulsifying drug delivery system contained in capsules as opposed to powder in capsules.Ayoub, R.

The movie is about a Kurdish guerilla fighter who deserted her military unit aiming at leaving the conflict region (Eastern Turkey) for the city of Izmir.  Plot  The movie opens with nature shots of clouds over the mountains in Turkey accompanied by heavy organ music. It seems to be fall time. The few minutes of the movie are shots of animals accompanied by the same music. A praying mantis is the first animal that appears, followed by a turtle, a grasshopper, the sounds of birds chirping, a male deer and a gecko. The sound of the chirping birds is the first \\"nature\\" sound heard in the film as opposed to the music which opens the film. A woman appears behind the leaves of trees of the mountain forest. It is not easy to identify any of her characteristics other than the fact that she is wearing a red scarf on her head. The peace is suddenly disrupted by explosions and gunfire. The gecko and the snake go into hiding. Shots of people (later revealed to be the Kurdish guerrilla's living in the mountains) running away from the explosions and gunfire follow. The convoy vehicles from which the gunfire was coming from drive away. The Kurdish guerilla's are now more clearly in view and are seen wearing the same items of clothing (nude colored jumpers and boots). Night falls and the guerilla's are in a cave. This is the first point in the movie where human speech is first heard in the form of a Kurdish song: My lovely mother tell me how are you regards to my father and to my brothers. Your father and I have grown old life is bitter to us enough sweetheart come back. After singing this song, the main character (J√Æn) is seen running away from the armed organization she was previously fighting and living in the caves with. She runs away in the cover of the dark. The reason for her fleeing is unknown. At approximately the 13 minute mark of the movie, J√Æn's face is clearly revealed for the first time. She runs into the deer, decides not to shoot it, and the two make eye contact. J√Æn is now wandering alone in the forest, searching for food. She hears a bird screeching (presumably a hawk), climbs into the tree its sounds are coming from, and goes to steal the bird's eggs from the nest. There are three eggs and although initially she plans on taking all three, she returns two and eats only one upon hearing the crying of the bird. It is as if they have a mutual understanding of each other's needs and they come to a compromise (J√Æn needs to eat, the egg's belong to the bird). After eating her \\"meal\\" she is ready to climb back down to the forest floor and continue her journey on foot. However, she quickly climbs back upon seeing the Turkish soldiers coming into her area and setting up camp. One of the soldiers sings. Were you the one who always cried and burned I couldn't laught either in this world of lies did you think I was happy in a world that stole my life over nothing. Oh in this world of lies, world of lies in this world that fakes a smile to your face you cried dear and I burned I though the world would be how I wished it I believed for no reason I was tricked over nothing In this world that takes its color from the sky. This is the second time in the movie there is human speech. Up to this point however, it has only been in the form of song. The soldiers are alerted by something and leave in a hurry. J√Æn, now safe, continues her journey. The first person she interacts with after being alone since fleeing the guerrillas is a shepherd boy. He gives her bread and calls her sister. She asks where the nearest village is and he points her in its direction. This is the first appearance of human speech in the movie. As she is walking away from him, someone fires shots at her (probably a Turkish soldier). The gecko appears again. She sees a house in the distance and waits for its owners to leave. Upon seeing them leave in a green truck, she goes inside and starts taking items like clothes, food, books, and money. She is in a girls room indicated by the girls clothes and the framed picture on the desk. J√Æn does not seems scared that she will be caught. Suddenly, inside the house, she hears an elderly woman calling for her granddaughter Leyla. J√Æn talks to the grandmother and helps her take her medication. The grandmother believes that J√Æn is her granddaughter Leyla. J√Æn takes this opportunity to call her mother, telling her not to cry or worry. The grandmother calls from Leyla (J√Æn) again for help to take her medication. In this moment, J√Æn realizes that the grandmother does not remember just having taken her medication. Considering the home owners were just in the house, they probably gave the grandmother her medication. J√Æn realizes that she accidentally gave the grandmother a double dose of medication. \\"Grandma, what have you done?\\" J√Æn says before leaving. With her new acquired items, J√Æn changes her boots to the shoes she took from Leyla's house. Bombs start falling and J√Æn runs for cover in a cave. She is not alone. There is a black bear in the cave with her, taking cover from the bombs too. The bombing ends and J√Æn tells the bear \\" Its finished, don't fear\\". She gives the bear an apple and says \\"Bye, bye compadre\\". J√Æn now sits alone, trying to read a geography book she took from the house. It is obvious she has some trouble reading. \\"Which part of the world do you live in? What part of Turkey do you live in?\\" the book reads. This is the first time in the movie that the audience learns where the movie is taking place (Turkey). This point of innocence and a failed attempt at reading indicate to the audience that although J√Æn is very independent and tough, she is really just a young girl. She changes over to commoner clothes but still keeps her red scarf on her head. She goes to a river to fill her canteen and the shepherd boy who she had met earlier sees her and approaches her. Due to her new outfit, he doesn't recognize who she is and starts asking her \\"what a beautiful girl like her is doing all alone\\". It seems like he is about to take advantage of the situation but J√Æn embarrass and intimidates him, yelling at him telling him who she is and how they had met earlier. She leaves him and continues her journey. She runs into the bear again telling it \\"Sorry compadre, no more apples\\". The next scene shows her sitting alone in the dark, eating bread by a small fire. She is still in the mountainous forest and can hear the hawks over head. She tries to sleep but cannot. She continues her journey and comes upon a road. She sees a car coming and she hides in a ditch. A purple flower is shown. The next car that passes, she stands up to be seen. It seems that she wants to hitchhike but the car does not stop for her. She sleeps in the ditch, waiting for the next car. It is very windy. The snake appears again. A truck finally stops for her. It is green. The driver is an older man and they refer to each other as sister and brother. The driver asks her the reason for her travels, presumably she lies, saying that she is going to see her sick grandmother. The driver inquires more about her: says that she is from Varaptil, reveals her age, she does not have a dad and that her name is Leyla. The truck driver laughs at the irony that his daughter is also named Leyla. (The audience may presume at this point that the truck driver is from the same house, J√Æn was in earlier with the sick grandmother). The driver drops her off at her destination and gives her a chocolate. J√Æn tells the driver to say hi to Leyla for her. It is windy and the snake is shown again. J√Æn gets on a bus with other people. In their journey, the soldiers stop them asking passengers where they are going. J√Æn seems afraid and mimics the response of the other passengers: she is going to go work. A woman on the bus asks J√Æn if she ran away from home. J√Æn says she is going to visit her sick grandmother. The two exchange a mutual smile as if they both understand the true reason. Ironically, J√Æn does end up going to work to make money for a bus ticket. She is with the same woman from the bus. It is at this point in the film (approximately the half way mark) when J√Æn first reveals her name. The woman's name is Zivar (which means ornament or jewelry). J√Æn shares her chocolate with Zivar. The truck J√Æn, Zivar, and the other workers are on finally arrives at the work field. The boss there tells the group that women hoe for 25 liras a day and men break rocks for 35 liras a day. When the man asks J√Æn for her papers, she says she forgot them at home. Zivar backs her up by lying that J√Æn is the neighbor's daughter. The man seems to believe the lie. In order for J√Æn to make money for her bus ticket quickly, she asks to break rocks instead. She lies to the man telling him that she wants to buy medication for her sick grandmother. She presents herself to him as 17 year old Leyla. The man allows her to break rocks and tells her to come by his quarters later to pick up her payment. She works hard for the next days breaking rocks. The task is difficult for her but she does not give up. When she has worked as many days she needs to, to collect money for her bus ticket she goes to visit the man. He invites her to his home and serves her tea. J√Æn, clearly uncomfortable and predicting what will happen (he will try to rape her) tries to not stay for too long, telling him she is only there for her payment. As soon as he gives her the money, he tries to rape her inside his home. She runs away and he chases behind her and catches up to her. He beats her briefly unconscious and starts dragging her back to his house. He rests for a second at which moment, J√Æn wakes up, takes a rock and knocks him unconscious in the head. She runs away and goes to the bus station purchasing her ticket. On the bus she sits next to a young girl who asks J√Æn what happen to her face. J√Æn's face has some cuts and bruises. J√Æn responds by saying that a dog attacked her but she fought back, it got scared and ran away. Soldiers stop the bus, asking for IDs. J√Æn is taken off the bus since she doesn't have one along with an old insisting that he just left it at home and can go get it if need be. The two get taken to a Turkish compound where they are questioned. She speaks only in Kurdish while the soldiers speak only Turkish. A Kurdish interpreter comes to speak for he. She says she is from Gevez. She is put in a holding cell along with the old man. A helicopter flies in carrying a wounded Kurdish guerrilla. He is put in the holding cell with her. It seems as if she recognizes him. He asks her to kill him, likely because he will be interrogated by the Turkish soldiers. Upon his request, J√Æn kills him. While she is in the holding cell, bombs are falling outside. The Kurdish interpreter comes in and tries to violate her. However, because of the bombings, both she and the old man are released. She runs away but the Kurdish interpreter follows behind her. Eventually, she loses him. She tries again to hitchhike but the cars don't stop for her. The turtle crosses the road. A car stops and two men get out. It seems that one of them is the Kurdish interpreter. J√Æn runs away from them back into the mountains. In the mountains, she find a mule with an injured leg. The mule is carrying food. She takes the mule to the river, cleans and ties its wounds. She takes the food its carrying, takes the mules reins off and sets it free. As she is walking away from the mule, bombs start falling. She runs for cover and later discovered the mule has been killed by one of the bombs. She returns to the cave where she initially started. She finds her geography book there. She sees a mountain tiger. Bombs start falling again, the purple flower is shown again. There is repeat imagery of the same scenario happening (bombs dropping) with J√Æn in different locations. The different animals are also shown (bear, deer, snake etc.). The animals are shown as going into hiding when the bombs are being dropped. Also interesting to note is that despite all her travels, J√Æn's white shoes are clean. J√Æn finds a wounded Turkish soldier and she takes care of him. They have a brief conversation. He tells J√Æn he only has 7 months of active duty left, perhaps implying that what he is doing is out of requirement and not purely driven by desire. He tells her he comes from √áanakkale and his family (mother and siblings but no father). Upon saying that he never saw his father, J√Æn get angry saying that they (likely Turkish soldiers) took her father away from her and she never saw him again. When the soldiers says \\"may he rest in peace\\", J√Æn responds by saying \\"what peace? He has no peace\\". The next morning he leaves. He calls his mother to tell her that he is okay, J√Æn also calls hers, telling her mother that she decided not to go (to Izmir).As a token of gratitude, the soldiers offers his cellphone to J√Æn but she refuses it. He asks J√Æn for her name and despite official hesitation, she eventually tells him. He is the second person in the film to know her true name. As she continues on her journey, she starts getting shot at again. She climbs into a tree for safety but she is shot and falls from it. She is shown lying on a huge rock, blood stains her once clean white shoes. All the animals shown throughout the movie surround her (bear, mule, mountain lion, deer etc.). She seems alive but it is uncertain. The movie ends with a black screen.

The game is based on Type- Moon's Fate/stay night franchise, and was released in Japan on July 29, 2015 for Android, and on August 12, 2015, for iOS. English iOS and Android versions followed on June 25, 2017 in the United States and Canada, and a Korean version was released on November 21, 2017.http://ch.netmarble.com/?p=20516 An arcade version titled Fate/Grand Order Arcade was released by Sega in Japan on 26 July 2018. The game is centered around turn-based combat where the player, who takes on the role of a \\"Master\\", summons and commands powerful familiars known as \\"Servants\\" to battle enemies. The story narrative is presented in a visual novel format, and each Servant has their own scenario which the player can explore. Fate/Grand Order grossed in 2017, making it the year's sixth highest-grossing mobile game. In 2018, Fate/Grand Order grossed , making it the year's seventh highest-grossing free-to-play game. As of 13 March 2019, the game has grossed more than $3 billion worldwide. Total revenue crossed $4 billion by the end of 2019. Gameplay Ryougi Shiki (Assassin) and Gilgamesh (Archer) face off against Hand of Dawn enemies Fate/Grand Order is a turn- based tactical RPG. The player takes the role of \\"Master\\" and commands a group of individuals called \\"Servants\\", who are typically historical, literary, and mythological figures from various cultures. The player commands a party composed of up to 6 Servants in each battle, 3 active members and 3 reserve members. In each turn, the player is given a set of 5 Command Cards and may use up to 3 of them in a turn to attack. Each Servant has 5 cards the player may use; the cards for all the Servants on the field are shuffled and dealt to the player each turn. The cards have three types: Buster (a heavy attack), Arts (a medium attack that charges a gauge for the Servant's \\"Noble Phantasm\\"), and Quick (a light attack that generates Critical Stars that increase the probability of critical hits next turn). If three similar cards are used in one turn, they create a \\"Chain\\" which gives a bonus based on the cards' properties. If three cards all corresponding to the same servant are selected, then a \\"Brave Chain\\" will ensue, resulting in an extra, more powerful, attack being added onto the end. Each Servant also has skills that can be used before drawing Command Cards; each skill gives effects in the battle, as well as a special command card called \\"Noble Phantasm\\" that appears when the gauge is full. The \\"Master\\" also has a separate set of skills and special abilities called \\"Command Spells.\\" Command Spells have a variety of effects and recharge based on real-world time. Servants are obtained via a gacha mechanic. Saint Quartz, an in-game currency earned both by playing the game and via real money in-app purchases, is used to summon new Servants and acquire \\"Craft Essences\\" which give additional effects when equipped to a servant. This summoning is random, with some servants available commonly, and others rarely. Another currency is \\"Friend Points\\", which are more easily acquired, but only can acquire common Servants with them. If multiple copies of the same Servant are acquired, that servant's power is slightly increased. Plot In 2015, the Chaldea Security Organization draws on experts of both the magical and mundane fields to observe the future of mankind for possible extinction events. Humanity's survival seems assured for the next century‚Äîuntil the verdict suddenly changes, and now eradication of the species awaits at the end of 2016. The cause is unknown, but appears to be linked with the Japanese town of Fuyuki and the events of 2004 during the Fifth Holy Grail War. In response, Chaldea harnesses an experimental means of time travel, the Rayshift technology. With it, Ritsuka Fujimaru (a young man or woman, depending on the player's choice of gender) was newly recruited to the organization, and a mysterious girl named Mash Kyrielight, can travel back to 2004 and discover how to save humanity. A grand order to fight fate has been declared‚Äîan order to change the past and restore the future. Following the events in Fuyuki, Ritsuka Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight must restore the Foundation of Humanity by retrieving powerful Holy Grails. The Grails, which are capable of granting any wish, are also able to sustain abnormalities that threaten humanity's existence. The protagonists utilize Rayshift technology to travel back in time to said periods, ranging from Orleans to Okeanos and even the ancient civilization of Babylonia. Along the way, Ritsuka encounters the main antagonist and mastermind behind the plan to eradicate humanity: the Mage-King Solomon. He proclaims that Chaldea's attempt to save humanity will not matter if they fail to obtain every single Holy Grail, before leaving. After obtaining all 7 Holy Grails, Fujimaru and their Servant advance into Ars Paulina, the throne where Solomon once sat. In the final battle against Solomon and his legion of 72 Demon Gods, both Ritsuka and Mash are unable to defeat any of the Demon Pillars as they regenerate immediately. When all hope seems lost, the Servants that assisted Fujimaru on their quest through every singularity appear, allowing Chaldea to break through and defeat Solomon, who is revealed to be the Demon God Goetia, a beast that possessed Solomon's corpse and wishes to eradicate humanity in order to travel back to the dawn of humankind. Goetia is swiftly dispatched, but not before Mash utilizes her Noble Phantasm to deflect Goetia's Noble Phantasm to protect Fujimaru in exchange for her life. Just as hope was lost, Romani appeared and revealed that he himself is actually the real Solomon, the Grand Caster who wished to be human after the fifth holy grail war. Using his only Noble Phantasm to erase himself from existence and weaken Goetia, he then said his goodbyes to Ritsuka and in order for him to defeat Goetia once and for all. Upon the final Singularity being restored to order, Mash is revived via the power of Beast IV, who is revealed to be Fou, a dog-like creature that has journeyed alongside Fujimaru and their party through the entirety of the game. Upon completion of the singularities, Ritsuka Fujimaru is awarded the rank of Cause, by the Mages Association. In the aftermath of the singularity crisis Chaldea would be tasked with handling Singularity Subspecies. During this time period Chaldea would come under fire from various organizations including the U.N. and the Mages Association. Following the completion of these incidents, Chaldea would find itself under new management under Goredolf Musik. It turned out that Goredolf was just a scapegoat in a hostile takeover by a mysterious organization, conspiring with an unknown entity known as the Foreign God, to destroy Chaldea and the current human history, reverting the planet back to the Age of Gods. Now on the run, Ritsuka, Mash and the surviving members of Chaldea survived aboard the autonomous vessel Shadow Border. In order to save humanity, the group now travels to different timelines called \\"Lostbelts\\"; alternate versions of history that differ drastically from the main human history and were \\"pruned away\\" from the primary timeline after having been deemed a dead end. The seven Lostbelts are each represented by a Crypter, former human masters and their servants, each of whom are in competition against one another as well as the Chaldean survivors for the ultimate fate of human history. For Ritsuka Fujimaru, he must make some grave decisions and sacrifices that either will make him a savior... or a destroyer. Development and release The game was first drafted by Kinoko Nasu under the working title \\"Fate Online Project Reboot\\", which was meant to be a Massive Multiplayer Online game using designs drafts and concepts later collected in the Fate/complete material IV Extra material book. But the planned game was cancelled and shelved during planning stages. It later became a novel, Fate/Apocrypha, which integrated some concepts of the planned game.

Biography  The world of La Province des t√©n√®bres After spending most of his childhood and adolescence at Roanne, Daniel Arsand practiced in Paris various professions in the world of books: first as bookseller, especially for the \\"Librairies Fontaine\\", he worked ten years as a literary advisor to various publishing houses among which La Manufacture de livres and , before he joined the √âditions du Rocher as press officer. Finally, in 2000, he became a publisher of foreign literature at √âditions Ph√©bus. He made his debut as a writer in 1989 with a biography of Mireille Balin but his career as a novelist began in 1998 with La Province des t√©n√®bres, a noticed work that earned him the prix Femina for first novel. This author, whom Michel Cr√©pu, in L'Express dated 28 September 2000, dubbed \\"Arsand, the wild classic\\" because of the contrast between the harshness of his themes and the sobriety of his style, later published several novels and short stories, including En silence, which obtained the Grand prix Jean Giono for second novel. At the same time, his role as a publisher is above all that of a \\"passer\\" ', that is to say a reader who allows the French- speaking public to discover foreign authors. In this sense, Daniel Arsand is the \\"passer\\" of William Trevor but also of three other Irish writers: Keith Ridgway (prix Femina √©tranger 2001), Hugo Hamilton (prix Femina √©tranger 2003) and Joseph O'Connor. He also had the Turkish novelist Elif Shafak's works translated. He is the publisher of Certaines n'avaient jamais vu la mer by Julie Otsuka which was awarded the prix Femina √©tranger in 2012.

He was the founder and leader of the environmentalist Values Party in the 1970s. Biography =Early life= Brunt was born in Auckland in 1947 and later became a journalist. He briefly changed profession and became a trade union organiser before returning to his career in journalism. He then moved to Wellington in order to study Political Science at Victoria University of Wellington. =Political career= Brunt became politically active and formed the environmentalist Values Party in the early 1970s and served as its inaugural leader. He founded the party to serve as a response to the \\"barren and miniaturist\\" political culture which existed in New Zealand at the time. Aged 25 at the time, Brunt was the youngest leader of a political party in New Zealand history. He went on to contest the Wellington electorate of Island Bay at the 1972 election, where he placed third out of six candidates gaining 7.6% of the vote. Two years later he stood for the Wellington Mayoralty and City Council on a Values ticket. He placed third for Mayor but was easily elected to the council. Brunt's candidacy for the mayoralty was viewed as having drawn away many left-wing voters from the Labour Party. Labour Mayor Frank Kitts lost office in a very close race and blamed the Values vote for his defeat. In 1977 he again stood for both positions and was again elected only as a councillor, topping the poll with more votes than any other candidate. While he was a member of the Council Brunt was also employed by the Commission for the Environment as an investigating officer. He did not stand for re-election in 1980. =Later activities= Brunt moved back to Auckland and settled in the suburb of Hillsborough. In 2000 he became the chairman of the Friends of Puketutu Trust, a lobby group campaigning for the Manukau Harbour island of Puketutu to be classified as a regional park.

The building has 27 units with 21 of its apartments being 100 square metres and the remaining 6 ‚Äòstudios‚Äù 65 square metres each. History Kingsway Mansions takes its name from the road which it faces, which was once lined with tall blue gum trees. The building was designed by the prominent architect P. Rogers Cook who with the practice of J.C. Cooke and Cowan was responsible for an impressive collection of Art Deco buildings in central Johannesburg and for a number of theatres and movie houses including The Playhouse in Durban and Capital Theatre in Pretoria. The intended extension of the wings on the undeveloped land adjacent to Kingsway Mansions was never carried out, and the main entrance was positioned on the western side of Henley Road to give easy access to the property. For many years, the tenants included members of the Johannesburg Country Club, whose main entrance was directly across the road. When the SABC moved from the city centre to Auckland Park, tenants reflected the convenience for broadcasters, announcers, actors, and show-business people involved in radio and later TV productions. Among the people who have lived there over the years have been scriptwriter Dannie Folbeck, TV presenter Donna Werzel, actor Richard Haines, the actor / director Robert Whitehead, musician John Oakley Smith, publisher Ivan Beek and art gallery owner Trent Reed. The present tenant profile includes SABC executives, university lecturers and other professionals. Current ownership The current owner, Patrick Corben, purchased this ‚Äúrent controlled‚Äù block in 1990, from Lionel Waldman whose family had previously owned the building for some 40 years. Mr Corben also purchased the adjacent house at 77 Richmond Avenue, to ensure that the site was not developed to the detriment of Kingsway Mansions.

The Pocket Essential Georges Simenon. The Pocket Essentials, 2003. In 2016, this novel was reissued in English under the title The Hand, newly translated by Linda Coverdale (). The novel is set in Connecticut, USA. Simenon lived in America from 1945 to 1955; from 1950 he lived at Shadow Rock Farm in Lakeville, Connecticut. Unlike his other novels set in America, it was written many years after his return to Europe. In the novel, a man's life is changed when, instead of looking for his friend lost in a blizzard, he sits on a bench in a barn next to his house and smokes cigarettes; later, he has an affair with his friend's widow, all the while wondering what his wife is thinking about him. Summary The narrator is Donald Dodd. In places, including the last few pages, he writes in the present tense. Donald Dodd is a lawyer in Brentwood, Connecticut; his friend Ray Sanders, whom he has known since they were at Yale University together, is a partner in a public-relations organization in Madison Avenue. Donald and his wife Isabel, and Ray and his wife Mona who are staying with the Dodds, go to a party in January in New York, given by Harold Ashbridge, a business acquaintance. During the party, he aimlessly goes into a room and sees Ray making love with Ashbridge's wife Patricia (unnoticed by Ray). There is a blizzard on the way back; the car gets stuck in snow about a mile from the Dodds' home Yellow Rock Farm, and they walk the rest of the way. When they get there, Ray is missing. Donald tells the others he will go and look for him; instead, he sits in the barn next to the house and smokes cigarettes, feeling that in doing so he has killed Ray. He wonders whether his attitude to Ray has been envy, admiration or hate.

Yet there was no accusation in her blue eyes, no sharpened attitude. Only a slight astonishment and curiosity.\\" Later, Ray's body is found. At the funeral, Donald stands beside Mona. Back at his office in Brentwood, he wonders if the others are aware he is a different person. He knows that he and Isabel have become strangers. He goes to New York to deal with Mona's estate. Arriving at her apartment in Sutton Place, Manhattan, they immediately begin a passionate affair. He tells her that at Ashbridges's party he saw Ray and Patricia, and that he didn't look for Ray in the blizzard; she thanks him for being frank, and says she knew about Ray and Patricia. Between visits to New York, where Mona has moved to a smaller apartment, his family life with Isabel and their daughters Mildred and Cecilia continues. Isabel continues to look at him, and he wonders what her eyes are saying. People in Brentwood know he is having an affair. During one visit to New York, Mona tells him she is going to marry John Falk, a television producer. Donald has settled Mona's estate, and he does not visit her again.

It was blazed on 21 April 1861. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 February 2003.  History  The Burke and Wills Dig Tree on the banks of Cooper's Creek is associated with explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. The tree was one of two trees blazed on 21 April 1861 by William Brahe and party who had remained at Cooper's Creek while Burke, Wills, Charles Gray and John King forged ahead to the northern coast of Australia. Brahe's party was finally forced to abandon the depot and trek homewards, leaving a message pointing to a cache of buried stores. = The Victorian Exploring Expedition = Burke was born in 1821 in County Galway, Ireland, of Protestant gentry. Following an education at the Woolwich Academy, the young Burke served as a lieutenant in the Austrian cavalry and later the Irish Mounted Constabulary, before immigrating to Australia in 1853. After several postings with the Victorian Police, Burke was appointed to lead the Victorian Exploring Expedition, a position he had anxiously and diligently pursued. Wills was born in Devon, England, in 1834. He trained in medicine and migrated to Australia in 1853 and after a short stint working as a shepherd at Deniliquin, New South Wales, Wills assisted his father with his medical practice at Ballarat, Victoria. Wills later studied surveying and astronomy, and accompanied the expedition as astronomer, surveyor, and third-in-command, behind camel master George Landells. The Victorian Exploring Expedition was undertaken in the spirit of previous epics such as Edward Eyre's journey between Western Australia and South Australia in 1840, and Ludwig Leichhardt's 1844-5 trek from the Darling Downs in Queensland to Port Essington (near Darwin). Organised by the Royal Society of Victoria and supported by the Victorian Government, the expedition's objectives were hazy, beyond the desire to make the already-prosperous colony mightier by taking the lead in exploration efforts. The expedition would prove extremely expensive both financially and in lives, yet was ultimately successful in its bid to beat South Australia's John McDouall Stuart to the first north-south crossing of the continent. A large Melbourne crowd farewelled the explorers on 20 August 1860. The party comprised fifteen men, twenty-six Indian camels with their drivers, packhorses, wagons, food and supplies. In early October the party reached Menindee on the Darling River. Burke had already begun to shed baggage, determined to travel light and fast, leaving behind much of the equipment and some provisions at Balranald. Burke left more provisions at Menindee. He also quarrelled with Landells, who subsequently resigned. Burke promoted Wills to second-in-charge and engaged local man William Wright as third officer. Despite having received clear instructions that he was to establish his main base camp at Cooper's Creek, Burke pressed on quickly with an advance party of eight, leaving the remainder of the men and stores under the unreliable charge of Wright. Wright lingered at Menindee for three months, contrary to Burke's orders to proceed to Coopers' Creek as soon as possible. Wright failed to arrive at Cooper's Creek with the all-too-important reserve provisions and transport before Burke returned from the Gulf of Carpentaria. = Coopers Creek Depot = On 6 December 1860 Burke and his seven men established Camp LXV (65) at Cooper's Creek, having halted at several other spots along the Creek during the preceding three-and-a-half weeks while searching for the best location for a longer-term depot. Here Burke split his party once again, and on 16 December pressed on to the Gulf accompanied only by Wills, King and Gray. Brahe, Thomas McDonough, William Patten and Dost Mahomet were instructed by Burke to wait for at least three months (the more cautious Wills preferred four months), before retracing their steps homewards via the Darling River. During their stay at Camp LXV, Brahe's party erected a timber stockade to protect themselves and their supplies from the unwanted interest of local Aborigines. Four months later on the morning of 21 April 1861, William Brahe and his party of three others including the seriously-injured Patten, left for Menindee. Before embarking on this four-hundred-mile return journey, Brahe carved three messages on two separate Coolibah trees at Depot Camp LXV. One of the inscriptions contained the word 'DIG' and the location of the cache of buried stores. Two other blazes were carved on an adjacent tree; one displaying the letter 'B' for Burke and the camp number 'LXV', the other contained the dates of the arrival of the party (6 December 1860) and the date of Brahe's departure. Brahe noted in his journal that the party left the depot at 10 o'clock a.m., leaving of flour, of oatmeal, of sugar, and of rice buried near the stockade, at the foot of a large tree, and marked the word \\"Dig\\" on the tree. Brahe headed towards Menindee, taking all the camels, horses and clothes, and the bulk of the remaining food stores. He later testified that he did not leave the message and stores in any real expectation of Burke's return, given that he was already well overdue. \\"Rather, only for any party that should come up - that was most likely to come up from the Darling - to know what had become of us. I was very likely to miss any party coming up\\", he told the 1861-2 Royal Commission established to inquire into and report upon the deaths of Burke and Wills. Burke's party, by now reduced to three with the death of Gray on 17 April 1861, reached Camp LXV on the evening of 21 April 1861. Only two exhausted camels survived and the men were perilously low on stores. They discovered that Brahe had departed that same day, leaving the messages carved into the Dig Tree pointing to the cache of supplies. Subsequent events would prove to be a litany of missed opportunities and failure to communicate. A week after their departure from Camp LXV, Brahe met with Wright's party, heading north and finally en route to Cooper's Creek. Brahe and Wright then returned to the camp, but having noticed no evidence of Burke's return on 21 April, left no further messages or indications and retraced their steps southwards. Brahe arrived in Melbourne late in June 1861 to report on the missing men. On April 23 Burke's trio began the 150-mile westward journey to Blanchewater Station, near Mount Hopeless in South Australia, preferring to take this direction over the longer, but known, journey to Menindee. Twice they were forced back to Cooper's Creek due to lack of water to the west. They then remained along the Creek throughout June. On 30 May 1861 Wills had returned to Camp LXV. He found no evidence of Brahe's return in early May, and placed his journals and a new note in the buried cache for fear of accidents, and returned to his companions waiting further along Cooper's Creek. After surviving on ground nardoo, which was slowly poisoning them due to their lack of expertise in its preparation in leaching out the toxins, Wills died alone on the banks of Cooper's Creek on 27 or 28 June. He had insisted that his companions head further down the creek to seek assistance from the Aborigines. A day or two later, Burke also succumbed, having sent King on to look for help. With the assistance of Aborigines, King survived along the watercourse until found on 15 September 1861 by Alfred William Howitt's search party. = Rescue Attempts = When it became known that the Burke and Wills expedition had foundered, such was the prominence of the undertaking that a number of search parties were quickly organised. Howitt left from Melbourne, John McKinlay from Adelaide, Frederick Walker from Rockhampton, and William Landsborough from Brisbane. Howitt's party, which included Brahe and King (? King was living with the Aboriginies), arrived at Camp LXV on 13 September 1861. The Royal Commission was told that they found the depot as Mr Brahe had left it, the plant untouched, and nothing removed of the useless things lying about, but a piece of leather. The party located Wills' remains where his body had been covered by King, some miles downstream of Camp LXV. They buried Wills on 18 September 1861, and inscribed a tree. Field books, notebooks and various small articles were recovered. Three days later and approximately seven miles away, Howitt found Burke's remains near Innamincka Waterhole (two miles north of Innamincka) in South Australia. Burke was buried wrapped in a Union Jack, under a box tree on the south-eastern bank of Cooper's Creek. Howitt blazed this tree at the head of Burke's grave. The Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, organised to promote exploration, awarded Burke a posthumous RGS Founder's Medal in 1862. Wills was awarded nothing, as the Society's policy was to award only one medal to an exploration party. King received a gold watch, as did McKinlay, Landsborough and Walker for leading their various search parties. These search parties helped open up vast areas of inland Australia for settlement, as a result of the increased knowledge of the country they brought back with them. McKinlay had travelled northwards across the Cooper, to Gray's grave, and on to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Landsborough came from the north, via the Barkly Tableland to the Cooper and then Menindee, and Walker arrived to find Burke's last camp, thence returning eastwards. By the time the public funeral for Burke and Wills was held in January 1863, pastoralists were driving their sheep and cattle up the Bulloo. Within a decade or so there were established homesteads on the banks of Cooper's Creek, including Nappa Merrie sheep station, taken up by John Conrick in 1873. Prospectors working their way north of Menindee found enormously rich deposits of silver, lead and zinc at Piesse's Knob, later better known as Broken Hill. = The Dig Tree = While working on the survey of the border between Queensland and South Australia, surveyor Alexander Salmond passed by Cooper's Creek and made a pencil sketch of the tree. Called in 1911 by the Sydney Mail \\"William Brahe's Tree\\", an accompanying photograph showed the \\"DIG\\" inscription on the right-hand branching trunk partly overgrown with bark, obscuring the \\"D\\". Another blaze on the left-branching trunk showed some indecipherable letters and/or numerals. Surviving remnants of Brahe's stockade also are visible in the photograph. In 1928 the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia referred to the tree as better known as the \\"Depot Tree\\", alluding to its function of marking a major stopping and storage place for the expedition. Frank Clune's 1937 book Dig has been credited with changing the tree's popular, and still-current name, to the \\"Dig Tree\\". This particular tree had initially received less attention because it was not immediately associated with the deaths of either man. But by the 1880s the various explorers' trees marked by members of the expedition and by the various search parties had become valued by Australians as relics worthy of protection. The Dig Tree eventually came to be regarded as central to the story of the expedition, partly as a result of John Longstaff's iconic 1907 painting exhibited in the National Gallery of Victoria, The Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted Camp at Coopers Creek. The \\"Face Tree\\" adjacent to the Dig tree into which John Dick in 1898 carved ROHB and a portrait of John Burke's face, 1935 The Dig Tree has been considered of historical significance to Queensland for much of the 20th century. In 1937 the Conrick Plaque, erected by members of the first Anglo-Australian family to occupy Yandruwandha/Yawarrawarrka and Wanggumara land, was placed on a cairn near the Dig Tree. On 2 July 1964 the Queensland Government declared an area of approximately one acre surrounding the Dig Tree a reserve for memorial purposes, the land placed under the trusteeship of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland. The Stanbroke Pastoral Company currently manages the site on behalf of the Society. The Department of Environment & Heritage erected interpretative signage in 1993. In 1996-1997 further signage was prepared by the Department of Environment, in consultation with the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Bulloo Shire Council, and the Stanbroke Pastoral Company. Funded by Dick Smith's Australian Geographic publication, these new interpretative panels were erected . Subsequently, boardwalks were built to protect the Dig and Face Trees, and toilets were built in February 2001. The Face Tree is located on the same reserve as the Dig Tree. It portrays the face of Robert O'Hara Burke and the letters ROHB, thought to have been carved in 1898 by John Dick.  Description  Close up of the carving on the Dig Tree, LXV for camp 65 is still visible, 2008 The Dig Tree is located approximately four to six kilometres southwest of Nappa Merrie homestead, on a Reserve for Memorial Purposes. The Reserve of is excised from Nappa Merrie cattle station, which comprises almost three-quarters of a million hectares of Channel Country. The homestead is close to the South Australian border, lying some west of Thargomindah and forty-four kilometres east of Innamincka. Waterhole beside the Dig Tree, 2008 The Dig Tree is a mature Coolibah (Eucalyptus microtheca), believed to be 200 to 250 years old, common along this section of the Cooper and widespread in arid and semi-arid areas near watercourses and in seasonally-inundated areas. The tree stands high above the creek, on the southern bank of the Bulloo Bulloo waterhole. Brahe cut three blazes into the tree in 1861. On the creek side of the trunk \\"B LXV\\" denotes Brahe and Camp 65 in Roman numerals. On the land side of the trunk \\"DIG 3FT NW\\" was the message to the returning party to find provisions buried approximately a metre to the northwest. On an upstream-side limb \\"DEC 6.60 APR 21.61\\" marks the date of establishment of the camp, and that of Brahe's departure. Much of the lettering is now obscured by overgrowing bark. A boardwalk has been constructed around the tree to prevent the ground from being compacted by visitors footfalls. A stone cairn is located northwest of the Dig Tree. Further to the northwest is the Conrick Plaque, a metal sign attached to a large stone. Recent signage near the Dig Tree tells the story of Burke and Wills and their ill-fated expedition. The Face Tree (Eucalyptus microtheca), stands on the banks of the waterhole downstream (southwest) of the Dig Tree. It portrays a rendition of the face of Robert O'Hara Burke and the letters ROHB.  Heritage listing  Burke and Wills Dig Tree was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 February 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Dig Tree is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland history, because the Burke and Wills expedition contributed to the opening up of the Australian inland to pastoralism. During the 1860s settlers, including the Duracks and Costellos in 1865, had pushed into the Channel Country grazing their sheep and cattle along Coopers Creek and the myriad channels and streams. Only twelve years after the deaths of Burke and Wills, the land encompassing the Dig Tree and depot area had been taken up as Nappa Merrie station. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Burke and Wills Dig Tree and Camp 65 is important for its special association with explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills, who completed the first north-south crossing of the Australian continent and who both died during their return journey, in 1861. Their journey was remarkable not only as a feat of endurance and story of incompetence, but for the way in which it has permeated Australian historical consciousness, how it is celebrated in high art by verse and painting, and how it has contributed to the perpetuation of the Australian bush legend of struggle against the wilderness.

He served two terms as a member of the House of Representatives of the Legislature of the Kingdom in 1862 and 1870. He became the only Native Hawaiian to be ordained a priest of the Anglican Church of Hawaii and traveled with its founder Queen Emma to Europe between 1865 and 1866, circumnavigating the globe upon his return eastward via New Zealand. Early life Ka ªauwai was born , as the second son of Zorobabela Ka ªauwai and Kalanikauleleiaiwi III. His father was a successful Hawaiian politician, judge and entrepreneur who owed his rise to prominence to High Chief Hoapili, a trusted friend and companion of King Kamehameha I and the Governor of Maui, who became the child's namesake. Through his mother, he descended from the ancient Hawaiian M≈ç ªƒ´ of Maui, Pi ªilani. His mother was also a relative of Governor Hoapili.; He had three siblings: David Kahalekula Ka ªauwai (1835‚Äì1856), George Kaleiwohi Ka ªauwai (1843‚Äì1883) and a sister who died in infancy before 1848. His niece became Princess Elizabeth Kahanu Kalaniana ªole, wife of Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole, the second Congressional Delegate from the Territory of Hawaii.; Career and travel abroad William Hoapili Ka ªauwai and Kiliwehi, in London, c. 1865 Ka ªauwai was elected and served two nonconsecutive terms as a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Hawaiian legislature, for the district of Wailuku on the island of Maui. He was elected in 1862 and re-elected to serve a second term in 1870. His father Zorobabela and brother David had served as representative for Maui as well in the 1850s.; At the time of his first election, he was regarded as less experienced than his elder brother David who was \\"one of the finest Hawaiian orators\\" of his time. However, he later proved himself to be an orator as capable as his father and brother. On July 1, 1856, Ka ªauwai married Mary Ann Kiliwehi (1840‚Äì1873), daughter of High Chiefess Kuini Liliha, Governess of Oahu, but they had no children. He became an aide-de-camp to King Kamehameha IV and converted from Congregationalism to the Anglican Church of Hawaii established by the Anglophile monarch and his wife Queen Emma. On September 25, 1864, he was ordained as a deacon by Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley in Lahaina, the only Native Hawaiian to have this distinction, and afterward assisted the Archdeacon Reverend George Mason on the island of Maui. After Kamehameha IV's death, Queen Emma decided to travel to England to solicit donations for erecting a cathedral in Honolulu and continued the legacy of her husband. She chose Ka ªauwai to be her chaplain and his wife Kiliwehi as her lady-in-waiting to accompany her on this trip. From 1865 to 1866, they traveled with the queen to Panama, England, Italy, and the French Rivera. At Florence, he request to return home and continue his clerical duties was granted; Kiliwehi was also later permitted to return with him. They returned to London where they proceeded on to Auckland, New Zealand without the knowledge or permission of Queen Emma or King Kamehameha V. Prior to leaving England, Ka ªauwai had written to the Hawaiian Minister of Finance Charles Coffin Harris indicating they intended to take a \\"rather long round- about, and slow way toward home\\". Unknown to the Hawaiian government, Ka ªauwai went to New Zealand to recruit MƒÅori immigrants to settle in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Later sources indicate Ka ªauwai was somewhat successful in his venture, but his request to proceed with the negotiations were denied by the Hawaiian government and they demanded he return home. By this time, Queen Emma had already returned to Hawaii. After his return to Honolulu, he was shunned by King Kamehameha V because of his treatment of Queen Emma and the unauthorized visit to New Zealand. Gravestone at the Kawaiaha ªo Church Domestic relations between Ka ªauwai and his wife worsened and in one incident, he placed a gun to her head and attempted to shoot her. Kiliwehi filed for divorce on April 22, 1872; the case went to trial on September 12 and she was granted a temporary decree which was made absolute on June 18, 1873. While married to Kiliwehi, he was known to have been unfaithful, although this was not brought up in the divorce suit. With his mistress Keanolani (or Keauookalau, the wife of Lihilihi, of Kauai), he had an illegitimate son named William Hoapili Ka ªauwai II, born on January 31, 1874. Return to politics and death Ka ªauwai developed pulmonary tuberculosis and his health was worsen by his drinking habit. These health issues did not completely hinder his return to active political life. He was re-elected to the legislator of 1870. He also took an active part in the 1874 election following the death of King Lunalilo and became a supporter of KalƒÅkaua against his former patron Queen Emma. After KalƒÅkaua ascended to the throne, he appointed Ka ªauwai as his Court Chamberlain. He was preparing to depart with the king on his tour of the islands when he died of a heart attack. He died in Honolulu, on March 30, 1874. His remains were interned in an underground family vault at the cemetery of the Kawaiaha ªo Church. The burial site later became known as the Kapi ªolani family plot where relatives of King KalƒÅkaua, Queen Kapi ªolani and of Princess Elizabeth Kahanu Kalaniana ªole (including her parents) were buried. Today, an obelisk marks where the Kapi ªolani family plot is located.

Early life  Zubkov was born on November 1, 1973 in Derazhnia, the son of Antonina and Ivan Zubkov. Between 1987 and 1991 he studied at the city's Secondary School No. 3. He went on to attend the Kyiv Military Naval School, graduating in 1995 and choosing to serve with Ukraine instead of Russia. Zubkov served with the 19th Rocket Division of the 43rd Rocket Army in Khmelnytskyi until he left the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1998 and became a manager at a meat factory. He later founded his own transport business. Zubkov married Irina and had two daughters: Valentina (born 2002) and Sofia (born 2013). During the winter of 2013 to 2014, he participated in the Euromaidan protests against the government of Viktor Yanukovych.  War in Donbass  He joined the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces in late summer 2014, after the War in Donbass began. Zubkov became a deputy fire support company commander in the new 90th Separate Airborne Battalion of the 81st Airmobile Brigade. He fought in the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport from late December 2014. On January 18, 2015, Zubkov participated in the Ukrainian assault to relieve troops trapped in the airport. He led the defense against counterattacks and called in artillery on himself. On January 19 he was wounded, but remained in the new terminal with his men. He helped evacuate wounded soldiers. On the next day, Zubkov was killed while covering his unit's retreat when separatists collapsed the second floor onto them. He was buried in Derazhnia on April 30, after his body was found in the rubble. In 2015, Zubkov was awarded the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate's Medal for Sacrifice and Love for Ukraine. Zubkov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine and the Order of the Gold Star on June 9, 2015 for his \\"exceptional courage, heroism and sacrifice, in the defense of national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state, and loyalty to the military oath.\\"  Legacy  On August 20, Zubkov was made an honorary citizen of Letychiv, where his parents had moved. Secondary School No. 3 in Derazhnia, where he studied, was named for Zubkov. A memorial plaque was also added to the school building. On December 30, 2015, the 81st Airmobile Brigade's 90th Separate Airmobile Battalion, in which Zubkov had served, was renamed in honor of him.

The C17Œ≤ dodecylcarbonate ester of 11Œ≤-MNT, 11Œ≤-methyl-19-nortestosterone 17Œ≤-dodecylcarbonate (11Œ≤-MNTDC) (CDB-4754), is a prodrug of 11Œ≤-MNT. Along with the closely related AAS dimethandrolone (7Œ±,11Œ≤-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone; CDB-1321) and its ester prodrug dimethandrolone undecanoate (CDB-4521), 11Œ≤-MNT and 11Œ≤-MNTDC are under investigation as potential male contraceptives and to treat male hypogonadism. Side effects Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= 11Œ≤-MNT does not undergo aromatization into the corresponding estrogenic metabolite 11Œ≤-methylestradiol, and for this reason, has no potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia. In addition, unlike testosterone, 11Œ≤-MNT does not appear to undergo 5Œ±-reduction into the corresponding 5Œ±-dihydrogenated metabolite 5Œ±-dihydro-11Œ≤-MNT (5Œ±-DHMNT). This conclusion is based on the fact that 5Œ±-DHMNT is 4 to 8 times as potent as 11Œ≤-MNT in terms of androgenicity in animal bioassays, yet the co-administration of the 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor dutasteride with 11Œ≤-MNT had no influence on its potency in assays using tissues that express 5Œ±-reductase like the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles. Due to lack of potentiation by 5Œ±-reductase in androgenic tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, 11Œ≤-MNT may have a lower risk of certain side effects such as oily skin, acne, androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss), prostate enlargement, and prostate cancer than testosterone and certain other AAS. Similarly to nandrolone, dimethandrolone, and other 19-nortestosterone derivatives, 11Œ≤-MNT has been found to possess progestogenic activity. Because of its dual activity as an AAS and progestogen, 11Œ≤-MNT may have greater efficacy in suppression of spermatogenesis and hence male fertility than pure AAS like testosterone. Oral 11Œ≤-MNT has shown little to no potential for hepatotoxicity in animals, similarly to testosterone but unlike 17Œ±-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone. The drug notably shows a much lower hepatotoxic potential than dimethandrolone and trestolone (7Œ±-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT), which may have an increased risk due to their shared C7Œ± methyl group (although a risk that is still significantly lower than that of 17Œ±-alkylated AAS). Chemistry 11Œ≤-MNT, or 11Œ≤-methyl-19-nortestosterone, also known as 11Œ≤-methylestr-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a non-17Œ±-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).

Basimba (Big Lion) people refers to a network of families with their surnames names of family, and history. It serves Basimba people as a constant chant to remind them of histories they are tied to within their culture. Basimba people know a lot about a Musimba of a Basimba (Big Lion) particular group through his clan, and family names. This often allows for certain protocols to be followed. In the culture of Africa, when one comes upon someone with a certain Basimba Clan group name you automatically know where they are from. The Basimba people clan naming is a cultural science perfected by the Clan thousands of years ago. In the Basimba (Big Lion) people culture even individuals have totems. These totems may be related to something within their destinies, some historical event that they were a seminal part of, a call upon them by the spirits, the taking on of a new responsibility or title, a wish by the Basimba people ancestors. Basimba (Big Lion) People Sub-divisions Among the Basimba people, settlement sub-divisions were created called \\"new settlements\\" (Muwuluko). The connection is that the originator of a particular Basimba group was separated from the main body and built a new settlement. These Basimba (Big Lion) people new settlements arose from various reasons, such as: # If a Musimba Clan member leaves his fathers family and settles in a new area, but keeps contact with his father's family. The Basimba founder of a new settlement becomes after several generations its head and not the clan head as he would be if he has severed all connections with his father's original home. # When a Basimba (Big Lion) people clan group grows too big it is found practicable to divide the members into smaller family units for easier dealing with such matters as inheritance, maintenance of female descendants, etc. The senior member of each of these new sub-divisions became the Muwuluko head. # If quarrels break out among the Basimba clan members and relatives take sides, each side constitutes itself as a sub-division with its senior member as its Muwuluko head and either adopts a new totem. Totem The Basimba people's primary and secondary totems are looked upon in entirely different lights. The primary totem is real taboo among the Basimba people, it may not be killed, eaten, touched and in some cases not even looked upon, but the secondary totem is a friendlier thing altogether and is often described by the Basimba people as the brother of the clan . For example, the Omugurusi of the Basimba Dog totem Clan is Mauwe. On the day of his birth a dog also had puppies. The dog often cleaned the child by licking it. Mauwe later, out of gratitude, ordered his Basimba descendants to consider the dog as their friend and the dog became the secondary totem of the clan. The Basimba (Big Lion) people's clan system is central to their culture. A clan represents a group of people who can trace their lineage to a common ancestor, in some distant past. In the customs of the Basimba, lineage is passed down along patrilineal lines. The clan essentially forms a large extended family and all members of a given clan regard each other as brothers and sisters regardless of how far removed from one another in terms of actual blood ties. The Basimba (Big Lion) people take great care to trace their ancestry through this clan structure. A formal introduction of a Musimba includes his own names, the names of his father and paternal grandfather, as well as a description of the family's lineage within the Basimba sub-division Clan group that he or she belongs to. The clan has a social structure with the clan leader at the top (great lineal ancestor), followed by successive subdivisions of the lineal ancestors and finally at the bottom the individual family unit (house). Every Musimba is required to know where he falls within each of these subdivisions and anyone who could not relate his ancestry fully is suspected of not being a true Musimba. The Basimba (Big Lion) people's sub-division Clans are not known by the names of the respective Clan founders. Totems were adopted by the seven Basimba Sub- division Clan groups and the names of these totems came to be synonymous with the Basimba sub-division clans themselves. Each Basimba sub-division clan has a main totem and a secondary totem. The seven Basimba sub-division Clan are usually known by their main totem similar to the Aboriginal Australians and among the Basimba people sub-division Clan group, the Ngo (Leopard) Clan is a royal Clan. The Nankanse, who have a leopard totem, say that when an elder of the clan is ... the leopard is an ancestor, and has already had a second funeral held for him. The leopard totem is often associated with royalty and high chieftain (male and female). It is widespread in Africa as the symbol for the king. Many African kings are depicted sitting upon leopard skin or resting their feet on the skin of the leopard. Some drape themselves in leopard skin and you can see this all the way back to ancient Nubia. The clan is a matter of genealogy and it is through the clan that the Basimba (Big Lion) people trace their ancestry. A totem on the other hand, is just a symbol to represent the Clan. Although the two are intimately associated with one another, they are in fact different. In the west, a totem would be similar to a court of arms. The seven Basimba clan totems are the Lion, leopard, Leopard Cat, Genet Cat, dog, frog and the rooster. Naming One of the Basimba people strongest manifestations of the four Clan spirit is in the traditional naming conventions. The Basimba (Big Lion) people are patrimonialism society, everyone automatically takes on his father's clan at birth. However, the new born child is considered to be a child of the whole Clan and not just the individual father. A Musimba child does not assume the father's name. Instead, each of the seven Basimba clan has a pool of names from which a name is selected and given to the child. Since the Basimba people clan names are well known, a person's clan is readily identified from their name but not necessarily the person's parents. Each Basimba family has retained its autonomy as a unit, it is nonetheless considered part of the bigger clan family. In Uganda at a place known as Butambala, there is a large rock called Nyakyejwe belonging to the Leopard (Ngo) Clan. Nyakyejwe was the daughter of Kabaka Kato Kintu who, so the story goes grieved so much at his death. Much moisture exudes from the rock at times and causes green trails on its face, which are said to be Nyakyejwe weeping-again an Etiological myth. This weeping is said to take place at the death of each Kabaka (King). At the same Butambala there is also a kitchen chimney, cooking stones a rock called Nabuto her daughter and under a nearby slab a Leopard used to live and have its young ones. A Leopard is always seen at the said place from time to time and there is a hole containing water on this rock were the Basimba Leopard (Ngo) totem Clan or the Leopard (Ngo) Clan used to bring every new born baby child of the Leopard Clan to be bathed and given a Clan name. The Basimba of the Leopard totem Clan genealogy, and descendants names given to their sons include Katunku, Ngulya, Mwati, Kaabya, Kitembwa, Kabolesa, Ntembe, Chanda, Namuyonjo, and Mukama. Daughters' names include Nakatunku, Namwati, Nangulya, Nakaabya, Nakitembwa, Nakabolesa, Nantembe, and Nachanda. The sub-division name of the Basimba of the Dog totem Clan for men is Mauwe, among others. For the Basimba of the Frog Clan, men's names include Kadukulu, Ndanda, Bulukunyi, and Waida, and for women, Nakadukulu, Nandanda, Nabulukunyi, and Nawaida are among their sub-division clan names. Customs The Basimba people's custom is that one is not supposed to marry into one's clan or that of one's mother. This type of system is referred to as being exogamy. Similarly, one is not supposed to eat the totem of one's clan, or of one's mother's clan. The Basimba people have a Chishimba stone which represents the Chishimba spirit which came from Buluba and is related to the institution of kingship. Its absence constitutes the absence of power. According to Traditional African religions and Veneration of the dead ,the Basimba people practice both totem and animal worship, dedicated to the Chishimba spirit which is synonymous to kingship. Its importance in the institution of kingship is similar to that attached to Shila tradition. The Chishimba stone is kept in a specially prepared basket called Embuga. It is wrapped with bark cloth and kept in a specifically prepared shrine (Esabbo lye jembe lye Chishimba) dedicated to the spirit. Basimba people make periodic prayers at the Chishimba shrine for the peace and prosperity of the Clan. Before these prayers are offered the Basimba people draped themselves with a leopard skin sing, calling the spirits of their ancestors while holding one of the ancestors spear and then blood of an animal killed specifically for this purpose is sprinkled round the shrine with local beer as an invocation to the spirit, similar the Kongo influence called Petwo or Petro and many Loa or Lwa are of Kongo origin such as Basimba of Haiti who practice Haitian vodou sold as slaves.

It is a bushy shrub with its branches and leaves densely covered with a layer of hairs, giving them a greyish appearance. The leaves are broad-elliptic to almost circular in shape and the tube-shaped flowers are pink with purple spots inside. Description Quoya atriplicina is a shrub with many branches, growing to a height of and which has its branches densely covered short, greyish hairs. The leaves are broadly elliptic to almost round, long and wide with the veins often hidden by the covering of short, ash-coloured hairs. The flowers are arranged in the upper leaf axils, usually in a short, broad leafy panicle with 3 to 7 flowers on a stalk long and densely covered with ash- coloured hairs. The flowers are surrounded by bracts and bracteoles which are hairy on the outer surface and glabrous on the inside. The five sepals are joined to form an egg-shaped or top-shaped tube, long, with egg-shaped lobes on the end, long. The sepal tube is densely hairy on the outside and glabrous on the inside. The petals are pink with purple spots in the throat, long, forming a tube with a wide opening and five short broad lobes. The lowest lobe is very broad, more or less circular and twice as large as the others. The outside of the petal tube is hairy, although not so hairy as the sepals, and glabrous inside apart from a ring of hairs around the ovary. The four stamens are about the same length as the tube, one pair shorter than the other. Flowering occurs mainly from May to October or November and is followed by fruit which is oval in shape, long and densely hairy with the sepals remaining attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes atriplicina. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Augustus Oldfield near the Murchison River. In 1870, George Bentham changed the name to Pityrodia atriplicina but in 2011, Barry Conn and Murray Henwood changed it back to Quoya atriplicina and published the change in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (atriplicina) is derived from the name of the saltbush genus, Atriplex. Distribution and habitat Saltbush foxglove grows in sand on sandplains mainly between Geraldton and Shark Bay in the Carnarvon, Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.

As a refugee from Francoist Spain he was interned in France where he recorded life in the camp at Bram. He is considered one of the founders of Spanish photojournalism and has been called the \\"Spanish Robert Capa\\", with a \\"direct, spare style\\" and \\"great skill with the miniature Leica which enabled him to follow and photograph scenes of the Civil War.\\"  Biography  His family moved to Barcelona when Centelles was a year old. He went to work as an apprentice in 1924 in the photographic studio of where he learned portraiture. A few years later he became the assistant of Josep Badosa who introduced him to journalism. He was an early adopter of the compact Leica camera and in 1934 began to work independently for newspapers such as ', Diario de Barcelona, ' and La Vanguardia. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War he was sent to the Aragon front and assigned to make reports on the troops at the front. He reported on the Battle of Teruel and the Battle of Belchite. Many of his war photographs had propaganda value, and were used on the front page of major newspapers, especially in La Vanguardia. He also contributed to the Catalan Propaganda Commission and managed the archives of the army of Catalonia in Barcelona. One famous photograph from this period shows George Orwell with the POUM militia at the Lenin barracks. In 1939 he fled over the Pyr√©n√©es to France and took with him what he considered his most important negatives. Nationalist troops seized the rest of the negatives from his house: they were bought by the Salamanca Archive in 2009 for ‚Ç¨700,000. In France he was imprisoned in various camps, managing to save his negatives and cameras. He set up a small photography lab in the camp at Bram, near Carcassonne, thanks to a press card issued by the French authorities and documented life in the camp in a diary and over 600 photographs. In 1939 he got special permission to temporarily leave the camp and work on the harvest. When he got a job at a photography studio the permit became final. In 1942 he encountered the French Resistance and began taking pictures for counterfeit identification documents. Some members of the resistance group were arrested in 1944 and the photo laboratory was dismantled. Centelles left his negatives in Carcassonne in the attic of the Degeilh family who had taken him in during his exile. He did this because he understood that he could not return home with material that, if seized, could implicate people in the photographs to the Francoist authorities. After that, he returned to Catalonia, via Andorra, and settled in Reus where he lived clandestinely for two years. In 1946 returned to Barcelona and presented to the authorities. He was tried and was released on parole. His political past prevented a return to a career in photojournalism, so he opted for industrial and advertising photography, making orders for products such as Chupa Chups and An√≠s del Mono. In 1976 he went back to France with his friend Eduard Pons Prades to retrieve the negatives he had left during his exile. The images were exhibited and Centelles was again recognised as a war photojournalist. In 1984, the Ministry of Culture awarded him the Spanish National Award for Plastic Arts. Today his sons, Sergi and Octavia, work to raise awareness of their father's work.

History The creation of the North Oil Company has been announced in June 2016 by Qatar Petroleum as a joint venture with Total S.A. (30%) to develop and operate the Al Shaheen oil field for 25 years. Operations along with production, sale and export of crude oil started on July 14, 2017. Total announced to invest around $2 billion into the oilfield between 2017 ‚Äì 2022 and Qatar Petroleum announced that total investments into the field would be around $3.5 billion. From 1992 ‚Äì 2017, the Al Shaheen Oil Field had been developed and operated by Maersk Oil. In July 2017, the first crude tanker from Al Shaheen was loaded. In November 2018, it was announced that PetroVietnam was contracted by NOC in order to further develop the second phase of the field, including the erection of three new wellhead platforms and three bridges until 2020. Corporate structure NOC is led by chief executive officer Frederic Paux. Khalid al Rumaihi is chairman of the board of directors. Other members of the board are Abdulaziz Al-Mannai, Jassim Al- Marzouqi, Mohammed Al Ghanem, Rashid Al Fehaidi, Hamad Al-Baker, Lionel Levha, Pierre Ranger and Laurent Wolffsheim. Operations North Oil operates the Al Shaheen Oil Field. The field is situated in Qatari waters, around 180 kilometers north from Doha, 80 kilometers north of Ras Laffan and the north- east coast of Qatar. Al Shaheen is the largest offshore field in Qatar and is part of the South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field, stretching across 9,700 square kilometres in Iranian and Qatari waters. The field is considered one of the largest and most complex oilfields in the world. Current production of the field was in 2017, produced by 33 platforms and close to 400 wells. The field covers more than 40% of Qatars total oil production. The companies current goal is to maintain current production and output levels from the field, which is considered difficult in complex fields like Al Shaheen, given the natural decrease of pressure and resources. In order to achieve their current goal, the company plans to drill more than 100 new wells until 2022. The Al Shaheen oil field, situated off the north-east coast of Qatar, is one of the largest and most complex of its kind in the world. Its 100 million barrels per annum comprise 45% of Qatar's Oil production.

They are known in their speech as Ganumi Bara. They are often considered to be a branch of the Darumbal. Language Though often thought to have spoken the Darumbal language, an early settler of the island, Robert Ross, stated that their language was unintelligible to the mainland Aboriginal people. According to an early sojourner, C. T. Wyndham, the language spoken was divided into two distinct dialects, northern and southern. This was disputed by another white informant who said that mainland Aboriginal people in that area could understand the Woppaburra language. Ecology and Lifestyle The Woppaburra were described by white settlers as small in stature, the hair of a reddish- brown tint, and their bodies covered in downy hair and living predominantly in natural caverns, and subsisting on a diet of fish and tubers since natural land game, such as kangaroos, opossums and wallabies, was absent from the island. Their numbers, as pastoral lease-holders began to establish a foothold on their territory in the 1860s, were believed to be about 60 people, and W. T. Wyndham reported later that during his own sojourn on the island in 1883‚Äì4, he counted 54. Archibald Meston in 1902 estimated the original population before contact to be around 200. Disparities overall numbers may reflect headcounts for the separate islands, and Rowland makes an estimate of the total Woppaburra before contact to be around 60 on South Keppel and a further 25 on the northern island. Anthropometrics Anthropometric studies have suggested the Woppaburra are quite distinct from the mainland peoples, one 1976 study concluding that, their bone remains constitute the \\"most striking instance we have seen of micro-evolution within the Australian Aborigines\\". History According to Michael Rowland, an authority on the Woppaburra writing in part to reply to the skepticism about reports of genocide advanced by Keith Windschuttle, the first visit of whites to the island, in 1865, occasioned a massacre of seven/eight members of the tribe: not mentioned in the report of the expedition, which spoke of an incident in which a fleeing Aboriginal woman had been saved by the group after she fell into the sea and injured herself, this or perhaps an earlier occasion of slaughter, was pointed out by tribal people later, who showed a hundred-yard line pitted with the skeletal remains of the Woppaburra who had been killed, and several males, accused of killing some sheep, were transported off the terrain, to Yeppoon, where the local tribes viewed them with hostility. The then lessee however stated that a full 30 had been removed, at their request, to the mainland, and relocated, after landing at a place 10 miles south of Cape Manifold, at the Water Park Native Reserve, while leaving only two women behind. Robert Ross's pastoral lease ran 3‚Äì4,000 sheep on island. Another white version at the time (1883) claimed that the Woppaburra were not native to the island but had managed, being part of a mainland tribe, to get over to the island and kill a 100 sheep, and that this accounted for their removal. According to testimony given to Walter Roth, however, some whites and mainland blacks had descended on the island, and hunted up all the Woppaburra women and children they could find, and had them transported back to the coast. \\"Human lives were sacrificed for sheep,\\" was his conclusion. Ross may have shifted them to the mainland to supply cheap labour for property at Taranganba. Deracinated on the mainland, and unable to adapt to Yeppoon conditions, where they eventually were said to have retired to, reports quickly noted that the transported group was rapidly dying off -though one man, Yoolowa/Lowoo, was said to have swum back to Keppel island and others were eaten by sharks in attempts to get back to their homeland- as a result of \\"coast fever\\" and an inability to live off the different diet. Corpses of Woppaburra were found here and there in scrubland and along the beaches. Reports from the mid-1880s indicate that some Woppaburra remained on the island, used as cheap labour on the sheep-runs, men and women whipped along as, harnassed to a plough, they were forced to furrow the soil, and fed tidbits thrown their way by whites. They were chained to a tidal cave if they refused to work. Something akin to frontier warfare, involving not only shootings, poisonings, and being driven into the sea, but also theft of their women by Japanese pearlers, appears to have struck the Woppaburra, according to the tales handed down by descendants of the tribe in both Yeppoon and Emu Park Ross's Keppel interests were taken over by his foreman, James Lucas, in 1897 and he moved the Woppaburra to South Keppel island near his homestead. At the same time, in the late 1890s, a dispute over territorial competence arose between the northern protector of Queensland's aboriginal peoples, and his southern colleague Archibald Meston. Roth insisted they not be dislocated from the islands, and was thought to favour the lessee's interests, while Meston was shocked by the degraded conditions to which the Woppaburra had been reduced in the introduced pastoralist environment. Roth reported 19 Woppaburra people on the island in 1898, 3 of them male, and 16 female, a disparity he attributed to the character of the Europeans who frequented the isle. Meston wanted them shifted to Fraser Island to isolate them from sexually predatory whites and fishermen. The remaining members of the Woppaburra were forcibly removed from the island in 1902, though one descendant claims his family was removed 8 years later, in 1910. The skeletal remains of 2 Woppaburra people were removed to museum holdings in London, in the 1920s, and were conserved at the Royal College of Surgeons and London's Natural History Museum. In the early 1980s The Keppel Islands Lifestyle Aborigninal Corporation (K.I.L.A.C) was formed by the initiative of Woppaburra descendants Elders Aunty Glenice Croft, Aunty Linette Van Issum, Uncle Robert Barney, Aunty Ethel Richards, Aunty Heather Saunders, Aunty Ruthy Cummings and their children Michelle Croft, Angela & Sonny Van Issum. When the K.I.L.A.C media person Aunty Glenice Croft contacted Michael Rowland after media coverage about Mr Rowland's archaeological survey on the Keppel Islands, he met Aunty Ethel Richards, Aunty Glenice Croft and others. This led to the first Woppaburra reunion return in 1984 when 40 descendants met up on Great Keppel island. Native title On 7 March 2014, the registration of a claim to native title made in November 2013 in the name of descendants of the Woppaburra was accepted by the National Native Title Tribunal. We Al-li The term we al-li was adopted from the Woppaburra language to describe a therapy program devised for indigenous peoples affected by the historic traumas of dispossession, informed by the work of Alice Miller as well as by the need to provide a culturally safe environment in which people could \\"intellectualise\\" or make sense of their experiences. We means \\"fire\\" and refers to both the symbolism of raging anger and its use in cleansing the earth to make way for new spring growth, in turn referring to the sacred responsibilities of taking care of country and also of people. Al-li means \\"water\\" and refers to both the symbolism of deep grieving and its essential life-giving and healing properties, in the form of rain and the ways it moves through the landscape, following the tracks of Moonda Nghadda. Taken together, we al-li describes the great anger and pain felt in the self and for others, the cleansing process crucial to recovery and regeneration, the grieving process necessary to restore the health of the community, and the healing process that results. Descendants Some 300 Australians trace their origins to the Woppaburra of the Keppel Islands. * Konomie Richards (1883/5-1973), native name, Boombilwan, died, aged 90. at Acacia Ridge, Brisbane in 1973.

It is bounded on the East by Ukhrul district and Nagaland on the North and West and covers an area of 46.48 km2. According to the Census of India 2011, there are 806 household with a total population of 5518 persons, out of which 2846 are male while 2672 are female.Census of India 2011, http://www.census2011.co.in/data/village/268498-laii-manipur.html History It is believed that the ancestors of Vafiimai originally came from Mao by hunting a phenomenal 7 branching horn stag. When they reached the present location of Laii, it was dusk and the hunters had to halt there for the night. With no food at hand, they ate the buds of a leafy plant Himalayan knotweed locally called vavu. Omens were good and 16 delegates from each clan of the 16 Mao villages were sent and a new settlement was set up. Etymology The term Vafiimai has its origin from the plant Himalayan knotweed which grows in abundant in the region. Literally, Va (Vavu) [Scientifically called Koenigia polystachya] is the name of the plant, Fii meaning place, and Mai means people. Hence, people from the land of Vavu. The name Gaziphema has the same interpretation as the above in Nagaland. The name Laii which means God in Manipuri was given by a Meitei Ningthou after a failed attempt to raid the village.  Culture and religion  Like any other Naga village, the people of Gaziphema depends mainly on cultivation and livestock-rearing. Because of this labor-intensive cultivation, land is the most important form of property among them to date. However, with the changing times, many has adopted small businesses and other skilled professions. Several educated individuals and families migrated to various metropolitan cities due to government postings, education and corporate jobs leading to a huge diaspora populace. During the period of headhunting, the menfolks spent the majority of their time in warfare with hostile villages and taking heads. Since 1879, when the British succeeded in annexing the Naga territory, the inter-village feuds have come to an end. With the introduction of Christianity in the region in the early twentieth century, many of them changed their faith to Christianity. Today, 99% of the population follows Christianity. These Christians are of two major denominations: Baptist and Roman Catholic. Location Gaziphema village is located at 25.5004¬∞ N latitude and 94.3893¬∞ E longitude. It is situated at a height of 1791.5 m above sea level, and lies about 42 Kilometres from national highway 39 at Tadubi. Literacy As per the Census of India 2011, Gaziphema village has a very low literacy rate. In 2011, literacy rate was 30.43 % compared to 76.94 % of Manipur. Male literacy stands at 35.67 % while female literacy rate was 24.76 %. World War II During the Second World War, Gaziphema was a strategic location to the Allied soldiers.

Reviews Phil Hoad from The Guardian believes that the film is unfocused and only scratches the surface. Isabelle Milton thinks that the movie shows the brutality the Hungarian Jews had to face towards the end of the Second World War, but has nothing new to offer. She also mentions that during the movie the soundtrack is played distractingly at inappropriate moments. Furthermore she thinks that the character development is thin. Ryan Izay Reviews thinks that there are several screenplay problems in the movie like plot-holes, clich√© bookend sequences and familiarity to the narrative. However she also thinks that it features enough competent filmmaking to forgive these kinds of mistakes.

Background Al-Masdar News (AMN) was launched in August 2014 as a media service that provides frontline news and analysis from the Middle East.Al- Masdar News - About Position The website was described by the BBC and Newsweek as having a pro-Syrian government viewpoint, while The Independent describes it as \\"sympathetic to the Syrian regime\\".

Criticism  Following the April 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in the Idlib Governorate, al-Masdar News published an opinion article by deputy editor Paul Antonopoulos entitled \\"Jumping to conclusions; something is not adding up in Idlib chemical weapons attack\\".Antonopoulos, Paul. Jumping to conclusions; something is not adding up in Idlib chemical weapons attack. Al- Masdar News. 2017-04-04. A report by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) published three days later described a \\"digital forensics\\" trail which showed how this Al-Masdar opinion article was used as a source by conspiracy, pro-Russian and far-right websites, in particular InfoWars, which recycled Antonopoulos' article in a piece by Mimi al Laham. It described Al-Masdar News as \\"an unofficial government outlet\\" and said that it had \\"repeatedly attacked regime critics and witnesses to regime atrocities, notably the White Helmets.\\" Business Insider showed the conclusions in the AMN article differing markedly from those of other analysts, specifically Fred Hof (director of the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East), US defense officials, President Donald Trump and Dr. Monzer Khalil (rebel-held Idlib Province's health director). After deputy editor Paul Antonopoulos (author of the opinion article \\"Jumping to conclusions\\") was shown to be active on the neo-Nazi site Stormfront, he was forced to resign from Al-Masdar on 28 April 2017. Al-Masdar issued a statement on behalf of its board of directors, saying they found his behaviour \\"wholly unacceptable\\" and strongly condemned it, while also apologizing to its readers and all those offended by his actions. Business Insider reporter Natasha Bertrand has described Leith Abou Fadel, the editor of Al-Masdar, as someone who had pushed a conspiracy theory in the past, and described him as an \\"Assad loyalist\\". The New York Times also accused Fadel of spreading unfounded misinformation about a victim of the Petra L√°szl√≥ incident. A 2018 report by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, based on analysis of its \\"Hamilton 68\\" database of Russian disinformation Twitter accounts, showed that Al-Masdar is a main source of Syria-related propaganda for Russian accounts aimed at US audiences.

In 2007, T-Mobile Netherlands, a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile International, acquired Orange Netherlands from France T√©l√©com for EUR 1.33 billion. This made it the third largest mobile telephone operator in the country behind KPN and VodafoneZiggo.

T-Mobile admitted the problems after much pressure from customers and the Dutch media. T-Mobile could not keep up with the growing data demand from smartphones, caused by the number of new customers who wanted an iPhone: T-Mobile in the Netherlands failed to keep up with the demand, and capacity problems on the network were the result. T-Mobile denied the problems at first by telling complaining customers that their mobile phone or SIM-card was causing the problem. The capacity problems occurred mostly in cities and densely populated areas. When affected, people could experience problems with calling or receiving calls, text messaging (SMS), or data services. A substantial number of customers were not able to use any of these services in cities or urban areas when the network capacity was overloaded, for instance, the cities of Amsterdam and Utrecht were heavily impacted. After being put under pressure by several consumer interest groups and the Dutch media, T-Mobile started a cash-back settlement for all consumers who had complained about failing communication services. T-Mobile invested tens of millions of euros to upgrade its network. The upgrade was completed around the end of the first quarter of 2011. = Acquisition of Vodafone Thuis = In August 2016, after Ziggo and Vodafone Netherlands announced their merger, the European Commission required Vodafone to split of their fixed-line Internet business, as a condition to approve the merger.

Established as a military order to advocate the Christian faith, its original implicite goal was to combat the Ottoman incursions into the Inner Austrian lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola. The order resided at Millstatt Abbey and in Wiener Neustadt, until in 1598 its properties were handed over to the Jesuit college in Graz. History =Frederick III= In 1462 Emperor Frederick III and his court at Hofburg Palace was besieged by his rebellious brother Archduke Albert VI of Austria and insurgent Vienna citizens. Frederick made a vow: if he was saved, he would undertake a pilgrimage to Rome, found a diocese and establish a chivalric order in honour of Saint George. Finally, the siege was lifted and Albert died in the following year. Investiture of the first Grand Master of the Knights of St George by Pope Paul II In November 1468, Frederick proceeded to the Holy See, where on 1 January 1469 the first Grand Master Johann Siebenhirter received his investiture in the Lateran Basilica. On 18 January the Austrian Diocese of Vienna and the Diocese of Wiener Neustadt were established by papal bull. The Wiener Neustadt bishopric was even incorporated into the Order of Saint George in 1479; however, this union was overshadowed by ongoing quarrels between Grand Master and Bishop, mainly over the order of precedence, and the union was again dissolved in 1528. Certificate of the papal legate Michael Padena on the inauguration of Grand Master Johann Siebenhirter, 14 May 1469 On 14 May 1469 Grand Master Siebenhirter ceremoniously entered Millstatt, where the Order was vested with the estates of the former Benedictine abbey. Emperor Frederick III himself had acted as the monastery's Vogt protector, but found its premises decayed and monastic life at a low point. His request to dissolve the convent was approved by Pope Paul II. The Order received further Carinthian estates at the strategically important Seeberg Saddle (Rechberg) and the Maria W√∂rth provostry, as well as the Styrian lordships of P√ºrgg in the Enns valley and Sankt Lorenzen im M√ºrztal. It temporarily held the former Sternberg comital estates, Landskron Castle (from 1511), the Bozen parish in Tyrol and additional possessions in Vienna and Lower Austria. When in 1479 the Order established its headquarters at Burg Wiener Neustadt, the patron of the Cathedral became Saint George. The proposed acquisition of Viktring Abbey, however, met fierce resistance from the Archbishop of Salzburg. Siebenhirter made significant efforts to restore the Millstatt monastery complex as a presentable residence and had extensive fortifications erected. He left valuable incunables such as a prayer book, today kept at the National Library of Sweden, and an antiphonary, which is part of the collections of the University Library of Graz. The Grand Master also provided for the decoration of numerous parish churches with Late Gothic winged altarpieces and frescoes. =Maximilian I= As the few Knights of Saint George proved unfit to fight the invading Ottoman forces, Emperor Frederick's son and successor Maximilian I (archduke 1493‚Äì1519, emperor 1508‚Äì19), called \\"the Last Knight\\", shortly after his father's death in 1493 established an affiliated secular Saint George fraternity, mainly to man a planned fortress at Rann (Bre≈æice) in Lower Styria. Emperor Maximilian himself and several Princes of the Holy Roman Empire joined the brotherhood in a solemn ceremony held at Antwerp Cathedral on 28 October 1494. Pope Alexander VI and numerous cardinals also were members. Maximilian called for a Christian campaign against the Ottoman intruders, which however failed due to the Habsburg quarrels with King Charles VIII of France and the Republic of Venice. Siebenhirter Tower, Millstatt Abbey Nevertheless, Maximilian remained an eager patron of the Order, whose representatives were present when in 1508 he took the title of an \\"Elected Roman Emperor\\" during a ceremony held at Trient Cathedral. On 10 October 1508 Grand Master Siebenhirter died and was succeeded by the Upper Austrian noble Johann Geumann. Maximilian thought about assuming the title of Grand Master himself, as he had had do cede the rights of Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece to his son Philip I of Castile in 1482, and Geumann did not receive his investiture until Maximilan's death on 1518. The next year, he acted as the late emperor's executioner of will and designated tomb guard at Wiener Neustadt Cathedral, after the Salzburg archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach had thwarted Maximilian's plans for a grail's fortress near St. Wolfgang. Numerous artworks from the estate of the emperor referred to the Order of Saint George, such as the Triumphal Arch, the Theuerdank and Wei√ükunig publications, as well as his prayer book printed in 1513 with drawings by Albrecht D√ºrer (kept at the Bavarian State Library). =Decline after Maximilian= With Maximilian, the Order lost his most influential patron. Emperors Charles V and his brother, Ferdinand I, had no interest in maintaining an obsolete knightly community not sufficient to meet modern military demands. Moreover, the Protestant Reformation spread over the Inner Austrian lands and was joined by many of the Order's members. After Johan Geumann died in 1536, a third Grand Master, Wolfgang Prandtner, was appointed, who nevertheless was absent most of the time and succumbed to the plague five years later. Afterwards no further Grand Master was appointed and the Order's premises were administrated by Imperial commissioners. When the Jesuit college in the Inner Austrian capital Graz was established by Archduke Charles II, the earnings of the order estates were added to its endowment. In 1598, the estates were formally handed over to the Jesuits; however, a formal dissolution of the Order is not documented. Further development A 17th century re-establishment of a knightly brotherhood () at the Augustinian Church in Vienna is mentioned in a 1974 guide to Austrian chivalric orders; the priory is said to be confirmed by Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria in 1848 and his successor Charles I in 1917. Upon the dissolution of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, Prior Alois Hudal in a memorandum turned to Charles I for the approbation of a secular chivalric order. The order's history was partly adopted by the secular Old Chivalric Order of Saint George, also called the Order of the Four Emperors, which was re-established in 1768 by count Philipp Ferdinand of Limburg-Stirum. Since 2011, a European Order of Saint George exists as a dynastic order of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, whose current head is Karl von Habsburg.

Family He was a member of the Veturii Cicurini, patrician branch of the gens Veturia. He was the son of Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus, consul in 494 BC. Biography =Consulship= In 462 BC, he became consul with Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus. The Romans recovered from a severe epidemic that occurred the year before and had taken the two consuls Publius Servilius Priscus Structus and Lucius Aebutius Helva, the augurs Titus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus and Manius Valerius Volusus Maximus, and the Curio Maximus Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus. Before the end of his consulship, a series of interreges were nominated in order to organize new elections. This they conducted during the term of the interrex, Publius Valerius Publicola in 462 BC. =War against the Aequi and the Volsci= The Aequi and Volsci attempted to take advantage of the consequences of the epidemic and attacked the territories of Rome and the Hernici. Geminus easily put the Volsci to flight while Lucius Lucretius inflicted a serious defeat against the pillagers, recovering the loot that they had taken from Roman territory.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 8 For these victories, Lucius Lucretius was given the honor of celebrating a triumph and Geminus was given an Ovation.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III.10Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, IX. 71  The rogatio Terentilia  When the consuls were absent from Rome, leading their armies in campaign against the Aequi and the Volsci, Terentilius, tribune of the plebs, proposed a law creating a special commission charged with regulating consular power. Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, named Praefectus urbi in absence of the consuls, opposed drafting the law and deferred the vote until the return of the consuls. =Decemvirate= In 451 BC, he was probably among the First Decemvirate - who wrote the first legal documents of Rome, the Law of the Twelve Tables, and who, according to tradition, governed Rome for one year with moderation.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XII. 9Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 33Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, X. 56 However, it is not certain that he was a decemvir as ancient authors disagree on his name. The Fasti Capitolini and Diodorus Siculus give the praenomen of Spurius, Livy that of Lucius, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus that of Titus. While many of the decemvirs were also consuls, only Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus and his (presumed) cousin Gaius Veturius Cicurinus match well with their filiations given by the Fasti Capitolini.

All crosses and Christian symbols have an inherent meaning arising from a multitude of sources and distinct features that set them apart from other religions. From both a design aspect and a theological perspective, the Carolingian Cross consists of a mixture of Christian and pre-Christian concepts built over a long history of cultural adaptation, religious iconography, liturgical practices and theological premises. German graphic designer Rudolf Koch in 1932 published a collection of 158 plates of drawings of Christian symbols. Under the heading of \\"Cross\\", this includes twelve drawings of Christian cross variants. One of these, dubbed \\"Carolingian Cross\\" (Karolingisches Kreuz) shows a cross of four triquetras inscribed in a circle.Rudolf Koch, Christliche Symbole (1932)Carolingian cross.  Artistic Conception  What differentiates the Carolingian Cross from other symbolic cross representations is that its design consists of four triquetras rotated to form a cross symbol. The use of the triquetra to form the symbol of the cross is both a representation of Christian theological conceptions of the Holy Trinity inter-fused with pre- Christian or pagan ideas of the tree of life. In this way the Carolingian Cross serves two conceptual purposes. Within Christianity, the triquetra symbol is an abstract variation of the cross itself symbolising the Holy Trinity, and the image of the cross is a symbolic representation of Christ‚Äôs sacrifice. External to Christianity, the triquetra symbol is found not only in ancient Celtic systems of religious thought, but also within that of the Scandinavian Vikings, and many other Germanic tribes within the Frankish region. The varied historical use of the triquetra has been used in Scandinavian runestone carvings, Germanic and Roman coins, and found within Christian illuminated manuscripts and Celtic knot style artworks. Thus, the Carolingian cross represents an inter-mixing or interfusion of Christian and pre-Christian cultural beliefs within one representative symbol. References  Further reading  Beatrice E.

The ancient city of Chalcis (a.k.a. Chalcis sub Libanum, Chalcis of Coele-Syria was located midway between Berytus and Damascus.Herod Agrippa II at Livius.org The modern town of Anjar in Lebanon is believed to be the site of ancient Chalcis sub Libanum, although this has not been definitively demonstrated. The ruins of a Roman temple are located a few kilometers south-west of Anjar near Majdal Anjar. Other sources indicate that Chalcis sub Libanum is located at \\"Husn esh-Shadur\\" near Baalbek. Independent kingdom Originally, Chalcis was a city in Coele-Syria. When the Seleucid influence in the area began to dissipate, the Itureans created the Kingdom of Chalcis, which stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to near Damascus. They made Chalcis the capital of their realm, Baalbek was the center of worship. The founder of the kingdom seems to have been Ptolemaeus, son of Menneus, an Ituraean dynast. During the time of Alexander Jannaeus, Hasmonaean king of Judea, Ptolemaeus had to cede part of his territory to the Hasmonaeans. This area was later known as Iturea (Iturea, in an ethnic sense, covered a much larger area). In 64 BCE Ptolemaeus bribed the Roman general Pompeius to refrain from annexing his kingdom and allow him to continue to rule as Tetrarch. Pompey also returned to him the areas lost to Jannaeus when he brought an end to the independent Hasmonaean state in 63 BCE. Roman vassal state Chalcis, Iturea and Trachonitis in the first century CE Chalcis was a vassal state under Roman rule during the remainder of Ptolemaeus' reign. In 40 BCE, he was succeeded by his son Lysanias. Lysanias supported the efforts of the Hasmonean scion Antigonus II Mattathias to take the throne of Judea in 42 and 40 BCE, allying with him against the Roman client king Herod, whom he temporarily supplanted on his Parthian-supported second attempt. Lysanias's anti-Roman sympathies eventually led to his execution by Mark Antony in 33 BCE, at the instigation of Cleopatra VII of Egypt, who had eyes on his territories.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 15.92. Though Antony gave Lysanias' territory to Cleopatra, a remnant realm of Chalcis persisted after this disaster, with the most important cities being Chalcis and Abila. Cleopatra leased it to Zenodorus, possibly a son of Lysanias, and following her suicide in 30 BCE, Augustus initially allowed Zenodorus to rule as Tetrarch, only to depose him in 23 BCE for conducting raids into Trachonitis, which had prompted complaints from his neighbors. Augustus then gave some or all of his lands to Herod, including Iturea, Batanaea, Trachonitis and Auranitis. Little is known about Chalcis itself in the time immediately after Lysanias' death; Chalcis sub Libanum and its district may have been made part of the Roman province of Syria, while Abilene, the area around Abila, appears to have made up a separate statelet at least part of the time. Division The districts surrendered to Herod continued to be ruled by him and his family, who in time came to control the core regions of the former kingdom as well. After Herod's death, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Batanaea, and Trachonitis became a tetrarchy under Philip, one of his sons. Meanwhile, Abilene may have gone to another Lysanias, mentioned in the Gospel of Luke as tetrarch of Abilene in the time of John the Baptist. It is possible, however, that the reference to Lysanias in Luke is an anachronistic reference to the Lysanias put to death by Antony. In AD 37, Emperor Caligula gave Herod Agrippa I the former tetrarchies of Philip (Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Batanaea, and Trachonitis) and Lysanias (Abilene). His realm was subsequently augmented in AD 39 by the non-Iturean regions of Galilee and Perea, formerly ruled by Herod AntipasSchwartz, Daniel R. Agrippa I Mohr 1990 (to which Caligula's successor Claudius would add Judea and Samaria in AD 41). Agrippa ruled all these territories until his death in AD 44. Meanwhile, in AD 39, the district of Iturea was given by Caligula to a certain Soemus, who is called by Dio Cassius (lix. 12) and by Tacitus (Annals, xii. 23) \\"king of the Itureans.\\" Soemus reigned until his death in AD 49, when his kingdom was incorporated into the province of Syria (Tacitus, l.c.). In AD 41, at Agrippa's request, his brother Herod was given Chalcis and allowed the title of basileus by Claudius. King Herod of Chalcis reigned until his death in AD 48, whereupon his kingdom was given to Agrippa's son Agrippa II, though only as a tetrarchy.: \\"In the year 50, without regard to the rights of the heir to the throne, he had himself appointed ... to the kingdom of Chalcis by the emperor.\\" Agrippa II was forced to give up the tetrarchy of Chalcis in AD 53, but in exchange Claudius made him ruler with the title of king over the territories previously governed by Philip (Batanea, Trachonitis and Gaulanitis), and Lysanias (Abilene).Josephus, Antiquities (book 20, chapter 7, verse 1); Josephus, Wars of the Jews (book 2, chapter 12, verse 8). In 55, the Emperor Nero added to his realm the cities of Tiberias and Taricheae in Galilee, and Livias (Iulias), with fourteen villages near it, in Perea. The tetrarchy of Chalcis previously surrendered by Agrippa II was subsequently in 57 given to his cousin Aristobulus, the son of Herod of Chalcis (). After the death of Aristobulus in AD 92, Chalcis was absorbed into the province of Syria. According to Photius, Agrippa died at the age of seventy in the third year of the reign of Trajan (AD 100,Photius cod. 33 but statements of Josephus, in addition to the contemporary epigraphy from his kingdom, cast this date into serious doubt. The modern scholarly consensus holds that he died before 93/94.Rajak (1996), Iulius Agrippa (2) II, Marcus Following his death his realm as well came under the direct rule of Rome.

Since the company was focusing on the development of the Epcot Center at Walt Disney World, Disney chairman Card Walker turned down the proposal. Instead, they made a deal with HBO to air a select number of Disney films, cartoons, and specials, including a live production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at Radio City Music Hall. However, Disney revived the idea in November 1981, entering into a partnership with the satellite unit of Group W (which had sold its 50% ownership stake in one of The Disney Channel's early rivals, Showtime, to Viacom around the same time); however, Group W would ultimately drop out of the intended joint venture that September, due to disagreements over the channel's creative control and financial obligations that would have required Group W to pay a 50% share of the channel's start-up costs. Despite losing Group W as a partner, The Disney Channel continued on with its development ‚Äì now solely under the oversight of Walt Disney Productions, and under the leadership of the channel's first president Alan Wagner, Walt Disney Productions formally announced the launch of its family-oriented cable channel in early 1983. Disney later invested US$11 million to acquiring space on two transponders of the Hughes Communications satellite Galaxy 1, and spent US$20 million on purchasing and developing programming. The concept of a premium service aimed at a family audience ‚Äì which Walt Disney Productions would choose to develop The Disney Channel as ‚Äì had first been attempted by HBO, which launched Take 2 in 1979 (the service, which was HBO's first attempt at a spin-off niche service (predating Cinemax's launch in August 1980), would shut down after only a few months on the air), and was followed by the 1981 launch of the Group W-owned Home Theater Network (which was the only premium channel that strictly competed with The Disney Channel for that demographic for much of the 1980s, until the 1987 launch of Festival). 1983‚Äì1990: As a premium channel and early years The Disney Channel launched nationally as a premium channel on April 18, 1983, at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The first program ever aired on the channel was also its first original series, Good Morning, Mickey!, which presented Disney animated shorts. At the time of its launch, The Disney Channel's programming aired for 16 hours each day from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (comparatively, its competitors HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Spotlight all had been operating on 24-hour programming schedules for a few years at the time). By the fall of 1983, the channel was available to more than 532,000 subscribers in the United States; this total would increase to 611,000 subscribers in December of that year. For its subscribers, the channel provided a monthly (and later bi- monthly) program guide/magazine called The Disney Channel Magazine, which in addition to carrying listings for the channel's programming, had also carried feature stories on upcoming programs (the magazine also lent its name to a series of interstitials seen during promotional breaks on the channel that provided behind-the-scenes looks at programming). The Disney Channel Magazine ceased publication in early 1997 and was replaced by Behind the Ears (a print magazine which also shared its name with another series of behind-the-scenes interstitials that aired on the channel from 1997 to 2000) as the channel began primarily operating as a commercial-free basic channel.Gutman, Steve. \\"Letter from the Publisher\\". The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 14, no. 6, December 1996/January 1997: p. 4. As a premium channel, The Disney Channel often ran free previews of five days to one week in length four times annually, as well as two periodic weekend-only previews (with ads targeted to cable and satellite customers who were not subscribers to the channel); this resulted in The Disney Channel offering more preview events each calendar year during its tenure as a pay service than HBO, Cinemax and Showtime had run during that timeframe. In April 1984, the channel extended its daily programming to 18 hours (from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time), with the addition of two hours onto its late night schedule.The Disney Channel Magazine, April 1984. On December 1, 1986, The Disney Channel began broadcasting 24 hours a day.The Disney Channel Magazine, December 1986. Disney Channel logo from 1983-1997 By September 1983, The Disney Channel was available on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states. In October 1983, the channel debuted its first made-for-cable movie, Tiger Town, which earned the channel a CableACE Award. The first \\"classic\\" Disney animated film to be broadcast on the channel, Alice in Wonderland, premiered on the network in January 1984. By January 1985, the channel's programming reached 1.75 million subscribers, at which time the channel had reached profitability. Sometime in 1986, (Colossal) Pictures produced on-air identification bumpers featuring Mickey Mouse (his gloved hands, and sometimes his feet, only visible) and the logo, be them animated or live action. In August 1989, the channel launched a series of interstitial segments called The Disney Channel Salutes The American Teacher; the channel subsequently began telecasting the American Teacher Awards in November 1991. By January 1990, The Disney Channel had about five million subscribers nationwide. In May of that year, The Disney Channel won its first Daytime Emmy Awards for the original made-for-cable film Looking for Miracles, the documentary Calgary '88: 16 Days of Glory, and the special A Conversation with... George Burns, as well as its first Peabody Award for the television film Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme. 1990‚Äì1997: As a hybrid premium/basic channel On September 1, 1990, TCI's Montgomery, Alabama, system became the first cable provider to carry the channel as a basic cable service. In 1991, eight additional cable providers volunteered to move the channel to their expanded basic cable tiers, with the first to make the transition (as a test run) being Jones Intercable's systems in Fort Myers and Broward County, Florida. Other cable providers eventually began moving the channel to their basic tiers, either experimentally or on a full-time basis. Even as major providers such as Cox Communications and Marcus Cable began offering The Disney Channel on their basic tiers, executives for The Walt Disney Company denied that the channel had plans to convert into an ad- supported basic service, stating that the move from premium to basic cable on some systems was part of a five-year \\"hybrid\\" strategy that allowed providers to offer the channel in either form. In 1991, The Disney Channel tested a two- channel multiplex service on two cable systems. HBO, Cinemax and Showtime also launched their own multiplex services that same year. However, The Disney Channel would not make its own multiplex service permanent, unlike the others. By 1992, a third of the channel's subscriber base were estimated by Nielsen Media Research to be adults that did not have children; and by 1995, its subscriber base expanded to 15 million cable homes, eight million of which paid an additional monthly fee to receive the channel. In March 1992, the channel debuted the original children's program Adventures in Wonderland, a contemporary live-action adaption of Alice in Wonderland (which, in turn, was based on the novel Alice Through the Looking Glass). In September 1992, the channel began carrying the Disney's Young Musicians Symphony Orchestra series of specials, which aired annually until 1998. In honor of its 10th anniversary, the channel embarked on a 14-city nationwide bus tour starting in April 1993. By January 1995, The Disney Channel was available to 12.6 million subscribers; the period from 1994 to 1995 saw the largest yearly subscriber increase with 4.87 million households with cable television adding the channel. In March 1995, the first international Disney Channel service was launched in Taiwan. That year, the documentary Anne Frank Remembered premiered on the channel; that film would earn an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1996. In 1996, veteran cable executive Anne Sweeney was appointed to oversee The Disney Channel as its president; that September as the launch of Disney Channel service in Southeast Asia, the channel began offering a film in primetime each night starting at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, with the expansion of the Sunday Magical World of Disney film block to Monday through Saturday nights; the new primetime schedule launched in September with the pay cable premiere of The Lion King. 1997‚Äì2002: Relaunch On April 6, 1997, The Disney Channel underwent a significant rebranding, shortening its name to just \\"Disney Channel\\" ‚Äì though the channel was typically referred to simply as \\"Disney\\" in on-air promotions and network identifications until September 2002 ‚Äì and introducing a new logo designed by Lee Hunt Associates (a black Mickey ear-shaped TV set, though with the introduction of a new graphics package for on-air promotions and IDs during the channel's daytime and evening lineup in 2000, the TV's patterning often varied; early versions of the logo featured people and animated characters appearing within the TV set element of the logo such as a 1930s-era Mickey Mouse). The debut of its new on-air look coincided with the cable television premiere of Pocahontas. The channel continued to transition from a premium service into a basic cable channel around this time, albeit with a similar programming format to the one it carried as a full- fledged pay service. However, the channel began shifting its target audience more toward kids (but continued to cater to family audiences at night), as it decreased the amount of older films it aired, and its music programming shifted focus towards the pre-teen and teenage demographic, incorporating music videos and revamping its concert specials to feature younger musicians popular with that demographic. Disney Channel initially continued to offer free preview events for pay television providers that continued to carry it as a premium service, but discontinued them altogether within three years of the rebrand. Although many providers still required subscribers to pay an additional monthly fee to view the channel at the time of its decision to incorporate them, Disney Channel also began to air break interruptions within shows, featuring promotions for the channel's programs as well as for feature film and home video releases from Disney. By March 1998, the channel was available to 35 million cable subscribers. The channel's programming would eventually be split into three distinct blocks: Playhouse Disney, Vault Disney, and Zoog Disney. Playhouse Disney debuted in May 1997, and comprised shows aimed at preschoolers. Its first series to reach wide popularity, Bear in the Big Blue House, made its debut in October 1997 and was named by TV Guide as one of the \\"top 10 new shows for kids\\". Vault Disney debuted as a Sunday-only nighttime block in September 1997 and featured older Disney programs such as Zorro, The Mickey Mouse Club and the Walt Disney anthology television series, as well as older television specials and feature films). Zoog Disney was introduced in August 1998, and was the most distinct of the three blocks, compromising Disney Channel Original Series aimed at preteens and teens. The afternoon-to-late evening lineup was hosted by anthropomorphic robot/alien hybrid characters called the \\"Zoogs\\" (who were originally two- dimensional figures, but were redesigned as cel shaded anime-esque figures and given mature voices in 2001) and was designed to encourage viewer interactivity between television and the Internet. The Zoog Disney brand would later expand, with most of the channel's weekend schedule (outside of Vault Disney and Playhouse Disney) becoming part of the \\"Zoog Weekendz\\" umbrella block from June 2000 to August 2002. Original programming on Disney Channel began to ramp up during this period starting with the sitcom Flash Forward, and would increase in the following years with shows like The Famous Jett Jackson in 1998 and So Weird in 1999, and into the early 2000s with Lizzie McGuire ‚Äì whose star Hilary Duff became the first lead actor or actress in one of the channel's original series to cross over into music through a record deal with co-owned music label Hollywood Records ‚Äì and Even Stevens ‚Äì which helped launch the career of its star Shia LaBeouf. In 1999, Disney Channel placed a mandate to cable operators that continued to carry it as a premium service to move the channel to a basic cable tier or stop carrying it altogether, stipulating that it would not renew carriage agreements with providers (such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, the last major cable providers to carry the channel as a pay service) that chose to continue offering the network as a premium channel. With the shift towards children as its target audience, some of the off-network programs acquired by the channel during the early-mid 2000s (such as Boy Meets World and later Sister, Sister) began to be edited for content such as profanity and sexual references that were deemed inappropriate for younger audiences. By 2001, Disney Channel was available to approximately 70 million cable and satellite subscribers, largely consisting of those who had already received the channel through basic cable, as well as the remnants of its pay subscriber base. The music videos and concert specials that the channel had been airing since the 1997 rebrand were dropped by this time, citing the inability to obtain revenue from the artists' CD sales and lack of exclusivity for the videos; soon after, the channel began featuring music videos from artists signed to Disney's in-house record labels Hollywood Records and Walt Disney Records, and songs featured in Disney- produced feature films. In 2001, the channel debuted its first original animated series, The Proud Family; the following year, Disney Channel achieved its first major animated series hit with the premiere of Kim Possible. 2002‚Äì2007: Peak Burbank, California, as it appeared in the 2000s (the logo was later removed instead of being replaced with the 2002-era logo) By 2002, Disney Channel was available in 80 million cable homes nationwide. In early September of that year, Disney Channel began a gradual rebranding, beginning with the discontinuance of the \\"Zoog\\" brand from on-air use (though Zoog Disney would continue to exist as a separate website until 2003, when the site's content was consolidated onto Disney Channel's primary website, DisneyChannel.com). On September 9, the Vault Disney overnight block was replaced by same-day repeats of the channel's original and acquired programs, primarily to contribute to the network's then-upcoming \\"hip\\" image. The block's removal resulted in Disney Channel not featuring programs aimed at adults for the first time in its history ‚Äì with the channel's primetime feature films becoming the only programs that intentionally targeted a broader family audience. , Disney Channel is the only major American cable channel aimed at children that does not directly maintain a dual audience of both kids and adults (Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network each feature nighttime programming for families and/or adults). Movies shown during primetime were also reduced from an average of two to three features to only one each night of the week. The channel phased out reality and scripted drama series from its original programming slate, while substantially increasing the channel's reliance on live-action sitcoms and animated series. On October 7, 2002, Disney Channel introduced a new on-air logo designed by CA Square (using an outline of Mickey Mouse's head as its centerpiece) that would later be adopted by its international sister channels in May 2003, and unveiled a new graphical design to fit the network's new look. Moreover, starting in May 2003, the channel began using a series of bumpers that are still used to this day, primarily featuring actors and animated characters from its original programs (and occasionally from Disney's theatrical releases) drawing the channel's logo using a wand (in actuality, a glowstick). Playhouse Disney became the only program block introduced in 1997 to remain on Disney Channel by this point (it was later relaunched as Disney Junior in February 2011). Around this time, Disney Channel's original series began airing as part of corporate sister ABC's Saturday morning children's program block; most of the shows that began airing on the block in 2006 would remain on the network until September 2011, when it was replaced by the Litton Entertainment-produced block Litton's Weekend Adventure. Anne Sweeney was appointed president of Disney‚ÄìABC Television Group in 2004, ultimately helping to remake Disney Channel into \\"the major profit driver in the company\\" by the middle of the decade as the channel made major inroads in increasing its overall viewership, while in turn using a strategy ‚Äì which proved successful ‚Äì to discover, nurture and aggressively cross-promote teen music stars whose style and image were carefully targeted to the pre-teen and teenage demographic (a strategy that has been de-emphasized in the 2010s). Around that time ‚Äì as Disney Channel's intended target audience began ranging from preschoolers to young adolescents ‚Äì the channel began to add viewers outside this target demographic, creating increased competition with Viacom-owned Nickelodeon. In 2003, Disney Channel premiered its first ever made-for-cable movie musical, The Cheetah Girls, which received a worldwide audience of 84 million viewers. In 2005, That's So Raven (which debuted in January 2003) became the channel's highest-rated series since its transition to basic cable as well as becoming the first original series to run longer than 65 episodes ‚Äì breaking a highly controversial rule that was implemented in 1998, aimed at limiting increases in production costs for its original programming (the 65-episode rule is no longer enforced, although most series are now usually discontinued after their fourth season at maximum) ‚Äì Raven eventually became the channel's longest- running original series at 100 episodes and the first to spawn a spin-off series (Cory in the House). The Suite Life of Zack & Cody made its debut in March 2005, and also became a hit for the channel. The earlier success of The Cheetah Girls led to the creation of other music-themed original programming: 2006 saw the debut of the hit original movie High School Musical (on January 20) and the series Hannah Montana (on March 24), the latter of which launched the career of its star Miley Cyrus (who starred opposite her father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, in the series). On July 28 of that year, the channel saw the debut of its first multiple-series crossover, That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana (which involved That's So Raven, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Hannah Montana). 2007‚Äì2013: Focus on original series and big ratings In 2007, the channel began dropping most of its acquired programs, and also began to incorporate rotating hour-long blocks of its original series and other programs during the daytime hours. It also moved first-run episodes of its original series on weekends from late afternoon/early evening into primetime. In addition, the channel began putting less emphasis on its animated series, moving some of them from primetime to graveyard slots, while substantially increasing its reliance on teen-oriented sitcoms. Despite this, 2007 saw the debut of Phineas and Ferb, the first original animated series (and first long-form original series) to be broadcast in HD. On March 19, 2008, Disney Channel launched a high-definition simulcast of the network. Two other series premiered that year: the That's So Raven spin-off Cory in the House (which ended after two seasons) and the more successful Wizards of Waverly Place (which surpassed That's So Raven in October 2011 to become Disney Channel's longest-running original series, and ending its run in January 2012 at 106 episodes). High School Musical 2 premiered on August 17 of that year, becoming the highest-rated non-sports program in the history of basic cable and the highest-rated made-for-cable movie premiere on record (as well as the highest-rated television program ‚Äì broadcast or cable ‚Äì of Summer 2007) with 17.2 million viewers. In 2008, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody spin- off The Suite Life on Deck (which became the #1 series among children between ages of 6- and 12-years-old in 2008) premiered, along with two more music- based original made-for-TV movies: Camp Rock and The Cheetah Girls: One World. Capitalizing on the rising star status of the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato following Camp Rock, two series respectively starring both acts premiered in 2009: Jonas (which was renamed Jonas L.A. for its second season before being canceled) and Sonny with a Chance (Lovato also co-starred in the original movie Princess Protection Program, which premiered in June). The August debut of the original film Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie became the highest- rated cable program of 2009 (excluding sporting events), premiering to 11.4 million viewers and ranking as the second highest-rated original movie premiere in Disney Channel's history, behind High School Musical 2. (A one- hour Wizards reunion special, Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex would later premiere in March 2013.) The July 17 premiere of the Wizards/Suite Life on Deck/Hannah Montana crossover special Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana also beat out its cable and broadcast competition that night with 9.1 million viewers (effectively making the Wizards and On Deck episodes featured in the special the highest-rated episodes of both series at that point). In 2010, Good Luck Charlie debuted as Disney Channel's first original sitcom targeted at family audiences, while Fish Hooks and Shake It Up also made their debuts. That year also saw the premiere of Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam among the four original movies premiering that year, along with two made-for-TV movies that were co-produced with Canadian specialty channels (Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars, in conjunction with Movie Central and The Movie Network; and 16 Wishes, with Family Channel). On November 19, 2010, Disney Channel began offering an alternate Spanish-language audio feed (carried either as a separate second audio program track or sold by cable and satellite providers in the form of a separate channel that is part of a Spanish-language programming package). Hannah Montana and The Suite Life on Deck both ended in 2011; Sonny with a Chance, meanwhile, was retooled for its third season as So Random! ‚Äì focusing on the show within the show ‚Äì after Demi Lovato decided not to return to the series to focus on her music career, following her treatment for bulimia and bipolar disorder (the So Random! spin-off series was canceled after one season in May 2012). Four other series (A.N.T. Farm, PrankStars, Jessie and Austin & Ally) also debuted that year, along with six made for-TV movies (most notably The Suite Life Movie, Lemonade Mouth and Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension). With the channel using the summer, winter and fall on-air appearances, it began to collaborate with Hallmark Cards to promote greeting cards of its original programming. In 2012, Disney Channel ended Nickelodeon's 17-year run as the highest-rated cable channel in the United States, placing its first ever win in total-day viewership among all cable networks as measured by ACNielsen. In June of that year, The Walt Disney Company announced that it would stop advertising or promoting food or beverage products that do not meet strict nutritional guidelines on Disney Channel or its other media properties aimed at children by 2015, purportedly becoming the first media company to take such a stance on stopping the marketing of junk food products to kids (due to its commercial-free format, such advertising appears only in the form of underwriter sponsorships during promotional breaks). In January of that year, Disney aired the premiere of the DCOM Frenemies. In February 2012, Disney aired another DCOM - Radio Rebel. In June 2012, Disney aired its third DCOM - Let It Shine, along with the premiere of the animated series Gravity Falls. In October 2012, Disney premiered the sitcom Dog with a Blog as well as the original film Girl vs. Monster. On July 1, 2012, Disney Channel began providing Descriptive Video Service audio in compliance with the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, which required network owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in the 25 largest television markets as well as the five highest-rated cable and satellite channels (including Disney Channel) to offer audio descriptions for the blind. Since July 1, 2012, Disney Channel now presents an on-screen mark at the beginning of certain programming on their schedule to refer that the program has audio description for visually-impaired, in order to comply with the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010. Certain episodes of Gravity Falls, Austin and Ally, Good Luck Charlie and Phineas and Ferb show the AD))) mark and a 2-tone sound repeated 3 times at the beginning of the episode to notice the audio description track available through the SAP feed. Disney Junior airs the AD)) mark and the intended SAP track on newer episodes of Little Einsteins. (ABC airs this mark of the bottom-left corner of the screen.) On July 14, 2012, Disney Channel announced its first television collaboration with Marvel Entertainment (which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2009), in the form of a crossover special that aired on August 16, 2013 called Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel featuring characters from Phineas and Ferb and the Marvel Universe, a new animated series, Wander Over Yonder debuted after that. 2014‚Äì2016: Rebrand On February 15 and 16, 2014, Disney Channel announced the future of the animated series airing on the channel at the time; it announced that Gravity Falls and Wander Over Yonder would move to Disney XD but will still air episodes on Disney Channel as part of \\"Disney XD on Disney Channel\\", and that Phineas and Ferb would go on hiatus, with its production having already been suspended. Around April 2014, Disney Channel also completely stopped airing the Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto cartoon shorts that would air as part of the commercials, due to the fact that the Mickey Mouse short series which premiered on June 28, 2013, replacing the older cartoon shorts and airing regularly as part of the commercials. In 2014, Disney Channel premiered two new series ‚Äì I Didn't Do It, Girl Meets World ‚Äì and three new DCOMs ‚Äì Cloud 9, Zapped and How to Build a Better Boy. Zapped was the highest rated movie of the year. Four new DCOMs premiered in 2015: Bad Hair Day, Teen Beach 2, Descendants, and Invisible Sister. Especially among them, Descendants was viewed by 6.6 million people on its premiere night on July 31, 2015 and 10.5 million viewers in Early DVR Playback. Shortly after the premier air date, ratings showed the film was the fifth most watched original movie in cable history. On March 21, 2014, A.N.T. Farm aired its last episode after three seasons. In 2015, Disney Channel premiered three new series: K.C. Undercover, Best Friends Whenever, and the Jessie spin-off Bunk'd. 2015 also marks the year that several series aired its last episodes. On June 12, 2015, Phineas and Ferb aired its last episode after 4 seasons. On September 25, 2015, Dog with a Blog aired its last episode after three seasons. Less than a month after, I Didn't Do It and Jessie also aired their last episodes after two and four seasons respectively on October 16, 2015. In December 2015, Disney Channel acquired Mako Mermaids for a January 2016 premiere. On January 10, 2016, Austin and Ally aired its last two episodes after four seasons. On February 8, 2016, several newsletters reported that Disney Channel acquired a teen music drama called Backstage that made its premiere on March 25, 2016. On February 14, 2016, during the channel's premiere of the 2013 animated film Frozen, Disney Channel aired a preview of Stuck in the Middle, the first Disney Channel series which all of the main characters are Hispanic. Additional episodes began airing on March 11, 2016. Stuck in the Middle is also the first single-camera Disney Channel series since Jonas L.A.. On June 24, 2016, Disney Channel premiered its 100th DCOM, Adventures in Babysitting, followed by the premiere of new series, Bizaardvark. Prior to the premiere, Disney Channel aired the \\"100th DCOM Celebration\\" which began Friday, May 27, 2016 with a four-day marathon of the 51 most popular DCOMs followed by encore presentations of these and every other DCOM ever made through June 2016. The movies would be seen on Disney Channel, the Disney Channel app and VOD through summer 2016. 2016‚Äì2019: Return of animated series and acquisitions On July 22, 2016, Disney premiered an animated series Elena of Avalor, a spin-off of the Disney Junior series Sofia the First and the first long-form original cartoon on the network since Wander Over Yonder in 2013. In August, Variety announced that a new single-camera series titled Andi Mack would start production in the fall for a 2017 premiere; the show would also be the first on the network to be geared at Asian Americans. Around the same time, Deadline reported that Disney Channel had acquired the worldwide TV rights to The ZhuZhus from Nelvana; the show would premiere in the US on September 12, 2016. The Lodge premiered on Disney Channel UK and Ireland in September 2016 and became the channel's highest rated series premiere in the last four years. 2017 would see several series finales and premieres for both Disney Channel's original and acquired programs. Girl Meets World, Best Friends Whenever, and Liv and Maddie all aired their final episodes in January, February, and March respectively. Meanwhile, Tangled: The Series (later retitled Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure), a spin-off of the 2010 film Tangled, first premiered with a precursor TV film on March 10, 2017 before regular episodes began airing on March 24. The premiere of Tangled also coincided with the debut of Disney Channel's graphic redesign. June 25 would see the premiere of Hotel Transylvania: The Series, an animated series based on characters from the 2012 movie of the same name, while the That's So Raven spin-off Raven's Home would debut immediately after the premiere of Descendants 2, on July 21. 2018 officially marked Disney Channel's return to animated programming; in February, the network ordered production on Amphibia and The Owl House while also reporting their intent to premiere first-run episodes from the fourth season of Star vs. the Forces of Evil. Additional press releases in the following months saw Disney XD originals DuckTales, Big Hero 6: The Series, Milo Murphy's Law, and the forthcoming Big City Greens move over to Disney Channel for their premieres. In April, the network unveiled their summer lineup ‚Äì \\"Disney Channel GO!\\" ‚Äì which, among other series, included a revival of Bug Juice entitled Bug Juice: My Adventures at Camp. New pickups, acquisitions, and renewals would continue throughout the end of 2018 into 2019, including Star Wars Resistance, Coop & Cami Ask the World, a fourth season of Bunk'd (which would not include regular cast members Peyton List, Karan Brar and Skai Jackson), Sydney to the Max, the miniseries Fast Layne, Just Roll with It, as well as the animated series Go Away, Unicorn! (co-produced with Canadian children's network YTV), Sadie Sparks, Ghostforce, and Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir (which had aired on Disney Channel's international outlets since its inception). 2020-present: Temporary return to commercial-free service From January 6-August 30, 2020, Disney Channel went completely commercial-free on weeknights and weekend mornings. This move saw the removal of most pre-show wand IDs, while promos for new episodes and movies avoided showing a given time for the premiere.

Description and history The Warner Home is located in northeastern St. Albans, at the northeast corner of High Street and Isham Avenue. It is a large three-story brick building, with a hip roof. Its west-facing front facade is dominated by a massive central portico, rising two stories to a modillioned hip roof and supported by fluted columns and pilasters. It is flanked on either side single-story porches, supported by smaller versions of similar columns. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings, with brick headers and wooden sills. The interior has retained many original finishes and features, despite modernizations in the 1950s and 1960s, and the conversion of the building to residential use in 1987. with The Warner Home was established in St. Albans in 1882 by bequest of Chauncey Warner of Cambridge, Vermont. It was originally located in a large Italianate building elsewhere in the city, which burned down in 1900. The present building was constructed at a cost of $20,000, using the last funds from Warner's bequest and money raised by subscription. The building as originally outfitted included bedrooms, classrooms, playrooms, and other public spaces. It was described at the time as one of the most prominent institutions of its type in northern New England. The building was converted into condominiums in 1987-88, retaining most of the room layout and restoring the central lobby.

The College building theatre, known to its regulars as the Butts Theatre, closed its doors behind the last audience member in January 2009, following the acquisition of the (then-named) City College site by developers. For years its future had been in doubt, but it re-opened on 1 February 2013. The Council's intervention - requiring the site owners to retain and support the re-named Albany Theatre for at least 25 years through the creation of a charitable trust - made it possible for volunteers to undertake a considerable amount of work revamping, replacing and renovating services and facilities. Adam Durnin was appointed as Theatre Manager, taking the Albany's development through its next stages. By October 2016, a team of 8 full and part-time staff, supported by 4 apprentices, had taken responsibility for the day to day management of the theatre - but still supported by volunteers. Facilities include an art-deco style theatre, seating up to 620 (515 stalls, 120 balcony). The Albany Theatre currently hosts a varied programme of events including music, theatre and children's shows.  History  As the engineering technology of the late 1890s became more complex, the construction of machine tools became more specialised and a trained workforce was needed. In response, Coventry 's new Technical Institute was opened in 1888 in an old textile warehouse in Earl Street which David Spencer had dedicated to the City Council on the condition that it should be used for technical schools and a school of science. Local industry was responsible for supplying the major equipment needed for these courses, often free of charge, and The American Writing Machine Company loaned typewriters to the commercial department until 1893. The Institute's Earl Street buildings were never really fully suitable for use, and so in the early 1900s, plans were drawn up to flatten the building and build a new one on the same site, but this proved to be too expensive. Various other sites were considered and Pool Meadow was selected. However, with the outbreak of the First World War, no further progress could be made. In 1919, the City Council acquired three acres of land at the corner of Albany Road and The Butts ‚Äì as a site for the new building (bringing together the Junior Technical School, providing apprenticeships for boys who were not academic enough for the National Diploma, and the Institute). The name Butts comes from when the land was used by archers for practice ‚Äì involving mounds of earth known as butts up to 200m long, forming a range along which the archers could shoot ‚Äì Edward IV having passed a law in 1477 making it compulsory for all males to own a longbow and to practice on Sundays after church!! In 1926 the Institute qualified as a Technical College and changed its name accordingly ‚Äì free from fees for children aged 5‚Äì11 and a senior school for over 11s. Coventry led the country in day release apprenticeships with 500 registered in 1931. The Institute was now providing courses for every level up to final honours degree. Work began on the building of the new college in August 1933, and a time capsule (messages in a bottle) was buried under the front steps by the workmen ‚Äì this was later discovered in 1995. On 10 July 1934, the Prince of Wales visited the building whilst it was still under construction and the new building was opened on 10 December 1935 by the then Duke of York who became George VI. During the Second World War, trenches were dug in the sports ground and special courses were run in fuel efficiency, economical bread production and the making of wartime gym shoes. The iron railings at the front (which had cost ¬£600) were lost to the War effort and the nation's need for scrap iron for a paltry ¬£30. The College never closed during this time and after the heavy bombing in November 1940, hundreds of homeless citizens were housed at the college. A number of bombs were dropped on the building, but it escaped with little damage. The theatre was originally used as a lecture theatre, called the Great Hall, when the college was first opened. Later the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts used the Theatre through the War Years to entertain the public with concerts and other events.

Paired sash windows are set on the second story above the entrance, and a triangular fan is set in the gable. The interior has a front lobby, with flanking stairs to the second floor. On each floor, a hallway leads toward the rear, flanked by smaller rooms, leading to a larger meeting space. The downstairs space is smaller, the flanking rooms each housing kitchen spaces, while the upper meeting hall has a stage at the far end. with The town of Worcester was chartered in 1763, but was abandoned in 1816, the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", when many crops failed. It was resettled in 1821, its early town meetings held in a local tavern. In 1846 a combination church and town hall was built, providing space for both town meetings and the local Congregationalists. That building was destroyed by fire in 1904. The present building was completed in 1912 on the site of the previous hall.

Tamils Emigration =Early migrations (before 1800s)= Many of Tamil emigrants who left shores of Tamil Nadu before 18th Century and mixed with countless other ethnicities. In medieval period Tamilians emigrated as soldiers, traders and labourers settled in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and intermixed well with local population, while few communities still maintain their language and culture. Many groups still claim descent from medieval-era Tamil emigrants such as the Kaikadis of Maharashtra, Chittys of Malaysia, and the Sri Lankan Chetties, Bharatha people, some section of Sri Lankan Tamils of Sri Lanka. =European Colonial period 1684 - 1947= During this period British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Danish colony administrators recruited a lot of local Tamilians and took them to their overseas colonies to work as laborers, petty administration officers, clerical and military duties. In the 19th century, Madras Presidency (of which the Tamil Nadu region was a core part of) faced brutal famines. Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78. Tamil Nadu was both politically and economically weak. Britishers thus made use of hungry Tamil workers for their plantations all over the world - Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji and also Sri Lanka (distinct from the Tamils who migrated to Sri Lanka before 18th century). Some of the Tamil groups (especially Chettiyars, Pillais, Muslims) emigrated as commercial migrants. These groups then dominated the trade and finance in Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa and other places. The first Indian to own a merchant ship during the British times comes from this group. These Tamilians well integrated, assimilated with their adopted countries, and became part and parcel of local populations in Mauritius, South Africa, Guyana, and Fiji. Where as Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka of Sri Lanka, and Tamil Malaysians of Malaysia were evolved into distinct communities of their own with multilingual and unique sub-culture identity. = Modern Migration (1950 - present) = In the second half of the 20th century, around 2 million Tamils from India migrated as skilled professionals to various parts of India and countries like UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA, Singapore and so on. Some of them got citizenship of respective countries but still having strong family and cultural ties with Tamil Nadu, than those who migrated before 1950, who lost touch with their ancestral links in Tamil Nadu.

The survey marker is at the border corner of South-West Queensland with New South Wales and South Australia; it was established in 1880. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  Corners of Australia Cameron Corner Survey Marker was established in September 1880 during the first official survey of the western section of the border between Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) undertaken in 1879-1881. It defines the westernmost extension of the Queensland-New South Wales border. Its marking was a surveying feat of its time. After debate about a suitable southern boundary for the proposed new colony to the north of New South Wales (NSW), letters patent were issued by Queen Victoria in June 1859 which separated the new Colony of Queensland from NSW. The letters patent described the border between the two colonies as having three components: * the watershed from Point Danger (28¬∞8\\"S) west to the Dumaresq River * a river section formed by the Dumaresq, Macintyre and Barwon Rivers to latitude 29 degrees South * along latitude 29 degrees South to the 141st meridian of East longitude, which was the eastern boundary of South Australia. The eastern and western sections of the border required surveying but the central river section did not. The eastern section was surveyed between 1863 and 1866. In 1863 surveyors Francis Edward Roberts from Queensland and Isaiah Rowland from New South Wales were chosen to survey the boundary line from Point Danger west to the Dumaresq River. Starting in June, two separate surveys were carried out, and although in many instances both surveyors used the same tree to mark the border, Rowland and Roberts defined the border in different positions. At the direction of the Queensland Surveyor-General, Roberts deviated from the definable position of the watershed in order to increase the accuracy of the survey. Subsequently, the New South Wales and Queensland governments essentially adopted the survey of Roberts. Marking the river section formed by the Dumaresq, Macintyre and Barwon Rivers to 29 degrees South took place in 1865. Queensland and New South Wales arranged for the fixing of the 29th parallel of latitude, at the intersections of the Barwon, Mooni, Bokhara, Narran, Biri and Culgoa Rivers, to enable the colonial governments to adjust the rents of leases of several pastoral runs in the vicinity, some of which were partly in both colonies. In addition, about of land on the Queensland border could not be leased until its position was determined. Augustus Charles Gregory, Queensland Surveyor-General and NSW District Surveyor of the Northern Rivers, William Albert Baylesford Greaves, conducted this initial survey of latitude 29S. The marking of the border was done with steel (iron) pins one inch in diameter and two feet long, driven a few inches below the surface, radial reference bearings being taken to adjacent trees.This process was repeated at each of the above named rivers, and the work was completed in five or six weeks. That left surveying of the western section of the border at latitude 29 degrees S to be completed. Pastoral occupation of south-west Queensland began in the 1860s. In July 1862 Sir Charles Nicholson had reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that: \\"On the west, the whole of the basin of the 'Barcoo' for several hundred miles, as far as the 142nd meridian of East longitude, is becoming rapidly occupied by squatters, and the authorised possession of the greater part of it has already, I believe, been secured under pastoral licenses...\\". Pastoralists began settling the Cooper and Bulloo country and the adjacent portion of South Australia in 1864 with Bulloo Downs Station being the first pastoral run in the Bulloo area. By the end of the decade the Cooper country was also settled. During the 1870s, settlement extended west to the Diamantina, Mulligan and Georgina areas. In 1873, the pastoral districts were named - Gregory South comprised the Bulloo and lower Cooper area and the remainder became Gregory North. Initially runs in both districts were stocked with cattle and sheep. By 1885 all available land in Queensland's far south-west had been claimed. This land, comprising the floodplains of the Mulligan, Georgina, Diamantina and Bulloo Rivers and Cooper Creek, which form part of a vast inland drainage system originating in Queensland's central west and north-west and eventually reaching Lake Eyre, became known as Channel Country. During floods, the semi-arid region becomes a network of channels, watering vast grasslands suitable for cattle-fattening. Another factor in the determination of the Queensland-NSW border was the collection of customs duties at the border and establishment of border customs offices. Inter-colonial border duties were introduced in Australia in the 1850s, after the Murray River became the boundary between New South Wales and Victoria. Their introduction demonstrated that the Australian colonies were developing in divergent and independent ways. As each new colony was declared, it established its own Customs administration, which was responsible for the collection of lucrative custom duties and the prevention of smuggling. In mid-1862, the Queensland government assented to the provisions of the New South Wales Border Customs Act, introduced to provide for a mutual Queensland- New South Wales system of collecting customs duties payable on goods crossing their shared border. At first, the flow of goods into Queensland through the inland routes was not sufficient in either quantity or value to warrant the cost of collecting customs duty in remote areas. However, as settlement expanded, the Queensland government became concerned at the amount of revenue being lost in this way (estimated in 1870 at between and per annum, with approximately 340 pastoral stations, stores and public houses along the southern Queensland border being supplied primarily from New South Wales). Not only did more goods travel north than went south into New South Wales, but duty on such everyday commodities as tea and tobacco was twice as high in Queensland and a considerable amount of smuggling across the border took place. As the western regions of the colony developed and internal trade routes were established, custom facilities were required along the borders with New South Wales and South Australia. The Customs Duties Act 1870 provided Queensland with independent legislation to regulate the collection of duties on goods imported from other colonies. A small Customs Border Patrol consisting of a police inspector, sub-inspector and four constables was appointed with powers to collect duties from 1 January 1871. They travelled along the Queensland-New South Wales border, collecting duties and keeping careful records regarding the type and value of goods and the amount of monies collected. They also recommended 11 sites where Custom offices could be established. It was soon reported that the effect of increased vigilance on the border was to deflect the importation of goods to Brisbane, reducing the amount of such trade through inland centres. Finally in June 1879 the surveying of the remainder of the Queensland-NSW border along the 29th parallel of south latitude extending into the Channel Country was undertaken. Survey parties from both colonies met at Barringun, near the border, and William Jacomb Conder, superintendent of the trigonometrical survey NSW, undertook preliminary work to fix the latitude of the border town on the Warrego River using astronomical observations. Having determined the position for the border and the longitude of a point on it and the direction of the true meridian found, surveyors John Brewer Cameron from NSW and George Chale Watson (Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Warrego and Gregory South) representing Queensland, started to survey westerly on 15 September 1879 from a point on the east bank of the Warrego River where they had erected the Zero Obelisk. The two surveyors divided their work with Watson being responsible for chainage and Cameron for the astronomical work required to undertake this geodetic survey. After marking the first 5-mile chord and offsetting the mileposts from this chord to the arc the work continued in this manner. Very soon the surveyors struck floods. Cameron wrote \\"Had great difficulty in crossing creeks with the whole camp. The Irarah, Cuttaburra and Warrego being flooded... I had to construct two boats one of planks and the other of Canvas and frame: ... ferried eight tons ... in one afternoon including instruments\\". After crossing these swollen watercourses, they encountered the usual arid conditions of the south-west. In March 1880 after reaching the 100-mile post on the Paroo River, Surveyor Watson withdrew from the survey party, having written \\"As I believe Mr Cameron capable of working within great precision and he is evidently a painstaking officer over his professional duties, I have no reason to doubt but that the work would be precise enough for all the purposes of scientific accuracy as Mr Cameron, added to his other qualifications, has a supreme regard for his own reputation\\". According to Bill Kitson, Watson had other reasons for withdrawing - he resented having to continue his duties as land commissioner while working on the border survey as it meant he was unable to fully participate and made him \\"the laughing stock of the NSW contingent\\". This left Cameron to complete the task of surveying the 29 degree latitude of S over remote and desolate country. Cameron wrote that \\"At the 235-mile post we nearly lost all our horses in one night (32) owing to ... being unable to find the waterhole ... Having 100 gallons of water in camp I divided 50 gallons among the 32 horses with a little oatmeal which enabled them to travel to 'Warri Warri' Creek. I was obliged to give the horses a week's spell to recruit their strength\\". Cameron identified the corner between Queensland, NSW and South Australia with a timber post marked with the government arrow and LAT 29. The survey of from Barringun to the South Australian border had taken a total of 12 months and 15 days. After reaching the South Australian border and marking the corner, Cameron returned to Barringun to survey the easterly section of about to the Barwon River, completing the entire border survey in October 1881. Cameron reported that his line passed 68.5 links north of Gregory and Greave's steel pin in the Culgoa River and that its greatest distance from Gregory's 29th parallel was about three chains on the Macintyre River. He marked the end of the survey to the east with a one-ton post (Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post) on the west bank of the Barwon River. John Brewer Cameron was born in Scotland and migrated to Victoria with his family in 1853. After going to the Victorian goldfields and then New Zealand, he returned to Victoria and joined a government geodetic surveying party working in the Mount Baw Baw area. This experience led him to take up a career in surveying. He went to Fiji as a surveyor in 1869 returning to Victoria in 1872 where he specialised in surveying and geodesy. By 1879 he was a First Class Surveyor in the Trigonometrical Branch of the NSW Lands Department and a member of the Royal Geographical Society of New South Wales. He undertook the surveying of the Queensland-NSW border between 1879 and 1881. In 1883 he moved to New Guinea, acquired a plantation and later guided the Government Resident, Sir William MacGregor, on journeys of exploration. In 1896 Cameron became Government Surveyor of New Guinea. On 31 December 1897 he died suddenly from malaria while visiting Brisbane and was buried in Toowong cemetery. Afterwards, his former colleague in marking the NSW-Queensland border, George Watson, stated \\"and so passed away an energetic spirit worthy of classification as a man of genius. His boundary marks on the Queensland boundary will remain an imperishable monument of his skill as an astronomer.\\" Given the enormous difficulties Cameron faced in the task, his survey of the Queensland-NSW border was impressive. Current technology such as the Global Positioning System (or GPS) enables places to be pinpointed by longitude and latitude more accurately. It is now apparent that the intended corner between Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia at was not achieved. The corner surveyed by Cameron was actually . This is the location of the original corner post at Cameron Corner, which was replaced by the current concrete pillar, unveiled by the Ministers for Lands from NSW, Queensland and South Australia on 6 June 1969. The position of Cameron Corner as per Queensland's Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB), however, does not correlate with either the concrete pillar or the intended border corner. The DCDB places Cameron Corner to the east of the concrete pillar and north-west of its intended position of . The DCDB corner location that can be listed is that on Lot 1 AP21535. This variation in the intention and reality of the border corner shows the continued difficulties of surveying remote regions. This would be resolved by re-survey of Lot 1 on AP21535. The Queensland Boundaries Declaratory Act 1982 confirmed \\"that each land boundary of the State ... as ... defined in the Letters Patent ... by reference to a parallel of latitude or a meridian of longitude is and always has been the boundary ... permanently fixed by marking it upon on the surface of the earth before 1900...\\". The corner post as a survey mark is protected under the Survey and Mapping Infrastructure Act 2003 and the Survey and Mapping Infrastructure Regulation 2004 whereby a person must not interfere with a survey mark unless certain conditions are met. Today, Cameron Corner Survey Marker is a well-known tourist destination.  Description  Shed and information boards, 2007 Cameron Corner Survey Marker is at the southernmost of Queensland's three south-western corners and is the westernmost point of the Queensland-New South Wales border. It is located approximately south of Haddon Corner , south-east of Poeppel Corner and from the east coast in an arid environment comprising ochre coloured dirt and sand with some native vegetation. The confluence of 141 degrees E and 29 degrees S (with no official marking) is located approximately to the south-east. Nearby are: * Cameron Corner StoreCloser view of signage and the survey post, circa 2007 * a shelter shed with information boards on the NSW side of the border * a road and road signs on the Queensland side of the border.  Heritage listing  Cameron Corner Survey Marker was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cameron Corner Survey Marker (1880), marking the westernmost extension of the first official survey of the Queensland-New South Wales border, is important in demonstrating the priority placed on clear border demarcation by the governments of Queensland and New South Wales. Set borders were an important part of colonial economic and administrative development, providing certainty for governments and pastoralists, and enabling the collection of customs duties. Cameron Corner is the result of early cooperation between Australian colonies and provides lasting evidence of the feat of endurance necessary to complete the Queensland-New South Wales border survey. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. Cameron Corner represents the culmination of a difficult feat of geodetic surveying and results from an early application of this branch of surveying in Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cameron Corner is important to the Australian community as a geographical and cultural landmark, and is a well- known tourist attraction. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Cameron Corner has an important association with the life and career of John Brewer Cameron (1843‚Äì97) as a commemoration of one of his most notable accomplishments.

The Khouw family of Tamboen (Bahasa Indonesia: 'Keluarga Khouw van Tamboen; Dutch: 'familie Khouw van Tamboen') was a bureaucratic and landowning dynasty, part of the Cabang Atas or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. Many members of the family held the rank of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen in the colonial government, which gave them significant political and judicial jurisdiction over the colony's Chinese subjects. As among the colony's largest landlords (Dutch: landheeren; Bahasa Indonesia: tuan tanah), the family also played an important role in the urban, agricultural and economic development of the greater Jakarta area. Portrait of Majoor Khouw Kim An's grandsons, Yan and Coen (by Charles Sayers, circa 1937). The family traces its lineage back to Khouw Tjoen, a successful merchant who had migrated around 1769 from Fujian in China to Tegal on Java's north coast, thence to Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies. On his death, he was succeeded by his son, Khouw Tian Sek (died in 1843), who later became the first member of the family to be raised to the honorary, but not substantive, rank of der Chinezen. In his Twentieth Century Impressions, the British journalist Arnold Wright attributes the family's rise to great wealth to Khouw Tian Sek, whose landholdings in then semi-rural Molenvliet suddenly became prime urban property as the colonial capital expanded southwards in the early nineteenth century. The family owned three extravagant Chinese compounds in Molenvliet, of which the only surviving one, Candra Naya, is now a major historic landmark in Jakarta. Khouw also began the family's century-long association with the estate (particuliere land) of Tamboen, the most important of the many estates the family acquired around Batavia. The family is also remembered today for their Art Deco country house, landhuis Tamboen (now :id:Gedung Juang Tambun). Khouw's three sons, Khouw Tjeng Tjoan, Khouw Tjeng Kee and Khouw Tjeng Po, were ‚àí like their father ‚àí also elevated to the honorary rank of der Chinezen. By the late nineteenth century, the family's accumulation of dynastic land and wealth were among the largest and most significant in Batavia, if not the whole colony. The three brothers had many wives and children. A number of their children were pre-eminent community leaders in the late colonial era, including: Khouw Yauw Kie (died 1908), the family's first Kapitein der Chinezen and first representative on the Chinese Council; his cousin, Khouw Kim An, the last Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia (1875 - 1945); his brother, Khouw Kim Tjiang, Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg (now Bogor); and their cousin, the philanthropist O. G. Khouw (1874 - 1927).

It was first published in 1957, as a follow-up to her first memoir, Life Among the Savages. The book was reissued in 2015 by Penguin. Background As was the case of Life Among the Savages, Raising Demons is composed primarily of short stories Jackson had previously published in women's magazines. Plot The book picks up shortly after where Life Among the Savages left off. With four children, numerous pets, thousands of books, and countless personal possessions, the narrator realizes with alarm that they have filled up the large house from the previous book and insists they must find a bigger house (to which her husband responds \\"there is no bigger house\\"). The family at last purchases an enormous old farmhouse on the edge of town, only to learn that it is still occupied by four different families who show no hurry to move out, all while suffering the indignity of a moving company that appears to have stolen all their furniture. The family spends the summer at a home in a resort town while they wait for the house to be vacated. The four children, now older, have developed their own distinctly different personalities: Laurie, the natural leader; Jannie, the romantic conformist; Sally, the stubborn, self-defined imp; and good-natured baby Barry, who seems to regard the rest of his family with wry amusement. With the often indifferent assistance of her husband, the narrator struggles to maintain order and discipline through a series of domestic adventures, even through the heartbreak of realizing her children are growing up. Reception While Raising Demons was criticized as less humorous than its predecessor, with some reviewers noting a \\"tart and tangy\\" tone compared to the lighter Life Among The Savages, overall it received and continues to receive positive reviews from critics. Ruth Franklin, writing for the New York Times, stated that Jackson \\"had a genuine gift for this mode of writing,\\" concluding that \\"Jackson‚Äôs relaxed approach to child-rearing feels refreshingly sane.\\" A Kirkus review commented that the book is \\"a very pleasant form of pandemonium and hugely entertaining.\\" References American memoirs Books by Shirley Jackson ","title":"Raising Demons"},{"id":"52443735","text":"Salim Osman is a Bangladesh Jatiya Party politician and the member of parliament from Narayanganj, the constituency of his deceased elder brother.

With a few interruptions it was published in paper form until 1994, and in digital form until 2009, making it one of the oldest newspapers in Europe. It has been called the most important newspaper in Barcelona's history, or the first real chronicle of Barcelona.  History  Permission to publish a journal was granted to Pedro Husson de Lapazaran, a Neapolitan printer. It was written in Spanish and acted as an official journal, publishing official notices. Around the turn of the 18th century readers began to demand content in Catalan and during the period of Napoleonic rule it was temporarily published with parallel French and Catalan text. After the War of Independence, on 6 June 1814, the right to publish passed to Antoni Brusi i Mirabent, and subsequently to his descendants, as a result of which it was popularly called √âl Brusi. The journal's politics were monarchist and liberal-conservative; this policy meant that it survived in the short term, but began to be less influential following a reduction in press censorship. Apart from a few Catalan poems, the language was mostly Castilian, like most of the Catalan press of the time. However because most readers used Catalan the paper had to provide explanations of some terms. Many Catalan writers (for example Joan Maragall) wrote in Castilian. A reduction in the level of censorship, other newspapers such as La Vanguardia (1881) and La Veu de Catalunya (1899)) challenged the pre-eminence of the Diario de Barcelona. During the Civil War the paper was seized and transformed into the organ of the Estat Catal√†, produced in Catalan by Marcel¬∑l√≠ Perell√≥ i Domingo. After the war it reverted to its previous owners. From 21 October it re-emerged as a worker-run bilingual edition. The paper, ceased publication in 1984, was acquired by the city of Barcelona the following year and transferred to the Grupo Zeta. From 1986 it was published entirely in Catalan.

While with the Gunners he would win the Eastern Conference MVP award in both 2006 and 2007. At the age of 24, Petrie signed his first professional contract when he joined Sydney based NBL club the West Sydney Razorbacks for the 2007‚Äì08 NBL season. During his rookie season, Petrie averaged 9.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 0.9 assists per game in 28 games. After just one season with the Razorbacks, Petrie joined the Wollongong Hawks in 2008‚Äì09, playing 27 games and improving his numbers to 12.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game. In 2009‚Äì10, Petrie had joined his 3rd NBL club, the Gold Coast Blaze.

Following the Blaze folding due to financial difficulties at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 NBL season, Petrie, along with teammates Adam Gibson and Jason Cadee, joined the Adelaide 36ers. After enduring a poor 2012‚Äì13 NBL season under Marty Clarke in which the 36ers finished in last place with an 8‚Äì20 record, Clarke was sacked and Joey Wright joined as head coach. Wright's impact with the 36ers was immediate and the team finished the regular season in second place with an 18-10 record.

Description and history The Saltus Grocery Store is located in Burlington's Old North End neighborhood, at the northern corner of North Winooski Avenue and Archibald Street. It is a two-story wood frame building, triangular in shape, with a flat roof and clapboarded exterior. The storefront entrance is set on a short facade facing Archibald Street, flanked on the left side of that facade by a display window, and also by a display window on the right side facade facing North Winooski. A polygonal bay projects on the second floor of this short facade. A residential unit entrance is located on the North Winooski facade, which extends to include a single-story ell. The upstairs has always historically had an apartment, and a second has been carved out of previously commercial space in the rear of the ground floor. with The store was built in 1897, during a period in which the Old North End was undergoing significant growth, including large numbers of immigrants drawn to the area's industries for jobs. It is fairly typical of small neighborhood groceries built in that time, but it is one of a small number that survive. The grocery was first operated by Frank Saltus. The rear space, now residential, housed such businesses as a barber, jeweler, and confectioner, during that area's commercial use, which ended about 1960.

Her father did not want them to marry, believing that because they were both deaf, they would be poor, but they moved to Southampton where Pearce was to remain in employment, serving the deaf community for the rest of his life. Eastern Road Brighton: location of the institution where Pearce was placed for 12 years from the age of five They had no children. It is not known whether Pearce's childlessness had any connection with recommendations of castration of the congenitally deaf by early 19th century eugenicists who held those views which were later developed by Francis Galton. In 1901 he and his wife were living at 2 Christ Church Road, Winchester, with two servants.United Kingdom Census 1901: RG13/1082 St Faith Within, Christ Church, Winchester, St Thomas The 1911 Census finds them living at Christ Church Lodge, Winchester, where he describes himself as \\"chaplain to the deaf and dumb in the Diocese of Winchester.\\" It is not known why the same record, completed in R.A.

Work Signature of Rev. R.A. Pearce, from 1911 Census He left the Institution in 1872 to work in his father's office as a secretary, but in his free time he sought out other deaf people, assisted and educated them, and organised groups for Sunday worship. His group grew in size, so that his time was needed for more mission work with the deaf in Hampshire. By 1881 he was still living with his parents and siblings, describing himself as \\"lay reader to deaf and dumb,\\"United Kingdom Census 1881: RG11/1221/98 p23, Norham Lodge, 16 Winchester Road, Millbrook Parish, Shirley, South Stoneham, St James, Hampshire He was ordained deacon on Sunday 21 May 1885 by the Bishop of Winchester, after being mentored via sign language by Reverend Charles Mansfield Owen who was at that time vicar of St George's Church, Edgbaston and was later to become Dean of Ripon. Thus Pearce became, ‚Äúthe first deaf ... clergyman to be ordained in the Church of England.‚Äù In the same year he became Chaplain to the Deaf and Dumb, employed by the Winchester Diocesan Mission to the Deaf and Dumb, which itself had been established by the efforts of Owen. This organisation founded the Mission Church in Oak Road, Southampton (now demolished), for the continuation of their work in 1891. It was completed in 1895 with the financial assistance of Sir Arthur Henderson Fairbairn (1852‚Äì1915) who was deaf, and other supporters. The Portsmouth Evening News said this: > \\"It is gratifying to recall the fact that the Winchester diocese is the > first, and, probably the only one, to devote special attention to the deaf > and dumb. For many years the Rev. F. Pearce (sic), himself afflicted in this > way, has laboured among them with rare devotion and success, and now, thanks > to the munificence of Sir A. Fairbairn, Bart., of Brambridge House, a church > for the deaf and dumb has been opened at Northam, the dedication sermon of > the Bishop being interpreted to the congregation by the finger and sign > language by Canon Owen.\\" Because he was the first deaf person to be ordained as an Anglican clergyman, Pearce was invited to meet Queen Victoria who \\"knew deaf people on the Isle of Wight\\":Sign Station: Historical aspects, Reverend Richard Aslatt Pearce > \\"Her Majesty the Queen, who, as is so well known, is always interested in > the deaf and dumb, having heard much of the good work done by both Mr. > Pearce and Mr. Owen, expressed her wish to see both gentlemen, and > accordingly they had the honour of being presented to the Queen and Her > Royal Highness the Princess Beatrice, at Osborne House, on the 16th of > January 1886. After meeting Pearce, the Queen requested a Royal Commission on the Blind, the Deaf and Dumb and Others of the United Kingdom, which completed its report in 1889. It included the comment: \\"The missionary under the bishop of the diocese [of Winchester] (the Rev. R.A. Pearce, who is the only ordained deaf and dumb clergyman in the Church of England) devotes the whole of his time to the work, visiting the deaf and dumb at their homes, or at places of business and workshops.\\" In 1886 Pearce also visited the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb at Derby.Irish Ecclesiastical Gazette 1886Listens: A Deaf And Dumb Clergyman In November 1887, Pearce preached a sermon at St Saviour's in London. \\"It was a grand service, and was most highly appreciated.\\" On 20 November 1887, he took a communion service and preached a sermon for deaf and hearing people at Holy Trinity, Golden Common, near Winchester, Hampshire. \\"The deepest attention was paid by the congregations throughout the whole of the services, who perfectly understood them, and expressed hope that the sermon would be long remembered. The parishioners of Golden Common were evidently deeply impressed by the reverential manner and silent eloquence of the preacher.\\" On 26 April 1888 he became Reverend of Christ Church Lodge at Winchester.Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1908, Oxford In Brighton in 1912, Pearce served as interpreter at the funeral of William Sleight, who had provided his school education. He retired in 1924, having served in the diocese for 43 years.The Frat, Nov. 1945, p. 3 Historical context To put Pearce into the context of his time, although he was the first deaf Anglican preacher whose service was formally ratified by ordination and benefice, he was not the first or only person to preach to the deaf by sign language in England. For example, in 1846, before Pearce was born, the Leeds Intelligencer cites two instances which drew praise in Yorkshire: > \\"There has been for some time past a chapel in Red-Lion Square [in Leeds], > in which public worship is performed twice every Sunday for the sole benefit > of the deaf ... The service is that of the Church of England ‚Äì singing and > the music of the organ being as a matter of course omitted.

Cabral's mother died in childbirth when her ninth child was born and the eight remaining children were raised by her father, who was mayor of Port of Spain, Trinidad in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The family travelled often by plane and Cabral became interested in flying. When in 1939 the Light Aeroplane Club was founded in Trinidad, she and her father joined as life members. Career Cabral chose to work in the insurance business and became a career woman. When the war ended and the flying club resumed its training facilities, she immediately began to study for a pilot's license. Most of the trainers were veterans of the Royal Air Force and Cabral studied with former RAF pilot Neville Pereira. She passed her three hour solo flight on her first try. When she received her license in 1948, she became the first woman pilot of Trinidad and Tobago. Soon after, on New Year's Day in 1949, she married Frank de Freitas, who subsequently became a pilot. The couple had two children, Francis and Isabella. For a while, de Freitas did exhibition and competition shows in an Auster Aircraft, with which she had trained.

His writings portray the more difficult aspects of autism. Additionally, most of his poems focus on social difficulties that he experiences. He is unemployed, but writes about how he wants to work and find love. Miedzianik writes about specific examples pertaining to those desires. Miedzianik's works have been extensively analyzed by noted autism researchers, who describe his writing as thoughtful, sophisticated, and displaying an unusually strong awareness of his social difficulties.  History  David Christopher\\"Christopher is My Middle Name\\". David Miedzianik, 2 March 2004. Retrieved 19 December 2018. Miedzianik was born on 24 July 1956 to a Russian father and English mother. He writes about his paternal grandfather having known Grigori Rasputin. His parents separated when Miedzianik was three years old - his father relocated to London and lived there for the next ten years until his death in 1969 due to a diabetic coma. In 1970, he was diagnosed with autism after being admitted to Middlewood Hospital, but did not start attending special education classes until two years later. In the late 1970s, he began writing for Jigsaw, the official magazine of Middlewood Hospital. This, he states, influenced him to write poetry, as did his wanting to become a musician when he was a teenager. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Miedzianik often attended concerts by local Sheffield groups and befriended several members of those groups. In 1985, he wrote his autobiography, My Autobiography, which was published in December 1986 through the University of Nottingham. Professor Elizabeth Newson in the foreword claimed that his autobiography was the second autism autobiography of all time to be published, with Emergence: Labeled Autistic by Temple Grandin being the first one. Because he cannot hold down a career, he has stated in his autobiography that \\"Living is more or less a constant bore\\". A long-form poem, I Hope Some Lass Will Want Me After Reading All This, followed in 1987. He also started publishing his poems in several autism newsletters in the UK and US. In 1990, an excerpt of his long-form poem was published in an issue of The Advocate, the Autism Society of America's newsletter. By the early 1990s, he had gotten local media attention for his writings, leading to an interview on Against All Odds, a local Sheffield TV programme, and an US release of his autobiography, including the long-form poem as an appendix. He would release two poetry anthologies, Taking the Load off My Mind (1993) and Now All I've Got Left is Myself (1997). 1997 also saw him contributing to Sarah Croskin's paper Autism: a life history approach. He continued publishing poetry to the Internet until roughly 2004.  Analysis  Miedzianik's works have been extensively analyzed by noted autism researchers, who describe his writing as thoughtful, sophisticated, and displaying an unusually strong awareness of his social difficulties. Miedzianik has been described as roaming from subject to subject, but usually introduces material to the reader with a proper explanation. Other topics he writes about besides his loneliness and datelessness are his unusual behavior. Francesca Happ√© has described Miedzianik‚Äôs writing as the \\"least autistic\\" from the authors that he was compared to including Temple Grandin, as he demonstrated the greatest awareness of his limitations and how others perceived him. Peter Hobson has described him as one of the most thoughtful and linguistically gifted autistic writers. Hobson has described Miedzianik‚Äôs writings about his solitude as repetitive and disjointed, and also notes his awareness of his own solitude. Uta Frith has described him as articulate and literate, and notes his use of highly sophisticated language. Professor Newson of the University of Nottingham noted that despite his difficulty with holding down a job, he manages to be involved in a wide variety of activities. Newson also claimed that his writing ability was so strong, only minor edits were needed for My Autobiography. He was noted for portraying autism through an autistic person's perspective. In his poem \\"The Mega-Chip Men\\" from 1997, he mocks the idea that autistics cannot think for themselves, comparing them to computers that can think independently. He also implies that they can work relentlessly. In another poem \\"Miracles Don't Happen\\", he talks about how he claims that his own country won't accept him. Miedzianik has been described as having a negative self-image and reduced self-esteem, based on his upbringing. He claimed that his friend Nigel was more well-adjusted than him, and he went to a special hospital school for a while and was given several medications. The novelist Lawrence Osborne in his book American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome compared Miedzianik to the autistic author Jonathan Mitchell in the respect that his writings portray the more difficult aspects of autism.  Works dedicated to Miedzianik  The British songwriter Ray Hearne once wrote a song about Miedzianik‚Äôs life in 1989, titled \\"Song for David\\". Additionally, the British metal band Solitary wrote a song named \\"Twisted\\" in 1998, which was released on their album Nothing Changes and dedicated to Miedzianik. The band stated \\"'Twisted' was written for and inspired by David Miedzianik by his and others continued fight against autism.\\" Jez Lowe and The Bad Pennies wrote a song about his experiences titled \\"A Lass to Want Me\\". \\"Song for David\\" and \\"A Lass to Want Me\\" were both featured on A Season of Changes: The Autistic Awareness Album, a music album about autistic experiences released in 1997 to fundraise for autism services in Doncaster. Autobiography  My Autobiography is the debut and only prose novel by David Miedzianik. Published in December 1986 by the University of Nottingham, the book chronicles Miedzianik's life from birth until 1985, when the book was written. According to Professor Elizabeth Newson, who wrote the foreword, Miedzianik's writing ability was so strong that only minor edits were required before publication. She also attributed the novel's genesis to a study on autistic people conducted in 1978 by the University, for which Miedzianik's mother was interviewed, and a follow-up in which Miedzianik himself was interviewed.Elizabeth Newson, My Autobiography (foreword), pp. i-iii, December 1986. Retrieved 22 May 2019. Peter Hobson has described his writing style in this novel as thoughtful and linguistically gifted. He has described Miedzianik's writings about his solitude as repetitive and disjointed, and also notes his awareness of solitude.

A commission in 2001 for his first large-scale orchestral work, In Camera, was premiered at the Barbican by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin; Lumina, for the Last Night of the Proms 2003, was televised from the Royal Albert Hall; and more recently Partita was a joint BBC/Serge Koussevitzky Foundation Award commission. From 1997 to 2001 he studied at Cornell University towards a doctorate of Musical Arts with Steven Stucky, a teacher and later friend who became a major influence on his music.A.

He was one of the leading Liberal rabbis in Germany. Together with Leo Baeck, he headed the Rabbinical Association of Germany, in which liberal and orthodox rabbis were organized. In 1935, he ordained Regina Jonas, the first female rabbi in Jewish history. Life Max Dienemann was born in September 1875 in Krotoszyn in the Prussian province of Posen. Dienemann first attended a Jewish folk school and a high school. He then studied Oriental philology in Breslau and graduated in 1898. In the following decades, Dienemann's works were published in Jewish newspapers, as he published sermons and Liberal interpretations of the Torah. His lectures, held throughout Germany, testified to his more traditional attitude towards Judaism. He warned against nationalism and racism and pleaded for Zionism. From 1903 to 1919 he was a rabbi in Racib√≥rz in Upper Silesia. In 1919, he was appointed rabbi by the Israelite community in Offenbach am Main and acted until 1938. Dienemann promoted the unity and independence of the Jews in Germany, but at the same time he also understood himself as a \\"German patriot\\". In 1935, Dienemann ordained Regina Jonas, the first female rabbi in the history of Judaism. During the National Socialist era, Dienemann was interned twice in concentration camps. First interred in a camp in Osthofen in 1933, he was later imprisoned in Buchenwald in 1938. Together with his family, he was forced to emigrate after Kristallnacht. In March 1939, the Dienemann family moved to Palestine. Dienemann died less than a month later in Tel-Aviv. Today, Dienemann is remembered by a path commemorated to him in Offenbach am Main's B√ºsing-Park. His path intersects one dedicated to Regina Jonas. An organization stationed in Offenbach called the Max Dienemann / Salomon Formstecher Society draws their name from Dienemann and his predecessor Salomon Formstecher.

In July 2006, aged 27, she became the first female Danish fighter pilot, flying an F-16 jet fighter. Biography Bonde was brought up in Billund, Jylland, in a traditional Danish family where her father was the main salary earner while her mother worked half-time and took care of the home and her two daughters. While at school, she was a powerful swimmer, later becoming one of the best in Denmark. But swimming was not enough for her. Once she took part in a trial flight in a Danish Air Force Hercules, she knew she was destined to become a pilot. She failed her first test, not because of the physical or theoretical aspects but simply because the examining psychologist thought she knew too little about flying. She returned a year later, completing basic training in flying in 2002. She then spent two years at officers school followed by 16 months in the United States where she earned her wings after completing a course at the Sheppard Air Force Base under the EURO-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training programme.

He pioneered the operation of wound excision, which is a procedure to systematically remove all devitalised and contaminated tissue, leaving only healthy bleeding tissue behind.Gray, H.M.W., The treatment of gunshot wounds by excision and primary suture. Journal Royal Army Medical Corps June 1915.Gray, H.M.W., Treatment of Gunshot wounds by excision and primary suture. British Medical Journal 1915; 2: p. 317. Wound excision saved limbs and lives by reducing the incidence of major wound infections, including gas gangrene. Gray was also an expert in the management of compound fractures of the femur, which carried a mortality of 80% in 1914-15.Watson, F., The Life of Sir Robert Jones. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1934, p.158. Early life Henry McIlltree Williamson Gray was born in Aberdeen on 14 March 1870. He was the fifth child of Alexander Reith Gray and Barbara Shand Anderson. He attended Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh and studied Medicine at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with honours in 1895.Scotland, TR., Boyer, A., Henry Gray: Surgeon of the Great War. Edinburgh: Capercaillie Books, 2015. After serving as house surgeon to Sir Alexander Ogston, Professor of Surgery at the University of Aberdeen, he studied in Germany for eighteen months where he learned the techniques of aseptic surgery, which he introduced to Aberdeen when he became a consultant surgeon there in 1904.Obituary, Sir Henry Gray, K.B.E., F.R.C.S., LL.D. The Lancet, October 15, 1938, p. 920. In the intervening years leading up to the war, he established himself as a surgeon of outstanding ability who set himself very high standards and expected others in his team to follow suit. To be trained by Gray gave young surgeons a confidence that boded well for future success.Smith, F.K., Sir Henry Gray, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., The Aberdeen University Review, 1939, Vol XXVI pp. 47-49. A well as credited with bringing aseptic surgery to Aberdeen, he was instrumental in introducing local anaesthesia to surgery in Britain.Porter, R.M.M., Recent Aberdeen Medical Teachers: Sir Henry Gray, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., LL.D, F.R.C.S.(Ed). Aberdeen Postgraduate Medical Bulletin, Oct. 1971, pp. 11-13.  World War I  During the First World War, Gray served in France for three and a half years, at first in charge of a group of base hospitals in Rouen, then from 1917 as Consulting Surgeon to the British Third Army. He was mentioned in dispatches five times and was awarded a knighthood for services to war surgery.University of Aberdeen, Roll of Service in the Great War 1914-1919. Edited by M.D. Allardyce, Aberdeen University Press. 1921. Gray attributed the high percentage mortality of fractures of the femur during the first two years of the war to inadequate splintage of fractures, which resulted in excessive blood loss during the transfer of the wounded from ‚ÄúNo Man\`s Land‚Äù to casualty clearing stations. Most arrived in a state of circulatory collapse unable to withstand surgery. During the Battle of Arras in April‚ÄìMay 1917, Gray used Thomas Splints exclusively, which immobilised fractures much more effectively. Patients reached casualty clearing stations in good clinical condition and fit to undergo limb and life saving surgery. He reported on the outcome of 1,009 fractures of the femur. Only 5% of patients reached casualty clearing stations in clinical shock due to blood loss and unfit for surgery. The mortality in his series was 15.9%.Gray, H.M.W., The Early Treatment of War Wounds. London: Henry Frowde and Hodder & Stoughton, 1919, p. 59. Gray published work on penetrating wounds of the knee joint.Gray, H.M.W., Treatment of Gunshot wounds of the knee Joint.

He was an authority on infected gunshot wounds.Gray, H.M.W., General Treatment of Infected Gunshot Wounds. British Medical Journal 1915; 2: pp.41-43. He was experienced in the management of gunshot wounds of the head and spinal cord.Gray, H.M.W., Gunshot Wounds of the Head. British Medical Journal 1916; 1: pp. 261-265.Gray, H.M.W., Early Treatment of Gunshot Injuries of the Spinal Cord. British Medical Journal 1917; 2: pp. 44-45. He published work on gas gangrene. If all devitalised tissue was removed, and there was no dead tissue left behind, the patient would not develop gas gangrene. If the patient already had gangrene, then he could only be saved by excision of all dead tissue, although even then he might die from multiple organ failure caused by release of powerful toxins.Gray, H.M.W., An essential principle in the treatment of gas gangrene. British Medical Journal 1918; 1: p. 369. Gray even removed a bullet from the heart of a patient under local anaesthetic.Birkbeck, L.H.C., Lorimer, G.N., Gray, H.M.W., Removal of a Bullet from the Right Ventricle of the Heart under Local Anaesthesia. British Medical Journal 1915; 2: pp. 561-562. His work received widespread acclaim from Australian and New Zealand medical officers, and he received special mention in their respective official medical histories.Butler, A.G., Official History of the Australian Army Medical Services, 1914‚Äì1918 Volume II ‚Äì The Western Front. Canberra: Australian War Memorial, 1940, p. 328.Carberry, A.D., The New Zealand medical Services in the Great War. Auckland: Whitcombe and Tombs Ltd, 1924, p. 399. He was admired by many young surgeons working in casualty clearing stations because he was extremely supportive of them.Colonel H.M.W. Gray, British Medical Journal, 19 April 1919; p. 503. They in return held a special dinner in London to acknowledge his achievements during the war.  After the First World War  Gray returned to Aberdeen but never settled. He was offered, and accepted, the position of Surgeon-in-Chief to the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Montreal, but when he went to Canada he became involved in bitter political infighting between Sir Arthur Currie, Principal and Vice-chancellor of McGill University and Sir Henry Vincent Meredith, President of the RVH, over the issue of whether Gray should be offered the Chair of Surgery at McGill University.Hanaway, J., R. Cruess, J. Darragh, McGill Medicine Volume 2, 1885-1936. Montreal: McGill-Queen\`s University Press, 2006, pp.112-117. Rather than furthering his surgical prospects, the move to Montreal destroyed him professionally. He lived out the rest of his life in surgical obscurity. He died in Montreal in 1938.

They were all ascetic wanderers and preachers who healed with herbs. The third led a peasant revolt in 1912. Their followers think they were the same person in different incarnations, a saint. The Monge State Park maintains a cave where the first monk once lived, visited by thousands of pilgrims annually. Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini in 1861 The first Jo√£o Maria was born in Piemont, Italy. As a young man he entered the seminary in Rome, but left before being ordained priest. He wandered in Europe, then came to South America where he travelled in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and finally Brazil. There are records from 1844 of Jo√£o Maria going from Par√° to Rio de Janeiro, where he became famous as a healer and counselor. He moved to Sorocaba and continued to practice medicine and give advice. Jo√£o Maria left the city of S√£o Paulo and disappeared for a while before showing up in Rio Grande do Sul. Thousands of people came to him at Cerro Campestre, in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, drawn by word of the miraculous power of his waters. The authorities of Rio Grande do Sul analyzed the water and found it was potable but no different from any other water. He then continued through Santa Catarina and Paran√°, where he lived in a cave near Lapa in 1847. There he performed marriages, baptisms, healings and gave blessings to the local people. Jo√£o Maria was not a revolutionary, but tried to improve the condition of the peasants. He organized processions, built chapels, blessed cattle and baptized children. He cared for the sick, and his herbal teas became famous. In 1848 Jo√£o Maria was deported to Santa Catarina, then to Rio de Janeiro, where he was lost from sight for a while. He reappeared in Buenos Aires in 1853 and walked through Bolivia and all of south and central America until 1861, arriving in New Mexico in the United States in 1862, where he lived in the mountains. He was assassinated there on 17 April 1869 at the age of 69. His tomb may be seen in New Mexico. Jo√£o Maria de Jesus Jo√£o Maria de Jesus in 1898 In 1890 Jo√£o Maria de Jesus began to travel in southern Brazil. His appearance, with a long white beard, and way of life were similar to Agostini. Jo√£o Maria de Jesus was famous as a healer, and his medicine was thought to be miraculous. It was said he could cure a person simply by praying for their health and prescribing a tea from a common herb called \\"monk's broom\\". He was quoted as saying, \\"He who does not know how to read the book of nature is illiterate in God's eyes.\\" His devotees thought that all objects or places that he touched became sacred, and would provide the hermit's blessings after he had disappeared. During the Federalist Revolution of 1893‚Äì95 he attended wounded rebels. His teachings were prophetic and apocalyptic. He said God would punish mankind with plagues of insects and bloody wars. He thought the First Brazilian Republic of 1889 was the work of the devil, and defended restoration of the monarchy as the \\"order of God\\". He may have died in 1908 in hospital in Ponta Grossa, Paran√°, or may be buried in Lagoa Vermelha, Rio Grande do Sul, but his devotees think he is still living in the Morro Tai√≥, a hill in Santa Catarina. Jos√© Maria de Santo Agostinho Jos√© Maria de Santo Agostinho Jos√© Maria de Santo Agostinho was formerly the soldier Miguel Lucena de Boaventura. He settled in Taquara√ßu, Santa Catarina, where he gained a reputation for healing powers. He established a \\"people's pharmacy\\" where he would provide herbs, seeds and roots as well as prayers. Jos√© Maria claimed to be the first Jo√£o Maria's brother. He was the religious leader of the rebels during the \\"Contestado War\\" of 1912‚Äì16, in which small farmers and settlers in Paran√° and Santa Catarina who had been expelled from their lands fought against the large capitalist landowners and companies. He organized the dispossessed peasants and sharecroppers from his base at the Fazenda do Irani. The state government's security regiment marched to Taquaru√ßu to disperse his followers. In a clash on 22 October 1912 the troops were defeated, but Jos√© Maria, who was leading the rebels, was killed. In their religious excitement the rebels sanctified Jos√© Maria and began to call him S√£o Jo√£o Maria, thinking he would return in a few months with an enchanted army commanded by Saint Sebastian. Legacy The people of the region began to conflate Jos√© Maria and the Jo√£o Marias, uniting them as one person. A socio-religious movement led by Andr√© Ferreira Fran√ßa began in Soledade, Rio Grande do Sul, in 1935. The group was persecuted and Andr√© Fran√ßa decided to withdraw, but was shot in a clash with the city's military brigade. There is a large literature about the monks called Jo√£o Maria, but the devout population have little interest in their historicity and are much more concerned with the sacred characteristics attributed to them. There are people today who think that Jo√£o Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles. There are many places in the center and east of Paran√° and Santa Catarina, the south of S√£o Paulo and the north of Rio Grande do Sul, where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the \\"Jo√£o Marias\\" would have passed. The various wanderers recognized as the monk or prophet Jo√£o Maria all have strong similarities. They are pilgrims, without home or family. They have withdrawn from the pleasures of the world to do penance by serving God. They preach the Apocalypse, when God will punish all sinners. They have the miraculous power of healing, and they are immortal. The Monge State Park was created in Lapa in 1960. The main attraction is the monk's cave, a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful. It includes a source of water that it considered to be miraculous. In 2015 Paran√° Turismo was considering definition of a tourist circuit to visit the olhos d'√°gua in places where the monk was present. As of December 2015 the secretariat of tourism had identified 38 municipalities where the monk was present.

Recipient of the Lenin Prize (1961) and the State Prize of the Russian Federation (1997). Early years Valentin Yezhov was born in Samara, Russian SFSR into a simple Russian family. His father Ivan Vasilievich Yezhov came from the Belye Kolodezi village (now Ozyorsky District, Moscow Oblast). As a Red Army soldier he took part in battles against the Czechoslovak Legion and was heavily wounded in action. While in a hospital he met Anna Ivanovna Maskalina, a senior nurse who later became his wife. Valentin was a premature child born after seven months of pregnancy. He was named after the character of the Faust opera that made a lasting impression on his parents.Vitaly Dobrusin. Samara Fates. Valentin Yezhov documentary, 2009 (in Russian) In six years the family moved to the town of Ozyory and then ‚Äî to Moscow. In 1938 Yezhov graduated from school and joined the army. Shortly before the Great Patriotic War he enrolled into the School for Junior Airmen (known simply as ShMAS), then fought at the Russian Far East as part of the naval aviation forces. He demobilized in 1945 and returned to Moscow where he entered VGIK to study screenwriting under Joseph Manevich. Alexander Dovzhenko took his place later on; it was Dovzhenko's only screenwriting course.Interview with Valentin Yezhov: How the Cinema is Written... from the Persona magazine ‚Ññ 9, 2003 (in Russian) Career Yezhov started working in cinema in 1953 and quickly turned into one of the most prolific screenwriters of the Soviet Union. He wrote and co-wrote over 50 screenplays, both for short and feature films. He worked in almost every genre, including documentaries. 1959 saw the release of the war drama Ballad of a Soldier directed by Grigori Chukhrai. The screenplay was co-written by Chukhrai and Yezhov, both war veterans. The film gained a lot of praise and gathered a handful of international awards, including the Special jury prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival,\\"Festival de Cannes: Ballad of a Soldier\\" at the official Cannes Film Festival website the 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film and the 1961 Bodil Award for Best Non-American Film. It was also nominated for the 1961 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Both Yezhov and Chukrai were awarded a Lenin Prize for their work. The following years Yezhov worked with such acclaimed directors as Georgiy Daneliya, Larisa Shepitko and Andrei Konchalovsky. Along with Rustam Ibragimbekov he co-wrote a screenplay that was later made into a 1970 Red Western movie White Sun of the Desert by Vladimir Motyl. It turned into one of the box office leaders with 34.5 million viewers and quickly gained a cult status despite lacking any awards or attention from critics. It became a good tradition for Russian cosmonauts to watch the film before the space flights.American space 'nerd' blasts off by BBC, April 7, 2007 In 1998 it was awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation by Boris Yeltsin as a culturally significant piece of art.Vladimir Motyl: Cinema Needs a Government Policy interview by Kommersant ‚Ññ104 (1507), June 11, 1998 (in Russian) In 1978 an epic historical drama Siberiade was produced by Andrei Konchalovsky based on the screenplay written by him and Yezhov. The movie was shown at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival where it received a lot of praise and eventually won the Grand Prix award.\\"Festival de Cannes: Siberiade\\" at the official Cannes Film Festival website It became Konchalovsky's most recognizable work ever since and opened him gates to Hollywood where he fled in just a year after the ceremony. In addition to his screenwriting career, Yezhov also wrote several theatrical plays (Nightingale Night, Alyosha, Gunfire Beyond the Dunes), worked as a professor and educator at VGIK. Among his students where Valentin Chernykh who produced the screenplay for the Oscar-winning movie Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears and Sergei Bodrov. Member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union since 1951. In later years Yezhov worked with Sergei Bondarchuk on the Red Bells dilogy, Ion Popescu-Gopo on the sequel to his Maria, Mirabela fairy tale and other Soviet and foreign film directors. He produced a total of six films together with a film director Viktor Sadovsky, including the 1991 biographical drama My Best Friend, General Vasili, Son of Joseph Stalin about the acclaimed Soviet sportsman Vsevolod Bobrov and his friendship with Vasily Stalin. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union he turned to screenwriting only once, in the 2000 short film Dr. Andersen that went unnoticed.

History  Al-Adiliyah Mosque in Aleppo was commissioned in the 16th century by Dukaginzade Mehmed Pasha, son of Dukaginzade Ahmed Pasha. The Dukaginzade would become one of the principal families of Aleppo in the Ottoman era The incorporation of Syria into the Ottoman Empire brought Janissary soldiers to urban centres of Syria such as Damascus, of which Albanians recruited from the Balkans in the seventeenth century were a noticeable presence alongside other Ottoman troops from different ethnicities.. During that era Albanians also served in other capacities such Sinan Pasha from Topojan who was for a time governor in the area. Albanians though in larger numbers migrated to Syria during the late 19th and early 20th century. The largest wave of migrants in Syria was during 1912-1913, when Albanians fled the Balkan Wars.Dr.Ramiz Zekaj: ‚ÄúArnaut√´t e Siris√´, nj√´ Shqip√´ri e vog√´l larg atdheut t√´ tyre ‚Äì radiokosovaelire.com From the Ottoman era until contemporary times a tradition of migration has continued whereby Albanian Muslim scholars and students migrated to Damascus, some to perfect their Arabic. Some of these individuals stayed and settled in neighbourhoods such as Suq Saruja and Suq al-Muhajirin. Some individuals within the Albanian community were Sufis and also served as a bridgehead for the spread of Sufism back in the homeland. Overall though, Albanian Muslim clergy in Damascus are conservative due to the dominance of Sunni Islam and that is reflected in many of their religious works in Arabic. Albanian Muslim scholars have left their mark on Islamic scholarship and prominent Albanian Muslim religious figures from Syria include Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani and Abdul Qader Arnaout. In contemporary times other Albanians in Syria have as artists, novelists, poets, short story writers, literary critics and dramatists contributed to Syrian society through their endeavours and works.. \\"Though not as famous as Egypt as a home for Albania's exiled community in the Eastern Arab world, Syria (and to a degree Lebanon) was to become a significant centre for Muslim Albanians, so that today the tiny ArnƒÅ‚Äô≈´·π≠ community in Damascus, as elsewhere, is not only respected but has already made a significant contribution to modern Arabic literature and cultural life in Syria. Damascus has for centuries acted as a magnet for Albanian Muslim scholars and students, and it is not uncommon to meet imƒÅms of mosques in Yugoslavia, a few of them Yugoslav Albanians, who have perfected their Arabic in Damascus. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a number of Ottoman governors and administrators were of Albanian origin. Among the most famous of these was SinƒÅn Pasha, whose achievements as a builder were distinguished in many parts of the Ottoman empire. He was born about 1500 in the region of Topoyani, in Central Albania, and rose to importance through the devshirme system‚Ä¶ Students who came to Damascus stayed longer, some of them for good. They would settle in such quarters as S≈´q SƒÅr≈´ja and S≈´q al- MuhƒÅjirƒ´n. If they returned, they would teach in Qur'ƒÅn schools in Kosovo and elsewhere. Others, of a ·π¢≈´fƒ´ spirit, acted as human bridges between Albania and the centres of the ·π¢≈´fƒ´ orders in the Middle East, Syria included. One specific order, the Sa‚Äôdiyya, founded by Sa‚Äôd al-Dƒ´n al JibƒÅwƒ´ and his successors in about 1335, was especially associated with Damascus, although it later spread to Turkey and Egypt, and in the eighteenth century gained a foothold in Kosovo and Yugoslav Macedonia‚Ä¶ Damascus and its Albanian circles were centres of Muslim orthodoxy. The Syrian influence on Muslim Albanians is characterised by its support for traditional orthodox Islam, freed from any taint of heterodoxy or excess, and it is therefore not surprising that studies in Arabic by Albanians published in Damascus, should reflect this preference. Examples of such books are a study of the thought of ImƒÅm Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa by Wahbƒ´ SulaymƒÅn GhƒÅwijƒ´ al-AlbƒÅnƒ´, published in Damascus and Beirut in 1973, an edition of ‚Äòal-Tadhkira fƒ´ fa·∏çl al-adhkƒÅr, by Ab≈´ AbdallƒÅh Muhammad al-Our·π≠ubƒ´ al-Andalusƒ´ (d. 671/1273), edited by ‚ÄòAbd al-QƒÅdir al-ArnƒÅ‚Äô≈´·π≠ and IbrƒÅhƒ´m al- ArnƒÅ‚Äô≈´·π≠, published in Damascus in 1972, and RiyƒÅ·∏ç al-·π¢ƒÅli·∏•ƒ´n, by the ImƒÅm al- Nawawƒ´, edited by Muhammad NƒÅ·π£ir al-Dƒ´n al-AlbƒÅnƒ´, and published by the Islamic Office in 1398/1978. These typify the serious scholarly work that has recently characterised the ArnƒÅ‚Äô≈´·π≠s in Syria. Potentially Syria has offered a scope and ambiance for their efforts that is rarely to be found, elsewhere, in the Arab world in recent years.

Pronunciation  In Kannada, the official and chief language of Karnataka, oralu kallu is written as ‡≤í‡≤∞‡≤≥‡≥Å ‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Å. The pronunciation of ‚Äòlu‚Äô in Oralu is not the same as ‚Äòlu‚Äô in \\"flu\\". 'Lu' of Oralu Kallu is depicted as ‚Äò·∏∑u‚Äô in equivalent English.

Oralu kallu  = Description = Oralu kallu or rubbo kallu is a household stone implement used for wet grinding. It consists of two separate parts. A grinding stone called gundukallu (‡≤ó‡≥Å‡≤Ç‡≤°‡≥Å‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Å)/gootada kallu (‡≤ó‡≥Ç‡≤ü‡≤¶‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Å) is a stout cylindrical stone of rounded ends with or without a wooden handle, and a base stone which actually is called oralu kallu has a central well with a diameter slightly larger than the gundukallu. = Wet grinding = Gundukallu is placed in the well of a base stone and rotated, usually with the left hand while the right hand is used to regularly push ingredients towards the well to grind them. The role of the hands keep interchanging with fatigue, duration and quantity of grinding. = Uses = * To wet grind dosa/idli batters, various chutneys, masalas etc. * It is a preferred tool to grind uddina vada batter in hotels and restaurants. * For making chigali * It plays an important role in Arishina Kuttuva Shastra (details under Miscellaneous section below), a wedding ritual in southern India. = Current scenario = Oralu kallu used to be a standard fixture of every household in the past. They were laid in flush with the kitchen floor or inlaid into counters or as separate stone unit within or outside homes. With availability and utility of mixer grinders, food processors, and commercial wet grinders, the oralu kallu has almost disappeared from urban areas and is on the decline in rural areas. Some believe that foods prepared using an oralu kallu taste better than foods processed in mixer grinders.  Beeso kallu  = Description = Beeso kallu is a household stone implement for dry grinding millet. It is made of two thick circular flat stones on top of each other. The upper stone has a central hole which accommodates a small conical (metal/stone) projection from stone below about which it can rotate. Also, on the upper stone is another hole, peripheral in location, which houses a wooden handle for rotating it. It is also called as chakki (stone mill) in northern India = Dry grinding = Ingredients to be ground are poured through the central hole of the upper stone which then slides along the sides of metal/stone projecting from below into a gap between the upper and lower stone. There it gets ground to flour upon rotating the upper stone. Beeso kallu, called jato in Nepal = Uses = * For making flour from millet like rice, ragi, wheat, jowar etc. * Sometimes powders like chili powder, sambar powder and other masala powders are also ground in it. = Current scenario = This was the chief tool of the past to grind millet into flour before the spread of commercial grinding mill shops. Hitherto found in rural areas, these have now almost disappeared.  Dundugallu  = Description = Dundugallu is a household stone implement for wet grinding found mostly in rural areas. It is a very basic form of an implement consisting of two separate parts, a circular or cylindrical or oval stone and another flat surfaced stone. It is seen in various sizes from small to large. = Wet grinding = Before grinding, both parts are washed and cleaned. Ingredients to be ground are placed on flat surfaced stone. Heavy round or cylindrical or oval stone is then rolled to and fro on the ingredients to grind them. = Uses = * Used in wet grinding ingredients for masalas, chutneys etc. = Current scenario = Hitherto found in rural areas, these have now almost disappeared.  Kutni  = Description = Kutni is a miniature household stone implement for grinding small quantities of either dry or wet ingredients. It traditionally is made of stone. It consists of kutni, a roughly boat or circular shaped base stone with shallow upper surface, and a kutto kallu (‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤ü‡≥ç‡≤ü‡≥ã ‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Å), a roughly pear shaped small stone to pound/crush/grind. 383x383px = Dry or wet grinding = Ingredients to be ground are placed in the kutni and the kutto kallu is used to crush/pound/grind. = Uses = * Usually to coarse powder small quantities of spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom etc. * To crush black pepper * To make small quantities of menasinkai (chilli) / bendekai (okra) and other chutneys * To make chigali = Current scenario = Kutni in the English world is known as a mortar and pestle. They are available in various sizes and shapes. Traditionally they were made of stone. Currently they are made in various sizes and shapes, from materials like iron, steel, brass, alloys, wood, marble stone, granite, or plastic. They are found in almost every household.  Miscellaneous  = Arishina Kuttuva Shastra = Arishina Kuttuva Shastra (‡≤Ö‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤∂‡≤ø‡≤® ‡≤ï‡≥Å‡≤ü‡≥ç‡≤ü‡≥Å‡≤µ ‡≤∂‡≤æ‡≤∏‡≥ç‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∞) is an important wedding ritual in Southern India. Arishina is a Kannada word for turmeric. In the ritual, whole turmeric (dried whole unbroken tuber) is placed in the oralu kallu. Women use the onake (description below) to pound it to a powder. Powdered turmeric is made into a paste with water. Turmeric paste is then applied on the bride and groom. In northern India, the Haldi function is similar. In another wedding ritual, instead of turmeric, various other grains like rice and jowar are symbolically pounded by the bride. = Onake = Onake is a wooden pole/stick, about the length of an average person, used in the past to pound millets into flour. millet to be pounded is placed in the oralukallu and pounded with onake to flour. Currently its usage is mostly limited to the Arishina Kuttuva ritual in South Indian weddings. The onake is sometimes called a pestle in English. A historical, brave woman, Obavva killed enemy soldiers with an onake in a battle at Chitradurga fort. She is revered as Onake Obavva. She is exemplified for the bravery and courage of women of Karnataka alongside another historical ruler, Kittur Chennamma. = Murders = Gundukallu, the grinding stone of oralu kallu, has been used as a weapon in numerous murders. Rarely, in domestic quarrels or family feuds or fights with neighbours or in village fights, a threat made by one individual to another can be heard said as \\"gundukallu yattak bidtini\\" (‡≤ó‡≥Å‡≤Ç‡≤°‡≥Å‡≤ï‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Å ‡≤Ø‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤æ‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≤ø‡≤°‡≥ç‡≤§‡≥Ä‡≤®‡≤ø), which can be translated roughly as \\"will lift up the grinding stone and throw it on you\\".

A similar project, World War Two (about World War II) began in September 2018. Neidell is also a writer and actor with credits that include Metropia and numerous commercials in Europe, as well as video game voice-acting.  Early life and education  Neidell was born in Pennsylvania moving to Houston, Texas at nine months old. Neidell attended St. John's School, graduating in 1985. He studied history at Wesleyan University. During an episode of World War Two, Neidell stated that his mother was born in Egypt. Neidell's grandfather, Basil worked for the Egyptian Ministry of Education before joining the Royal Air Force during World War II. At some point after the war ended, he became the Secretary of the International Lawn Tennis Federation.  Career  Neidell was approached by Mediakraft, the producers of The Great War, to host the series after they saw a series of videos he had produced between May and September 2013 about the history of baseball, entitled Watch Sunday Baseball. The Great War spin-off YouTube channel ‚ÄúIt's History‚Äù also featured Neidell as a guest host for episodes on famous military campaigns. In June 2017, he launched the TimeGhost History YouTube channel with Spartacus Olsson, the creator of The Great War and producer for its first two years. The first feature was day-by-day coverage of the Cuban Missile Crisis, 55 years to the day after the event. In April 2018, they launched the \\"Between-2-Wars\\" series to recap the Interwar period. The Great War project officially ended on November 11, 2018, exactly 100 years after the signing of the Armistice at Compi√®gne which formally ended all hostilities in the First World War. Neidell stated in his finale video that the channel will continue to release some episodes about events following the First World War. As for himself, Neidell has moved on to focus on other projects, such as the aforementioned World War II series. With The Great War project (a similar web series which followed World War I) coming to a close in November 2018, Indy Neidell and Spartacus Olsson prepared for an equivalent YouTube project focusing on World War II, which they would produce themselves through their own TimeGhost channel (unlike The Great War) with a projected start date for September 1, 2018. Accounting for the war's longer duration and larger scope for this independent project without the participation of Mediakraft Networks, it is a collaboration of various channels: TimeGhost will focus on a weekly series on the general historical events of the war in the European and Pacific Theatres of the war. To raise the seed money for this project, there has been a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised ‚Ç¨54,380 ($63,816). With those funds available, a new studio was built from the ground up in its own building and arrangements were made with media providers such as Reuters News Service for archival footage. The series also has an Instagram account which runs parallel to it and follows the events of World War II on a day-by-day basis. As of September 10th, 2020, the YouTube channel had received 42,463,079 views and has over 535,000 subscribers. In February 2019, Neidell teamed up with Swedish power metal band Sabaton for a project called Sabaton History, for which he is the host and writer. The series documents the historical events surrounding the band's songs. He also portrayed T. E. Lawrence in the music video for Sabaton's song \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\".  Personal life  In 1996, Neidell moved to Sweden. He lives in Stockholm, Sweden and holds a dual citizenship of the United States and Sweden.

It is a subspecies of Iris iberica and is a rhizomatous perennial, from Armenia, Turkey and Iran. It has large, thin and falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves, slender stem with a single flower between April and May. It has a white, cream or pale yellow ground, which is covered in dark veining or speckling in violet, mauve, purple or brown shades. The larger standards are paler, normally white and less veined. The falls, have darker veining and a dark signal patch and brown or purple beard. It is commonly known as Iris elegantissima, especially in Europe and Russia. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, but normally needs some protection during the winter period. Description It is classed as an mezo-xerophyte (meaning it likes medium to dry habitats), and has stoloniferous rhizomes which are about 3 cm long. Underneath the rhizomes, it has very long secondary roots. It has large, ribbon-like, and falcate (sickle- shaped), leaves, that can grow up to between long, It has a slender stem or peduncle, that starts to grow in March, up to between tall. The stem holds a terminal (top of stem) flower, the plant normally has 2‚Äì3 stems, each with flower buds, blooming in Spring,James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) between late March, or April and May, or June. The large flowers, are in diameter, they have a white, cream, or pale yellow ground, has dark, veining or speckling in violet, mauve, purple or brown shades. Compared to Iris iberica which can have blue veining and marking. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The darker veined, scallop shell shaped, falls are deflexed (bending over to an almost flat position), and up to long. in the center of the falls, is a velvet-like, dark, brown to purple, or black signal patch. Also, in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are brown to purple. Also over the falls, the iris has a deflexed style branches that almost covers the signal spot. The almost vertical, and larger standards, are creamy, or white, with pale, or thin violet veins. They are up to long, and can be described as white cotton handkerchiefs. The flowers produce pollen, which has been precisely measured, the long axis is long and the short axis is 111 microns long. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule between June to July. Then the plant dies back, losing the leaves and stems, to rest underground during the winter. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=20, and has an unnamed alkaloid (as of 1961), contained within its rhizome.John James Willaman and Bernice Schubert A study in 2014, was carried out on various species of iris DNA, it found that I. iberica ssp. elegantissima had a purity value of 2.80, compared to 1.26 of Iris aucheri. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet elegantissima refers to 'elegantissimus' meaning very elegant,William Stern it is a superlative of 'elegans'.David Gledhill It was first discovered in Transcaucasus, and then first published and described by Dmitrii Ivanovich Sosnowsky in Vestn. Tiflissk. Bot. Sada Vol.11 on page 2 in 1915. In 1972, it was then re-classified as a subspecies of Iris iberica by A. L. Takhtadzhyan and A. A. Fedorov, and published as Iris iberica subsp. elegantissima (Sosn.) Fed. & Takht. in Fl. Erevana Vol.331 in 1972. Although it is often referred to as Iris elegantissima Sosn. in Russia and Armenia.Sergeƒ≠ Kirillovich Cherepanov (1981) but elsewhere it is referred to as a subspecies. It was verified as Iris iberica subsp. elegantissima by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 22 February 2006, then altered in 11 December 2007. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. =Range= It is found in Armenia, (including Shirak, Yerevan, Aparan, Mount Aragats and Sevan.) in north western Iran, (including Maku,) and in north eastern Turkey, (or East Anatolia,) including near Lake Van Basin, Erzurum, and Ararat. It was listed as found in Azerbaijan, in 2004, but this either a cultivated form or mistaken form of Iris iberica, which is naturally found there. =Habitat= It grows on the lower and middle mountain belts, on semi-desert slopes, or dry rocky, (marl) slopes, and steppes,\\\\--> (with many annuals and long grasses.) and in coniferous forests. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It is a rare species, and was included in the Red Data Book of Armenia, but not included in the Annexes of CITES and that of the Bern Convention. It is at risk due to various factors, including urbanization, land development for arable purposes (framing) and the intensive collection (of the flowers) for selling. The species grows and is monitored within Sevan National Park, Khosrov State Reserve and Erebuni State Reserve in Armenia. Erebuni was formed in 1981, with the purpose of protecting 100 varieties of wild wheat and their habitat. Various rare or endangered species of plant can be found within the reserve, including Actinolema macrolema, Aegilops crassa, Gladiolus atroviolaceus, Hordeum spontaneum, Iris elegantissima (I. iberica subsp. elegantissima), Merendera trigyna, Stipa vavilovii, Triticum araraticum, Triticum boeoticum and Triticum urartu. It is also grown in Yerevan Botanic Garden in Armenia. Cultivation 'Oncocyclus Section' Irises are in general easier to grow than 'Regalia Section' irises. I. iberica subsp elegantissima is hardy to European Zone 4, (meaning hardy to ‚àí5 to ‚àí10oC (23 to 14oF). In the UK, it needs to be covered through the winter, within an alpine house. The irises grow within fertile, highly drained soil, in full sun, but needs protection from rain in the late summer and winter. In the US, the rhizomes are susceptible to being dug up by squirrels. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Oncoyclus irises dislike division, but it should only be carried out when the plant is overcrowded. Although hand pollination and germinating seedlings gives better results. Toxicity Armenia produced stamps for Iris elegantissima and Iris lycotis (subspecies of Iris iberica) Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture On 19 December 1997, as part of Flora and Fauna of Armenia (III issue) in the 'Irises' series, 2 stamps had images of the irises, (See images on the right), also on 12 August 1993, a commemorative stamp was issued in Azerbaijan, from the Flowers series, Iris elegantissima.

The OTE consists of some major parts of the telescopes including the main mirror, the secondary mirrors, the framework and controls to support those mirrors, and various thermal and other systems to support the functioning of the telescope. The other two major sections of the JWST are the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) and the Spacecraft Element (SE), which includes the Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield. The OTE collects the light and sends it to the science instruments in the ISIM. The OTE has been compared to being the \\"eye\\" of the telescope and the backplane of it to being the \\"spine\\". The primary mirror is a tiled assembly of 18 hexagonal elements, each 1.32 meters from flat to flat. This combination yields an effective aperture of 6.5 meters and a total collecting surface of 27 square meters. Secondary mirrors complete the 20 anastigmatic imaging optics. The complete system provides an effective number of 16.67 and focal length of 131.4 meters. The main three-mirror telescope is a Korsch-type design, and it feeds into the Aft Optics Subsystem (part of OTE), which in turn feeds into the Integrated Science Instrument Module which holds the science instruments and fine guidance sensor. Overview The OTE combines a large amount of the optics and structural components of the James Webb Space Telescope, including the Main mirror. It also has the fine steering mirror, which, provides that final precise pointing, and it works in conjunction with the fine guidance sensor and other controls systems and sensors in the Spacecraft Bus. The main mirror segments are aligned roughly using a coarse phasing algorithm. Then for finer alignment, special optical devices inside NIRCam are used to conduct a phase retrieval technique, to achieve designed wavefront error of less than 150 nm. To function as focusing mirror correctly the 18 main mirror segments need to be aligned very closely to perform as one. This needs to be done in outer space, so extensive testing on Earth is required to ensure that it will work properly. To align each mirror segment, it is mounted to six actuators that can adjust that segment in 5 nm steps. One reason the mirror was divided into segments is that it cuts down on weight, because a mirror's weight is related to its size, which is also one of the reasons beryllium was chosen as the mirror material because of its low weight. Although in the essentially weightless environment of space the mirror will weigh hardly anything, it needs to be very stiff to maintain its shape. The Wavefront sensing and control sub-system is designed to make the 18 segment primary mirror behave as a monolithic (single-piece) mirror, and it does this in part by actively sensing and correcting for errors. There are nine distance alignment process that the telescope goes through to achieve this. Another important aspect to the adjustments is that the primary mirror backplane assembly is steady. The backplane assembly is made of graphite composite, invar, and titanium. The ADIR, Aft Deployable Infrared Radiator is a radiator behind the main mirror, that helps keep the telescope cool. There are two ADIR's and they are made of high-purity aluminum. There is a special black coating on the radiators that helps them emit heat into space. Testing of the Aft Optic Subsytem in 2011, which contains the Tertiary (3rd) mirror and Fine Steering Mirror Some major parts of the OTE according to NASA: * Primary mirror (18 segments) * Secondary mirror (74 cm diameter) * Tertiary mirror (3rd) (in Aft Optics Subsystem) * Fine Steering Mirror (in Aft Optics Subsystem) * Telescope structure ** primary mirror backplane assembly ** main backplane support fixture (BSF) ** secondary mirror support structure ** deployable tower array * Thermal Management Subsystem * Aft Deployable ISIM Radiator (ADIR) * Wavefront sensing and control The Aft Optics Subsystem includes the Tertiary mirror and the Fine Steering Mirror. One of the tasks for the Fine steering mirror is image stabilization. The metal Beryllium was chosen for a number of reasons including weight, but also for its low- temperature coefficient of thermal expansion compared to glass. Other infrared telescopes that have used beryllium mirrors include IRAS, COBE, and Spitzer. The Subscale Beryllium Model Demonstrator (SBMD) was successfully tested at cryogenic temperatures, and one of the concerns was surface roughness at low kelvin numbers. The beryllium mirrors are coated with a very fine layer of Gold to reflect infrared light. There are 18 hexagonal segments that are grouped together to create a single mirror with an overall diameter of 6.5 meters (650 cm, ~7.1 yards, ~256 inches). DTA The Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) is where OTE connects with the rest of telescope such as the Spacecraft Bus. During stowage there is another attachment point for the folded sunshield higher up on the OTE At the base of the OTE is a critical structural component that connects OTE to the Spacecraft Bus, it is called the Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA). It also must expand to allow the Sunshield (JWST) to spread out to allow the space between its five layers to expand. The Sunshield segment has various structure, including six spreaders at its outer edge to spread the layers out at its six extremities. During launch its is shrunk down, but at the right time in space the DTA must extend. The extended DTA structure allows the sun-shield layers to be fully spread out. The DTA must also thermally isolate the cold section of the OTE from the hot spacecraft bus. The Sunshield will protect the OTE from direct sunlight and reduce the thermal radiation hitting it, but another aspect is the OTE's physcially connection to the rest of the spacecraft. (see Thermal conduction and Heat transfer) Whereas the sunshield stops the telescope getting hot at a distance from a fire (near not in it), the DTA has to handle the heat flow like how a handle on a pan might get warm when its on the stove if not insulated enough. The way the DTA extends is that it has two telescoping tubes that can slide between each-other on rollers. There is an inner tube and an outer tube. The DTA is extended by an electric motor that rotates a ball screw nut that pushes the two tubes apart. When the DTA is fully deployed it is 10 feet long (~3 meter). The DTA tubes are made of graphite-composite carbon fiber, and it is intended that it will be able to survive the conditions in space.

Part of the JWST development included validating and testing JWST on various testbeds of different functions and sizes. Some types of development items include pathfinders, test beds, and engineering test units. Sometimes a single item can be used for different functions, or it may not be a physically created item at all, but rather a software simulation. The NEXUS space telescope was complete space telescope, but essentially a scaled down JWST but with a number of changes including only three mirror segments with one folding out for a main mirror diameter of 2.8 meters. It was lighter, so it was envisioned it could be launched as early as 2004 on a Delta 2 launch rocket. The design was cancelled at the end of 2000. At that time NGST/JWST was still a 8-meter design (50 m2), a few years later this was reduced eventually to the 25 m2 (6.5 m) design. =OTE Pathfinder= One part of JWST development was the production of the Optical Telescope Element Pathfinder. The OTE pathfinder uses two additional mirror segments, and additional secondary mirror, and puts together various structures to allow testing of various aspects of the section, including Ground Support Equipment. This supports the GSE being used on the JWST itself later on, and allows testing of mirror integration. OTE pathfinder as 12 rather than 18 cells compared to the full telescope, but it does include a test of the backplane structure. =Additional tests/models= There are many test articles and developmental demonstrators for the creation of JWST. Some important ones were early demonstrators, that showed that many of fundamental technologies of JWST were possible. Other test articles are important for risk mitigation, essentially reducing the overall risk of the program by practicing on something other than the actual flight spacecraft. Another testbed was a 1/6th scale functioning version of the main mirror and technology, used especially to ensure the many segments can work as one. Another optics testbed is called JOST, which stands for JWST Optical Simulation Testbed. The Subscale Beryllium Model Demonstrator (SBMD) was fabricated and tested by 2001 and demonstrated enabling technologies for what was soon Christened the James Webb Space Telescope, previously the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). The SBMD was a half- meter diameter mirror made from powered beryllium. The weight of the mirror was then reduced through a mirror-making process called \\"light-weighting\\", where material is removed without disrupting its reflecting ability, and in this case 90% of the SBMD mass was removed. It was then mounted to a rigidly with titanium and underwent various tests. This included freezing it down to the low temperatures required and seeing how it behaved optically and physically. The tests were conducted with the Optical Testing System (aka the OTS) which was created specifically to test the SBMD. The SBMD had to meet the requirements for a space-based mirror, and these lessons were important to the development of the JWST. The tests were conducted at the X-Ray Calibration Facility (XRCF) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in the U.S. State of Alabama. The Optical Testing System (OTS) had to be developed to test the SBMD (the NGST mirror prototype) under cryogenic vacuum conditions. The OTS included a WaveScope Shack-Hartmann sensor and a Leica Disto Pro distance measurement instrument.

Overview  As mandated by the Statistics Act, Statistics Canada carries out a Census of Agriculture every five years. For this purpose, Statistics Canada surveys every agricultural operation and agricultural operator in Canada to construct a detailed, local understanding of demographics, commodities, operation structure, technology spread, and other notable aspects of agricultural data. Like the United States Census of Agriculture, farm operators are obligated to respond to the census. Unlike the Census of Agriculture, there is no minimum amount of agricultural operation income produced and sold for an agricultural operation to be considered. The Census of Agriculture is conducted concurrently with the larger Census of Population. Doing so allows for savings within the administrative costs, as well as for a direct linkage with the socio-demographic results present in the Census of Population, which is used to further inform the results of the Census of Agriculture. This linkage has been running since 1971. The latest Census of Agriculture in Canada was conducted in May 2016.  History  Following after the designation of the national census in the Constitution Act of 1867, the first Census of Agriculture was conducted in Manitoba in 1896, with Alberta and Saskatchewan being added in 1901. In 1956 the Census of Agriculture was expanded to the rest of Canada, and at the same time would begin to be conducted concurrently to the Census of Population. Like the Census of Population, the Census of Agriculture shifted from the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Trade and Commerce in 1912, and finally to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics (presently Statistics Canada) in 1918. The 2016 Census of Agriculture recorded 193,492 farms and 271,935 farm operators.  Data collected from Census of Agriculture  The Census of Agriculture, given its interests in presenting a thorough understanding of the entirety of the agricultural sector in Canada, collects a wide variety of data about individual farm operations and operators. Examples of information collected include: Agricultural Operator Data: * Number of Operators * Age of Operators * Gender of Operators * Education of Operators * Responsibilities of Operators Agricultural Operation Data: * Type of operating arrangements * Main farm location * Size (area) of operation * Land use and land tenure * Area and type of crops * Number and type of livestock * Land management practices * Market value of land and buildings * Number and market value of farm machinery by type * Total gross farm receipts * Total farm business operating expenses * Total number of employees and number of employees paid on a full, part-time or seasonal basis * Presence of Direct marketing * Succession planning * Presence of Renewable energy producing systems. The Census of Agriculture includes producers of both traditional agricultural products as well as other, more exotic to Canada products. Special categorization is given to operations in the territories, including the herding of wild animals, breeding of sled dogs, and harvesting of indigenous plants and berries. Data collected under the Census of Agriculture is protected under the Statistics Act, to ensure that all information provided during the census remains confidential. Like the Census of Population, data is held confidentially and anonymized as necessary.  2016 Census of Agriculture  The most recent Census of Agriculture, in May 2016, included a questionnaire containing 183 questions, spanning 16 pages. However respondents were only required to answer questions applying to their agricultural operations, thus, on average each respondent only answered 20% of questions on the questionnaire. Questions on four new topics were added to the 2016 Census of Agriculture, including adoption of technologies, direct marketing, succession planning and renewable energy systems. There were several types of data collected to assess information on current agriculture, as an important commodity in the Canadian economy.  Census publication and use  Statistics Canada provides the data to government and public entities at various levels to inform agricultural policy, as well as to establish benchmarks of crops, livestock, and farm finances. The statistical sets, as well as analysis by Statistics Canada is published in the years following a Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture has been useful in many scientific studies, including a study on land use for agriculture in Canada. It has also been used in the past to gauge the effects of climate change within the prairie provinces of Canada.

He studied at Calcutta University and Leeds University, obtaining M.A. degrees at both universities. He took part in the Quit India movement and was jailed during the struggle for Indian independence. Bhattacharya came into contact with the Democratic Vanguard leader Jibanlal Chatterjee in 1943. After Chatterjee founded the WPI, Bhattacharya became a key leader of the party. WPI leader Bhattacharya worked as a lecturer in English at Dibrugarh University, Assam, later shifting to Calcutta University, where he retired as Professor of English.

During the violent environment of the election campaign, he had to leave the constituency and live elsewhere. In September 1971 he presented his unpublished thesis Fascism: A Developing Trend in India at the Second All India Conference of the Indian School of Social Sciences. According to the thesis, a fascist system of governance was emerging in India under Congress (I) rule. Bhattacharya again contested the Ballygunge seat in the 1972 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, finishing in second place with 18,181 votes (35.49%). The WPI was split in 1976, with Bhattacharya leading the minority faction. Bhattacharya was seen as closer linked to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was expelled from WPI in early 1976, accused of 'anti-party activities' in the party organ Ganabiplab. After his expulsion he founded the Communist Workers Party. As of the 1980s Bhattacharya was the Head of the Department of English at Calcutta University. Bhattacharya died in 1998.

This battery is proposed to run on the radioactivity of waste graphite blocks (previously used as neutron moderator material in graphite-moderated reactors) and would generate small amounts of electricity for thousands of years. The battery is a betavoltaic cell using carbon-14 (14C) in the form of diamond-like carbon (DLC) as the beta radiation source, and additional normal-carbon DLC to make the necessary semiconductor junction and encapsulate the carbon-14.  Prototypes  Currently no known prototype uses 14C as its source, there are however some prototypes that use nickel-63 (63Ni) as their source with diamond semiconductors for energy conversion which are seen as a stepping stone to a possible 14C diamond battery prototype. = University of Bristol prototype = In 2016 researchers from the University of Bristol claim have constructed one of those 63Ni prototypes however no proof is provided. Details about the performance of this prototype have been provided, however they are not self- consistent, contradicting other details and figures for performance exceed theoretical values by several orders of magnitude. = Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology prototype = In 2018 researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), the Technological Institute for Superhard and Novel Carbon Materials (TISNCM), and the National University of Science and Technology (MISIS) announced a prototype using 2-micron thick layers of 63Ni foil sandwiched between 200 10-micron diamond converters. It produced a power output of about 1 ŒºW at for power density of 10 ŒºW/cm3, at those values it's energy density would be approximately 3.3 Wh/g over it's 100 year half-life, about 10 times that of conventional electrochemical batteries. This research was published in April of 2018 in the Diamond and Related Materials journal.  Carbon-14  Researchers are trying to improve the efficiency and are focusing on use of radioactive 14C, which is a minor contributor to the radioactivity of nuclear waste. 14C undergoes beta decay, in which it emits a low-energy beta particle to become Nitrogen-14, which is stable (not radioactive). : ‚Üí + These beta particles, having an average energy of 50 keV, undergo inelastic collisions with other carbon atoms, thus creating electron-hole pairs which then contribute to an electric current. This can be restated in terms of band theory by saying that due to the high energy of the beta particles, electrons in the carbon valence band jump to its conduction band, leaving behind holes in the valence band where electrons were earlier present. Proposed manufacturing In graphite-moderated reactors, fissile uranium rods are placed inside graphite blocks. These blocks act as a neutron moderator whose purpose is to slow down fast-moving neutrons so that nuclear chain reactions can occur with thermal neutrons. During their use, some of the non-radioactive carbon-12 and carbon-13 isotopes in graphite get converted into radioactive 14C by capturing neutrons. Once the graphite blocks are removed during station decommissioning their induced radioactivity qualifies them as low-level waste requiring safe disposal. Researchers at the University of Bristol demonstrated that a large amount of the radioactive 14C was concentrated on the inner walls of the graphite blocks. Due to this, they propose that much of it can be effectively removed from the blocks. This can be done by heating them to the sublimation point of 3915 K (3642 ¬∞C, 6588 ¬∞F) which will release the carbon in gaseous form. After this blocks will be less radioactive and possibly easier to dispose of with most of the radioactive 14C having being extracted. Those researchers propose that this 14C gas could be collected and used to produce man-made diamonds by a process known as chemical vapor deposition using low pressure and elevated temperature, noting that this diamond would be a thin sheet and not of the stereotypical diamond cut. The resulting diamond made of radioactive 14C would still produce beta radiation which researchers claim would allow it to be used as a betavoltaic source. Researchers also claim this diamond would be sandwiched between non- radioactive man-made diamonds made from 12C which would block radiation from the source and would also be used for energy conversion as a diamond semiconductor instead of convention silicon semiconductors.  Proposed applications  Due to its very low power density, conversion efficiency and high cost it is very similar to other existing betavoltaic devices which are suited to niche applications needing very little power (microwatts) for several years in situations where conventional batteries cannot be replaced or recharged using conventional energy harvesting techniques.Bristol university Press release issued: 25 November 2016 Bristol University interdisciplinary Aspire project, 2017 Due to its longer half-life 14C betavoltaics may have an advantage in service life when compared to other betavoltaics using tritium or nickel however this will likely come at the cost of further reduced power density. =Commercialisation= In September 2020 Morgan Boardman, an Industrial Fellow and Strategic Advisory Consultant with the Aspire Diamond Group at the South West Nuclear Hub of the University of Bristol was appointed to be the CEO of a new company called Arkenlight which was created explicitly to commercialise their diamond battery technology, and possibly other nuclear radiation devices under research or development at Bristol University New Atlas (formerly Gizmag) interview with Dr Boardman  References   External links  * The speech that proposed the battery * Are Radioactive ‚ÄòDiamond Batteries‚Äô a Real Thing?

His name was Latinized to de Ponte Cardonis or de Ponte CardunoPole, p.411 (\\"from the bridge of Cardon\\"). Robert de Pont-Chardon was certainly well rewarded for his companionship and support by Baldwin FitzGilbert (died 1090), Sheriff of Devon, and feudal baron of Okehampton (alias Baldwin de Meulles and Baldwin du Sap), tenant-in-chief of 176 manors in Devon, who granted him lands in England amounting to four and a quarter knight's fees. Baldwin's chief seats in Normandy were Meulles and Le Sap, from which he took his alternative surnames, which were located 7 kilometers north-east and 7 kilometers south-east of Pont-Chardon respectively. The lands granted to Robert were chiefly in Devon, Somerset, Hertfordshire and a manor in Hampshire. His Devon estates comprised the following five manors, all in North Devon and all held from Baldwin the Sheriff (whose follower he thus may have been): *Heanton (Braunton hundred) *Hagginton (Ilfracombe parish, Braunton hundred) *Charles (anciently Charnies) (Shirwell hundred) *Mockham (Charles parish, Shirwell hundred) *Blakewell (Marwood parish, Braunton hundred) In 1894 Reverend Elgood Punchard published his research into the Punchard family in a volume entitled \\"Punchard of Heaton Punchardon - Records of an Unfortunate Family\\"Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association Punchard of Heaton Punchardon - Records of an Unfortunate Family in which he traced the descent from wealth and standing in royal favour in the Norman era to relative obscurity by Tudor times in the 16th century. Rev. Punchard described the descent of the Punchardon family thus (largely following PolePole, pp. 396‚Äì7, Heanton Punchardon): *Sir William I de Punchardon, eldest son of Robert, who retained the Devon and Hampshire estates but those in Hertfordshire Somerset fell to younger brothers. *Roger de Punchardon (died 1243), eldest son. After a few transactions with his brothers Reginald and Robert, he confined his interest to Devonshire. In 1220 he acquired the manor of CoombePunchard, 1894, quoting: Testa de Nevill His nephew Oliver, son to Reginald, was the last of the Hampshire family concerned with Devon and was summoned once as jurator in the hundred of Haytor.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Rotuli Hundredorum, vol. i *Sir William II de Punchardon, eldest son of Roger, succeeded in 1243 and largely increased the estates. In 1254 he was \\"coronator\\", with de Briwere and another knight, concerning wreckage;Punchard, 1894, quoting: Placitorum in domo Capit: Westmonast: Abbreviatio,\\"p. 137 in 1259 he was a juror concerning the claims of Isabell de Forz, Countess of Albemarle, daughter of Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon (1217‚Äì1245).Punchard, 1894, quoting: Placita de quo Warranto,\\" p. 177. His widow Ermegard de Punchardon outlived him twenty years, and married Alexander de Viteri, who tried (though ineffectually) to retain possession of Heanton and Charles.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Feet of Fines, 1877 *Sir John Punchardon, son and heir, last of the direct male line. Mention of him is frequently made in various documents down to 1296; indeed, as Westcote (d.circa 1637) quaintly says, \\"There are few ancient evidences in those parts, whereunto the Punchardons have not been witnesses: yea sometimes two or three of them...Heanton is surnamed Punchardon; the parish reserving charily the old lord's name of long antiquity, and therewithal copious in some ages\\". he left three daughters as co-heiresses: **Ermegard de Punchardon, heiress of Heanton Punchardon, wife of Sir Philip Beaumont of Shirwell. She left an only son John Beaumont, who married Alice Scudamore and in the second generation, the male issue here also was extinct. But Joan Beaumont, the wife of Sir James Chudleigh, gave Heanton Punchardon to Richard Beaumont, nephew of the first Sir Philip Beaumont, whose last descendant and heiress, Joan Beaumont, married John Basset of Whitechapel, Bishops Nympton. John Basset, after several lawsuits in Chancery, secured the Punchardon estates and his successors were possessed of Heanton until the late 19th century. One of them was Colonel Arthur Basset, who held St. Michael's Mount for King Charles and surrendered to Colonel Hammond in 1646. **Mabil de Punchardon, wife of Sir Henry Ralegh of Raleigh, Pilton, heiress of Charles, whose descendants held that manor in direct descent for seven generations. **Margery de Punchardon, heiress of West Buckland, who married twice, firstly to Sir Richard Beauple, of Landkey and secondly to Joel de Buckenton.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Pole's \\" Collections,\\" pp. 896, 411, 404, 288, 428, &c.; She died without children.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Pole's \\"Collections,\\" p . 411 Junior branches of Punchardon Of this senior stock was William de Punchardon (died 1274), priest and prebend of Bosham, and Canon of Crediton in 1270, and Canon of Exeter in 1273.

Hugh Punchardon, with the consent of Reginald de Punchardon his eldest son, during the reign of King John (1299‚Äì1216) gave lands there to his daughter Mary de Punchardon. Roger de Punchardon held the same estates during the reign of King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272). In 1277 Sir William de Punchardon of this line, following a muster at Worcester, performed military service due from Edmund, Earl of Cornwall.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Palgrave, Writs On his own tenure he was further summoned to Carmarthen in 1282, for the war in West Wales.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Palgrave, Writs. In 1310 another William Punchardon served for Richard Lovel,Punchard, 1894, quoting: Afterwards Baron Lovel of Kary. In 1313 Edward II and Isabella went to France for the coronation of Louis X, and this nobleman was in attendance and attended the levy at Tweedmouth. Three years later he crossed over seas on the same military duty, and in 1312 his lands had the usual foedus de protectione (letters of protection). In 1311 he was manucaptor of Alfred de Penhergard, burgess returned for Liskeard. In 1322 a certain Thomas Punchard was similarly bound for the return of John le Taverner for Bristol. The most distinguished of the line was Sir Richard de Punchardon, made a knight banneret by King Edward III (1327‚Äì1377). During the French Campaign of 1356, which ended with the Battle of Poitiers on 19 September, he was caught in an ambuscade, but with his gallant comrades, he fought a way through to the main army under the Black Prince. Sir Richard de Punchardon's lands at Bovey were again under royal protection in 1359.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Foedera,\\" 83¬∞ Ed : iii He stood high in court favour, and was entrusted by the King with the guardianship of the young de Bensted of Benington, with estates in Essex, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Wiltshire.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Abbreviatio Rotm : Orig : in Curia Scaccarii,\\" vol. ii. p. 253. Froissart speaks of him as Marshal of Aquitaine in 1366, at the birth of Richard of Bordeaux. His grandson Richard II Punchardon held Bovey until 1413. In 1446 John Punchardon, perhaps a brother, was noted at South Hole, Hardesworth and West Barlyngton.Punchard, 1894, quoting: Feet of Fines The Bovey line probably ended during the Wars of the Roses as no further record of its fate survives. Heraldry According to Guillim (died 1621) the arms of the Punchardon family of Heanton were: Sable, six plates three, two, one, sometimes shown as ten plates, four, three, two, and one. However, according to Pole (died 1635), Sir William Punchardon of Heanton Punchardon bore: Argent, a cross sarcel voided gules.Pole, Sir William (died 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.454; followed by Lysons Magna Britannia, Vol.6: Devon, 1822, clxix Rev. Punchard (1894) suggested this coat given by Pole was that of the Bovey (Little BoveyPole, p.266) line of the Punchardon family. Risdon (died 1640) gave the arms of Willelmus de Ponte Cardonis, de Lydyet (possibly Lydiard-Punchardon, Somerset) as: Argent, a cross moline voided gules. The Crest was: A unicorn's head erased gules bezantee armed or. =Basset= Arms of Basset: Barry wavy of six or and gules. The manor of Heanton Punchardon was held from the 15th century to 1802 by the Basset family, formerly of Umberleigh, whose seat was Heanton Court, situated on the bank of the River Taw, 3/4 mile SE of the village. The house is now the Tarka Inn. The last of the male line was Francis Basset (c. 1740 ‚Äì 1802), MP for Barnstaple, who died in 1802 unmarried and without children. This last Francis Basset appears to have been the \\"Colonel Basset\\" who was master of the North Devon Staghounds (which became in 1837 the Devon and Somerset Staghounds) from 1775 t0 1784. Confusion however arises between this Francis Basset Esq. (c. 1740 ‚Äì 1802) of Heanton Court and his contemporary and distant cousin (from a junior branch of the family) Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset (1757‚Äì1835), of Tehidy in Cornwall, who is stated in his History of Parliament biography to have been Lt-Col. of the North Devon Militia from 1779. The mural monument to Elizabeth Bassett (1571‚Äì1635) is situated on the east wall of the Bassett Chapel. She was one of the four daughters and co-heiresses of Sir William Peryam (1534‚Äì1604), Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, by his second wife Anne Parker, daughter of John Parker of North Molton, Devon. She married in 1591 Sir Robert Bassett (1574‚Äì1641) of Heanton Punchardon, MP for Plymouth in 1593, and bore him two sons and four daughters,History of Parliament biography of Sir Robert Bassett, MP amongst whom was Colonel Arthur Bassett, MP, who erected the monument. =Davie- Basset= The heir of Francis Basset (died 1802) was his nephew Joseph Davie Esq. of Watermouth Castle, near Lynmouth, son of John Davie of Orleigh Court, near Bideford, by his wife Eleanora Basset, Francis Basset's sister. In accordance with the terms of the inheritance, as was then usual in such cases, Joseph Davie and his descendants adopted the arms and surname of Basset in lieu of their patronymic. =Williams= Arms of Williams of Caerhays, Scorrier & Tregullow in Cornwall: Vair, three crescents or.Burke's Landed Gentry, 1937, p.2442 A catalogue note in the Williams Estate Archive held in the North Devon Record Office under ref: B170, states: \\"William Williams purchased the Heanton Estate from the Bassetts in the mid nineteenth century and the family lived at Heanton Court\\". Documents show Williams as the new owner as early as 1852 and the Comprehensive Gazetteer of England and Wales in 1894-5 stated a member of the Williams family to be lord of the manor. A younger member of this family became heir to the Davie-Basset family, namely Charles Henry Williams, Esq., (who later assumed the surname Basset) of Watermouth Castle, near Lynmouth, JP and MP for Barnstaple (1868‚Äì1874) and master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds from 1887 to 1893. Born 16 November 1834, being the fourth surviving son of Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet (1791‚Äì1870), MFH,Bailys Magazine of Tregullow, Cornwall, by his wife Caroline Eales, younger daughter of Richard Eales of Eastdon. He married on 7 January 1878, Harriet Mary Basset, only daughter of Arthur Davie Basset, Gentleman, of Watermouth Castle, and sister and co-heiress of Reverend Arthur Crawfurth Davie Basset, JP and MA, also of Watermouth. Again there had been a failure in the male Basset line. As a condition of his inheritance he assumed by Royal Licence in 1880 the surname of Basset in lieu of his patronymic, with the arms of Basset. In 1861 the occupant of Heanton Court was George Norman.Address given as subscriber to the Bath & West of England Society, 1861 Notes References Heanton Punchardon ","title":"Manor of Heanton Punchardon"},{"id":"52445122","text":"Family policy in Spain refers to the implementation of public policy measures that aim to support the social actions carried out by families, as well as define family roles and relationships within Spain. These laws and services provide Spanish families with provisions regarding parental leave, childcare, family allowances, marriage, divorce, and cohabitation. History =Franco era= Spain is categorized within the Southern European social model, due largely in part to its strong dependence on family assistance and support. Rather than promoting state reliance, the predominance of the male breadwinner model and the family-oriented nature of social measures in Spain has hindered the development of effective family policies, according to the South European Society and Politics journal. In Francoist Spain from 1939 until 1975, strong state intervention established social protections for families; however, these programs provided fragmented coverage for male industrial workers and their families exclusively. Those working in the agriculture sector as well as women, who were highly unemployed, received little to no benefits in regards to family protections. Family policy during this time mainly served to encourage large families, especially through the promotion of measures such as the 1943 Large Family Law which rewarded families with the largest number of children. =Restoration to democracy= After Spain became a democracy and established its Constitution in 1978, family policy profoundly changed to reflect a new emphasis on promoting work-life balance. This led to the elimination of payments for marriage and for those given after the birth of each child. For employed individuals, the main benefit was payments transferred monthly for those with dependent children, as well as various extensions of maternity leave and childcare provisions. These policies gave women the chance to possess a more participatory role within Spain's overall workforce, rather than remaining solely in the domestic sphere. Bringing together family and employment obligations through family policy, however, still took a number of years to fully develop. The legacy of Francoist Spain, in which married women were strongly encouraged to stay home, continued to hamper women's efforts in gaining employment and receiving state-paid family assistance. Current situation Recent efforts to improve family protections have largely been undermined by the presence of fragmented coverage and drastic budget cuts. The current economic crisis that began in 2007, has led the Spanish government to implement various austerity measures which have directly hindered the development of Spanish family policies. These measures were meant to curtail the ill effects of the economic downturn, however, they also worked to instigate a resurgence of the belief that family life is a private, rather than a public, matter. Alongside this, the lack of sufficient family protections have also had effects on Spain's overall fertility rate. Since the latter half of the 1970s, the fertility rate has experienced a steady decline, going from a rate of 2.78 to a low of 1.323 in the mid 2000s. The average age of the Spanish at their first birth has also been rising, having increased by 6 years from the 1980s to the mid 2000s. These trends are due in part to Spain's underdeveloped family policies, which have incentivized new parents to return to work at a quicker pace, and have also required families to manage the expensive costs of child-rearing on their own.

A specialist sprinter he won four of his twenty-one races in a track career which lasted from April 1982 until August 2014. After being bought cheaply as a yearling he showed promising form as a juvenile in 1982 as he won two of his seven races. In the following year he was well beaten in his first three starts but then recorded an upset victory in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. In 1984 he won once in seven races and finished third in his attempt to repeat his win in the King's Stand. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and had moderate success as a breeding stallion. Background Sayf El Arab was a \\"small, attractive\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Walter Ferrell. As a yearling he was consigned to the Keeneland sales in September 1981 and was bought for $37,000 by Fred Purman. The colt entered the ownership of Moufid Dabaghi and was sent to England where he entered training with Bill O'Gorman at Newmarket, Suffolk. Sayf El Arab was sired by Drone, a Kentucky-bred stallion who was undefeated in four races in a brief track career before retiring to stud after a career-ending injury. He sired several other major winners including Lets Don't Fight (Arlington Futurity) but was best known as the broodmare sire of the Kentucky Derby winners Charismatic and Grindstone. Sayf El Arab's dam Make Plans showed little racing ability but became a successful broodmare, producing several other winners including the Palace House Stakes winner Monde Bleu. She was a granddaughter of Our Patrice, a half-sister of the Brooklyn Handicap winner Palestinian. Racing career =1982: two-year-old season= After finishing fourth on his racecourse debut over five furlongs Sayf El Arab recorded his first success when odds-on favourite for a minor race over the same distance at Newmarket Racecourse in May. He was then stepped up in class for the National Stakes in June and finished second of the five runners, beaten a head by Krayyan. He was later found to have sustained minor fracture to his cannon bone which affected his form for the rest of the season. After being beaten in his next two starts over six furlongs, Sayf El Arab was dropped back in trip for the five furlong Highflyer Stakes at Thirsk Racecourse in September. Equipped with blinkers for the first time he won by a length from Jonacris, who was carrying twelve pounds more. He ended the season bay finishing fourth in a race over five furlongs. =1983: three-year-old season= Sayf El Arab's form in the spring of 1983 was undistinguished although his trainer pointed out that he was not suited to the prevailing soft ground: he finished unplaced in the Quail Stakes at Kempton Park in April, the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket and the Prix de Saint-Georges at Longchamp Racecourse in May. The colt raced much firmer ground conditions and was re-fitted with blinkers when he was stepped up to Group One class for the first time for the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden by the lightweight Michael \\"Taffy\\" Thomas he started a 33/1 outsider whilst his stablemate On Stage was made the 11/4 favourite in a sixteen-runner field. The other runners included Fearless Lad, Soba (Stewards' Cup), Salieri (Mill Reef Stakes), Kind Music (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne), Krayyan, Jonacris, Touch Boy (Portland Handicap), Chellaston Park (runner-up in 1982) and Prince Reymo (Windsor Castle Stakes). Sayf El Arab started quickly, took an early lead and never looked in any danger of defeat and drew away in the final furlong to win by three lengths from Soba with On Stage in third place. He was the longest- priced winner of the race since Squander Bug in 1948 and enabled Bill O'Gorman to emulate his father Paddy who had trained the winner in 1958 and 1963. After an absence of well over two months, Sayf El Arab was tried over six furlongs in the Haydock Sprint Cup but after going well for most of the way he tired in the closing stages and finished fifth of the six runners behind Habibti. Five days later he returned to the minimum distance for the Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse and finished fifth behind Soba. He ended his season in the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp on 2 October in which he started a 30/1 outsider and ran accordingly, finishing sixth of seven behind Habibti. =1984: four-year-old season= After running unplaced on his first run of 1984, Sayf El Arab won the Quail Stakes at Kempton in April by a length from El Gazebo, recording his first and only victory over six furlongs. He was then matched against Habibti in the Leisure Stakes at Lingfield Park in early June and was beaten a length into second place by the filly. At Royal Ascot two weeks later the blinkers were re-applied as the colt attempted to repeat his 1983 success in the King's Stand Stakes. After setting a \\"scorching\\" pace in the early running he was overtaken but held on to finish third behind Habibti and Anita's Prince. In July he was sent to Ireland for the Phoenix Sprint Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse and dead-heated for second place behind the three-year-old filly Princess Tracy. In his two remaining races he finished a close-up fifth behind Celestial Dancer in the Prix de Meautry at Deauville Racecourse and then ran poorly when unplaced behind the Irish mare Committed in the William Hill Sprint Championship at York Racecourse in August. Assessment and awards In 1982 the independent Timeform organisation gave Sayf El Arab a rating of 110, 23 pounds inferior to their top two-year-old Diesis, and commented that he appeared \\"barely to stay 6f\\". In the British Free Handicap he was more highly regarded, being placed fourteen pounds behind Diesis with a weight of 119 pounds. In the following year he was rated 127 by Timeform, nine pounds behind their best sprinter Habibti whilst in the official International Classification he was rated eleven pound inferior to the top-rated three-year-old Shareef Dancer. In their annual Racehorses of 1983 described him as a horse capable of winning more good races but one who could not be relied upon to reproduce his best form. His Timeform rating dropped to 120 in 1984, placing him eleven pounds below their best sprinter Chief Singer. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Sayf El Arab began his career as a breeding stallion at the Woodditton Stud in Newmarket where he stood at an initial fee of ¬£4,000. He sired two horses who won Group race winners in Italy namely Flaming Sword and Manoftheyear, both of whom won the Group Three Premio Primi Passi. He sired numerous other winners including El Yasaf (Listed race winner), Vintage Only (second in the Gimcrack Stakes), China Castle (winner of 26 races) and Nineacres (14 wins). He spent his later stud career in Italy where his last recorded foal was born in 1999. Pedigree *Sayf El Arab was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Princequillo, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and the fourth generations of her pedigree. He was also inbred 4 √ó 4 to Royal Charger.

It has been used in both Black and White positions by professional players. It is characterized by not opening the bishop's diagonal with a pawn push (P-34 or P-76) and instead moving the bishop back (to 31 if played by White or 79 if played by Black) so that it can then exit one's camp via the central (5th) file, which has been opened by advancing the central pawn. With the bishop out of way, it possible to castle the king into a Left Mino castle. The opening is named after professional player Eiji Iijima who has won the Masuda Award in 2009 for developing the strategy. vs Central Rook The example here is an Iijima Bishop Pullback position played by White against a Central Rook position played by Black. White first suggests their intention to play a Static Rook position while Black hints at a Central Rook position. After Black pushes their rook pawn to the mid rank, Black shows their clear intention for Central Rook. From this point, White starts the Iijima Bishop Pullback development by moving their left silver straight up to make way for a space in which to pull back their bishop. Black starts castling their king rightward, and White pulls their bishop back to rank 1, which allows for a possible pawn and bishop exchange on the eighth file at the 86 square focal point. In later development, White's left silver and right gold have been moved to construct a Left Mino castle. In the last diagram, both players have (a) finished moving their kings into their castles, (b) developed their attacking silvers further, and (c) exchanged their central file pawns. vs Fourth File Rook 1\\\\.

Description The adult of this species tends to be entirely dark brown or black. They reach approximately 9mm in length. Females tend to be redder in body color than males are. Only adult males have wings and are capable of flying. Adult males, unlike adult females, have an affinity for light. The nymphs are much paler than adults, and they darken in color as they mature. Life cycle The entire life cycle of the black webspinner is typically completed within a year. They are a hemimetabolous insect species, meaning that they have incomplete metamorphosis. During developmental stages the nymphs produce silk from silk glands. The glands are located on the basal segment of the foretarsus. they use this ability to create silk tunnels for protection from predators and to store food. Eggs are laid within the silk tunnels. When the nymphs hatch they expand the network of tunnels. This network continues to expand as the insect matures. The vast majority of their life is spent within the silk tunnel. Distribution and habitat This insect is originally from India; however, it is now found in other parts of the world. In America, it can be found from Texas to California up to Utah, covering much of the southwest region of the United States. It was most likely introduced to North America in the late 1800s during the shipping of date palm cuttings from the Persian Gulf Region. During the day they spend most of their lives in silk tunnels beneath a rock or structure nearby a food source. In gardens their food source is frequently grass or some type of ornamental plant. They are often found near the base of palm trees, emerging from their tubes to feed on debris, dead plant material, mosses and lichens.

This species has been used as a model for human Plasmodium vivax because Plasmodium cynomolgi shares the same life cycle and some important biological features with P. vivax.  Life cycle  The life cycle of P. cynomolgi resembles that of other Plasmodium species, particularly the related human parasite Plasmodium vivax. Like other Plasmodium species, P. cynomolgi infects both an insect host and a vertebrate (generally Old World monkeys). The parasite is transmitted when the mosquito host takes a blood meal from the vertebrate host. During the feeding, motile parasites called sporozoites are injected from the mosquito salivary gland into the host tissue. These sporozoites move into the bloodstream and infect cells in the host liver, where they grow and divide over the course of approximately one week. At this point, the parasitized liver cells rupture, releasing thousands of parasite daughter cells, called merozoites, which either move into the bloodstream to infect red blood cells, or remain in the liver to reinfect liver cells. Those that reinfect liver cells form a quiescent stage called a hypnozoite, which can remain dormant in the liver cell for months or years before reactivating. The merozoites that enter the bloodstream infect red blood cells, where they grow and replicate. After approximately 48 hours, the infected red blood cell bursts, allowing the daughter merozoites to infect new red blood cells. This cycle can continue indefinitely. Occasionally, after infection of a red blood cell, the parasite develops into one of two distinct sexual forms called male and female gametocytes (also micro and macrogametocytes respectively). If a mosquito takes a blood meal containing a gametocyte of each sex, the two sexual stages merge and form a zygote. The zygote develops into a motile stage called the ookinete which penetrates the wall of the mosquito gut and forms a stationary oocyst. The oocyst develops over about 11 days, then begins to release thousands of sporozoites into the mosquito's hemolymph. The sporozoites move through the hemolymph and infect the mosquito salivary glands, where they will again be injected into a mammalian host when the mosquito takes a blood meal. Immunofluorescence image of P. cynomolgi infecting macaque liver cells. The parasite is shown in green. Large blue ovals are macaque cell nuclei. Blue dots surrounded by green are parasite nuclei. The image is approximately 100 micrometers across.  Description  P. cynomolgi closely resembles the human parasite P. vivax throughout its life cycle. Similar to P. vivax, P. cynomolgi infection changes the red blood cell membrane structure, causing surface perturbations that appear as pink dots (called Sch√ºffner's dots) when stained with Giemsa.  Ecology and distribution P. cynomolgi is found throughout Southeast Asia where it naturally infects a variety of macaque monkeys, including Macaca cyclopis, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Macaca nemestrina, Macaca radiata, Macaca sinica, Trachypithecus cristatus, and Semnopithecus entellus. The effect of infection on primate hosts has primarily been studied in rhesus monkeys, where P. cynomolgi generally causes mild and self-limiting illness. Monkeys can suffer anemia and thrombocytopenia as well as occasional kidney inflammation, however all generally resolve without treatment. The exception to this is in pregnant monkeys, where P. cynomolgi infection can be severe, resulting in death of the mother and fetus without antimalarial treatment. Infection of humans with P. cynomolgi is exceedingly rare. However, occasional zoonotic infections have been described. In addition to a few naturally occurring cases, human infection by P. cynomolgi has been verified in laboratories both by experimental infection of human volunteers and by laboratory accidents resulting in human infection. Transmission of P. cynomolgi from human to human by a mosquito vector has also been shown in laboratory experiments, although it appears to occur rarely if at all in the environment. P. cynomolgi also infects a broad variety of Anopheles mosquitoes; the effect of infection on these mosquitoes is not known.  Taxonomy and evolution  P. cynomolgi is in the genus Plasmodium, which contains all Apicomplexan parasites that undergo asexual reproduction through schizogony and digest red blood cell hemoglobin to produce the crystalline pigment hemozoin. Within Plasmodium, P. cynomolgi is in the subgenus Plasmodium, containing all species of Plasmodium that infect primates (except for some that infect the Great Apes, which are in the subgenus Laverania). Evolutionarily, P. cynomolgi is most closely related to the other Plasmodium species that infect monkeys, as well as P. vivax which infects humans. Evolutionary relationships among Plasmodium species have been inferred from ribosomal RNA sequencing, and are summarized in the cladogram below:  Research  P. cynomolgi is the second-most studied malaria parasite of non- human primates after Plasmodium knowlesi, primarily due to its similarity to the human parasite P. vivax. In particular, P. cynomolgi is used as a model for hypnozoite biology as it (along with P. vivax) is one of the few Plasmodium species known to have this lifecycle stage. P. cynomolgi can infect a variety of monkey species and can be transmitted by several common laboratory-grown mosquitoes. Due to this, P. cynomolgi has been used in research on a broad variety of malaria topics including hypnozoite biology, host immune responses to infection, and to test the efficacy of antimalarial drugs and vaccines. History P. cynomolgi was first observed in 1905 in the blood of the long-tailed macaque.

It belongs to the town of Guilford. It is near Falkner Island, North Rocks, Falkner Island Reef, Stony Island, and Three Quarters Rock. Goose Island has eroded to the point that it is 0.5 acre and virtually underwater at high tide, although it was once about 4 acres in size.https://www.yelp.com/biz/faulkners-island-lighthouse-guilford The strait between the two islands is between 16 and 8 feet deep.http://www.uscg.mil/d1/antlis/files/lights%5Cfil.asphttp://coastmariner.com/bin/chart2.php?chartId=12372_16‚™´=41.2081&lon;=-72.6722&locId;=7017 The coastline is defined prominently by two small bays that connect during high tide. The island is currently privately owned, but may someday become part of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. Shipwrecks In 1805, a gale storm caused a ship to crash on the island, killing the crew of seven men. They were found and buried by Joseph Griffing, keeper of the lighthouse on Falkner. During the time that Captain Oliver N. Brooks owned Falkner Light, there were at least 100 shipwrecks on Goose Island. Brooks saved 71 sailors.http://www.newenglandlighthouses.net/faulkners-island-light- history.html In 1858, a coal schooner named Moses F. Webb crashed on the island. The crew of five was saved by Brooks. He later was given a medal, silver set, salary raise, and was nicknamed the \\"Hero of 1858\\".

Early life  Marie Elizabeth Watkins was born in Ray County, Missouri to Charles Allen Watkins and Henrietta Rives Watkins. The family lived in a country home called Westover, and were fairly well off due to her father's work as both a farmer and businessman. Her father developed a number of businesses with her uncle, James R. Allen, including a brickyard, flour mill, sawmill, store, and warehouse. Marie was educated by a governess and at private schools, before attending Richmond College with her younger brothers. Marie Watkins became the tutor for her brothers as they prepared to attend the University of Missouri. One of her brothers, Charles, roomed with a law student, Robert Burett Oliver, who would eventually become her husband. When Charles died, Robert began exchanging letters with Marie. They wrote for two years before eventually meeting in 1876. After a long courtship, the two were married on December 10, 1879. The two moved to Jackson, Missouri, where Robert worked as a lawyer until he was elected to the Missouri Senate in 1882. Marie Elizabeth Watkins Oliver had five sons and one daughter while living in Jackson: Robert Burett Jr., John Byrd, Allen Laws, William Palmer, Charles Watkins, and Marie Marguerite. During that time, Marie began volunteering throughout the community.  Designing Missouri's Flag  In 1896, Oliver moved with her family to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where her husband established his law firm. In 1904, she joined the Nancy Hunter Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), and in 1907 she was elected state DAR vice regent. In 1908, the state DAR noticed that Missouri did not have an official state flag, and Mrs. Samuel McKnight Green appointed a committee to research, design, and secure passage of a bill for an official flag. Oliver was appointed chairperson of the committee, and began writing to the secretaries of state for every state and territory in the Union, in order to learn how other locations designed their flags, and the process necessary to have them adopted. She received an answer from every Secretary of State, and spent months researching historical interests connected to passing legislation about state flags. She envisioned a flag that featured the Missouri coat of arms, encircled by twenty four stars that represented Missouri's status as the twenty-fourth state to enter the Union. Oliver's friend and artist, Mary Kochtitzky, painted Oliver's design, and her husband, now a former state senator, drafted the legislative bill. On March 17, 1909, Oliver's nephew, Senator Arthur L. Oliver, introduced the bill to the Missouri Senate. The bill passed twenty four to one, but failed to pass in the House of Representatives. The bill was reintroduced in 1911, but met with the same result since the General Assembly was considering another design known as the \\"Holcomb flag.\\" Oliver thought that the \\"Holcomb flag\\" did not distinctively represent Missouri, since the stripes might be confused with the National flag, and failed to include any representation of local government. Later that year, the Missouri State Capitol burned, destroying Kochtitzky's original work. Oliver and another friend, Mrs. S. D. MacFarland, recreated the design in silk. On January 21, 1913, the Oliver Flag Bill was again reintroduced, this time passing on March 7 and being officially signed by Governor Elliot Woolfolk Major on March 22, 1913. Oliver kept the silk flag until her death in 1944, when she was buried in Lorimer Cemetery in Cape Girardeau.

It was their 34th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945‚Äì46. They played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. Ren√© Theler was the club's chairman for the fourth consecutive season. Overview Match program Basel-Servette 25 August 1979 Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the fifteenth consecutive season. There were a number of players that left the squad during the off-season. Midfield player Urs Siegenthaler moved on to Schaffhausen after eight years and 112 league games with the club. Stricker Roland Sch√∂nenberger moved on to Young Boys after four seasons, he had played 110 league games and scored 41 league goals. Defender Paul Fischli ended his professional career. After ten years with the club he moved on to local amateur team FC M√ºnchenstein as player-coach. Between the years 1968 and 1979 Fischli played a total of 395 games for Basel scoring a total of 22 goals. 189 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 52 in the Swiss Cup and Swiss League Cup, 59 in the European competitions (European Cup, Cup Winners' Cup, UEFA cup and Cup of the Alps) and 95 were friendly games. He scored seven goals in the domestic league, two in the cup competitions, two in the European competitions and the other 11 were scored during the test games. In the other direction the experienced Ren√© Hasler and youngster Ernst Schleiffer both signed in from Xamax. Joseph K√ºttel signed in from Young Boys. Two local players joined both from the other side of the boarder. French player Serge Gaisser joined in from St. Louis and German Manfred Jungk joined from SV Weil. Basel played a total of 57 games in their 1979‚Äì80 season. 36 matches were played in the domestic league, two in the Swiss Cup, one in the Swiss League Cup and 18 were friendly matches. The team scored a total of 160 goals and conceded 62. All of their friendly games were played away from home. Of their 18 test games, 14 were won, two were drawn and two ended with a defeat. One of the defeats was against the Swiss national team. 14 teams played in the 1979‚Äì80 Nationalliga A. The qualification round was played as double round- robin. The top six teams were qualified for the championship group. There was no relegation round to be held this season and the bottom two teams were to be relegated after the qualification. Following the poor season the year before Basel started the season as outsiders. Reigning Champions Servette together with the two clubs Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich and FC Z√ºrich were favorites. Benthaus declared qualification to the UEFA Cup as the teams primary aim. Basel ended the qualification round in second position, two points behind Servette and one ahead of the Grasshoppers. In the championship group the points obtained in the qualification were halved as a bonus (rounded up). Basel won the Championship with 33 points, two ahead of both second place Grasshopper Club and third placed Servette. Basel scored a total of 91 goals conceding 38 in the 32 league games. This was the club's eighth championship title in their history and the seventh and last under trainer Benthaus. Erni Maissen and Detlev Lauscher led the team's top goal scorers list after the qualifying phase, both with 13 league goals. At the end of the season they were joined by Joseph K√ºttel and all three managed to score 18 league goals during the season. Maissen had played in 35 league matches, Lauscher had played in 33 and K√ºttel had had 32 appearances. Goalkeeper Hans K√ºng and the two defenders Jean-Pierre Maradan and J√∂rg Stohler played in all 36 domestic league games. In the qualification round 22, the home match at the Landhof on 26 April K√ºttel scored four goals as Basel won 6‚Äì1 against Xamax. In the home match against Luzern on 17 May Lauscher went one better and scored five goals as Basel won 8‚Äì2. All NLA teams entered the Swiss Cup in the round of 32. Basel were drawn away against Mendrisiostar where they won 3‚Äì1. In the second round, again away from home in the Wankdorf Stadium and this against Young Boys. In the Swiss League Cup Basel were also drawn away from home against the Young Boys. Basel lost both duels and thus without further cup matches to contest they had enough strength and energy to win the Swiss championship.

Recorded at The Ranch Production House in Southampton with producer Neil Kennedy, it was released on 19 February 2016 by Roadrunner Records. The EP was the band's first release to chart, reaching the top ten of the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. \\"Black Mass\\" and \\"Astral Projection\\" were released as music videos. The material for The Stranger was written mostly by Creeper vocalist Will Gould and guitarist Ian Miles, following the departure of second guitarist and frequent songwriter Sina Nemati in December 2015. The EP is the first to feature contributions from Oliver Burdett, who replaced Nemati, as well as keyboardist and backing vocalist Hannah Greenwood, who had previously been a touring member of the band. The Stranger received positive reviews from the majority of music critics, who praised the EP in line with 2014's Creeper and 2015's The Callous Heart as an indication of the band's potential future success. Songs such as \\"Black Mass\\", \\"Misery\\" and \\"Astral Projection\\" in particular were highlighted as some of the year's best songs by multiple publications, earning Creeper a number of award nominations.  Background  In December 2015, Creeper announced that their third EP The Stranger would be released in February 2016, and would feature contributions from new guitarist Oliver Burdett (who replaced Sina Nemati) and keyboardist Hannah Greenwood (who was originally a touring member for the band). The recording of the EP was influenced by the work of veteran producer Jim Steinman, which Stereoboard.com's Alec Chillingworth claimed is most evident on the songs \\"The Secret Society\\" and \\"Black Mass\\". Other artists named by vocalist Will Gould as influences on the EP include Arcade Fire (\\"The Secret Society\\" was originally written to sound like the song \\"Wake Up\\"), R.E.M. (Gould wrote \\"Valentine\\" with the band in mind in order to make it sound \\"Poppy but not patronisingly so\\") and Alkaline Trio (one of multiple influences on \\"Black Mass\\"). Prior to its release, The Stranger was made available for free online streaming on the band's website. \\"Black Mass\\" was released as the first song from the EP, along with a music video, on 28 January 2016. The video for the song was filmed in a rehearsal room in Southampton in which the band used to practise, which Gould claimed \\"gave the video a quiet sense of continuity\\". \\"Astral Projection\\" was released as the second music video from the EP on 11 May, featuring footage from the band's recent UK headline tour. The EP was promoted on a headline tour with Scottish support band Grader, as well as dates supporting Neck Deep and WSTR. In May 2016 Creeper supported Black Veil Brides vocalist Andy Biersack on his Homecoming Tour, performed second on the bill for Funeral for a Friend at their final show on 21 May at The Forum, London, and in August performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals.  Critical reception  Media response to The Stranger was generally positive. Reviewing the EP for DIY magazine, Tom Connick described that it \\"harbours a playful musicianship and songwriting talent that could turn groups ten times Creeper's age green with envy\\", praising Creeper's development on the EP from their previous releases. Kerrang! magazine's Paul Travers praised Creeper on The Stranger as \\"the closest anyone has come yet to MCR's punk-tinged sense of the grandiose\\", highlighting \\"Black Mass\\" as the EP's standout track and noting that the band \\"just get better and better\\". Awarding it a perfect score of five stars, Alec Chillingworth of Stereoboard.com also compared The Stranger favourably to The Callous Heart, highlighting \\"Misery\\" and \\"Astral Projection\\" and hailing the release as being \\"as good as rock music gets\\". In June 2016, Kerrang! featured \\"Black Mass\\" in its feature of \\"The Best Songs of 2016 So Far\\". Writer Paul Travers praised the track as \\"a supernatural goth- punk stalker with a bassline to kill for\\" and compared it stylistically to the work of My Chemical Romance, AFI and Misfits.  Chart performance  The Stranger was Creeper's first release to chart, entering the UK Albums Chart at number 130, the UK Album Downloads Chart at number 59, the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart at number 9, the UK Album Sales Chart at number 84, and the UK Vinyl Albums Chart at number 7.

Due to back strain, the tendons and muscles supporting the spine are twisted or pulled. Chronic back strain occurs because of the sustained trauma and wearing out of the back muscles Acute back strain can occur following a single instance of over stressing of back muscles, as in lifting a heavy object. Chronic back strain is more common than the acute type. To avoid back strain it is important to bend the knees whenever you lift a heavy object ‚Äì see partial squats. Signs and symptoms The pain over the back is localized and does not radiate into the leg. It occurs suddenly and may be accompanied by muscle spasms. The pain is dull, aching type and decreases on rest. It may be aggravated with activity. Cause Back strain occurs more in women than men and is more common after pregnancy. Lean people, those standing for long hours and those doing sedentary work in bad posture are prone to back strain. Back strain is also more common in people with excessive curving of the back, weak muscles (as in muscular dystrophies) and tight thigh muscles. People who play sports involving lifting heavy weights, pushing and pulling are also prone to back strain. Diagnosis The diagnosis of mild back strain can be made with a medical history and physical examination. In case of more severe strains, an X-ray should be taken to rule out fracture and disc herniation. Treatment Back strain is treated using analgesics such as ibuprofen, rest and use of ice packs. The patient can resume activities 24-48 hours after pain and swelling is reduced. It is not recommended to have prolonged immobilization or bed rest. If the pain does not subside in two weeks, additional treatment may be required. Prevention of back strain is possible by adopting proper body mechanics while sitting, standing and lifting. Cessation of smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, exercise and normal weight is also good for preventing back strain. Temporary pain relief may be achieved through application of a menthol-based pain relief cream.

It described itself as a union/organisation of nurses for professional objects and campaigned for the establishment of a register of nurses. It wanted the training to last three years with national standards. Princess Christian was the president from its foundation. In 1891, it received the prefix \\"Royal\\", and received a Royal Charter in 1892. In a speech she made in 1893, she made clear that the association was working towards \\"improving the education and status of those devoted and self-sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick, the suffering, and the dying\\". In the same speech, she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered. Although the Association was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses, its Charter with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses, but as the list had no formal status few nurses joined it, and the campaign for registration continued.Seweryn Chomet, Helena: A Princess Reclaimed (Begell House, New York, 1999) p. 120 The Charter altered the constitution, and Mrs Bedford-Fenwick lost her permanent position. Alice Ravenhill was the secretary of the association from 1894 to 1897. It set up a Nurses Co-operative, the Chartered Nurses Association, in 1896. In 1905 it employed 120 nurses taking 7.5% of their earnings. The Passing of the Midwives Act 1902 encouraged the campaign for registration of nurses. The Association helped to set up the Central Committee for the State Registration of Nurses in 1908. The RBNA gradually went into decline following the Nurses Registration Act 1919; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the British parliament passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration. In 1925 it had about 5,000 members - around a fifth of the membership of the College of Nursing. It was still in existence .

It feeds and breeds exclusively on members of the aquatic plant family Pontederiaceae, especially water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and is being investigated as a possible biological pest control agent for the water hyacinth in countries where that plant is invasive. Although its semiaquatic behavior is unusual, it is not unique. In South America alone there are more than 50 species of orthopterans that are associated with water, including a few relatively well-known species like Paulinia acuminata, which is used for control of the plant Salvinia molesta. Appearance Cornops aquaticum is a medium-sized grasshopper, with adults typically about in total length (head to wing tip); males average smaller than females. Adults are greenish with a distinct, broad black stripe on either side, running from the eye to the tip of the wing.Lin Besaans (2011). . Plant Protection Research Institute, Department of the Environment (South Africa). Accessdate 17 March 2019. During dry periods they become brown. The nymphs range from , and are mottled in green-blue and orange-red. Ecology Being semiaquatic and living on floating plants, both adults and nymphs of C. aquaticum are a strong swimmers and readily enter the water. They have been observed moving between aquatic plants as much as below the surface. If on land and seeing a predator like a bird, the grasshopper may attempt to crawl out of sight, jump or fly away, or dive into the water where it may stay submerged for an extended period of time. The adults are strong fliers and can move relatively long distances to access new regions with their preferred food plants. Adults live for 55‚Äì110 days; after an initial feeding period of four weeks, females deposit up to seven egg packets at intervals. Each packet contains 30‚Äì70 eggs. The female inserts its ovipositor into the leaf stalk of the host plant to deposits the egg packet; the egg cases are large, measuring an average of . The eggs hatch after 25‚Äì30 days, and the nymphs feed on the leaves of the plant for about seven weeks, passing through six or seven instars, and causing much damage. Feeding trials show that besides water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), nymphs can complete their development on Eichhornia azurea and Pontederia cordata (pickerel weed), both also in the family Pontederiaceae, and on Canna indica. In laboratory starvation trials, nymphs can also feed on some other plants but the females do not oviposit on these species and the nymphs do not develop beyond the third instar on any of them. The adults also consume large amounts of foliage of their plant host. Damage caused to the plant is high compared to damage caused by other grasshoppers, but nevertheless, it is only able to limit the plant, as the growth exceeds the consumption by the insect. Biological control The water hyacinth is an aquatic plant in the family Pontederiaceae whose natural enemies keep under control in its native South America. However this plant has been introduced into countries where it has insufficient natural enemies and where it has become invasive. Cornops aquaticum is under consideration as a biological control agent for this invasive plant, and has been introduced under controlled conditions into South Africa for this purpose. Before full release, the South African trials showed that, in the absence of E. crassipes, the adult insects would feed on maize (Zea mays) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), but that only eggs laid on E crassipes were viable. Where the insects had a choice of diet, they invariably chose E. crassipes and were not found on the crop species.

She was dean of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania from 1888 to 1917. Early life and education Clara Marshall was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the daughter of prominent Quakers Mary and Pennock Marshall. She initially worked as a schoolteacher, and at age 24 she enrolled in the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. Her instructors included Rachel Bodley (chemistry), Ann Preston (physiology), Emeline Horton Cleveland (obstetrics), and Mary Scarlett-Dixon (anatomy). She graduated with a degree in medicine in 1875, and due to her exceptional skill was immediately made a demonstrator of materia medica and therapeutics. Some members of the college board disputed Marshall's appointment due to her lack of experience, but she was able to overcome their objections. To further her knowledge of the subject, she attended lectures at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1876, becoming the first woman to do so. After this she was made a professor of materia medica and therapeutics at the Woman's Medical College, a title she would retain until 1905.  Career  In 1882 Marshall was the first woman to join the faculty of Blockley Medical College, as a demonstrator in obstetrics. In her 1897 book The Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania: An Historical Outline, she praised chairman John Huggard for offering her the opportunity, writing: \\"To this gentleman, more than to any other, belongs the honor of extending more fully to women the clinical advantages of this great hospital.\\" In 1886 she became an attending physician at the Girls' Department of the Philadelphia House of Refuge. Marshall became dean of the Woman's Medical College in 1888, after the death of Rachel Bodley. During her tenure, her achievements included expanding degree programs from three to four years, increasing the number of subjects taught, and instituting an entrance exam. In 1896 she oversaw the establishment of the first professorship in bacteriology and a laboratory for its instruction. She encouraged students to author academic papers, and in 1895 compiled a list of over 500 such publications. In 1904, Marshall's fundraising efforts resulted in the construction of Pavilion Hospital on the college grounds. From 1907 to 1913 this was expanded to the larger College Hospital. She retired as dean in 1917 and worked in private practice until shortly before her death from arteriosclerosis in 1931. Marshall was a member of organizations such as the Philadelphia County Medical Society, the Obstetrical Society of Philadelphia, the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania, and the American Medical Association. She was a founding member of the New Century Club, and advocated for women's suffrage and the admission of women to medical societies. She was a school board member and a school director in Philadelphia's Eighth Ward.

Family He was the only member of the patrician family to become consul. The gens Romilia disappears after him in the ancient accounts. He was the grandson of a Titus Romilius and the son of a Titus Romilius, his complete name being Titus Romilius T.f. T.n. Rocus Vaticanus. The cognomen Vaticanus which he carried shows that the term was used at least as far back as the 5th century BC. He might be the founder of the tribus Romilia which included several immigrant districts. Biography =Consulship= In 455 BC, he was elected consul with Gaius Veturius Cicurinus.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XII. 4 They issued orders during a period of high tension between the patricians and the plebeians. The tribunes of the plebs, representatives of the people, demanded in vain for many years that the power of the consuls be limited in written law. The Lex Terentilia, first drafted in 462 BC, was deferred each year by the tribunes who tirelessly proposed numerous identical drafts of the law. The Latin city of Tusculum needed Roman aid against the Aequi who had pillaged their lands. The two consuls levied an army, consisted primarily of patricians, but also of some plebeian volunteers, to defend the Tusculan allies. Among the plebeians was Lucius Siccius Dentatus, who openly supported the legal drafts contested by the patricians. In response, Titus Romilius chose Lucius Siccius for a perilous mission. When Siccius protested regarding the risks of the mission, the consul interrupted and imposed silence. This anecdote, delivered by Dionysius of Halicarnassus but ignored by Livy, allowed Dionysius to illustrate by example the tense relationship between the patricians and the plebeians, the superiority in social status, and the authority of the former over the later.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, X. 45 Lucius Siccius Dentatus survived and was elected tribune of the plebs in 454 BC. The Aequi were defeated near Mount Algidus. The public treasury was then exhausted, and so the consuls decided to sell the abundant spoils (praeda), which would otherwise be rewarded to the soldiery. Essentially, this limited the gains of the plebeians who had volunteered. =Proceedings= In the wake of their decision, Gaius Veturius and Titus Romilius were taken to court by the plebeian aedile Lucius Alienus and by the tribune of the plebs, Gaius Calvus Cicero, in early 454 BC. The testimony of Lucius Siccius Dentatus implicated Titus Romilius, but Siccius retracted his testimony when the old consul offered to send an ambassador to the Greek cities as a sign of appeasement during political tensions. Nevertheless, Titus Romilius was found guilty and ordered to pay a considerable indemnity of 10,000 asses. This proved impracticable, and so a law was passed allowing the indemnity to be satisfied by an equivalent value in cattle and bronze. =Decemvirate= In 451 BC, Titus Romilius was part of the First Decemvirate which wrote the first written laws of Rome and whose government lasted one year and acted in moderation.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XII. 9Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 33Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, X. 56 References  Bibliography  =Ancient bibliography= * Livy, Ab urbe condita * Diodorus Siculus, Universal History, Book XII, 9 on the site Philippe Remacle * Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, Book X, 33-49/50-60 at LacusCurtius =Modern bibliography=   5th-century BC Romans Ancient Roman decemvirs Roman Republican consuls Roman patricians ","title":"Titus Romilius Rocus Vaticanus"},{"id":"52445901","text":"Potokar is a surname.

According to the Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of Armenia, Armenia has an average of about 1720 kilowatt hour (kWh) solar energy flow per square meter of horizontal surface annually and has a potential of 1000 MW power production. In the capital Yerevan, the average solar energy flux is equal to 1642 kWh/m2. Armenia's area cannot be considered as homogeneous from the perspective of available solar energy: the difference between the amount of solar energy reaching the ground in different places in the country can be up to 20% in the summer time, and 50% in the winter time. The use of solar energy in Armenia is gradually increasing.  Photovoltaics  Solar panels on the rooftop of American University of Armenia Currently 9 solar PV plants (total installed capacity ‚Äì about 7,02 MW) have been put into operation. 7 companies (totally 31,5 MW) have been licensed for the construction of the solar PV plant with up tp 5 MW installed capacity. As of February 20, 2019 Technical terms were given to 907 autonomous energy producers with capacity up to 500 kW (total capacity 12,9 MW), 854 of which have already been connected to energy system (total capacity 10,3 MW). Example of buildings equipped with solar panels are the American University of Armenia generating enough power for the elevators and other uses, and the UN House in Armenia. A 55 MW utility-scale solar power plant will be built near Mets Masrik in Gegharkunik province, requiring an investment of about $50 million. International tender was won by consortium of the Netherlands‚Äô Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) B.V and Spain‚Äôs FSL Solar S.L. that are expected to commission the plant in 2020. There are defined tariffs for generating electricity using solar energy. In November 2016, Public Services Regulatory Commission of RA made a decision to set the price of electrical energy from photovoltaic systems to 42.645 AMD/kWh. Consumers are allowed to install solar panels with total power of up to 150 kW, and may sell any surplus to electricity distribution company Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA).  Thermal solar  Solar water heating system on the rooftop of American University of Armenia with maximum capacity of 35 kW In Armenia, solar thermal collectors, or water-heaters, are produced in standard sizes (1.38-4.12 square meters). Solar water-heaters can be used for space heating, solar cooling, etc. In order to generate heat, they use solar energy from the Sun. Modern solar water÷äheaters can cause water to boil even in winter‚Ä§ Solar thermal collectors are used throughout the territory of Armenia. One building using solar thermal collectors is AUA, which uses solar cooling and ventilation systems. The biggest solar water-heater in Armenia is located at Diana hotel in Goris, which has 1900 vacuum tubes that provide hot water for a swimming pool with 180 cubic meter volume, and for 40 hotel rooms.  Solar companies  The main companies that operate in this sector in Armenia are Solar Group Ltd, Arpi Solar Ltd, Simartek (in partnership with Solitek Armenia), Eco Step Armenia, ArtClima, General Electric Lighting Armenia (Rubinar LLC), Elips Technoline, Hatuk Santekhmontazh CJSC (SanHit Specialized Shop), Shtigen, Technoeco, Solaron (local PV panel manufacturer).

It is one of the largest birds in the world, second only to its sister subspecies Struthio camelus camelus. Today it is hunted and farmed for eggs, meat, and feathers.Magige, F., R√∏skaft, E., & Mlingwa, C. (2008). Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet, Fakultet for Naturvitenskap Og Teknologi. The Ecology and Behaviour of the Masai Ostrich (Struthio Camelus Massaicus) in the Serengeti Ecosystem, Tanzania. URL: https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu- xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/244464/123686_FULLTEXT01.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y  Taxonomy  = Subspecies = The Masai ostrich is one of the four extant subspecies of ostrich currently inhabiting Africa, including the nominative ostrich (S. c. camelus) found across northern Africa, the South African ostrich (S. c. australis), and the Somali ostrich (S. c. molybdyphanes). It is considered one of the two red-necked forms of ostrich, along with S. c. camelus, as opposed to the two blue-necked forms (S. c. australis and S. c. molybdyphanes). Comparative restriction-enzyme analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) found the Masai ostrich, though genetically distinct, is most closely related to S. c. australis, despite their geographical separation, and least genetically related to S. c. molybdophanes, despite habitat overlap. Explanations for these counterintuitive findings are that while the Brachystegia or ‚Äúmiombo‚Äù woodlands currently serves as a zoogeographic barrier separating northern and southern ostrich populations, it is theorized that this barrier was not as dense and effective throughout evolutionary time and once allowed for brief periods of intraspecific breeding between S. c. massaicus and S. c. australis populations. Conversely, the genetic divergence observed between S. c. massaicus and S. c. molybdophanes, albeit a lack of any zoogeographic barrier, is thought to be due to the ecological differences in behavioral and reproductive cues between these populations. These differences were substantial enough to prevent intraspecific breeding throughout time. These same studies found S. c. massaicus to significantly differ genetically from S. c. camelus subspecies. Although the now extinct subspecies S. c. syriacus was determined to also be a red-necked form of ostrich based on historical evidence, similar analysis of mtDNA found the Masai ostrich to not be as close of a relative to S. c. syriacus compared to S. c. camelus.  Description  = Anatomy = Adult males are 2.1-2.7 m in height and can weigh up to 145 kg; females are typically slightly smaller in size. They have large eyes (50 mm across), long eyelashes, and exceptional vision.Hurxthal, L. M. (1986). Our gang, ostrich style. Natural History (Pre-1988), 95, 34-41,94. Retrieved from http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/editors_pick/1986_12_pick.html Their heads are relatively small compared to their body and are covered in degenerated feathers that give the upper two-thirds of their elongated neck an almost naked appearance. The skin of the neck and thighs of male Masai ostriches is bare and pink in color, which intensifies to an almost reddish hue during mating season. Their large size prevents the capability of flight, but this is compensated by their exceptionally long and muscular legs, which allow for maximum running speeds of up to 60-70 km/hr.left  Plumage  The feathers of the Masai ostrich lack barbs, which gives them a soft, downy appearance. Similar to other ostrich subspecies, they possess approximately 50-60 tail feathers, 16 primaries, 4 alular, and 20-23 secondary feathers. The wing and tail feathers have evolved to serve as decorative plumes for courtship display rather than flight. For males, the majority of the body is covered in black feathers. White feathers appear along the tips of the wings, tail, and form a small ring partway up the neck that separates the black body feathers from bare neck skin. The white tail feathers are often discolored from dirt and appear reddish-brown. Females tend to be smaller than males and also possess bare skin on both the neck and legs, though their skin color appears more beige than pink. Adult females body feathers are a uniformly- distributed, monochromatic color scheme of brown.  Reproductive/Excretory organs  left Unlike most avian species, male ostriches have a retractable penis that averages 20 cm in length and everts during defecation, urination, and copulation. The ostrich is the only bird to void urine separate from defecation due to the muscular sphincter-like folds located within the cloaca.Warui, C., Macharia, R., Mwangi, D., Macheru, P., & Moilo, J. 1998. Observations on the morphology of the cloacal region of the African ostrich (Struthio camelus massaicus). The Kenya Veterinarian. 23(Special Issue), 53-55. Retrieved from https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/FullTextPDF/2006/20063016891.pdf  Environmental adaptations  Several physiological adaptations have evolved to allow the Masai ostrich to live in the extreme arid conditions of Sub- Saharan Africa. Their feathers have specialized to work as efficient insulators for proper thermoregulation during both hot and cold climates.Louw, G.N., Belonje, P.C. and Coetzee, H.J. (1969). Renal function, respiration, heart rate and thermoregulation in the Ostrich (Struthio camelus). Scientific Papers of the Namib Desert Research Station 42: 43-54. Retrieved from http://www.the-eis.com/data/literature/Louw_1969_sci_pap_NDRS_ostrich.pdf Increased aldosterone release and use of mucous in place of water for excretion of uric acid promotes water retention in arid environments. Masai ostriches also possess salt-excreting nasal glands which allow for consumption of salt water from saline and soda lakes when necessary.  Distribution and habitat  Wild Masai ostriches are located across Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Denser populations are often found in the semi-arid, open grassy plains of the African savanna. Despite this preference, they have been known to also inhabit desert, dense brush, and steep rocky mountain environments.  Behavior and ecology  = Breeding = Masai ostrich breeding season begins around May or June. During this time, the pink hue on male Masai ostriches neck and leg skin intensifies as a form of mating display. Mature males begin to establish territories that are about 2-3 km¬≤ in area and aggressively defend their domain against other breeding males. They will also construct scrape nests in prior to the arrival of breeding females. In July, adult female ostriches begin establishing breeding zones that span around 13 km¬≤. These breeding zones overlap with 5-7 male territories, in which males attempt to mate with any adult females that pass through his territory.  Communal nesting  alt= Similar to other ostrich subspecies, the Masai ostrich nests in groups and engages in cr—êching behavior where a single (major) female incubates the eggs of several other (minor) females within a single nest. Only 1 out of 3 hens will become major a female, the remaining hens are considered minor females and will not incubate their own eggs. A nest is initiated when a single major female mates with a territorial male who has already prepared a nesting site and performed a complex mating display. After she lays the initial clutch, both her and the territorial male assume primary care of the eggs. The major female lays on average 2 eggs per day and will spend a subsequent 15-90 minutes incubating, then will periodically leave the nest unattended to allow minor females to copulate with the territorial male and lay eggs in the nest. The male will often spend more time incubating the nest than the major female. An upwards of 18 different minor females will lay eggs in a single major females nest, resulting in an excess of eggs. Since both male and female Masai ostriches are only able to incubate 20-21 eggs at a time, so the major female will eject excess eggs. A reproductive advantage observed in major females is that they are able to recognize their own eggs and will eject minor female eggs in favor of theirs as a necessary way to reduce nest overcrowding.  Eggs  Masai ostrich eggs are large (grapefruit-sized) and white in color. They measure 14-16 cm and weigh between 1.0 and 1.6 kg. Egg hatching occurs during October and November, when eastern Africa experiences brief periods of rainfall that generates edible plants that are the Masai ostriches primary food source. Hatchlings are about the size of a domestic chicken hen and are physically precocious, but still require parental care. The conspicuous size and color of the Masai ostrich eggs makes them an easy target for predation, particularly when major females abandon nests for upwards of two to three weeks prior to incubation. A 2008 study found the salient white egg coloration to be an evolutionary trade-off favoring a reduced risk of eggs overheating and occurrence of embryo mortality over increased predation during these periods of exposure.alt= = Food and feeding = Like other Struthio camelus subspecies, Masai ostriches are almost entirely herbivorous. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, bushes, herbs, succulents, and leaves. Occasionally they will consume flowers, fruits, seeds, and animal protein (e.g. lizards, insects, etc.), but to a lesser extant. = Threats = Lions are the central predator of adults, but many species prey on ostrich eggs including: jackals, hyaenas, lions, and other avian species. Egg predation poses the greatest threat to the reproductive success of wild ostrich populations. Documented instances have attributed 90% of a single flock's chick mortality to be caused purely by predation.  Relationship to humans  Alongside predation, human activity has been shown to have a negative impact on the success of wild Masai ostrich communities. Anthropogenic-induced ostrich population decline is believed to be attributed to rapid human expansion within Sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in reduced resources and territory availability. Collection of ostrich eggs by both locals and tourists within protected areas has also poses a substantial negative impact on their population success. Interestingly, a 2009 study found that illegal hunting of ostrich meat did not significantly affect Masai ostrich population density within the Serengeti National Park. During the 1990s, worldwide domestication and breeding of the Masai ostrich rose in popularity.Horba√±czuk, J., & Sales, J. (2001).

Ostrich eggs and feathers have been harvested for ornamental purposes throughout history, but are frequently utilized today by the Maasai as source of food and as a vessel for liquids.  Status  Though Struthio camelus is listed as a species of ‚Äúleast concern‚Äù under the IUCN red list, wild ostrich populations are acknowledged to be in decline.

When Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works was re-established after bankruptcy on 18 November 1895, Bergroth was selected its first manager.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Laivatelakka osakeyhti√∂n√§. pp. 48‚Äì57. During his leadership, the company enlarged its premises and invested heavily on facilities and machinery. Considering the limited amount of capital and the market situation, Bergroth's management was successful. He left his position in 1900, but continued as board member after that. By the 1880s, city of Helsinki had become increasingly dissatisfied on Bergroth's old employer, the gas illumination company, which was unwilling to invest on new light technology and produced gas inefficiently by burning wood. In November 1899, the city took over the gas distribution; Bergroth was appointed to the board of the new City of Helsinki Illumination Works.  Tampere Linen and Iron Industry  In 1905, Bergroth became board member in Tampere Linen and Iron Industry company and in the following year he became chairman of board. The company underwent thorough renewal under Bergroth's chairmanship, and many of the changes were initiated by him. The company invested on new buildings and machinery for linen production, increasing both capacity and productivity. During the economic upswing prior to First World War, the company invested on production of various yarn types, canvas, sailcloth and plain weave for bedclothes. The investments continued also during the war, when new linen storage and weaving facility were built. Bergroth left the board in 1915.  Political career  Bergroth was member of Helsinki City Council in 1875‚Äì1877, 1880‚Äì1882 and 1897‚Äì1899. He represented Helsinki bourgeoisie in Diet of Finland in 1882 and 1899. Bergroth took part in number of state committees, Swedish-speaking technical association, voluntary fire brigade activities and charity work.  Personal life  In 1864, Bergroth married Lydia n√©e von Essen, daughter of professor Carl Gustaf von Essen and Catalina Sofia n√©e Arppe. Between 1865 and 1871, they had three daughters and four sons. After Lydia Bergroth's death in 1872, he was married to Evelina n√©e Bergroth, whose parents were vicar Carl Edvard Bergroth and Carolina Amalia n√©e Stenb√§ck. They had a son in 1876. In total, four of Bergroth's children survived until adult age.

It was the first and last military success of the Patriotes in the campaign of 1838. Eight hundred Patriotes gathered on a farm near Sainte-Martine, Quebec and fought off several attacks by Loyalist volunteers. After news of the defeat of Patriotes forces at the Battle of Odelltown spread, the massed Patriotes dispersed before the arrival of British troops. Background In 1837 the Russell Resolutions were made law by the British Parliament, imposing taxation without representation and rejecting all Patriotes reforms for Lower Canada. This led to a confrontation with the Soci√©t√© des Fils de la Libert√©, a paramilitary organization on November 6, 1837. A series of battles took place in the countryside around Montreal and the British crushed the initial rebellion, capturing many and forcing others, including Louis-Joseph Papineau to flee to the United States. The British burned many farms and placed the colony under martial law.Greenwood and Wright, pp. 12‚Äì14 From the United States a second campaign was planned, groups of Fr√®res Chasseurs were established all over the province to set up an underground military organization. On November 4, 1838, Robert Nelson, one of the leaders of the Fr√®res Chasseurs, declared the independence of Lower Canada at Napierville with him as head of the provisional government before a crowd of 1,000.Greenwood and Wright, p. 14Ouellet, Chapter 38 Though the area of Beauharnois did not participate in the rebellion in 1837, it had been readied during summer 1838 and was ready to rise after the harvest.Boissery, p. 102 Led by Joson Dumochelle, a farmer who was a member of the Fr√®res Chasseurs, a force of 400 men marched on a manor house owned by the British Member of Parliament Edward Ellice and seized it from his wife on November 3. On November 4, the group detained and disabled the steamboat Henry Brougham when it docked at Beauharnois.Greenwood and Wright, p. 15 The Ellice manor house and the steamboat were looted, with the owners left with promissory notes by the Patriotes.Boissery, p. 108 Camp Baker and battle Dumochelle took his force to the farm of an American landowner George Washington Baker near Sainte-Martine on November 7. There, along with those Patriotes under Doctor James Perrigo, they fortified the land where it met the Chateauguay River and the roads around the farm. Awaiting orders from Nelson, the number of Patriotes at Camp Baker grew to 800 of which three quarters were armed with guns. On November 8, the force came under attack by Loyalist volunteers from Huntingdon. Easily repulsed, the Patriotes grew disillusioned with the movement as news of defeat elsewhere filtered into the camp. On November 10, 250 men were sent to Saint-Timoth√©e to reinforce the Patriotes there. However, from Beauharnois, the force encountered volunteer troops. They were ordered to lay down their arms and return to their homes, which they did.Boissery, pp. 108‚Äì109 The camp disbanded after news of British troops closing on their position. Aftermath The Battle of Beauharnois took place on November 10, which the Patriotes lost, ending the rebellion. The South Glengarry Volunteers from Upper Canada and a company of the 71st Regiment took part in the Battle of Beauharnois and spent much of their time following the battle rooting out Patriotes in the region and looting and burning much of the countryside.Boissery, pp. 109‚Äì110 Dumochelle fled into the woods and reportedly died of starvation there.Boissery, p. 110 A report of damages done to the lands around Sainte-Martine claimed 35 houses, 19 barns, 45 sheds and stables burned and 376 families pillaged for a total of $146,181 in damages.Boiserry, p. 111 108 Patriotes were brought to trial of which 99 were sentenced to death. 12 were hanged, 58 deported to Australia, 2 banished and 22 sent home on a bond of good behavior.

Located just north of Knox College, Standish Park Arboretum has a collection of 137 trees of 67 different species. The park is used by the Galesburg community for many events such as the annual Art in the Park festival. Walkways criss-cross the park and along all four sides of its perimeter. A gazebo at the center serves as the focal point. Surrounding the Standish Park Arboretum are sites such as, to the south, Old Main (on the Knox College campus) which was the location of one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates (1858), the Knox County, Illinois Courthouse (erected in 1884-1886) to the east, and the Galesburg City Hall to the north. History Standish Park Arboretum was founded by Dr. John Van Ness Standish, direct descendant of Miles Standish of the Mayflower Colony, in 1873. Dr. Standish was a horticulture specialist and oversaw personally the plantings of 122 trees and 115 shrubs. He was involved with the establishment of the Galesburg Horticultural Society in 1873 and the Park Commission Board in 1876. He helped shape the policy of the park and transformed it into a park of exceeding beauty, available for visitors from near and far. He nurtured the park until his death in 1919. In 2003, Standish Park was designated an Arboretum by the Galesburg City Council. In the 1950s, Knox College classes in advanced taxonomy re-identified and tagged trees. In the 1970s, the Ray Brown Restoration Project set out to identify original trees and shrubs. They planted 37 trees and 6 shrubs in addition to their inventory work. In 1989, the SPRUCE committee (Standish Park Restoration Undertaking with Creative Enthusiasm) formed to replant and nurture Standish Park. As a result of their work, 38 trees and 3 shrubs were planted. In 2003, University of Illinois Extension Master Gardener volunteers re-identified the current inventory of trees and shrubs in Standish Park Arboretum. Subsequently, the inventory was also re-tagged and efforts are underway to encourage more visitors to the Arboretum.

He drew large crowds who believed that he was a holy man who could work miracles, although the authorities often viewed him with suspicion. In Brazil his devotees have conflated his identity with two other monks named Jo√£o Maria. Thousands people each year visit a cave in the state of Paran√°, Brazil, where he once lived. Early years (1801‚Äì43) Giovanni de Agostini was born into a noble family in 1801 in Sizzano, Piedmont, Italy. After his mother died in 1819, he made a pilgrimage to Rome, and then to France and Spain. He tried to become a monk, but was unable to accept the secluded life of the monastery. He decided to become an evangelist in America, and arrived in Caracas, Venezuela, in June 1838. He then travelled in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and finally Brazil. Brazil (1843‚Äì52) Agostini lived in Brazil from 1843 to 1852 under the name of Jo√£o Maria. He visited the cities of Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Curitiba, Florian√≥polis (then called Desterro) and Porto Alegre. In each place he obtained authorization from the bishop and president of the province to preach the gospel, before leaving for the interior to conduct his missionary work. Dressed in the habit of a Capuchin friar, he wore sandals and carried religious objects such as a Bible, medals of Our Lady and a staff. Agostini knew the Gospel well, had a good understanding of theology and was fluent in French and Latin. He gave apocalyptic sermons in which he condemned luxury and avarice, warned of the day of judgement and the torments of hell, and spoke of the possibilities of salvation. Like other Capuchins he established cruzeiros or sacred ways where the faithful could make penitential processions to reduce their debt to God. Agostini made rosaries and wooden crucifixes which he sold for cash or bartered in order to support his mission. He made medicines from herbs, roots, leaves and water from special sources. He gained a reputation as a saint who could perform miracles, and drew large crowds. During his stay in Rio Grande do Sul between 1846 and 1848 he was visited by crowds of patients and others curious to see him, including some who came from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. Although Jo√£o Maria was not a revolutionary, he tried to improve the condition of the peasants. He organized processions, built chapels, blessed cattle and baptized children. He cared for the sick, and his herbal teas became famous. The monk's cave in Monge State Park near Lapa, Paran√° There are records from 1844 of Jo√£o Maria going from Par√° to Rio de Janeiro, where he became famous as a healer and counselor. He moved to Sorocaba, S√£o Paulo, and continued to practice medicine and give advice. Jo√£o Maria left the city of S√£o Paulo and disappeared for a time before showing up in Rio Grande do Sul. Thousands of people came to him at Cerro Campestre, in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, drawn by word of the miraculous power of his waters. The authorities of Rio Grande do Sul analyzed the water and found it was potable but no different from any other water. He then continued through Santa Catarina and Paran√°, where he lived in a cave near Lapa in 1847. There he performed marriages, baptisms, healings and gave blessings to the local people. In 1848 Jo√£o Maria was deported to Santa Catarina, then to Rio de Janeiro, where he was lost from sight for a while. He met Father Joaquim Gomes de Oliveira e Paiva, deputy provincial of Santa Catarina, in February 1849 on Arvoredo Island. The father spoke highly of him, and perhaps as a result the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil gave him an audience and offered him gifts and favors which, as a mendicant, he could not use. The emperor's favor may have offered him protection, when charges were later laid against him of charlatanism, illegal medicine, false promises of cure and religious imposture. Later career (1853‚Äì1869) In 1852 Agostini moved to Monte Palma in Paraguay, now called El Cerro del Monje and now in the Misiones Province of Argentina. The next year he was in Buenos Aires, then crossed the Andes to Chile, where he lived from 1854 to 1856. He was in Bolivia in 1857, Peru in 1858, Mexico in 1859, Cuba in 1860 and Canada in 1861. Because he drew large crowds from time to time, the activities of this foreign religious leader often roused the suspicions of the authorities. Agostini reached the United States in 1861, and walked for almost to New Mexico. In 1867 he moved to a cave near the village of Las Vegas, although the residents warned him that the Indians were dangerous. He lived there for two years, sometimes coming down to the village to preach, treat the sick and catechize children. In April 1869 the villagers noted the absence of his fire, went up to his cave to investigate, and discovered that he had been killed. His murderer was never found. He had died on 17 April 1869 at the age of 69. Jo√£o Maria's tomb may still be seen in New Mexico. Legacy Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini inspired others who became mendicants in Brazil in the following decades, and was the first of the three \\"monks\\" named Jo√£o Maria in southern Brazil. Some widely distributed photographs with the legend \\"J√µao Maria de Agostinho Propheta\\" are actually pictures of a later monk, Jo√£o Maria de Jesus. Even now, some people believe that Jo√£o Maria still wanders in the region and works his miracles. There are many sites in the center and east of Paran√° and Santa Catarina, the south of S√£o Paulo and the north of Rio Grande do Sul, where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the \\"Jo√£o Marias\\" would have passed. The Monge State Park was created in Lapa in 1960. An important feature is the monk's cave, which is a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful people. It also includes a source of water that it considered to be miraculous. Hermit Peak, a mountain in San Miguel County, New Mexico, is named for him.

Early life  Alva C. Ellisor was born on April 26, 1892 in Galveston, Texas. At the age of eight, she survived the 1900 Great Galveston Hurricane. She had two infant brothers who were killed in the event. Being the valedictorian of her class, she later, in 1915, graduated as an honours student in Geology from the University of Texas, and was one of the two women who graduated in her field. After graduating, Ellisor held a teaching position in Ball High School. This was short-lived as she decided to go back to university and study in hopes of becoming a professor. At the same time Ellisor was studying, she was also doing research in the field of geology under the supervision of her instructors, Professor Francis L. Whitney and Professor Hal P. Bybee. One of her first research papers was published shortly after, in 1918, which consisted of numerous discoveries of her fossils. These same fossils were included in the Handbook of Texas Cretaceous Fossils, by W.S. Adkin (1928). The same year, Ellisor began working as a professor at the University of Kansas teaching geology and in 1919 was able to apply her experience while working for the Kansas Geological Survey.  Career  In 1920, Ellisor switched professions again and started working for the Humble Oil & Refining Company. She was specifically hired by Wallace Pratt to design a subsurface laboratory which works to show the development of petroleum and natural gas as well as other minerals. This is where she was really able to make a name for herself in the study of petroleum geology as well as making many firsts for women in geology. Ellisor created and opened the laboratory to focus on focusing on Tertiary and Cretaceous time periods. In just a few months after opening the laboratory, she made a major discovery of foraminifera in one of the company's wells at Goose Creek. Her study of foraminifera indicated Oligocene-aged coral reefs on the Damon Mound salt dome in Brazoria County. Some of her specimens are contained in the NPL‚Äôs Type Collection. She was one of the first to see the potential for using foraminifera to correlate rocks from drilling cores. These findings would be the basis of some of her most famous writing for years to come. Alva C. Ellisor became one of the first female stratigraphers, a leading economic micropaleontologist in the US, and has had a lasting impact in the field of geology as well as paving the way for many women in the field. When she was employed by the Humble Oil & Refining Company to work on a subsurface laboratory, she became the first woman to work on one for a company ‚Äì simultaneously she was able to aid in the creation of the Houston Geological Society. In her many journals with Joseph A. Cushman, they studied the foraminiferal fauna and discovered fifteen new species and seven new varieties. Despite her contributions, she was never credited for her discovery in foraminifera in Edgar Owen's The Trek of the Oil Finders, which exclusively credited J.A Udden, Edwin T. Dumble, Joseph A. Cushman, and Jesse J. Galloway. Yet, the four could only conclude their findings only by the research of Ellisor herself, as well as her co authors Esther Applin and Hedwig Kniker. Ellisor, along with Applin and Kniker all proposed the idea of using microfossils to locate and find petroleum. Alva C. Ellisor continued to be influential on her own, having her work published by many well known geology organizations in The United States. Of her many achievements, some of her greatest positions in science were being a fellow of the Geological Society of America and being the Vice President for the Houston Geological Society for two years. Ellisor spent over twenty years working for the Humble Oil & Refining Company until she retired in 1947. Ellisor engaged in acts of philanthropy throughout her career, donating money and her 3000 volume geologic library to the University of Texas. She passed away at the age of seventy-two on September 22, 1964 in Galveston, Texas.

He gained prominence covering World War II in Europe for NBC News. Throughout the war he provided eyewitness radio reports on major events, including the London Blitz, the Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, and the Normandy landings at Omaha Beach.  Early life  MacVane was born in Portland, Maine. He received a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1933 and a master's degree from Oxford University in 1935. Prior to World War II, he worked as a print journalist for the Brooklyn Eagle and the New York Sun. In 1938 he accepted a position as a sub-editor for the London Daily Express.  Career  MacVane began his career as a war correspondent reporting from France for the International News Service. He left the country in June 1940 shortly before its fall. He soon joined the newly-established NBC News division as a broadcast journalist and covered the London Blitz alongside Edward R. Murrow of CBS News. MacVane continued to work as a war correspondent throughout World War II. He was the only American correspondent to accompany Allied forces during the Dieppe Raid. He also accompanied the invasion fleet during the North African campaign in 1942. In 1944 he covered the Normandy landings, and was the first correspondent to land at Omaha Beach. He returned to London to broadcast the first full eyewitness report of the invasion. He was one of the first correspondents to enter Paris after its liberation. MacVane continued to report from the Western Front until the fall of Berlin, and witnessed the meeting of American and Soviet forces at the Elbe near the end of the war. In 1946 MacVane convinced NBC to open up a bureau at the United Nations. He left NBC in 1950 to serve as an adviser to the United States mission to the UN. Starting in 1953 he worked as the UN bureau chief for ABC News and remained at the network until his retirement in 1977. In his later career he moderated the television program United or Not? and was a contributor to ABC Evening News.

The principal concern about the IJA (and, as of 1942, its successor group, the National Lawyers Guild or NLG) was that it \\"constituted itself an agent of a foreign principal hostile to the interests of the United States.\\" History =Background= International Red Aid (Russian acronym \\"MOPR\\") HUAC's account of the IJA traced back to 1922, when the Communist International established the International Red Aid (Russian acronym \\"MOPR\\") to: > Render material and moral aid to the imprisoned victims of capitalism > Resolutions and Theses of the Fourth Congress of the Communist > International (London: Communist Party of Great Britain, 1922) p. 87 HUAC's translation: International Red Aid (MOPR) served to protect Comintern (\\"subversive\\") agents \\"whenever they ran into difficulties with the law of the various countries in which they were operating.\\" In 1925, MOPR had established an American section known as the International Labor Defense (ILD). The ILD functioned until 1946, when it merged into the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), deemed a \\"new subversive organization\\" by HUAC. According to HUAC, the International Juridical Association (IJA) formed in 1931 and \\"cooperated closely\\" with the ILD. =Establishment= Mahatma Gandhi. The IJA was the brainchild of Carol Weiss King, according to a biography by Ann Fagan Ginger. As Ginger recounts, King decided to take \\"a trip to Europe\\" and happened to choose Russia thanks to an ad for \\"12 thrilling days in the U.S.S.R\\" (The source happened to appear in the communist literary magazine New Masses. Ginger wrongly cites summer of 1932 for the ad's wording, which appeared in the April 1932 issue. However, a similar ad appeared in May 1931 with the lead \\"To the Soviet Union!\\" and itinerary therein that matches Ginger's account. ) In Moscow, King met American Harry Shapiro, a Harvard Law School graduate, with whom she discussed the ILD and its \\"Soviet counterpart,\\" the MOPR. \\"Shapiro urged King to help organize a new association of lawyers\\" in the States to \\"fight repression on many fronts\\" as most MOPR national sections were illegal. He gave her names in Berlin to look up. (Ginger's \\"trip\\" narration follows that of the NLG. ) Alfred Apfel, second from left, in front of Berlin prison (1932) In Berlin, she met with Dr. :de:Alfred Apfel, head of a new group called the \\"International Juridical Association\\". The IJA already had sections in Germany, France, and Austria. Sections fell under an \\"Organizing Committee\\" \\"International Juridical Association,\\" headed by Apfel. Their purpose was to defend civil liberties and labor unions. (The IJA expanded to Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Netherlands, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Venezuela. Members included Mahatma Gandhi. ) A similar brief account of Apfel, Weiss, and formation of the American section of the IJA appears in The Red Angel: The Life and Times of Elaine Black Yoneda. Upon her return to the states, she rented offices for the American section of the IJA in the St. Denis Building at 80 E 11th Street, New York NY 10003. Ginger stated: > Within a few months, she had forty-nine names from twenty states to put on > the letterhead, including not only the customary East Coast liberal names > but writer Sherwood Anderson from Virginia, and two each from Tennessee and > Louisiana, one each from Canada and Puerto Rico. Funding ran short, so she moved the IJA's offices into her own at 100 Fifth Avenue. (King's biography in The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law states only that she came back from Moscow and Berlin to found the International Juridical Association Bulletin. ) A HUAC report stated that George Anderson had helped found the IJA: > George Andersen helped to found a \\"legal bureau\\" established in response to > this directive in the United States in the early 1930s under the name of the > International Juridical Association. He served on the national committee of > this Communist-controlled offshoot of the International Labor Defense in > 1942. In the same year, he was legal adviser for the Committee for > Citizenship Rights, which was intended to protect Communist subversion from > any penalties under the law. The report also carefully notes that Anderson was an NGL member, too. (Both HUAC reports document the close association of the IJA and NLG with the \\"American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born (1934‚Äì1952).\\") =Merger into NLG= According to report by HUAC on the NLG, the IJA \\"quietly disappeared from the American scene in the early 1940s\\" and merged into the NLG. As proof points, HUAC stated that the December 1942 issue of the International Juridical Association Monthly Bulletin announced the journal's merger into NLG's Lawyers Guild Review. The December 1942 issue also announced that its writers move to the board of editors of the Lawyers Guild Review and take primary responsibility for the material in its \\"IJA section.\\". (A Catalogue of the Law Collection at New York University: With Selected Annotations confirms absorption by 1943. ) Issues championed =Approach= From inception, King felt the mission of American branch of the IJA was to champion \\"civil liberties and labor law problems.\\" She was very careful in envisioning how it would operate: > It would not compete with the existing defense groups ‚Äì the ACLU, the ILD, > and the NAACP; on the contrary, it would assist them in their legal defense > work. Building on the European models, she planned a legal research group > that would hold forums on current legal problems, draft new social > legislation, write briefs in pending cases, and publish a monthly legal > bulletin on labor and civil rights law. In 1932, the IJA bulletin announced further that it would support \\"human rights.\\" =Activities= In 1931, the IJA championed was that of Euel Lee AKA \\"Orphan Jones\\" (defended by Bernard Ades when King filed papers with the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. Then, the IJA's bulletin wrote a defense of communist August Yokinen against his deportation by the U.S. Government (which followed the Yokinen Show Trial of March 1931). In 1932, the IJA championed the Scottsboro Boys case before the U.S. Supreme Court by recommending the ILD's Walter Pollak as attorney. Further, it raised two constitutional issues: first, the right to counsel (denied to defendants, it argued) and, second, the right to trial by peers (since fellow African-Americans had been excluded from the jury). In May 1932, King represented the IJA with a delegation of attorneys from Johns Hopkins University and the Union Theological Seminary to investigate violent strikes in Bell County, Kentucky. Following the July 1932 arrest of Angelo Herndon in Atlanta, the IJA bulletin began covering the case, after which King helped research the case when the ILD requested help from the IJA. In the fall of 1932, IJA members King and Brodsky among others supported the presidential candidacy of CPUSA leaders William Z. Foster and James W. Ford. Also in 1932, the IJA began to champion the right of foreigners against deportation by the U.S. Government, starting with its reaction against the Dies Deportation Bill of 1932. In June 1932, U.S. Rep. Fiorello H. La Guardia (20th) introduced an anti-deportation bill based on the IJA's recommendations. In November 1932, the IJA experienced some success when the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the Scottsboro Boys case. In December 1932, King telegrammed President Herbert Hoover and then joined a CPUSA-led Hunger March on Washington (which followed a similar march in the UK earlier that fall). In 1933, King sent a letter of protest to the German embassy regarding the arrest of Apfel by the new Nazi government. The IJA Monthly Bulletin noted his arrest and death, stating that he had been tortured. The IJA helped organize an international campaign for the Nazi government to release Georgi Dimitrov after acquittal for his role in the Reichstag Fire. During that year, King, Nathan Greene, and other IJA members supported the labor cases of Abe Isserman and others by researching and writing complaints and briefs. The IJA responded to a request by defense lawyer Benjamin J. Davis Jr., the IJA agreed to review the brief of Angelo Herndon. In 1934, King wrote an argument in the IJA bulletin on how to raise constitutional issues during state criminal cases. The IJA then made recommendations in the Angelo Herndon case. They organized to have Columbia University law professor Herbert Wechsler and Whitney North Seymour, former U.S. assistant solicitor general (1931‚Äì1931) write briefs. The IJA organized a luncheon in ohonor of Dr. Kurt Rosenfeld, former Prussian Minister of Justice, then in exile from Nazi Germany. In May 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against appeal on the Angelo Herndon case. In June 1937, members of the IJA attended an ILD national conference in Washington, DC, to review the Memorial Day massacre of 1937. In 1939, the IJA supported the United Shoe Workers-CIO against Bata Shoes Company, which had come under Nazi control in 1938. =Victories= Bust of Harry Bridges at the University of Washington As it folded into the NLG, the IJA counted victories in the following cases: * Scottsboro Boys * Angelo Herndon * Harry Bridges * Strecker * De Jonge v. Oregon (1937) * NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. (1937) * Senn v. Tile Layers (1937) * Hague v. CIO (1939) * Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader (1940) The IJA supported the successful release of Tom Mooney, Warren Billings, and George Dimitrov. The IJA supported acts of the U.S. Congress, including: Social Security Act, Wagner Labor Relations Act, Norris-LaGuardia Anti-Injunction Act, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Fair Labor Standards Act. The IJA also supported Executive Order 8802, which forbids racial discrimination in defense industries. Organization =Constitution= The first issue of the IJA's Monthly Bulletin contained the preamble of its constitution: > PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN SECTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL > JURIDICAL ASSOCIATION > The American Section of the International Juridical Association subscribes > to the declaration of principles of the International Juridical Association. > Present America offers the example of a country discarding traditions of > liberty and freedom, and substituting legislative, administrate and judicial > tyranny.

Brodsky, Thomas I. Emerson, Robert L. Hale, Robert W. Kenny, Carol Weiss King, Shad Polier, and Lee Pressman. (On September 17, 1950, Lowenthal testified before HUAC that the National Lawyers Guild included the following members: John J. Abt, Joseph R. Brodsky, Bartley C. Crum, Thomas I. Emerson, Robert W. Kenny, Carol Weiss King, Shad Polier, Martin Popper, and Allan Rosenberg.) Further, according to the 1950 and 1959 HUAC reports, other IJA members who were both later \\"leaders\\" of the NLG and actively associated with the ILD included: * Alger Hiss * Osmond K.

Criticism: Communism Chairman Dies of HUAC proofs letter replying to FDR (1938) In 1939, the Dies Committee began investigating the IJA as part of its investigation into the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). HUAC characterized IJA as \\"Another early front for [communist] lawyers was the International Juridical Association ... and its members were closely interlocked with the International Labor Defense as well as the National Lawyers Guild (NLG). Among its prominent members was Alger Hiss.\\" It saw the IJA as active defender of Communists in various kinds of lawsuits; it ascertained a pattern of that \\"consistently followed the Communist Party line.\\" As early as a report of March 29, 1944, HUAC had considered the IJA a communist \\"front.\\" In its 1950 report on the NLG (which includes a brief description of the IJA), HUAC cited the \\"New York City Council Committee Investigating the Municipal Civil Service Committee\\" (1940‚Äì1941), which (according to HUAC) stated: > The bulletins of the International Juridical Association from its very > inception show that it is devoted to the defense of the Communist Party, > Communists, and radical agitators and that it is not limited merely to legal > research but to sharp criticism of existing governmental agencies and > defense of subversive groups. HUAC noted that \\"examination of the [IJA monthly] bulletin reveals consistent support of Communist legal cases during its entire career.\\" In a footnote in his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers notes: > In the early 1930s, Hiss had been a member of the International Juridical > Association, of which the late Carol [Weiss] King, a habitual attorney for > Communists in trouble, was a moving spirit. The International Juridical > Association has been cited as subversive by the Attorney General. Also among > its members: Lee Pressman, Abraham Isserman (one of the attorneys for the > eleven convicted Communist leaders), Max Loewenthal (sic: should read \\"Max > Lowenthal\\"), author of a recent book attacking the F.B.I. Publications =Monthly bulletin= Throughout, the IJA published the International Juridical Association Monthly Bulletin, edited by Joseph Kovner and Nathan Greene (AKA \\"Nuddy\\" Greene). One of the main functions of the bulletin was to mention and cover \\"little cases\\" around the country, which made the bulletin a de facto newspaper of record for such. HUAC's 1950 report on the NLG noted regarding the IJA that \\"examination of the bulletin reveals consistent support of Communist legal cases during its entire career. According to the Encyclopedia of the American Left, the IJA Bulletin was \\"widely considered the law journal of the Left.\\" Early content included the following: * 1931: Enjoining Free Speech: Review of a number of labor injunction cases (June 1931) * 1932: The Hosiery Workers Injunction at Nazareth, PA: Decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court; dissenting opinion by Justice Maxey (January 1932) \\"The bulletins go free to a mailing list of about 350 persons and organizations.\\" =Archived collections= Thomas Jefferson Building There appears to be no online source for a digitized (OCR) collection of the bulletin. The Tamiment Library, whose archives include those of the Communist Party of the USA, has no single collection listed only of the IJA's monthly bulletin, although issues and mention appear in scores of other collections of personal papers, photographs, etc. According to WorldCat, libraries with full or partial archives include: * Washington area: ** Library of Congress ** George Washington University Law Library - Jacob Burns Law Library ** University of Virginia - Arthur J.

Biography  Halperin has since 1970 been involved in the music of Lennie Tristano, and he got lessons with Tristano selv and Sal Mosca at a young age. The first recordings in 1986 he did within the Warne Marsh Quintet (Back Home at the label CrissCross). Since 1982, Halperin worked with bassist Dominic Duval and the first joint recordings were made until 2003. In 1997 Halperin released his debut album under his own name on the label Zinnia: a Tristano dedicated duet with Sal Mosca (Psalm). In 1998 he joined the Thomas Andersen Quintet (NorCD), and in 2001, he participated in a trio with bassist Don Messina and drummer Bill Chattin at Cadence Jazz Records. At this time he also worked at CIMP as a session musician with Duval and Jay Rosen. In 2003 the result of closer cooperation in CIMP-was released on the album Joy And Gravitas, with interpretations of Jazz Standards, i.e. \\"A Night in Tunisia\\", \\"Love for Sale\\", \\"My Funny Valentine\\", \\"Don't Explain\\", \\"Naima\\" og \\"Round Midnight!, followed by the Duo album Monkinus by Halperin and Duval on the label CIMP.

The L Street Brownies are a polar bear club based in South Boston, Massachusetts. Organized in 1902, it is one of the oldest such clubs in the United States. Although the Brownies swim year round, they are best known for their annual New Year's Day plunge in Dorchester Bay.  History  Winter swimming in South Boston began in the 19th century, by some accounts as early as 1865. The practice was likely introduced by European immigrants, who believed that cold water plunges followed by saunas or steam baths were good for one's health. Swimmers who came regularly to the L Street Bathhouse in South Boston usually swam nude or with minimal clothing, and became known as the \\"Brownies\\" because of the deep tans they acquired from daily exposure to the sun. The Brownies claimed that swimming and tanning were beneficial to the heart, skin, and circulation, and credited the practice with miraculous cures. The belief that winter swimming strengthens the immune system has persisted into the 21st century. = Founding = L Street Brownies by George Luks, 1922. The club was officially organized in 1902, and began accepting women members in 1915. Although the club itself is older than the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, which was founded in 1903, its first documented New Year's Day swim did not take place until 1904, when a photographer took a picture of the event. For this reason, the title of \\"oldest polar bear club in the United States\\" is generally given to the Coney Island club. The New Year's Day swim became an annual tradition that continues to this day. Each year hundreds of people join the L Street Brownies in their New Year's Day swim, accompanied by spectators and reporters. Traditionally, the most dedicated Brownies swam every day of the year, rain or shine. The daily ritual was so important to them that in 1913, according to the Boston Globe, it was \\"not unusual at L St, after an extremely cold night\\", when the bay was covered with ice, \\"to see a naked bather plodding through the snow armed with a hatchet or ax for the purpose of cutting out a space large enough for a dip.\\" One such member, Richard Pinkson, had reportedly been an L Street Brownie for 64 years when he died in 1955. Over the years, regular participation in year-round swimming gradually declined. In 2013, a group of young people called the L Street Ice Swimmers revived the tradition, and in 2015 their group was officially incorporated. Calling themselves \\"the next generation of the L Street Brownies\\", members swim several times a week throughout the year. Their motto is \\"We'll be here 'til L freezes over.\\" = The L Street Bathhouse = L Street Bathhouse, 1970s The L Street Bathhouse stands at L Street and Day Boulevard in South Boston, facing Carson Beach (or the L Street Beach, as that part of the beach is sometimes called). The original bathhouse was one of several built by the city in 1866 to enable poor immigrants, who lived in tenements with no indoor plumbing, to bathe regularly. The motto \\"Cleanliness of Body Is Next to Godliness\\" was inscribed above the building's entrance. The bathhouse was rebuilt by Mayor Curley in 1931, and is officially known as the Curley Community Center. In the 1970s, during Kevin White's administration, the women's half of the bathhouse was converted into temporary classrooms. Under Mayor Raymond Flynn, the whole building was renovated and turned into a fitness center, and women were once again allowed to join. = The Boston Light Swim = The L Street Brownies organized many swimming and rowing competitions, including annual swimming races on Christmas Day. The most popular race, however, took place in the summer: a 10-mile swim to Boston Light, a lighthouse on Little Brewster Island in outer Boston Harbor. The original course began at the Charlestown Bridge, ran east of Governor's Island, west of Long Island, west of Georges Island, and finished at the lighthouse. Known as the \\"Boston Light\\", the race drew thousands of spectators each year and attracted national publicity until the onset of World War II, when it was discontinued. Since then, the race has been revived several times. The new course starts at Boston Light and ends at the L Street Bathhouse, covering a distance of 8 miles. Peter S. McNally, a world champion long- distance swimmer, made the first recorded attempt to swim Boston Light in 1898. In 1907, during Old Home Week, three more men attempted the swim: Samuel Richards, Commodore Alfred Brown, and Louis Jacot. Richards and Brown dropped out, making Jacot the first winner of the Boston Light, despite not actually reaching the lighthouse finish line. Richards went on to win the competition in 1911 and 1912, and in 1913 made headlines when he swam from the Charlestown Bridge to Boston Light and back, a distance of approximately 24 miles, in 13 hours and 9 minutes. In 1909, the Austrian-born Alois Anderl√© swam to Boston Light in 5 hours and 38 minutes, completing the last half mile in a severe thunderstorm. He was later disqualified because his navigator had steered him over Nix's Mate, a small island which was barely submerged at the time, forcing him to walk the short distance across it. The following year, 15-year- old Rose Pitonof of Dorchester completed the course in 6 hours and 50 minutes, defeating seven men. Her father and brother navigated her over an irregular course that stretched the distance to 12 or 13 miles through choppy, frigid waters. By the time she finished, cold and fatigue had forced all the other contestants to drop out. The Bavarian-born Charlie Toth, a waiter at the Westminster Hotel near Copley Square, won the Boston Light in 1914, completing the course in 6 hours and 48 minutes. He won again in 1916 and 1921. In 1915, Toth swam from Charlestown to Graves Light and on to Revere Beach, a distance of about 24 miles, in 12 hours and 49 minutes. Toth held the American endurance record for a time, and famously trained for his English Channel swim in 1923 by towing a rowboat full of passengers. Other notable Boston Light competitors have included James J. Doty (for whom the Doty Memorial Mile Swim is named), Olympic swimmer Marian Gilman, Eva Morrison, and Henry Sullivan. The Boston Light Swim is now organized and sponsored independently of the L Street Brownies.  Notable members  * Michael T.

It did not reach production. Design and development The Nieuport-Delage NiD 540 was an all- metal aircraft. It had a two part, high, cantilever wing; each half-wing was trapezoidal in plan with blunted tips and which tapered uniformly outwards in thickness from below, providing some dihedral. The half-wings were linked by a centre-section built into and the same width as the upper fuselage. High aspect ratio ailerons filled most of the trailing edges. Structurally the half-wings were in three parts, a spanwise box and separate leading and trailing edges, all covered in Duralumin. The NiD 540's engine was in the nose. Its first flight, made early in 1930 by Lasne, was powered by a Renault 12Ki V-12 engine, identifiable by a short, upright exhaust stub, geared down and driving a three blade propeller. By the time of the Paris Salon exhibition in November 1930 it had a Lorraine 12Fad Courlis W-12 engine with a two blade propeller and from April 1931 a Lorraine Petrel V12. Behind the engine, the fuselage, rectangular in section apart from a curved roof, was in two parts. The central section, which mounted the wing and held both crew and passengers, was built from riveted frames and was metal skinned, with a corrugated floor. The enclosed and multi-panel glazed cockpit had side-by-side seating with dual control and was just forward of the wing leading edge. The NiD 540's passenger cabin seated eight, each with their own large window, and was entered by a portside door at its rear. The rear section of the fuselage began immediately behind the door and was constructed from four longerons, tapering to the tail and fabric covered. The NiD 540 had an angular empennage, with its straight- tapered tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage carrying narrow elevators. The square-topped fin had a more generous rudder hinged behind the elevators. Earlier, unbuilt designs of the NiD 540 were shown with curved tail shapes. The landing gear was fixed and conventional, with each mainwheel, fitted with brakes, on a hinged faired V-strut from the side of the fuselage. A tall, faired landing leg with a Messier shock absorber was attached to the wing root. The track was . Its tailwheel also had a shock absorber. There were several design studies of variants but the only one which may have been completed was the NiD 541. Rosenthal suggests it was and had a Lorraine 14Ae Antar√®s fourteen cylinder radial engine. Flight, on the other hand, associates this name with the Courlis-engined example on display at the 1930 Salon. Les Ailes makes it clear that the Courlis and the Antares were options in 1930. No images of the radial-engined variant seem to have survived. Rather little is known of the activities of the NiD 540 after its first flight apart from the various engine changes. A period of official evaluation of these continued until May 1933. It remained active until at least 1935, when it took part in October in the annual tour of French prototypes organised by the French Aeronautical Federation.

Yazid initially refused to bury her and was so affected by her death he refused to see anyone for a week. He neglected his duties and died not long after. Yazid's great love for her and sorrow at her death resulted in his name coming in disrepute for centuries before he was rehabilitated, and his neglect of state affairs and religion caused Hababah to be considered as an enemy of God.

The minimum age at marriage was set in the 1811 Civil Code, amended in 1838. Same sex marriage was allowed in 2001. The first Family Allowance Act was introduced in 1941, and provided benefits only to working families with more than two children. In 1947, the income dependency was abolished and wage earners were also entitled to an allowance for their first and second children under 18 years old. In 1963, family allowances were extended to self-employed people. Currently, all families living in the Netherlands are entitled to a family allowance if their child (biological, adopted, step or foster) is younger than 18 years old. In 1956, the Netherlands passed the Nursery Education Act that funded preschool; however, in 1981, preschool was added to the standard education system. The Childcare Act of 2005 gave childcare an official framework which provided funding and supervision for many programs. Marriage Marriage in the Netherlands has very few rules that have changed throughout history. The first rule was set in the 1811 Civil Code which stated that the groom must be at least 18 years of age and the bride must be at least 15 years of age.Van de Brekel, J.C., van de Kaa, D.J. (1994). The Netherlands: aspects of family policy in the setting of the Second Demographic Trainsition. In W. Dumon (ed.) Changing Family Policies In the Member States of the European Union. Brussels.pp. 225-54. This was changed in 1838 when brides were made to be at least 16 years of age and grooms still 18. Recent additions to the Civil Code have changed the brides' age to 18, along with the grooms' age of 18.\\"Dutch Civil Codes.\\" Dutch Civil Law. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Nov. 2016. These Civil Codes also added to the laws that in order to be married in the Netherlands, one partner must be Dutch or currently living in the Netherlands. Along with this law was the provision of relatives marrying; however, it only applies to brother-sister, parent-child, and grandparent-grandchild. Pre-2001, the Civil Code did not explicitly address same-sex marriage. In 2001, a law was created that allowed same-sex marriage in the Netherlands.Waaldijk, K. (2005). Major legal consequences of marriage, cohabitation, and registered partnership for different-sex and same-sex partners in the Netherlands. In: K. Waaldijk (eds.), more or less together: levels of legal consequences of marriage, cohabitation and registered countries. Paris: Institut National d‚ÄôEtudes D√©mographiques, pp. 137-154. Family provisions In 1941, the Family Allowance Act was created in order to support families in hard times; however, this act only applied to working families with three or more children.Th√©venon, O. (2011). Family Policies in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis. Population and Development Review (March). 37, 1: 57‚Äî87. This was because it was assumed that an average salary was enough to support a family with two children. In addition to this, the children had to be dependent on the parent and once the child turned 15, the benefits no longer applied. In 1947, working families were allowed benefits from all children if they were under the age of 18 years old; in 1963, benefits were extended to self- employed families as well.Hantrais, L., Letablier, M-T. (1996). Families and family policies in Europe. Addison Wesley. Family allowance is broken down based on the age of the child in euros per month (EpM): 0-6=191.65 EpM, 6-12=232.71 EpM, 12-18=273.78 EpM.Statistics Netherlands (2014).

If a child is earning more than 1,266 euros per quarter or is receiving study benefits, the family can not receive benefits for them. Additionally, a family is only allowed benefits for 16 and 17-year-olds if they are actively participating in an education program to receive a VMBO, HAVO, or VWO. These rules change slightly given different situations such as disability, single- parent families, and other special circumstances. Childcare In 1956, the Netherlands passed the Nursery Education Act that funded preschool; however, in 1981, preschool was added to the standard education system.OECD (2011). Doing Better for Families. Paris, OECD. Four-year-olds were allowed to be enrolled in school but it was not mandatory; school became mandatory once the child reached five years old. If a child has the possibility of a language disadvantage, mainly for immigrant children, they can be enrolled as young as two years old in order to catch them up before primary school started.Selton, Wieke, and Anne H. Gauthier. \\"Family Policies: Netherlands.\\" Perfar. European Commission, 2014. Web. 20 Nov. 2016. Daycare and after-school care have policies dating back to the 1970s in the Netherlands.

Welfare regimes, family-suportive policies, and women's employment along the life-course. American Journal of Sociology. 106, 6: 1731‚Äî60. Today, the system is mixed of formal, informal, public, and private care. The Childcare Act of 2005 gave childcare an official framework and provided funding and supervision for many programs. In 2010, the act was amended and renamed to the \\"Childcare and Quality Standards for Playgroups Act\\".

Mukhariq entered the court circles after Ibrahim sent him to entertain the powerful Barmakids with some of Ibrahim's newest compositions. The Barmakids were so enthusiastic about his performance, that Ibrahim made a gift of him to al-Fadl ibn Yahya al-Barmaki, who then gifted him to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786‚Äì809). The Caliph was also impressed by Mukhariq, granting him his freedom and showing him his favour by gifts and tokens of esteem, such as allowing him to sit on the same seat as he, or disposing of the curtain that usually separated the court musicians from the caliphal presence. Mukhariq continued to enjoy caliphal favour by Harun's heirs until his death in 844/5. Following the death of his erstwhile master Ibrahim al-Mawsili, and Ibn Jami, by the time of al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833) Mukhariq was easily the most pre-eminent singer of his day, rivalling as a musician the Abbasid prince Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, Ishaq al- Mawsili (son of Ibrahim), and Alluya. Mukhariq ascribed to a school, begun by Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi and much in vogue at the time, whereby he altered the notes or the rhythm of a song at every performance. This reportedly disappointed Caliph al-Wathiq (r. 842‚Äì847), who was himself a composer, when he was asked to perform one of the Caliph's compositions. Later authors in the Kitab al-Aghani and the Iqd al-farid rejected this school, and considered it to have caused the loss of traditional Arabic music. Despite such criticism, Mukhariq enjoyed a firm reputation as one of the best singers of his time, with the quality of his voice being known to captivate audiences. According to the 15th-century historian Ibn al-Taghribirdi, for instance, while Ibrahim and Ishaq al-Mawsili \\"sang well to the accompaniment of the lute, in pure vocal work Mukhariq outshone them both\\". Such was his eminence that the 10th-century scholar al-Farabi only mentions two musicians of the entire Abbasid period, Muhkariq and Ishaq al-Mawsili. Mukhariq himself had several pupils, the best known being Ahmad ibn Abdallah Abi'l-Ala, and Hamdun ibn Isma'il ibn Dawud al- Katib, the patriarch of a family of musicians.

Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944), was a much cited 1944 decision of the United States Supreme Court dealing with fraud on the Patent Office.. A widely quoted statement in the Court's opinion is: \\"The public welfare demands that the agencies of public justice be not so impotent that they must always be mute and helpless victims of deception and fraud.\\"322 U.S. at 246. Although the fraud occurred in the late 1920s, the facts became public only much later in the Government's antitrust trial in United States v. Hartford-Empire Co.. Background The Hartford gob feeder fraudulently patented in this case (U.S. Pat. No. 1,655,391 In 1926 Hartford had a pending Peiler patent application on a \\"gob feeder\\" glass-making machine. The Patent Office confronted Hartford with \\"apparently insurmountable opposition.\\" To help persuade the Office to grant the application, Hartford's patent attorney R.F. Hatch \\"ghost-wrote\\" a trade journal article for a union official, Clarke, praising the invention as a revolutionary advance, and paying him to sign it. Hartford's patent attorneys Brown and Dorsey brought the published article to the attention of the Patent Office. The Office then issued the patent (U.S. Patent No. 1,655,391), in 1928. Hartford then sued Hazel for infringing the patent. The district court dismissed the bill, however, on the ground that no infringement had been proved. The court considered the patent to be at best only a slight improvement in a well-developed art (automatic feeders for mechanical glass bottle blowing), accordingly held that the claims were not entitled to a broad construction and that, with the Peiler patent so construed, Hazel had not infringed. Hartford appealed to the Third Circuit; its patent attorneys, including the one who \\"had played a part in getting the spurious article prepared for publication,\\" for the first time focused the court's attention on the article. The court's opinion quoted copiously from the article and reversed the district court, holding the patent valid and infringed. 322 U.S. at 240‚Äì41. In contrast to the district court, the Third Circuit considered the patent to be a pioneer (as Clarke maintained), so that the claims were entitled to a broad construction. Therefore, with the patent claims so construed, the Third Circuit held that Hazel infringed a valid patent.59 F.2d at 413. During trial in the district court in 1929, Hazel had received hearsay information that both Clarke and one of Hartford's lawyers had, several years previously, admitted that a Hartford lawyer was the true author of the spurious publication. Hazel did not at that time attempt to verify the truth of the hearsay story of the article's authorship, but relied upon other defenses, which proved successful in the district court. After the opinion of the Third Circuit in 1932, quoting the spurious article and reversing the decree of the district court, Hazel hired private investigators for the purpose of verifying the hearsay by admissible evidence. One of the PIs interviewed Clarke twice. In each interview, Clarke insisted that he wrote the article, and would so swear if summoned to court. In the second interview, the investigator asked Clarke to sign a statement telling in detail how the article was prepared, and further asked to see Clarke's files. Clarke replied that he would not \\"stultify\\" himself by signing any \\"statement or affidavit;\\" and that he would show the records to no one unless compelled by a subpoena. At the same time, he reinforced his claim of authorship by asserting that he had spent seven weeks in preparing the article. Unknown to Hazel, a Hartford representative had gone to visit Clarke. Hazel's PI reported failure, but Hartford's man reported \\"very successful results,\\" that Hartford was in a \\"most satisfactory position\\" in the matter, and that Clarke had signed an affidavit for him stating that Clarke had \\"signed the article and released it for publication.\\" Hazel then capitulated in the patent infringement litigation and settled with Hartford for $1 million, and the parties entered into a cross-licensing agreement.This agreement was part of the glass bottle cartel arrangement involved in the Government antitrust suit described in the Wikipedia article Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States. Hartford's representative then went back to Clarke, who asked for $10,000; they negotiated (Hartford initially said $$10,000 was too much) but Hartford eventually paid him the full $10,000. These facts came out during the Government's Hartford-Empire trial in 1941. 322 U.S. at 241‚Äì43. Renewed Third Circuit review Hazel then filed in the Third Circuit a petition for leave to file a somewhat belated bill of review in the district court to set aside the 1932 judgment which that court entered against Hazel pursuant to the Third Circuit's mandate overturning the district court's judgment of non- infringement. Hazel contended that the Third Circuit's appellate judgment had been obtained by fraud. The Third Circuit decided that because the alleged fraud had been perpetrated on it, rather than on the district court, it should decide the case instead of having the district court consider a bill of review. The Third Circuit considered the evidence of how Hartford's patent attorneys wrote the article for Clarke, had it published, and then presented it to the Patent Office. It concluded, however, that \\"sordid as is the story concerning the genesis of the Clarke article and the deceptive design and use of its spurious authorship, still it does not qualify as after-discovered evidence\\" in Hartford's infringement suit against Hazel. The court pointed to Hazel's knowledge of the hearsay during the trial in 1929. \\"Although then so informed, counsel for Hazel-Atlas deliberately chose not to go into the matter of the article's real authorship, fearing that if they should refer to the article (which was not in evidence), they might thereby call attention to the statements therein contained as to the increased production from gob feeders as compared with stream feeders, which could not be successfully refuted.\\" The Third Circuit also emphasized that although the authorship of the article had been falsified, it was not shown that its factual assertions were false. Therefore, the fraud was not \\"material.\\" Accordingly, \\"In the situation shown, it is not possible for us to say that the Clarke article was so basic to this court's decision in the Hazel-Atlas case that, upon the showing of fraud in the article's authorship, we would be justified in setting aside the order[].\\"137 F.2d at 768‚Äì69. The Third Circuit also held that it lacked power to set aside its 1932 of infringement and must dismiss the case: > [This court lost] the only jurisdiction it ever had over the decrees in > those cases, appropriate mandates duly issued and the terms at which the > final orders on the appeals were entered expired long prior to the filing of > the instant petitions without action having been taken to extend this > court's grasp. In that situation there is nothing from which the > jurisdiction of this court can be deemed to have been continued.137 F.2d at > 769. Ruling of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the Court Hazel sought further review in the Supreme Court, which reversed in a 5-4 opinion that Justice Hugo Black delivered for the Court. Four justices dissented on procedural grounds, believing that the case should have been decided in the district court rather than the court of appeals. =Majority opinion= The Court rejected each of the three reasons that the Third Circuit gave for denying the petition. First, the general rule that federal courts will not alter or set aside their judgments after the expiration of the term at which the judgments were finally entered is not inviolable. \\"From the beginning, there has existed alongside the term rule a rule of equity to the effect that, under certain circumstances, one of which is after-discovered fraud, relief will be granted against judgments regardless of the term of their entry\\" and \\"where the situation has required, the court has, in some manner, devitalized the judgment even though the term at which it was entered had long since passed away.\\" The Court condemned Hartford's conduct as \\"a deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme to defraud not only the Patent Office, but the Circuit Court of Appeals.\\" 322 U.S. 244-45. Next, because of public policy, the Court rejected the Third Circuit's condonation of Hartford's fraud on the grounds of Hazel's failure to exercise sufficient diligence: > This matter does not concern only private parties. There are issues of great > moment to the public in a patent suit. Furthermore, tampering with the > administration of justice in the manner indisputably shown here involves far > more than an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong against the > institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public, institutions in > which fraud cannot complacently be tolerated consistently with the good > order of society. Surely it cannot be that preservation of the integrity of > the judicial process must always wait upon the diligence of litigants. The > public welfare demands that the agencies of public justice be not so > impotent that they must always be mute and helpless victims of deception and > fraud.322 U.S. at 246 (citations omitted). Third, the Court challenged the Third Circuit's argument that the fraudulent conduct was not \\"basic‚Äô to the 1932 decision and the factual allegations in the article were actually true. Hartford persuaded the court of appeals to reverse the district court's judgment on the basis of the article, and is therefore estopped from claiming it was not effective. Moreover: \\"The article, even if true, should have stood or fallen under the only title it could honestly have been given‚Äîthat of a brief in behalf of Hartford, prepared by Hartford's agents, attorneys, and collaborators.\\" 322 U.S. 246-47. Hartford had conceded that the district court has the power, upon proper proof of fraud, to set aside its 1932 decree in a bill of review proceeding, but nevertheless denied that the court of appeals possesses a similar power, for the reason that the term during which its 1932 judgment was entered had expired.322 U.S. at 247-48. The Court disagreed and held that the court of appeals had \\"both the duty and the power to vacate its own judgment and to give the district court appropriate directions\\" to set aside its judgment entered pursuant to the Third Circuit's previous mandate and to reinstate its original judgment denying relief to Hartford.322 U.S. at 250-51. =Dissenting opinion= Owen J. Roberts delivered the majority opinion In dissent, Justice Owen Roberts conceded: \\"No fraud is more odious than an attempt to subvert the administration of justice. The court is unanimous in condemning the transaction disclosed by this record. Our problem is how best the wrong should be righted and the wrongdoers pursued.\\" 322 U.S. at 251. He then summarized the majority holding, with which he disagreed only on procedural grounds, as follows: > (1) That the court below has power at this date to deal with the matter > either as a new suit or as a continuation of the old one; (2) that it can > recall the case from the District Court; (3) that it can grant relief; (4) > that it can hear evidence and act as a court of first instance or a trial > court; (5) that such a trial as it affords need not be according to the > ordinary course of trial of facts in open court, by examination and cross- > examination of witnesses, but that the proofs may consist merely of ex parte > affidavits, and (6) that such a trial has already been afforded, and it > remains only, in effect, to cancel Hartford's patent.322 U.S. at 254. Roberts said the court of appeals lacked power to operate in this manner once the time to correct an erroneous judgment has passed, and the only proper way to deal with this case would be by a new action in the district court. Courts of appeals lack original jurisdiction to hold trials, and the proceeding should be by way of taking testy from witnesses, nots use of affidavits as here. Roberts pointed to additional facts that he believed should be considered. The settlement agreement resulted to Hazel's becoming a co- conspirator in the market-allocation scheme condemned in the recent Hartford- Empire case and profiting greatly from the antitrust violation. Roberts therefore concluded that the majority: > holds that, solely because of the fraud which was practiced on the Patent > Office and in litigation on the patent, the owner of the patent is to be > amerced and in effect fined for the benefit of the other party to the suit, > although that other comes with unclean hands and stands adjudged a party to > a conspiracy to benefit over a period of twelve years under the aegis of the > very patent it now attacks for fraud. To disregard these considerations, to > preclude inquiry concerning these matters, is recklessly to punish one > wrongdoer for the benefit of another.322 U.S. at 270. Justices Stanley Reed and Felix Frankfurter joined in this dissenting opinion, while Chief Justice Harlan Stone simply agreed with the result that the dissent suggested.

Henry descended from Richard I, Duke of Normandy. His father died in 1096, having revolted against King William II of England. As the eldest son, Henry succeeded William as Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings. In 1101, he supported Duke Robert Curthose against his brother Henry Beauclerc who has just seized the English throne. Robert left Tr√©port, the domain of the county of Eu, to invade England. Orderic Vitalis reports that in 1104, while still in Normandy, Henry submitted to the English king. He fought for the king at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106, where Duke Robert was taken prisoner, to remain in captivity for the rest of his life. Henry the joined to cause of William Clito, the son of Duke Robert, in the coalition composed of Baldwin VII of Flanders, Fulk V of Anjou, and Louis VI the Fat. In 1117, Henry and Hugh de Gournay were arrested at Rouen by Henry I. On the promise of good behaviour and at the request of William de Warenne, they were released. Nevertheless, Henry and Hugh, joining with Stephen of Aumale, led a rebellion in the northeast and provided military support to Baldwin VI. The rebellion ended in September 1118 at the Battle of Bures-en-Brai, where Baldwin was mortally wounded. Henry returned to the side of King Henry I. A few months later, on August 20, 1119, Henry was one several barons who accompanied King Henry I when a meeting of the Norman and French royal armies gave rise to the Battle of Br√©mule. The French were swept away, and Louis VI had to flee and take refuge in the fortress of Les Andelys. In the following month, he took part in the defense of the town of Breteuil, which was attacked by the French king and his ally Amaury III of Montfort. Once again, the French were defeated. In 1124, William of Grandcourt, one of Henry's sons, took part in the ambush at Bourgtheroulde.. He captured Amaury III of Montfort, but chose to desert rather than hand him over to Henry I. In 1127, Henry again openly supported William Clito. Henry first married Mathilde and secondly Hermentrude, both of unknown families. He married thirdly Marguerite de Sully, daughter of William the Simple, Count of Sully, and his wife Agnes. Henry and Marguerite had four children: * John, Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings * B√©atrice of Eu * Mathilde (Mahout) of Eu (d. 1153) * Stephen (Etienne) of Eu (d. after 1140). William of Grandcourt (d. 1150 or after) was also a son of Henry's but likely illegitimate. Henry founded the Savignian abbey of Foucarmont in 1129, now known as La Fontaine Saint Martin. Henry embraced a religious life by becoming the Augustinian canon of the abbey Notre-Dame d'Eu. His death is marked on 12 July in the obituary of the abbey of Foucarmont, where he is buried. Upon Henry's death, his son John became Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings.

Allen previously served as the defensive coordinator at Indiana and South Florida. He spent time as an assistant at Ole Miss, Arkansas State, and Drake, among other programs. A native of New Castle, Indiana, Allen also spent six seasons as defensive coordinator and three seasons as the head football coach at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis.  Early life and education  Allen played high school football at New Castle High School in New Castle, Indiana, where his father (also named Tom Allen) was the head football coach. While in high school, Allen also competed in shot put and wrestling. After high school, he attended Maranatha Baptist University, where he participated in football and wrestling. Coaching career = Arkansas State (2011) = In 2011, Allen served as the assistant head coach at Arkansas State, his first position with a Division I FBS program. The head coach during this time was Hugh Freeze, who Allen had previously coached with at Lambuth University. After the end of the regular season, Allen followed Freeze to Ole Miss after Freeze was hired to be the head coach of the Rebels. In his sole season with the Red Wolves, they went 10‚Äì2. = Ole Miss (2012‚Äì2014) = From 2012 to 2014, Allen spent three seasons as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Ole Miss under head coach Hugh Freeze. During his time in Oxford, the Rebels went 24‚Äì15 and consistently ranked near the top of the FBS in terms of tackles for loss and sacks. Prior to his arrival, Ole Miss had ranked last in the SEC in total defense. =South Florida (2015)= On December 17, 2014, Allen was named defensive coordinator at South Florida under third-year head coach Willie Taggart. In his lone season in Tampa, Allen's defensive unit ranked first in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in scoring defense at just 19.6 points per conference game. His efforts also saw the team's defense rank high nationally, tying for 13th nationally in tackles for loss (7.5 per game), 14th in interceptions (17), 24th in takeaways (25), 26th in sacks (2.62 per game), 31st in rushing defense (141.4 ypg), 34th in passing efficiency defense (118.76), and 35th in scoring defense (22.9 ppg). Allen was considered a candidate for the defensive coordinator position at Auburn following then- defensive coordinator Will Muschamp's departure in December 2015, but the vacant position was ultimately filled by Kevin Steele. = Indiana (2016‚Äìpresent) = Allen was hired on January 15, 2016 to serve as defensive coordinator on head coach Kevin Wilson's staff at Indiana. In replacing previous defensive coordinator Brian Knorr, Allen took over a defense that ranked #120 in the FBS in total defense and #106 in opponent points scored. After just one season, Allen engineered one of the top defensive turnarounds in the country with the team improving in every major statistical category against a schedule featuring four top-10 opponents, a program first. The Hoosiers were the most improved team nationally in total defense (-169.4 ypg) and passing defense (-134.1 ypg), the sixth-most improved in third-down defense (-12.2 percent) and the ninth-most improved in points per game allowed (-12.3 ypg). On December 1, 2016, Indiana athletic director Fred Glass named Allen head coach after Wilson's sudden resignation, forcing Allen to make his coaching debut during the team's final game of the season at the 2016 Foster Farms Bowl. His contract guaranteed him $1.795 million annually ‚Äî $500,000 per year in base pay, plus $1.295 million per year in outside, marketing, and promotional income. This made Tom Allen the lowest paid head coach in the Big Ten, although various bonuses could take his total compensation above $3 million. Allen quickly elevated Indiana's recruiting posture. During his first two seasons as head coach, a school-record number of players earned conference honors and a school-record were drafted or invited to NFL camps. The 2019 signing class was the highest rated in program history, besting his previous top-ranked class of 2018, and the two classes combined constituting 80 of the team's 115-man roster. In 2019, Allen's third season, he led Indiana to its first 7-2 start since 1993, the last season Indiana won eight games. That season Indiana earned a #24 ranking in the Associated Press and #25 ranking in the coaches poll, the team's first top 25 ranking in football since 1994. His 17 wins (and counting) over his first three seasons were the most for an Indiana coach in the post-World War II era. Indiana finished the regular season with an 8-4 record, its first eight-win since 1993, and its 5-4 Big Ten record its first winning conference record since 1993. Following the regular season, Allen and the school agreed to a new seven-year contract with an average annual compensation of $3.9 million.  Personal life  Allen is a Christian and a supporter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

He was a civil rights leader in the city and was widely known for his poem, \\"Take up the Black Man's Burden\\", written in 1899 in response to British poet Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The White Man's Burden\\". Bowser was a member of the Citizen's League of Kansas City Inter-Racial Committee. Early life James Dallas Bowser was born free in Weldon, North Carolina on February 15, 1846 to free people of color. When he was about six years old, the family moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, which had a black community.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising.

In 1868, James Milton Turner, principal of the Lincoln School, resigned when appointed as US Minister to Liberia. Bowser was hired to succeed him. He held that job for eleven years before moving outside the city to Wyandotte County, Kansas, where he took a position as principal of another school. In 1873 he married Dora J. Troy of Xenia, Ohio. Political activities and work Bowser was active in Republican politics in Kansas for the rest of his life. In 1881 he was appointed as a mail carrier, a patronage position he held for four years, until Republican appointees were replaced by the new administration of Democratic President Grover Cleveland. Bowser was a member of the Republican State Central Committee in 1885 and 1886. In 1887 he worked as a sealer of weights and measures in Kansas City. In the 1900s, he also worked as principal at Attucks School in Kansas City. Gate City Press In 1880, H. H. Johnson founded The Free Press in Kansas City, but was only able to afford a single issue. Johnson solicited the aid of Bowser, and Bowser took control of the paper starting with its second issue. He renamed it as the Gate City Press and became its editor. The paper was very successful and attracted well-known writers. William Ward Yates (husband of Josephine Silone Yates) and G. N. Gresham were associate editors of the paper.Penn, Irvine Garland.

Routledge, 2016. p23-24 Bowser continued to publish the paper until 1889.Coulter 2006, p108 Black Man's Burden In 1899, Bowser published a poem in response to Rudyard Kipling's \\"The White Man's Burden\\". Bowser entitled his work \\"Take up the Black Man's Burden\\", writing: :\\"Take up the Black Man's burden/Send forth the best ye breed,/To judge with righteous judgement/The Black Man's work and need,//...//Let the glory of your people/Be the making of great men,/The lifting of the lowly,/To noble thought and aim.\\" He drew connections between racism and imperialism in the poem and criticized both. He also advocated black self-improvement, a position expressed as well by Booker T. Washington, president of the Tuskegee Institute. The poem is often paired with a number of poems written in response to Kipling, particularly with \\"Charity Begins at Home\\", published a few weeks earlier in the Colored Americanand pseudonymously written by \\"X-Ray\\". It was more biting in its criticism.Brantlinger, Patrick. Taming Cannibals: Race and the Victorians.

With Thomas Hutchinson Tristram he was the last of the civilians‚Äîthe civil lawyers with a training from Doctors' Commons, as described in David Copperfield by Charles Dickens. Life Born at Hurst Grove, Berkshire, on 25 June 1812, he was second son of Henry Boyle Deane by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of James Wyborn of Hull House, Shelden, Kent. He went to Winchester School as a colleger in 1824, and matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 29 June 1829. In 1833 he obtained a second class in the final classical school and a third in the final mathematical school. Deane graduated BCL on 28 May 1834, and proceeded DCL on 10 April 1839; he admitted on 2 November that year as a member of the College of Advocates. He had previously, on 8 November 1837, entered as a student the Inner Temple, and on 29 January 1841 he was called to the bar there. He was made a QC on 16 Jan. 1858, and became bencher of his inn in the same year, serving the office of treasurer in 1878. In 1854 Deane was appointed legal adviser to Admiral Sir Charles Napier commanding the British fleet in the Baltic Sea: he was present on board HMS Duke of Wellington at the bombardment of Bomarsund, and was one of the landing party. On the abolition of Doctors' Commons in 1858 Deane transferred himself to the courts of probate and divorce, where he obtained a large practice, adapting himself to juries and to the examination of witnesses. In the ecclesiastical courts of the period there were few leading cases in which Deane was not retained; noted appearances were Boyd v. Phillpotts, in which the legality of the Exeter reredos was challenged, and of Martin v. the Rev. A. H. Mackonochie, which continued in some form from 1867 to 1882, and in the earlier stages of which he appeared on behalf of the defendant. Deane was appointed vicar-general of the province and diocese of Canterbury in 1872, on the resignation of Sir Travers Twiss; he had already (in 1868) been made Chancellor of the diocese of Salisbury by the Bishop, Walter Kerr Hamilton. In 1868 he became admiralty advocate-general. He also discharged from 1872 to 1886, as legal adviser to the Foreign Office, the office of Queen's Advocate. In this capacity he prepared the British case in the arbitration between Great Britain and Portugal on the border of Mozambique, over the territory south of what is now Maputo Bay; and he advised the government on the Alabama Claims. Deane was a Conservative in politics, and in the general election 1868 he contested against Edward Cardwell and William Vernon Harcourt, being heavily defeated. In 1885 Deane was sworn a member of the Privy Council, and received the honour of knighthood on 1 August in the same year. He held the leading brief in the case of the missing will of the 1st Lord St. Leonards, tried in 1876. He continued to practise at the bar until deafness forced him to retire. On the occasion of the confirmation of Arthur Winnington-Ingram as Bishop of London at Bow Church on 17 April 1901, the turbulent conduct of the \\"opposers\\" got beyond his power of control. His last public appearance was at the confirmation of Francis Paget as Bishop of Oxford a few months later; he was then in his ninetieth year. Deane died at his house in Westbourne Terrace, London on 3 January 1902, having resigned his offices a few days previously. He was buried at Brookwood cemetery. Family Deane married his cousin in 1841 Isabella Frances Wyborn (d. 1894), daughter of Bargrave Wyborn. His only surviving son was Henry Bargrave Deane, also a judge.

Life and career Yaou was raised by her aunt in a literary family, and wrote her first poems between the ages of twelve and fourteen. She attended the technical high school in Cocody, where in 1977 she participated in a literary contest organized by the publishing house Nouvelles √©ditions africaines; this led to the creation of her first work, a novella entitled La Citadine which has remained unpublished, but which won a prize in the contest. After leaving school she worked for a few years before returning to her studies in 1982; she attended the University of Tours and spent a year at the Universit√© F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny in Cocody. She has also lived in Akrou, in the Jacqueville Department. She was declared a winner of literary competition organized by the new African edition in 1977 Yaou completed her first novel, Lezou Marie ou les √©cueils de la vie, in 1977, presenting it to an editor in 1981 and publishing it in 1982. She followed it with La r√©volte d'Affiba in 1985; she has since written numerous other novels. From 1991 until 1993 she was in the United States as a guest lecturer at a number of universities. She then returned to Ivory Coast, where in addition to her literary activities she held a number of other positions; in 2005 she returned to the United States once more, for two years of comparative study of the similarities between the stories of the southern United States and those of her home country. In 2009 she returned again to Ivory Coast. Beginning in the 1990s, Yaou published a number of works under pseudonyms such as Jo√´lle Anskey and Ruth Owotchi. Her work generally focuses on themes of modern life and the role of women in Ivorian society, and includes discussion of domestic violence, infidelity, and maternity, among other issues. In 2014 she received the excellency award from the president of Cote d' Ivoire, and was the writer in the spotlight at the last international book fair at Abidijan.

Traces of gold were found about 1842. A small find was made near Coromandel in 1852; and a larger find in August 1867 when there was a modest rush. But Thames acquired a reputation for speculative holding of unworked ground despite regulations designed to check it, and some miners left for Queensland. Most of the gold was in quartz reefs rather than in more accessible alluvial deposits and had to be recovered from underground mines and extracted using stamping batteries. The decline in New Zealand gold production was halted in the 1890s. The Waihi Mine had been discovered in 1878, but was not seriously worked until 1887, when English capital set up a cyanide process plant. Hence, with these mines and gold dredges extracting gold from the Molyneaux River in Otago, the gold production of New Zealand again exceeded half a million ounces in 1902. The Golden Cross Mine closed in 1920 but reopened from 1991 to 1998. The Martha Mine closed in 1952 but reopened in 1987 and is still operating.  Reward for gold  A group of Auckland businessmen offered a reward of ¬£100, increased to ¬£500 for the finding of gold in the Auckland region. The Auckland Provincial Council then offered ¬£2000 for the finding of a goldfield in the Hauraki region south of Auckland, though southerners like the Otago Daily Times regarded the potential Coromandel goldfields as a \\"Complete Hoax\\".  First gold rush  In October 1852 Charles Ring who had been on the California goldfields and his brother Frederick found some gold flakes on the banks of Driving Creek. The government leased land from the local Maori, but accessible alluvial gold ran out after a month, The field was reopened in 1862.  Thames goldfields  Hunt discovered the Shotover quartz lode at Thames in 1867; usually said to be William Albert Hunt but possibly his brother (the confusingly named) Albert William Hunt. His brother was responsible for the Hunt‚Äôs Duffer incident on the West Coast in 1866, when he escaped from a large crowd of miners who followed him to Bruce Bay. He had previously discovered the rich Greenstone field near Hokitika in 1864. The more lasting Thames field to the south was proclaimed on 30 July 1867; in Grahamstown near Thames, and in Shortland in the southern part of Thames. The field produced ¬£18,000 worth in 1867 and ¬£150,000 worth in 1868 from underground mines. From 1867 to 1924 the total value was ¬£7,178,000, giving a boost to the northern North Island. At its peak Thames had a population of 15,000 (rivalling Auckland). A contemporary description in 1868 said that the population of the Thames Gold Fields was at least 18,000, with 11,000 miner‚Äôs rights issued, ‚Äúbut many persons who hold shares do not reside upon the diggings‚Äù. About 2,000 claims employ an average of 4.1268 men each. Various stampers employ 185 men, averaging five to a mill. About ten steamers ply between Shortland and Auckland fifty miles away, and a wharf is being erected. The five leading companies in the 1870s were the Caledonian, Moanataiara, Alburnia, Kuranui (Barry‚Äôs Claim), Long Drive and Una Hill (Hape Creek); but there were scores of failures. In most Thames and Coromandel mines the rich patches were interspersed among low-grade ore. The Waiotahi Company was notable for being prudently managed by James Smith from 1873 to 1904 so not requiring \\"reconstruction\\". In 1889 the Crown Mine at Karangahake was the first in the world to use the McArthur-Forrest cyanide process developed in Scotland which increased recovery from low-grade ores and discarded tailings. The government purchased the patent rights to the cyanide process in 1897 and leased the rights to small companies; the purchase price was recouped in ten years. Gold output dropped during the First World War, and in 1916 the Minister of Mines announced proudly that gold-miners led the call to arms. Postwar the annual value of Waihi production was steady at ¬£320,000, and some mines at Thames (e.g. the Sylvia Mine) and Coromandel reopened. In 1926 a conference was held in Dunedin to invigorate the industry. In 1935 gold output peaked during the depression, with two-thirds by the Waihi Company which was the largest of the four major companies. That year for tax reasons the Waihi Company was split into three, including the Martha Company which controlled the Martha Mine.  Thames and the Coromandel today  Some preserved relics are relatively accessible, such as the Crown Mine at Karangahake and the Golden Hills Battery at Broken Hills. Other relics may have hazards like disused mineshafts hidden by undergrowth and visitors should keep to marked tracks and observe warning signs. Thames has many historic buildings including the Golden Crown Battery building, and the Thames-Hauraki and Saxon Shaft pumphouses. The former Thames School of Mines (1886‚Äì1954) is now a museum.

She was commonly referred to only as Umm al-Muqtadir (mother of al-Muqtadir) or al-sayyida (the lady). Life =Early life= Shaghab was reportedly a Rumiyya, that is to say of Greek origin from the Byzantine Empire. She was originally a slave of Umm Qasim, a daughter of Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, the Tahirid governor of Baghdad in 851‚Äì867. Originally named Na'ima (\\"gentle\\"), at some point‚Äîit is not recorded how or when‚Äîshe entered the harem of Caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892‚Äì902), and became his concubine. After giving birth to Ja'far, the future al-Muqtadir, in 895, she was set free (umm walad) and given the name Shaghab (\\"turbulent\\"). According to the historian Hugh Kennedy, this was a common practice at the time for girls, so as to \\"draw attention from their beauty, or, possibly, to ward off jealousy and misfortune\\". Shaghab was influential at court, especially after the death of al-Mu'tadid's first wife, the Tulunid princess Qatr al-Nada, who had one day threatened to cut off her nose. While al-Muktafi (r. 902‚Äì908) remained the first heir, it was widely expected that her son would reign, since al-Muktafi was of sickly disposition. She also avidly promoted the careers of her own family, her sister Khatif, her brother Gharib ibn Abdallah, and her nephew Harun. Gharib became one of close circle of senior ghilmƒÅn, many of whom were of Greek origin, around al-Mu'tadid, such as the future commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Khadim. Until his death in 917, Gharib was one of the leading commanders and provincial governors of the state. When al-Mu'tadid died and al-Muktafi became Caliph, al-Muqtadir was the target of various palace intrigues, but Shaghab could count on the devotion of al-Mu'tadid's old ghilmƒÅn to his offspring to ward off any danger to her son. =Reign of al- Muqtadir= In 908, al-Muktafi fell ill, and was evidently nearing his end. The issue of succession had been left open, and with the Caliph incapacitated, the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i took it upon himself to seek out a successor. Two different stories are told on the events: Miskawayh reports that the vizier sought the advice of the most important bureaucrats, with Mahmud ibn Dawud ibn al-Jarrah suggesting the older and experienced Abdallah ibn al-Mu'tazz, but Ali ibn al-Furat‚Äîwho is usually portrayed as a villain by Miskawayh‚Äîproposing instead someone weak, pliable, and easy to be manipulated by the senior officials. The vizier concurred, and Shaghab's thirteen-year-old son was chosen as heir; when the testament of al-Muktafi was opened, he too had chosen his brother as his successor. A different story is reported by the Andalusi historian Arib, whereby the vizier dithered between the candidacies of Ibn al-Mu'tazz and another older Abbasid prince, Muhammad ibn al-Mu'tamid. The choice of the latter would represent a major political departure, in effect a repudiation of al-Mu'tadid's coup that had deprived the offspring of Caliph al-Mu'tamid (r. 870‚Äì892) of power, and of the officials and ghilmƒÅn that had underpinned al-Mu'tadid's regime. The Caliph recovered before a final choice had been made, and nominated Ja'far as his heir, before dying. The two stories highlight different aspects of al-Muqtadir's accession: on the one hand, a cabal of officials choosing a weak and pliable ruler, \\"a sinister development\\" that inaugurated one \\"of the most disastrous reigns in the whole of Abbasid history [...] a quarter of a century in which all of the work of [al-Muqtadir's] predecessors would be undone\\", while on the other hand, the issue of dynastic succession, and especially the loyalty of al-Mu'tadid's ghilmƒÅn to his son, evidently also played an important role. The harem and Shaghab's influence Al-Muqtadir was the first underage Caliph in Muslim history, and as such during the early years of his reign, a regency council (al-sƒÅda, \\"the masters\\") was set up, comprising, according to al-Tanukhi, his mother Shaghab, her personal agent (qahramƒÅna) Umm Musa, her sister Khatif, and another umm walad of al-Mu'tadid's, Dastanbuwayh. Saghab, usually known simply as al-Sayyida (\\"the Lady\\"), utterly \\"dominated her son to the exclusion of the other women in his harem, including his wives and concubines\\"; al- Muqtadir would spend much of his time in his mother's quarters. As a result, government business came to be determined in the private quarters of the sovereign rather than the public palace dominated by the bureaucracy, and Saghab became one of the most influential figures of her son's reign, interfering in the appointments and dismissals of officials, making financial contributions to the treasury, and undertaking charitable activities. Indeed, a common feature of all accounts by medieval sources is that \\"mentions of al- Muqtadir are indissolubly tied to mentions not only of his viziers, but also of his female household\\", and this was one of the main points of criticism for subsequent historians. Thus the contemporary historian al-Mas'udi condemned al-Muqtadir's reign as one where \\"those who had power were women, servants and others\\", while the Caliph himself \\"did not concern himself with State affairs\\", leaving his officials to govern the state. Likewise, the 13th- century chronicler Ibn al-Tiqtaqa, regarded al-Muqtadir as a \\"squanderer\\" who let \\"matters concerning his reign were run by women and servants, while he was busy satisfying his pleasure\\". Shaghab in particular is usually portrayed as a \\"rapacious and short-sighted schemer\\" by later historians. Although she sometimes challenged conventions of the role of a woman‚Äîit is reported that in 918 she even dared to go out in public riding a horse‚ÄîShaghab spent most of her life confined in the harem. There she ran her own parallel bureaucracy, with secretaries (kuttƒÅb, sing. kƒÅtib) devoted to both civil and military affairs. Her power was such that when her kƒÅtib Ahmad al-Khasibi was appointed vizier in 925 due to her own and her sister's influence, he regretted the appointment, since his post as kƒÅtib to the queen-mother was more beneficial to himself. The most important members of her court were the stewardesses or qahramƒÅna, who were free to exit the harem and act as agents to her interests in the outside world. These women wielded considerable influence, especially as intermediaries between the harem and the court; their influence with Shaghab could lead to the dismissal of even the vizier. The first incumbent was one Fatima, who drowned in the Tigris when her boat was caught in a storm. She was followed by Umm Musa, a descendant of one of the Abbasid clan's junior branches. Her plotting for her favourites, the corruption of her family, and her hostility towards the \\"good vizier\\" Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, who was dismissed due to her machinations in 917, are underlined in the chronicles of the period. However, when she married her niece to Abu'l-Abbas, a grandson of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861), her rivals were quick to accuse her of aspiring to overthrow the Caliph and place her nephew on the throne. In 922/3, she was arrested and replaced by Thumal, who tortured Umm Musa, her brother, and her sister, until they had revealed where her treasure‚Äîreportedly valued at one million gold dinars‚Äîwas hidden. Thumal enjoyed a reputation for cruelty; her first master, Abu Dulaf, had used her to punish servants who displeased him. Another qahramƒÅna, Zaydan, was the antithesis of Thumal: her house was used to jail several senior officials after they were dismissed, but it was a comfortable captivity, and she often provided refuge to those persecuted by their political rivals. When the qadi Ahmad ibn Yaqub refused to recognize her son as Caliph because of his age, Shaghab had him executed.Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. . She stated that the affairs of the umma, especially justice, was better administered with a woman in charge, and appointed her female assistant Thumal in charge of the mazalim courts, in effect minister of justice or chief administrator of justice and supervisor of the qadis, who opposed to be supervised by a woman, but was forced to accept the appointment.Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. . According to the historian Tabari, Thumal carried out her duties well enough to achieve popularity among the public in her office, especially because of the new reforms which lowered the cost for a plaintiff to initiate a case: however, her appointment was described in Muslim history, among others by Ibn Hazm, as a proof on the decadence of the reign of al- Muqtadir and one example of a series of \\"scandals whose equal has not been seen to this day\\".Mernissi, Fatima; Mary Jo Lakeland (2003). The forgotten queens of Islam. Oxford University Press. . During her de facto reign, Shaghab also spent large sums on ostentatious public charity, which gave her some popularity among the general public.Chris Wickham: The Inheritance of Rome: A History of Europe from 400 to 1000 See also * Qatr al-Nada * Thumal the Qahraman References Sources   9th-century births 10th-century women rulers 933 deaths Abbasids Greek slaves Women of the Abbasid Caliphate Medieval slaves ","title":"Shaghab"},{"id":"52447292","text":"Urszula Grabowska Urszula Grabowska-Ochalik (born 27 June 1976) is a Polish film and television actress.

Free The Bid‚Äôs pledge calls for ad agencies and brands to include at least one woman director every time they triple-bid a commercial production. The program also urges production companies to add more women to their rosters. Pledged agencies, brands and production companies further pledge to free the bid by seeking intersectional, diverse perspectives whenever possible. The initiative was launched in 2016 by award-winning filmmaker Alma Har'el.  About  Har'el decided to launch the initiative after giving an interview at Mashable about the shockingly low number of female-helmed commercials. In the interview, Har'el stated, \\"Less than 7% of directors are women and less than 10% of creative directors at ad agencies are women. These numbers are hard to swallow for 50% of the world‚Äôs population, especially when the Harvard Business review and many other publications suggest that women are the #1 consumer group that makes approximately 85% of product purchase decisions.\\" Inspired by Har'el's Mashable interview, PJ Pereira, CCO and co-founder of Pereira & O‚ÄôDell agency announced that he would be pursuing a mandatory bid from a woman director on every pitch at his agency. Pereira explained, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a simple idea that will help the entire advertising ecosystem be more open to women directors. Because it's right but also because it's smart. A more diverse industry means a more creative one and a better representation of their customers and of society itself.‚Äù Har‚Äôel decided to use this idea to inspire more ad agencies, production companies and brands to take the pledge to have a woman director bid on every commercial. Har'el named the initiative #FreeTheBid and launched it in September 2016 with an extensive website and the backing of prominent industry figures within the gender diversity discussion, including renowned feminist and advertising consultant Cindy Gallop. With early support from large networks such as FCB, DDB, BBDO, McCann, JWT and Leo Burnett to hot shops like Pereira & O'Dell, Mother, 72&Sunny;, Martin and 180, the initiative quickly received widespread exposure in the media. One of the first brands to take a global pledge to seek a woman director on every job they produced around the world was HP. Antonio Lucio, Global CMO HP Inc. explained, \\"HP takes the pledge to #FREETHEBID globally. We believe the creative process of our ad agencies will be strengthened and we‚Äôre excited to implement this pledge globally and give women a voice in advertising to the benefit of everyone, everywhere. We hope to inspire more brands to join us in this pledge and #FREETHEBID.\\" Another early supporter of the initiative is award winning film and commercial director Spike Jonze, who stated in an interview, \\"I find #FreeTheBid so inspiring. It seems like a no brainer. Of course we should be getting more women filmmakers to bid on jobs. As with all great ideas, its such a simple one and the end result is going to be get- ting more diverse voices into the conversation and therefore more diverse voices into the work which makes the work better.\\" Free The Bid‚Äôs website currently features a database of over 400 women directors from all over the world, including links to their reels and producers. The database is designed to help the pledged agencies keep their commitment to the cause and is searchable by keyword, category tags, and location, allowing visitors to easily discover the work of a woman best suited for any job.  Industry feedback  In October 2016, advertising magazine SHOOT Online followed up with female directors to see how they felt about the initiative. In the article, director Molly Schiot states that #FreeTheBid is \\"the most important step that has been made in my career as a director. Opportunity creates a larger possibility of landing a job for myself and my female peers. Which means they will get a decent budget. Which means their reels will get better. Which means that things will be fairer. Which means agencies can start talking about the quality of ones work with a pronoun that isn‚Äôt just he, his, or him.\\" McCann Worldgroup Global Creative Chairman Rob Reilly reported the initiative is already in play at the agency's New York office. \\"This wasn't forced by me, but everyone got behind it and said it's the right thing to do,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes bills and laws get written and redone and they come up with a new law that's even better, but someone has to write that first bill for change to happen. The big agencies need to be part of this effort, and the best thing that can happen is that there aren't enough viable female directors, and then it forces production companies to look at more female talent.\\" EBay CMO Suzy Deering was one of the first adopters of the program and reported the company has already implemented the initiative into its current work, and that, \\"moving forward, [we] will update our agency partners' scopes of work,\\" she said. \\"The cycle must be broken. Given our diverse community of buyers and sellers around the world, this is an important cause for eBay to stand for.\\" FCB Chicago reported that prior to joining Free the Bid, roughly 40% of its bids included a female director. Six months in, 95% of bids now include a woman. Before, women directors actually landed about 10% of all its bids. Now that number has jumped to 30%. HP has been an avid benefactor as the effort has dovetailed with the company's own stated commitment to promote diversity. The company's financial support has helped Free the Bid to bring in an executive director, Emma Reeves, and expand the portfolio of female directors' reels on its website to more than 400 from 70 at the start. A recent HP campaign, \\"Reinvent My Story,\\" brought in director Peyton Wilson and Free the Bid writers. During 2017 Cannes film festival, the brand said it would be stepping into the film business for the first time with a female director, Nandita Das, on the biopic \\"Manto.\\" Brands like Visa, Coca- Cola and Nestle Waters have pledged to free the bid.  Awards  In November 2016, Har'el received the \\"3 Cheers Award\\" from the 3% Conference in New York City for Free The Bid's impact on gender equality in advertising.

Early life and education Miller was born in Wheatley, Oxfordshire, the third son of Brigadier General Alfred Douglas Miller and Ella Geraldine (n√©e Fletcher). His mother was a descendant of political writer Andrew Fletcher, and of the Earls of Wemyss and March. His maternal great-grandfather Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot was Member of Parliament for Glamorgan for 60 years and Father of the House. His great-great grandfather was Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Glengall. Miller grew up at the family estate of Shotover Park. He was educated at Eton College, followed by the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Career =Military service= On 26 January 1939, Miller was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Welsh Guards, and was given the service number of 85599. He served with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) after the outbreak of the Second World War that September. Serving with the regiment's 1st Battalion, part of the 32nd Guards Brigade of Major General Allan Adair's Guards Armoured Division, he was a courageous soldier who distinguished himself during the war, and was honoured for his bravery during and after the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in December 1944, while serving as a major commanding a company in the 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards, with the citation noting, \\"that in the North Western Europe theatre of operations, after D-Day, in the face of heavy shelling, he kept his beleaguered men together, continually exposing himself to enemy fire, with complete disregard for his survival.\\" In March 1945, Miller was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for \\"re-establishing, again at great risk to himself, two companies of his regiment, scattered after a fierce enemy tank attack.\\" Also same month, he commanded the first British troops to enter Brussels when it was liberated in September. Followed the war, Miller served as aide-de-camp from 1945 to 1947 to Field Marshal Lord Wilson, head of the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington, D.C. From 1958 to 1961, Miller commanded the 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards. =Equestrian and crown equerry= Horses formed an integral part of Miller's childhood at the family estate, Shotover House, where he rode with the South Oxfordshire Hunt. Miller was a contender to make the United Kingdom's equestrian eventing team for the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, but he suffered a fractured vertebra in a fall that prevented him from making the team. In 1972, he was a member of the first-place British team at the Equestrian World Driving Championships in M√ºnster, where he also claimed an individual silver medal. He won a second gold medal with the British team at the 1974 World Championships in Frauenfeld, Switzerland. In April 1961, Queen Elizabeth appointed Miller as Crown Equerry, a post he held for 26 years. As equerry, he took care of all of the Queen's horses, excluding her racehorses, and also looked after the fleet of royal cars. He was a key figure concerning all the coach and horses element of royal pageantry during his tenure, including Trooping the Colour, the opening of parliament, visits by foreign heads of state, royal weddings and the procession down the course at Royal Ascot. Miller led four royal wedding processions: those of Princess Alexandra of Kent to Angus Ogilvy in 1963, Princess Anne to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973, Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 and Prince Andrew to Sarah Ferguson in 1986. His expertise with horses rivalled that of the Queen herself, to whom he became both an adviser on all things horses and a loyal friend. During his tenure, he helped foster the royal family's interests in equine sports, including Prince Philip's competition and coach driving; Prince Charles' polo; and Princess Anne's equestrian career. The princess royal's eventing career began with the horse Purple Star, a foal among seven born to Stella, Miller's favourite mare. Miller helped oversee the princess's progress when she began riding Doublet, her partner in winning the 1971 European Eventing Championships. In addition to his duties supervising the royal horses and motor transport from the Royal Mews, Miller worked to ensure that the Mews remained London's centre for equestrian life. The mews' indoor riding school was opened for disabled children and members of riding clubs, and equine societies and charities held meetings there. Over the years, Miller served as president of many equine-relation organisations, including the British Show Jumping Association, the British Driving Society, the Coaching Club, the National Light Horse Breeding Society, the Horse Rangers Association, the Cleveland Bay Horse Society, and the Royal Windsor Horse Show Club. He retired as crown equerry in August 1987, but remained an extra equerry to the Queen. Personal life Miller was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1966 Birthday Honours. He was knighted as a Knight Commander in the same order (KCVO) in 1974, and further honoured as Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) in 1987. Miller never married. He died in Oxfordshire in 2006.

Alongside her husband William Hoapili Ka ªauwai, she traveled with Queen Emma of Hawaii to Europe between 1865 and 1866, and circumnavigated the globe upon their return eastward via New Zealand.  Early life  Kiliwehi was born ,This date is possibly inaccurate since her mother died on August 25, 1839. () as the daughter of Kuini Liliha, an influential high chiefess and Governor of Oahu, and Ha ªalou. Her mother was a descendant of the ancient kings of Hawaii and Maui. Kiliwehi was also the name of an early Hawaiian high chiefess who was the daughter of King Kamehameha I and Peleuli, the wife of Prime Minister Kalanimoku and the mother of Leleiohoku I. She had many half-siblings including sisters: Jane Loeau (1828‚Äì1873), Abigail Maheha (1832‚Äì1861), and Kailinoa, and brothers: Pius F. Koakanu (died 1880) and Aberahama Kaikioewa Palekaluhi (1830‚Äì1912). Most of her siblings were given away in hƒÅnai to other family members and friends. The Hawaiian custom of hƒÅnai is an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. Kiliwehi and her sister Abigail Maheha were adopted under the Hawaiian tradition of hƒÅnai by the Princess Kekau ª≈çnohi, a granddaughter of Kamehameha I who served as Governor of Kauai. She attended the Royal School in Honolulu, which was run by American Protestant missionaries Reverend Edward G. Beckwith. Her classmates included the future monarchs KalƒÅkaua and Liliuokalani, and Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu. These royal classmates and her two elder sisters had attended the previous institution of the same name, a boarding school ran by Amos Starr Cooke and Juliette Montague Cooke, and had been declared by King Kamehameha III as eligible for the Hawaiian throne.  Marriage and travel abroad  William Hoapili Ka ªauwai and Kiliwehi, in London, c. 1865 Kiliwehi married William Hoapili Ka ªauwai (1835‚Äì1874), a Maui high chief, politician and the only ordained Native Hawaiian priest of the Anglican Church of Hawaii. They had no children. She and her husband became associated with King Kamehameha IV and his wife Queen Emma. They became early converts to the Anglican faith. After Kamehameha IV's death, Queen Emma decided to travel to England to solicit donations for erecting a cathedral in Honolulu and to continue the legacy of her husband. She chose Kiliwehi as her lady-in-waiting and her husband Ka ªauwai to be her chaplain to accompany her on this trip from 1865 to 1866. They traveled with the queen through Panama, England, Italy, and the French Rivera. She was presented to Queen Victoria during Queen Emma's audience with the British monarch on September 9, 1865, and her overnight stay at Windsor Castle on November 27, 1865. In her private journal, Victoria mentioned Kiliwehi as \\"Mrs. Hoopile\\", writing that Queen Emma \\"presented her lady, whose husband is her Chaplain, both being Hawaiians\\". The extended royal trip continued onto the European continent. At Florence, her husband requested to return home and continue his clerical duties in Hawaii. Later at Turin, Kiliwehi was also permitted to accompany him back. They returned to London and took an extended route back to Hawaii, stopping off in Auckland, New Zealand without the knowledge or permission of Queen Emma or King Kamehameha V. Prior to leaving England, Ka ªauwai had written to the Hawaiian Minister of Finance Charles Coffin Harris indicating they intended to take a \\"rather long round- about, and slow way toward home\\". Unknown to the Hawaiian government, the couple went to New Zealand to recruit MƒÅori immigrants to settle in the Kingdom of Hawaii. This unauthorized excursion displeased the Hawaiian government and they were asked to return home. By the time the Ka ªauwais returned to Hawaii in 1867, Queen Emma had already returned as well. Back in Honolulu, her husband was shunned by King Kamehameha V because of his treatment of Queen Emma and the unauthorized visit to New Zealand. Domestic relations between Kiliwehi and her husband worsened. According to Kamehameha V, in one incident, Ka ªauwai placed a gun to her head and offered to shoot her. After this abuse, she left her husband and went to live at Hale ªƒÅkala, with High Chiefess Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Kiliwehi filed for divorce on April 22, 1872; the case went to trial on September 12 and she was granted a temporary decree which was made absolute on June 18, 1873. She was awarded ten dollars a month in alimony and Ka ªauwai was asked to cover the costs of the divorce suit. Her husband later had an illegitimate son William Hoapili Ka ªauwai II, whose mother is either mentioned as Keanolani or Keauookalau, the wife of Lihilihi, of Kauai.; ;  Death  Kiliwehi developed pulmonary tuberculosis, a serious disease among the Native Hawaiians which her husband also had. On October 12, 1873, she was sent from her home at Wailuku via Kahului to the Queen's Hospital in Honolulu for further treatment. Her friend Queen Emma wrote, \\"Poor Kiliwehi is at the Hospital and bleeding dreadfully at her lungs.\\" Her condition worsened and she was moved from her hospital room to Hale ªƒÅkala, the home of Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Kiliwehi eventually died, on November 3, 1873, at Hale ªƒÅkala, Honolulu. She was 33 years old at the time of her death. Her funeral was held the following day at the St. Andrew's Pro- Cathedral.Hawaiian Church Monthly Messenger, I ( 1873), p. 96; ; ; ; ; ;  References   Bibliography     External links  * 1840s births 1873 deaths Hawaiian nobility Royalty of the Hawaiian Kingdom Hawaiian ladies-in-waiting Hawaiian Kingdom Anglicans Converts to Anglicanism Royal School (Hawaii) alumni 19th-century deaths from tuberculosis ","title":"Kiliwehi"},{"id":"52447427","text":"Muraltia is a genus of plants in the milkwort family (Polygalaceae) which is native to Southern and Eastern Africa.

Because the ancient Egyptians had relied on this miracle river, Egypt was the ‚ÄúGift of the Nile.‚Äù Occurring at about 450 BCE, Herodotus‚Äîa Greek historian‚Äîcalled Egypt the ‚ÄúGift of the Nile‚Äù because ancient Egyptian civilization depended on the resources from the river so they could continue living in that vicinity. Beyond the Nile River is the Sahara Desert, and since it almost impossible to grow food in the desert, very few people lived far from the river itself. People that were settled close to the banks of the Nile shared the same language and also worshipped similar gods.  Analysis  = Religion = The ancient Egyptian peoples believed the river was God himself and he blessed the population with goods and offerings. Within the hymn, the river is described with human-like qualities, which in turn, makes the Nile more relatable to human life. However, the river was more than just given human-like qualities, but more-so God-like characteristics. The hymn specifically states \\"offerings are made unto you, men are immolated to you, great festivals are instituted for you. Birds are sacrificed to you, gazelles are taken for you in the mountain, pure flames are prepared for you.‚Äù This is an example of how the ancient Egyptian peoples treated the Nile as if it were bigger and better than humans themselves. This would be considered part of their religious practice, making the Nile River a religious figure to the ancient Egyptian peoples. = Agriculture = The ancient Egyptian peoples connected with the river agriculturally as well. They noticed that if the water levels reached too high then their shelter would be washed away. However, if the water level was not high enough it would bring famine and misfortune to their lives. The happy medium was praised by the Egyptian people and looked at as a miracle for life itself. Ancient Egyptian agriculture boomed when the Nile River produced a middle ground to grow crops to feed the society. Crops have so much importance to keep a civilization up and running, and the Nile River made this and so much more possible for Egypt. There are many quotes in the hymn itself showcasing their gratitude for the Nile River supporting their crop growth. For example, ‚ÄúHe makes mankind valiant, enriching some, bestowing his love on others‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe stanches the water from all eyes and watches over the increase of his good things‚Äù = Economics = The Nile pleased the Egyptian peoples economically also. Egypt was granted an economic stand point because crops were now growing on their land due to the regular flooding of the river. Because of this, living would become much easier and life would be much more economically satisfying for Egyptian people at this point in time. Trading routes with other civilizations could also have been expanded making trading goods much easier as well as making more money for themselves to grant them better lives in this area.

She was also recognised in 2015 by the British Council for her community work, and by the BBC as part of their 100 Women series. Personal life Rabia Sa'id was born in Wangara, a town in Gezawa local government area of Kano State, Northern Nigeria, where girls have few education opportunities, many marry in their teens, and women are expected to stay at home. Her father, however, wanted her to become a doctor. He was an officer in the Nigerian Army who had two wives and fathered ten children. Sa'id attended an Army school at the top of her class. She chose to marry at the age of 18, once she graduated from a secondary school. She is a mother of six. Two of her children needed medical care (one of them was born with club foot and another with sickle-cell anemia), which added to her personal challenge to obtain higher education degrees. Career =Education and early career= Sa'id began her university education at the age of 29 and ran a nursery school to pay for her education. She holds Bachelor of Science, Masters of Science and Ph.D degrees in Physics from Bayero University Kano. In September 1999, she commenced work as a Graduate Assistant at Bayero University. In 2002, on the International Fellowships Program (IFP) of the Ford Foundation, she studied for an M.Sc degree in Environment and Development from the University of Reading, United Kingdom. =Educator= She began working in 1999 for the Bayero University and is now a professor of undergraduate and graduate level courses in atmospheric and space-weather physics. By 2015, she was Deputy Dean at the Student Affairs Division of the university. =Research= She received a research post at the university, where she conducts research in atmospheric and space weather physics, particle physics, and electronics. Her research is conducted to solve Nigerian environmental challenges. To reduce the number of trees cut down for firewood, for instance, one study was about use scraps of wood from carpentry projects for briquettes that could be to use as a fuel, thereby reducing the rate at which the country's forests are diminished. She also gathers atmospheric data and studies the effects of deforestation and dust aerosols on climate temperatures. Her goal is to encourage greater reliance in Nigeria on renewable energy sources‚Äîlike wind power, solar energy, and hydropower‚Äîthat are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels. In 2010, she worked with Dr. C. Matzler, a scientist in terrestrial and atmospheric remote sensing, at the Institute of Applied Physics, University of Bern, Switzerland as a visiting research scientist for four months. In January 2013, she was made an African Scientific Institute (ASI) Fellow in Physics, which is an honorary association and think tank of academics, researchers, and business people. =STEM outreach= Sa'id is active in Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) outreach. She is a co-founder of Nigeria's Association of Women Physicists in 2011, which encourages women to become physicists, seeks to improve physics education in schools, and gives prizes to young women. Sa'id also encourages participation of young people by mentoring them in local and national science projects, volunteering for the Peace Corps Nigeria Alumni Foundation and Visiola Foundation. She says she is active in STEM outreach because there is group pressure and obstacles that girls, particularly those in northern Nigeria, must overcome to pursue degrees and careers in these fields. In addition, \\"more girls in science will mean that the solutions that science provides are not just tailored to the needs of a single gender.\\" In addition, there is greater appreciation for careers where there are practical applications, like banking and medicine. =Recognition= In 2015 she was a recipient of one of the five Elsevier Foundation Awards for Women Scientists in the Developing World.

Fossils that were found by Carlotta Maury, areas of Old Eocene beds in Trinidad. Carlotta Joaquina Maury (January 6, 1874 ‚Äì January 3, 1938) was a geologist, stratigrapher, paleontologist, and was one of the first women to work as a professional scientist in the oil and gas industry. She worked as a palaeontologist within an oil company; she was a petroleum geologist at Royal Dutch Shell. Maury focused on tertiary mollusks. Maury initially taught in universities after attending Cornell University finishing with a PhD in 1902, although she had trouble achieving a full-time position. However, she really wanted to pursue paleontological expeditions. Even though she went on to later be successful, there were still elements of difficulty in her early career, in some ways due to her gender. In the early 1900s there were hardly any women with a career in science. Maury was one of those few women that pursued the sciences. Early life Carlotta Joaquina Maury was born on January 6, 1874 in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Maury's father was the Reverend Mytton Maury, a direct descendant of the Reverend James Maury and one of the sons of Sarah Mytton Maury. Maury's mother was Virginia Draper, a daughter of Antonia Coetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner and Dr. John William Draper. Early in Maury‚Äôs life, her mother and father gave her a love for nature by exposing her to the wonders of the natural world. Her Grandfather, Daniel Gardner was the Emperor of Brazil's physician. As a Maury, she was the sixth generation of her family to live in the United States along with her siblings. Her sister, Antonia Maury became an astronomer, and worked as a scientist and a mathematician in Harvard Observatory. Maury‚Äôs other sister, Sarah Mytton Maury passed away in her early childhood. Lastly, John William Draper was her brother who went on to be an established surgeon in New York. Maury was also the granddaughter of John William Draper and a niece of Henry Draper, both pioneering astronomers who privately funded the Harvard Observatory.  Education  From 1891 to 1894, Maury attended Radcliffe College. One of the founding members of Radcliffe College and the first president, Elizabeth Agassiz, played a key role in Maury‚Äôs education. Maury received the Schulyer Fellowship and the Sarah Berliner Fellowship while attending Cornell University. Maury later attended Jardin des Plantes in Paris from 1899 to 1900 and Columbia University. After spending a year at Sorbonne for post-graduate studies, in 1902, Maury completed her PhD in paleontology at Cornell University. Griffen Harris was Maury‚Äôs mentor throughout her palaeontology education career.  Career  Upon completion of her degree, Maury started teaching at Erasmus High School in Brooklyn, New York in 1900. She went on to become a paleontologist assistant at Columbia University in 1904 and a lecturer in geology at Columbia College and Barnard College until 1912. Maury returned to the field and joined a team led by G. D. Harris, her former Cornell advisor. The team‚Äôs objective was to investigate oil-rich areas off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. The information provided was the first significant geological information about the oil-producing area it is today. Maury‚Äôs specific contribution to the team‚Äôs research efforts was assembling data based on paleontologist findings in order to create a structure map of a large region. The team‚Äôs analysis has only needed minor adjustments since being published in 1910.Creese, M. R. (2007). [null Fossil hunters, a cave explorer and a rock analyst; notes on some] early women contributors to geology. In C. V. Burek & B. Higgs (eds.), The role of women in the history of geology, (vol. 281, pp. 39-49). London, UK: Geological Society of London. In 1910, she started working for the Royal Dutch Shell as a consulting geologist and stratigrapher - she became the first female to be hired as a consultant, and then for General Asphalt Co. as part of a team to explore areas of Old Eocene beds in Trinidad and Venezuela. Her findings of fossils and fauna were the first of their kind in the Caribbean and South America. From 1910-1911 Maury had the opportunity to be a part of Arthur Clifford Veatch‚Äôs geological expedition to Venezuela as a paleontologist during that time. After teaching at Huguenot College in Wellington, South Africa, she returned to the Caribbean in 1916 as a leader of the \\"Maury Expedition\\" to the Dominican Republic, despite political instability in the area at the time. Her goal was to order the stratigraphic layers of the Miocene and Oligocene eras, which were composed of sedimentary rock with heavy fossil deposits. This resulted in the discovery of 400 new species. Her work formed the foundation of the present day International Dominican Republic Project, which is a research effort that aims to dissect evolutionary change in the Caribbean from the Miocene era to the present day. In 1925, Maury published \\"Fosseis Terciarios do Brasil com Descrip√ß√£o de Novas Formas Cretaceas\\". In this work she describes a various amount of species of mollusks from the northeaster coast of South America. Among these mollusks a majority of them were discovered to be new species. Using her stratigraphy knowledge, she was able to find a correlation of those faunas with similar faunas around the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. The monograph details mostly on fossils from the geological epoch of the Lower Miocene that were found in Rio Pirabas and Bragan√ßa to Bel√©m. In both these areas the fossils were located in beds of limestone, and the fossils were primarily internal and external shell casts within the rock. Maury had a talent for writing among her many other skills and accomplishments, she documented her expeditions in a very professional manner. She was known by her colleagues for her energy and efficiency as she worked against the prejudice against women scientists. Her skills and capabilities were highly acknowledged that she became an official paleontologist with the Geological and Mineralogical Service of Brazil. While in this position, she published multiple monographs and Mineralogical Service Bulletins between 1919-1937. She was a fellow of the American Geographical Society. Her last report before she died was published in 1937, on the Pliocene fossils of Acre, Brazil. Most of her work after 1923 was completed inside a private lab in her apartment in Yonkers, New York. Since she was financially independent, she was able to hire other specialists on the work she wasn‚Äôt as confident in.  Death  Maury died January 3, 1938 in Yonkers, New York. She was buried at Cold Springs, New York on January 6 - her 64th birthday.

It was founded by Hope Swinimer in 1997 as The Eastern Shore Wildlife Rehabilitation and Rescue Centre. It got its current name in 2005. A television series, Hope for Wildlife, began documenting the centre's efforts in 2009. The centre is dedicated to providing care to injured and orphaned animals before releasing them back into the wild. It also seeks to connect people to wildlife in a positive way through education for a sustainable future. As of 2018, the center has helped over 40,000 animals return to their wild habitat, representing over 200 species. The money for the farm comes mostly from small donations. Bigger donations come from events like the open house where people tour the farm, a government grant for summer internships, and money from the TV show. In an interview with a local paper, Swinimer admits the show is \\"a little hammed up,\\" but it brings money into the rehab centre and children from all over the country write letters asking about the animals. A volunteer tells of meeting people in South Africa who first heard of Nova Scotia on the show, which airs in more than 20 countries.\\"  History  While working at Dartmouth Veterinary Hospital in 1995, Hope Swinimer received as a patient a robin that had been attacked by a cat, and while taking care of the bird she developed an eagerness to learn more about taking care of injured wildlife. Her passion quickly led her to start doing wildlife rehabilitation as a full- time career, turning her home into a makeshift rehabilitation center, starting with a few cages in the backyard and using her spare room as a nursery. In 1996, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) required Hope to obtain a wildlife rehabilitation permit for her makeshift wildlife center even though such a permit did not exist in Nova Scotia at the time. Hope worked with DNR to establish a licensing process that allowed for wildlife rehabilitation in the province. In 1997 she received her rehabilitation permit and moved to Winnie's Way in Seaforth, Nova Scotia. Here she established the Eastern Shore Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre. The centre became the first fully operating wildlife rescue facility in Nova Scotia. After just a few years the demands for the centre's help outgrew the property and in 2001 Hope moved again. Staying in Seaforth, Hope moved to a farm property which allowed for expansion to her growing business. Five years after this move, the Eastern Shore Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre officially became known as Hope for Wildlife, a registered charitable organization that continues to grow. In 2012, the primary worker at HFW for 8 years, and then manager, Allison Dube, left and moved to Scotland. As of 2015, the centre had helped over 15,000 animals from over 250 species. In 2018, a major member of HFW, Reid Steward Patterson, died. As of 2018, the centre had helped over 40,000 animals.  Mission statement  The organization has put forth a mission statement to outline what it wishes to achieve. It lists three main goals: # Rescue, rehabilitate and reintroduce to the wild injured and orphaned wildlife. # Educate others about the importance of conserving wild animals and the ecosystems that sustain them. # Research and develop the knowledge and understanding necessary for the conservation and management of wildlife.  Progress  Since 1997 the facility has grown phenomenally, starting with development of the education centre which allowed for people to visit the facility and learn about wildlife and what the organization does. The education centre itself grew and now consists of one building, an outdoor pavilion and wildlife gardens.http://cwf-fcf.org/en/explore-our- work/connecting-with-nature/in-the-garden/gardener/feature-gardens/hope-for- wildlife-garden.html. Many accomplishments have been made on the rehabilitation side of the facility too. Hope for Wildlife became the first in the province to legally rehabilitate and release white tailed deer and birds of prey, developing a 100-foot-long flight cage for large birds and a deer enclosure which consists of over an acre of field and a small barn designed for raising orphaned white tailed deer. The facility hit a milestone when they opened the first wildlife veterinary hospital in the province back in 2012.http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2012/01/04/wildlife-care-group- opens-vet-hospital.html The next big projects consisted of building a marine unit, for the growing number of injured seal pups and sea birds. Following the marine unit a large mammal unit was constructed at the back of the property for the larger predator mammals, such as bobcats. On average, the centre sees about 3,500 animals a year, continuing to take in more animals each year. These animals may have been injured, orphaned or lost. Animals the centre has worked with include fox, deer, raccoons, skunks and beavers. The centre receives approximately 10,000 callers a year to its wildlife helpline, which is put in place for anyone who comes into contact with a wild animal in need of assistance.  Funding  The organization gets most of its funding from small donations given by the public, both those who visit the centre and those who call the helpline. The majority of donations are around $10 and pay for about $95,000 of necessities such as feed, cleaning supplies, and building upkeep. Larger donations come from events like the annual open house that the centre hosts, gift shop proceeds, government grants set forth for summer internships and any money coming from a TV series, simply named Hope for Wildlife, that follows many of the organization's stories.  Television series  Produced by Arcadia Content the documentary series, \\"Hope for Wildlife\\", follows the team as they nurse thousands of injured and orphaned wildlife back to health and return them to the wild. The stories of the animals and the team members that devote their lives to saving them are depicted in each episode.

It is a shrub with its branches, leaves and some of its flower parts densely covered with white, woolly hairs. The leaves are thick and soft and the flowers are tube-shaped, pale to deep pinkish-purple or claret red. Description Dasymalla terminalis is an erect shrub which grows to a height of with its branches and leaves densely covered with white or grey, woolly hairs. The leaves are oblong to narrowly elliptic, long, wide, thick, soft and covered with small pimples which are hidden in the thick layer of woolly hairs. The flowers are pale to deep pinkish-purple or claret red and arranged in leaf axils in groups of up to five on a densely hairy stalk, long. (A form from near Lake Grace has white flowers.) The flowers are surrounded by woolly bracts and bracteoles which are hairy on the outside but glabrous on the inside. The five sepals are long and joined at their base to form a short tube which is woolly on the outside and glabrous on the inside. The five petals are joined to form a tube long, wide in the upper half, with five lobes on the end. The tube has scattered hairs outside but is glabrous inside except for a ring of hairs near the ovary. The lower petal lobe in more or less circular and almost twice as large as the other four lobes which are roughly equal in size. The four stamens are shorter than the tube with one pair slightly shorter than the other. Flowering occurs from may to November or December and the hairy fruit which follows splits into two when mature. Taxonomy and naming Dasymalla terminalis was first formally described in 1839 by Stephan Endlicher and the description was published in his book Novarum Stirpium Decades. The specific epithet (terminalis) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the ends\\". Distribution This species of Dasymalla is the most widely distributed of the genus and grows from near the Murchison River in the north- west to Kalgoorlie in the south-east, in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation Dasymalla terminalis is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

He is also the author of the Piper Houdini series of young adult novels and a manualist.  Early life Herdling was born on May 2, 1964, in Summit, NJ. He graduated from Bucknell University in 1986 and shortly thereafter began his publishing career at Marvel Comics. Career As assistant editor to Jim Salicrup on Marvel's flagship Spider-Man titles, he was instrumental in acquiring the talent that increased circulation to a record 2.5 million copies. Herdling was promoted to Editorial Director of Marvel's Custom Publishing division and when the company went public in 1991, he developed the company's first Quarterly and Annual Reports, which were done as comic books. Herdling became the regular writer on Namor, the Sub-Mariner when his editor was reassigned to the book. According to Herdling, this abrupt change of plans was the reason why the first issue of his run, number 44 (November 1993), was an out-of-continuity story whose text was taken entirely from the poem \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". He was enthusiastic about his run on the series and later confided that, before the series was cancelled, he had been planning a follow-up story arc to \\"Atlantis Rising\\" called \\"Deities of the Deep\\" which would have pitted Namor against the Norse god √Ügir. In 1996, Herdling became the Creative Director at Spiderwebart Gallery, which engaged in traditional book publishing, packaging, and design. The company also represents artists on an exclusive basis, particularly the renowned fantasy painters, Greg and Tim Hildebrandt. In 1999, Herdling became Wizard Entertainment's Director of Business Development and supervised the launch of its new comic book division, Black Bull Entertainment. In May 2005, he received a Master of Science Degree in Publishing from New York University where he was awarded the Cond√© Nast Award in Magazine Publishing. Herdling has since worked as a communications specialist in the healthcare and financial sectors. He has contributed to numerous published works and has written over 80 comic books. In 2015, he published his first novel, Piper Houdini: Apprentice of Coney Island and followed it up a year later with a sequel, Piper Houdini: Nightmare on Esopus Island. In 2016, Herdling launched a YouTube channel where he performs a variety of popular songs using manualism: the art of playing flatulent tones by squeezing air through his hands. The selections include a number of Christmas carols.

Synopsis A group of young people head to Ibiza for the holiday of a lifetime ‚Äì only to find a zombie outbreak getting in the way. In the world of Ibiza Undead zombies are commonplace and a new strain of virus has started appearing across the globe, rendering its victims as flesh-eating maniacs. Britain has been severely affected, but zombie are managed and frequent checks ensure that no virus carriers make it across the borders.

His plan backfires and his 'cargo' ends up in the Mediterranean. But the undead don‚Äôt stay dead, and when they make their way ashore the holiday paradise of Ibiza soon begins to resemble a war zone.

He became successful as being the first black South African show jumper.  Biography and Career  Born in a Johannesburg township Mafokate lived with his parents in the countryside, where he worked on a farm as a groom and thereby started to love horses. The (white) owner of the farm taught him riding. 1962 he worked as a groom for professional show jumpers. He had his first chance for competitive showjumping, when his employer decided to let the black grooms compete against each other. Mafokate first competed just against other black people, as he was not allowed to compete against whites. His career ended 1962 for now, because of political problems. However, in 1975 he enrolled at the Marist Brothers College, a showjumping school, which allowed 17 black grooms at their school. Because he won many competitions he gained recognition and was furthermore called \\"black rider\\", not \\"groom\\". His international career started 1980, when he was spotted by the British rider David Broome. 1992 was the first time since 1960 for South Africa to compete at the Olympics, because prior to that South Africa was suspended because of Apartheid. Mafokate, as being the first black South African show jumper, did not competed actively, but accompanied the games as a sports ambassador. 2007 Mafokate founded the Soweto Equestrian Foundation (SEF), a non-profit riding school. It has the aim to improve the welfare of cart horses in Soweto, to open the elite world of riding to people, who would otherwise never get the chance to ride on a horse, and to get disabled children on horses. To accomplish this the pupils at the riding school only have to pay a very small membership fee. Enos Mafokate is father of the famous South African musician Arthur Mafokate and six other children.

The life cycle of C. longicollis is asexual as well as complex. Its asexual stage resides in the body of whelks where it replicates many times, and eventually its eggs are dispersed in the water through feces. C.longicollis begin their early life as free swimming miracidia larvae in the water. They go on to infect snails (intermediate host), and a variety of fishes, usually second intermediate host, in the form of a cercariae. While C.longicollis has previously been recorded in 19 fish species, researchers have found 12 other species which are viable hosts for C.longicollis making for a grand total of 31 aquatic species. The final host for this parasite are the gulls that eat the infected fish in which the parasite has formed cysts in. TOC  Life cycle  The asexual life cycle of C. longicollis is complex which involves carnivorous scavenging whelks, a variety of fish, and gulls. The asexual stages of C. longicollis reside in the body of whelks where it replicates many times, producing a stream of swimming larvae call cercariae. The cercariae then go in the water to infect a variety of different fish. While C. longicollis has previously been recorded in 19 fish species, researchers have found 12 other species which are also viable hosts for C. longicollis, making for a grand total of 31 aquatic species. The final host for this parasite are gulls, when they eat the fluke that reside in parasitised fish.Leung, T. (2016, November 26). Cardiocephaloides longicollis  Host  The occurrence of C. longicollis was restricted to 3 species of Nassaridae, N. corniculum, N. reticulatus and N. neritea. Data demonstrate that C. longicollis has a much wider host spectrum in the second intermediate host, by recently adding 12 new host records: Diplodus sargus, D. dentex, Spicara maena, Spondyliosoma cantharus, Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Pagellus bogaraveo, Oblada melanura, Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, Coris julis, C. chromis, Serranus scriba. The Sparidae, Gobiidae and Labriidae are previously recorded host families and the Pomacentridae and Serranidae as new host families, resulting in a total of 31 fish host species from nine fish families.Born-Torrijos, A., Poulin, R., Perez-del-Olmo, A., Culurgioni, J., Raga, J. A., & Holzer, A. S. (2016, June 16). \\"An optimised multi-host trematode life cycle: Fishery discards enhance trophic parasite transmission to scavenging birds\\". International Journal for Parasitology, 46(745), 753rd ser., 1-9.  Transmission by human intervention  The parasite, C. longicollis, infections fish that hang around near the sea floor or near the coast, also in shallow lagoon which is significantly higher. This is probably because they are in close proximity to the whelks which are sources of infection. Fish that are around ‚â§14 cm in length are usually infected with the parasite. The fish in those size range have on average of 73 larvae in their brain. One fish has been recorded to have 220 parasites in its brain. These larger fish live in deeper waters which are out of the gulls' reach, so regardless of their heavy larval fluke load, gulls can't get to them. Those parasites are at a dead end, where they are destined to die or end up in the stomach of another predator which is not a gull. Human intervention are the reason infection is reoccurring. As many as 31 species of fish can be infected with C. longicollis which are targeted by commercial fishing operations, or end up as by-catch. Many of those by-catch fishes are loaded with parasites and discarded at the port. This pile of parasite-laden fish present opportunistic gulls with a rich and accessible feast. Thus contributing to the transmission.Pr√©vot, G., Bartoli, P., 1980. \\"D√©monstration de l‚Äôexistence d‚Äôun cycle marin chez les Strigeides: Cardiocephalus longicollis Szidat\\", 1928 (Trematoda: Strigeidae).

Her stepson Suyurghatmish arrived in Kerman on 19 September 1280 and forced her to make him a co-ruler by 19 October, had the khutba proclaimed in his name too. She soon \\"complained to her daughter Padishah Khatun and received a yarligh forbidding her stepson to meddle in the affairs of Kirman\\".  Last years  The last years of her reign was described as a golden age of Kirman. She funded public granaries in 1263/4, receiving praise from her subjects. She was involved in construction of various public projects such as fortresses (1279), madrasas, hospitals, mosques, qanats and at least 16 charitable organizations. In 1282, however, new Ilkhan Ahmad Tekuder confirmed Suyurghatamish on the throne of Kirman under influence of her mother Qutui Khatun. Kutlugh Tarkan traveled to the Mongol court at Tabriz to protest but without success. She died in summer 1283 in Charandab district of Tabriz. She was buried at Gubba-i Sabz Mausoleum of Qutlughanids in Kirman.

The Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center is one of 29 Alzheimer's centers in the U.S. designated and funded by the National Institute on Aging. The RADC is a leader in research into the causes and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. One of its earliest research projects was the Religious Orders Study. An important influence on the development of the Religious Orders Study was the Nun Study founded by Dr. David Snowdon. The Religious Orders Study was initially funded by the National Institute on Aging in 1993. It is a study utilizing volunteers in the religious community, including priests, nuns, and brothers, who agree to donate their brains to the RADC after they die, providing doctors with an opportunity to look for postmortem correlations between lifestyle and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Scientists at the RADC use the brains to study a broad range of factors relating to Alzheimer's disease and other common diseases of age, and share tissue samples from those brains, as well as data, with other medical institutions around the country. The RADC's Memory and Aging Project (MAP) followed in 1997 and uses volunteers from the community. The study design is similar to the Religious Orders Study and enrolls volunteers without dementia who agree to annual clinical evaluation and organ donation. Both studies are ongoing, and have created research opportunities at Rush University, including the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay MIND diet research, Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), which is a study of decline in cognitive function and risk of Alzheimer's disease in older African Americans, with brain donation after death added as an optional component, the Latino CORE study, relating to older Latino adults, and a study newly-funded by NIA to study Alzheimer's disease in Brazil.

The building stands on Cotchford Lane, a private lane off the B2026 between Hartfield and Duddleswell. It is located close to the Ashdown Forest, and roughly equidistant from East Grinstead about to the west on the A22, Royal Tunbridge Wells to the east on the A26, and Uckfield to the south. Its owners have included the author A. A. Milne and the musician Brian Jones, who drowned in the swimming pool at the house in July 1969. It is listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England. The building is a timber-framed farmhouse, with \\"L\\" plan, possibly dating to the 17th century or perhaps the mid-16th century. It was probably originally built with wattle and daub infilled walls and a thatched roof, but was later refaced with red brick on the ground floor, and the roof rehung with tiles. The main block has three storeys oriented approximately north-south, with a two-storey wing to the south, and the kitchen in a single storey addition off the north end of the main block. Inside, the house has a split-level drawing room with inglenook fireplace, and views in four directions but mainly over the garden to the east and south, and also an oak-panelled dining room. Upstairs are six bedrooms, four on the first floor and two on the second floor. The building was bought as a country home by the author A. A. Milne in 1925. Milne wrote all of his Winnie-the-Pooh books at the house, often inspired by the local landscape, and died at Cotchford Farm in 1956. There are statues of Milne's son, Christopher Robin, and his character Owl in the garden, and also a sundial with a gnomon in the shape of a quill and a base carved with images of Pooh characters, including Piglet, Tigger and Roo, the initials \\"AAM\\", the words \\"This warm and sunny spot belongs to Pooh, And here he wonders what it's time to do\\". A stream runs through trees along the southern boundary of the garden, with Poohsticks Bridge approximately upstream to the west. After being owned by an American couple, the Taylors, who installed an outdoor swimming pool, the house was bought by Rolling Stones band member Brian Jones. He drowned in the swimming pool in July 1969, aged twenty-seven. The house retains some of the fittings he installed, including coloured lighting and glazing. It was bought by Alistair Johns in 1970 and became a Grade II listed building in 1982. The house was put on sale by Johns's wife Harriet Johns for ¬£2m in April 2012, including its plot with the heated outdoor swimming pool and fishpond. It failed to sell, and was put up for sale again in 2016, and was sold for ¬£1.8m in June 2017.\\"New owners want to refurbish 'Winnie the Pooh home'\\", The Argus, 1 September 2018 References * 6 bedroom detached house for sale, Rightmove, 5 October 2012 * Cotchford Lane, Hartfield, East Sussex, TN7 4DN, Savills, * No interest in Rolling Stones pool tragedy house, The Argus, 3 February 2013 * You can buy the house where Winnie the Pooh was born (if you‚Äôve got a spare ¬£1.9m), Metro, 14 March 2016 A.

Early life and education  Luella Agnes Owen was born in St. Joseph, Missouri on 8 September 1852. Her father, James Alfred Owen, was a lawyer. Her mother, Agnes Jeanette Owen (n√©e Cargill), was the child of a wealthy businessman. She was the second of five children (Mary, Luella, Florence, Herbert, and Juliette) who survived to adulthood. Her older sister, Mary Alicia Owen, was a folklorist; her younger sister, Juliette Amelia Owen, was an ornithologist and botanist. Luella attended a local private school before the Civil War. The Owen family were known Southern sympathizers. The Owen daughters were educated at home during the war years. Their mother was described as possessing \\"an eager mind and a retentive memory which gave her a solid base for the reading that throughout her life kept her well informed.\\" After the war, Luella attended St. Joseph High School and graduated as the class valedictorian in 1872. She did not attend college, but studied geology on her own. As a child, Owen showed early interest in the shells, fossils, and caves around St. Joseph, which became the subject of her later research. She was described as \\"brainy, brusque, and brave,\\" like her father.  Caves  Owen met Horace Carter Hover, a Presbyterian minister from Kansas City, in 1873 and together they went spelunking around the caves near the newly completed Missouri River bridge at St. Joseph. Later she studied glacial deposits in northern Minnesota and explored caves around southern Missouri, the Black Hills, and Yellowstone. While she sometimes faced difficulties visiting caves, in part because she was a woman, her fearless attitude encouraged men \\"cavers\\" to take her along with them. She had several mentors who were geologists, including James Todd, George Frederick Wright, and Newton Horace Winchell, that encouraged her to publish her research in foreign and American journals. Before her father's death in 1890, Owen wrote under a now-unknown pseudonym. The first article published under her own name, titled \\"Cavernes Americaines,\\" appeared in Spelunca, the bulletin of the French Societ√© de Spelelogie in 1896. At the time, she was their only woman member. She also published in the American Mining Engineer Journal and American Geologist, among others. She contributed important proof, in 1897, that the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone was the remains of a geyser basin and her last scientific paper on caves, \\"Les Cavernes de Ha Ha Tonka,\\" appeared in 1898. Researchers believe Owen conducted her field studies over a five to seven year period beginning in 1892, leading up to the 1898 publication of her book Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills. It was the first and only reference on Missouri caves for about 50 years. In her book, she was an early advocate for the preservation of caves. She wrote that: > \\"Unfortunately, most of the caves in this region [the Ozarks] have been > deprived of great quantities of their beautiful adornment by visitors who > are allowed to choose the best and remove it in such quantities as may suit > their convenience and pleasure. Those who own the caves, and those who visit > them, would do well to remember that if all the natural adornment should be > allowed to remain in its original position, it would continue to afford > pleasure to many persons for an indefinite time; but if broken, removed and > scattered the pleasure to a few will be comparatively little and that short- > lived. The gift of beauty should always be honored and protected for the > public good.\\" Owen was elected a life fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1900, she took a year-long trip around the world as a working member of the American Geographic Society, along with the famous explorer Admiral Robert E. Peary.  Loess soil  Owen studied the Pleisocene loess deposits around the Missouri River bluffs. Her first paper on the subject, \\"The Bluffs of the Missouri River\\" discussed the loess soil in the area. She wrote an article called \\"More Concerning the Lancing Skeleton\\" in the Bibliotheca Sacra in 1903 and presented a paper on \\"The Loess of St. Joseph\\" at an American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in January 1904. She published research on \\"Evidence of the Disposition of Loess\\" in American Geologist in 1905. In 1908 she went to Geneva to present her paper on \\"The Missouri River and Its Future Importance to Europe\\" at the Ninth International Geographical Congress; the paper was later published in the Scottish Geographic Magazine and reprinted in the US Congressional Record of January 28, 1913. She published her \\"Later Studies on the Loess\\" in 1926.  Death and legacy  Owen died of pneumonia on May 31, 1932. Her obituary described her thus: > \\"She [Luella] was an indefatigable student and was versed in astronomy and > chemistry. As was the fashion in education in her youth, she was taught > artistic accomplishments. Her talent for painting was quite marked, and her > family has many fine specimens of her work with the brush, especially > portraits. In her exploration of caves, she was fearless, though her daring > caused many apprehensions to those closest to her.\\" She was engaged in research up to her death in 1932. She and her sisters were remarkable both during and after their lifetimes for their scientific accomplishments. She and her sisters received an entry in the 1921 Centennial History of Missouri compiled by Walter B. Stephens and have been the subject of several biographies. Owen has even been the subject of a children's book.

Kingsland is widely quoted for its statement that the prosecution of patent applications in the Patent Office \\"requires the highest degree of candor and good faith\\" because the Patent Office \\"must rely upon [patent attorneys'] integrity and deal with them in a spirit of trust and confidence.338 U.S. at 319. Background After the Supreme Court castigated the fraud perpetrated on the Patent Office that Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co. and Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States describe,As those decisions describe, the Hartford attorneys \\"ghost wrote\\" an article praising an invention for which Hartford sought a patent, had it published under the name of a union official (to whom Hartford made a substantial payment) as its author, submitted the article to the Patent Office to overcome its otherwise \\"insurmountable opposition\\" to granting the patent, and later submitted the article to the Third Circuit to persuade it to overrule an adverse judgment in a patent infringement case. the Patent Office took disciplinary action against the Hartford patent attorneys involved, including Vernon M. Dorsey.See Hatch v. Ooms, 69 F. Supp. 788 (D.D.C. 1947), reversed, 173 F.2d 405 (D.C. Cir. 1949), reversed, 338 U.S. 318 (1949). The Patent Office found that the attorneys \\"connived with each other with the intention of misleading and deceiving the officials of the Patent Office . . . for the purpose of securing favorable action by the Patent Office with respect to the claims in the Peiler application.\\" 69 F. Supp. at 791. The Office disbarred them \\"for gross misconduct,\\"69 F. Supp. at 790. and they appealed the action by suing the Patent Commissioner in the district court. The district court affirmed the order of the Patent Office, holding: > Having determined, after due notice, a fair hearing, and upon substantial > evidence, that the petitioners were guilty of gross misconduct, it was in > the discretion of the Commissioner to determine the proper disciplinary > action in accordance with the applicable statute. I can find no abuse of > such discretion here.69 F. Supp. at 803. Opinion of court of appeals Dorsey appealed to the court of appeals, which reversed 2-1 the district court judgment.Dorsey v. Kingsland, 173 F.2d 405 (D.C. Cir. 1949). The majority found \\"indelible evidence that the conduct of the Patent Office in the whole proceeding carried out nearly two decades after the alleged commission of the offense amounts to a classic exemplification of a citizen being deprived of a valuable right (as well as honor and a means of livelihood) without due process of law or indeed without process of law of any kind except bureaucratic 'lynch law.' \\"173 F.2d at 406. The court of appeals did not use the \\"substantial evidence\\" test for reviewing an administrative agency. Instead, it held that the Commissioner's findings were not supported by \\"substantial probative evidence.\\" 173 F.2d at 410. 411, 412. The dissenting judge stated: > I think the proceedings were properly conducted. I think appellant's fraud > was fairly charged, proved, and found. I think the proof conclusive and the > result just. The public and social interests in discouraging the fraudulent > procurement of patents seem to me to outweigh appellant's interest in his > reputation and practice.

Ruling of the Supreme Court The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals 6-2 and reinstated the district court order affirming the action of the Patent Office. The majority opinion was per curiam and joined in by Chief Justice Fred Vinson and Justices Hugo Black, Stanley Reed, Harold Burton, Tom C. Clark, and Sherman Minton. Justice Robert Jackson dissented, joined by Justice Felix Frankfurter. Justice William O. Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. The majority stated that it agreed with the Patent Office that: > By reason of the nature of an application for patent, the relationship of > attorneys to the Patent Office requires the highest degree of candor and > good faith. In its relation to applicants, the Office . . . must rely upon > their integrity and deal with them in a spirit of trust and confidence.338 > U.S. at 319.

She is known for her 2016 debut novel, Here Comes the Sun, which was named a \\"Best Book of the year\\" by The New York Times, and for her best-selling novel, Patsy, acclaimed by Time, NPR, People Magazine, Oprah Magazine, and elsewhere. She lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She is a notable out lesbian and feminist author who explores themes of gender, sexuality, Jamaican life, and its diaspora in her works.  Life  Nicole Dennis-Benn was born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica. Her family lived in Vineyard Town, where she spent most of her childhood before moving to Portmore, St. Catherine. When she was 11 years old, Dennis-Benn won an academic scholarship to the prestigious St Andrew High School for Girls in Kingston. She left Jamaica at 17 due to her displeasure of race and class inequalities on the island and the very little opportunities for upward mobility. Her mother sent her off to New York to live with her father after she expressed her feelings of hopelessness in high school. She became ‚Äòa new woman‚Äô in New York, eventually feeling like a true New Yorker, though she still considers Jamaica home.\\"Get to Know Immigrants Who Are Putting Their Stamps on NYC\\", Time Out Chicago. Growing up in Jamaica, Dennis- Benn said ‚ÄòI had felt as if I were the only lesbian in a country in which police turn a blind eye to mob violence against gays and sex between men is punishable by law.‚Äô Dennis-benn, Nicole. \\"Who's Allowed to Hold Hands?\\", The New York Times, 1 September 2017. In America, she went on to attend college, receiving a bachelor's degree in Biology and Nutritional Sciences from Cornell University in 2003. She wrote throughout her college years to cope with her homesickness and found that she enjoyed writing more than her pre-med courses. In 2004 she pursued a Masters in Public Health, specializing in women's reproductive health, at the University of Michigan's top ranking MPH program in Ann Arbor, graduating in 2006. Dennis-Benn then went on to work as a Project Manager in Gender, Sexuality and Health Research in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health for four years before finally deciding to pursue her passion as a writer. While working at Columbia, she completed her MFA in Creative Writing, Fiction, from Sarah Lawrence College in 2012.

Their wedding became a viral sensation on the island, making national news. It became such a big deal as ‚Äúthe media has played it out as the first lesbian wedding‚Äù on the island. Despite fears about having a ceremony outside and attacks on same-sex couples on the island, they were able to find an open venue. She describes parts of Jamaica as safer for same-sex couples and has committed and engaged LGBT friends on the island. They were married one year after same-sex marriage became legal in New York. Friends and family joined to celebrate with many curious and excited hotel staffers, all taking pictures of the ceremony.  Awards and writing recognitions  In 2016 Dennis-Benn published her much acclaimed debut novel, Here Comes the Sun, with W.W.

Writing  Nicole Dennis-Benn's work challenges issues of ‚Äúhomophobia and sexualization of young girls, race, class socioeconomic disparities‚Äù \\"Nicole Dennis-Benn, Writer\\", PBS Newshour. In 2010, while bringing her partner to visit Jamaica, she was confronted again by all of these issues and her own identity. This solidified her decision to focus on becoming a writer rather than continue her medical career. Her writing is described throughout reviews as harsh, striking, and engaging. Her tone does what she intends and exposes the controversial underside to Jamaica's flashy tourism. Dennis-Benn hopes that her writing can ‚Äúcontribute to the greater good‚Äù and teach people important things about the places and people in her stories Revoyr, Nina, and Nicole Dennis-Benn. \\"Me Too, I Say, Me Too: Nicole Dennis-Benn on 'Here Comes the Sun'\\", Los Angeles Review of Books. The dialogue in her stories and novel is written in the patois dialect. Jennifer Senior describes it as \\"one of the book's [Here Comes the Sun's] incidental pleasures, its own melodious tune\\" It gives insight into Jamaican culture and Dennis-Benn's \\"internal speech\\".  Novels  = Here Comes the Sun = Her debut novel, Here Comes the Sun, has garnered positive critical attention and praise as it explores many of Jamaica's controversial issues. Dennis-Benn hopes her novel will get ‚Äúpeople talking and thinking‚Äù as she explores \\"themes of love, identity, sexuality, and belonging\\" that all readers may be able to connect to. Readers tell her \\"I want through that\\" as they read about the over-sexualization of girls and the hustle to thrive. A goal of the novel is to give a voice to the ignored issues and complacency in the working class. Reni Eddo-Loge describes the novel as \\"an engaging debut about exploitation and racial prejudice, as seen through the eyes of three women\\" that shows the \\"creeping colonialism of the hotel industry\\" and the \\"effect of displacement\\" on local peoples.Eddo-Lodge, Reni. \\"Here Comes the Sun by Nicole Dennis-Benn Review ‚Äì the Sinister Side of Jamaica's Tourist Trade\\", The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 22 March 2017. The novel seeks to show the racial, social, and economic disparities on Jamaica that are often covered up by the government's emphasis on unity. Poor and working class Jamaicans are exploited ‚Äúby the tourism industry to repay our [national] debt‚Äù Naive Thandi, hotel worker Margot, and tourist-trapping Dolores show in three generations the struggle that average Jamaicans face on the daily trying to survive and get opportunities for success. According to Jennifer Senior, the novel shows ‚Äúthe ugliest legacy of colonialism,‚Äù the ‚Äúself-hatred, passed down from one generation to the next‚Äù as Thandi tries to lighten her skin and her sister and mother remain caught up in the sex and tourism trades. = Patsy = Her second novel, Patsy, was released on 4 June 2019. An excerpt was published in the Feminist magazine, Lenny, in 2017.Dennis-Benn, Nicole. \\"Fiction: 'Patsy'\\", Lenny Letter, 19 December 2017. The excerpt reveals a similar use of the patois dialect and themes of identity, motherhood, gender, class, and immigration.  Themes  Dennis- Benn's works cover a number of themes including race, class, colonialism, self-acceptance, self-hatred, homophobia, love, and sexualization. = Sexuality = Her works address two sides of sexuality, the issues of being LGBT in Jamaica and the sexualization of young girls, especially by older men. Dennis-Benn was motivated to write by these issues and her experiences with them. Like the author, Margot in Here Comes the Sun lives a closeted life on Jamaica. According to Rosamund S. King, there is an increase in portrayals of same-sex couples in Jamaican literature. She explains that \\"the publication of Dennis-Benn‚Äôs...first [novel] with major US publishers‚Äîand major marketing budgets... mark a sea change in the literary landscape‚Äù and a possible resulting change in the self-identification of more Jamaican women as LGBT.King, Rosamond S. \\"One Sustained Moment: The Constant Re-Creation of Caribbean Sexualities.\\" Small Axe, vol. 21, no. 1 52, 2017, pp. 250‚Äì259, doi:10.1215/07990537-3844010. While there is more openness and literary portrayals of same-sex Caribbean characters, there is still violent signs of homophobia. Dennis-Benn explained the ability to write only once she was in America and other LGBT Jamaicans have had similar experiences. King writes that ‚Äúthe homophobia that made [LGBT authors] immigrate are taken up by the media to become an integral part of the story of the entire region‚Äù./ While laws in Jamaica still tend towards homophobia, Jamaicans themselves are less overwhelmingly homophobic according to King's study. Dennis-Benn's novel gives Jamaicans an entry point to discussing a same-sex character because while they may not understand her sexuality, there are other relatable parts to Margot's life, which humanizes the issue. = Working-class Jamaican life = Nicole Dennis-Benn describes being Jamaican as being \\"an ambassador\\" to the rest of the world. She says it feels like it is the job of working-class people to ‚Äúsell the fantasy‚Äù of what the tourists expect Jamaica to be like to them. She wanted to show who the people behind the fantasy are because working class Jamaicans and women ‚Äúare invisible.\\" It is important that visitors can see the working class and see the real Jamaican culture. In an interview with LAFB, she describes how \\"upward mobility in Jamaica is extremely difficult, which is why a lot of working-class Jamaicans leave.\\" A small number of Jamaicans, especially lighter skinned, own the resorts and profit from tourism, but many people are stuck in a rut of poverty. It is her hope that as Jamaicans read her novel and connect to themes that they will \\"realize that we are free ‚Äî free to love, free to be, and most importantly, free to change.\\" = Stigmatization and danger of sex work = In Here Comes the Sun, Margot works as a prostitute at the hotel in order to save up additional money for her younger sister, Thandi, to be able to go to private school and then college. Like many Jamaican sex works, Margot works because she has to and is often afraid that her coworkers at the hotel will find out and turn her in. Sharpe and Pinto explain that ‚ÄúCaribbean women see sex work as a legitimate way to raise money for...sending their children to private schools.\\" There is also an underriding current of sex tourism that brings both men and women in Jamaica to explore their own sexuality and fantasies of being with someone 'exotic.' Nicole Dennis-Benn shows this instantly in her novel and Margot explains how the men so often just want to see her black skin and what her body would look like. Sharpe and Pinto confirm that studies show \\"Tourists often extend the romance of their vacation on an island paradise to the sex workers themselves.\\"Sharpe, Jenny, and Samantha Pinto. \\"The Sweetest Taboo: Studies of Caribbean Sexualities; A Review Essay.\\" Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, vol. 32, no. 1, 2006, pp. 247‚Äì274, doi:10.1086/505541. The Sex Work Coalition in Jamaica works towards helping decriminalize sex work in Jamaica and advocate for the rights and safety of sex works along with ending stigma and health care discrimination. = Racial prejudice and skin whitening = Thandi, in Here Comes the Sun, struggles with her identity and popularity as a teenage girl because she is very dark skinned. She spends some of the little money they have on cream and to see an old fish wife to try and lighten her skin. Skin lightening has actually become a huge industry in Jamaica, making the sellers huge profits. She hopes if it is lighter that the boys will like her, calling her a browning (lighter skinned girl), and she will be popular at the party she is invited to later in the school year. In an article exploring the skin bleaching culture in Jamaica, Rebekah Kebebe interview Jody Cooper who explained: \\"When you black in Jamaica, nobody see you.\\" Christopher Charles notes that the bleaching culture comes out of European ideals and Colonialism since brown Jamaicans were often half-white and \\"often received greater access to land and resources as a result of their white ancestry.\\" Dennis-Benn's story ‚ÄúGrowing Up with Miss Jamaica‚Äù writes \\"Though they were strangers, our community seemed to love them more than they loved us\\" solely for their lighter skin. Being darker results in insults like \\"blackie\\" and though some people bleach for self-esteem or due to self-hatred, it has become such an ingrained part of Jamaican culture.Kebede, Rebekah. \\"Why Black Women in a Predominately Black Culture Are Still Bleaching Their Skin\\", Marie Claire, 20 December 2017. = The destructive force of tourism = Tourism is a huge part of the Jamaican economy though the money it brings in is tempered by the damage it causes to local communities and the environment. In Here Comes the Sun, Margot earns decent money at the local resort and Delores earns her money by conning tourists into buying her souvenirs. Dennis-Benn shows how people use the tourists in order to survive, but she also shows the terrible living conditions that her characters deal with as they struggle to buy enough food and the small fishing town crumbles down outside of the sight of the resort. Margot reflects on her poor school friends who are mothers and struggling even more without the chance to work at the hotel, but the only reason Margot seems to make good money is because she also does sex work. Dennis-Benn explains that as tourism picked up, \\"the developers and government alike became ravenous, indifferent\\" to the struggles of their people in the quest for profits. Tourism creates tremendous pressure on people to sell and perform.

After his death his devotees conflated his identity with two other monks named Jo√£o Maria who wandered, preached and cured in the region. There are many places where a small cross or altar marks a place where the monk \\"Jo√£o Maria\\" stopped. There are many who think that Jo√£o Maria is still working his miracles today. Life Jo√£o Maria de Jesus was originally named Anast√°s Marcaf. He was probably a Syrian of Greek ancestry. He arrived in Brazil from Argentina in 1886. When asked where he came from he said he was born in the sea and raised in Buenos Aires. One legend about Jo√£o Maria de Jesus is that he abandoned the Christian religion to marry a pagan, and fought the French expeditionary army. After his wife's death he was made a prisoner, managed to escape, and had a vision of the apostle Paul who sent him on a pilgrimage for 14 (or perhaps 40) years as penance. Other legends held that he had committed some crime, or had seduced a nun, and as penance had to wander alone in the back country. In the 1890s Jo√£o Maria de Jesus began to wander in southern Brazil. He said he had a dream that he would walk the world for fourteen years without eating meat on Wednesdays, Fridays or Saturdays, and without staying in anyone's house. Jo√£o Maria de Jesus's appearance, with a long white beard, and way of life were similar to Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini, who had preached and healed in the region earlier. He followed a similar path to D‚ÄôAgostini, and blessed several sources of water. He assumed the first monk's names and sanctity as a means to gain credibility among the people, but never claimed that he was a reincarnation of the first Jo√£o Maria. During the Federalist Revolution of 1893‚Äì95 Jo√£o Maria de Jesus attended wounded rebels. His teachings were prophetic and apocalyptic. He said God would punish mankind with plagues of insects and bloody wars. He thought the First Brazilian Republic of 1889 was the work of the devil, and defended restoration of the monarchy as the \\"order of God\\". The doctor and federalist colonel Angelo Dourado met Jo√£o Maria, who claimed to have foreseen the present war, and said the republicans were animated by the devil, and had strength and money, but the others would win even without arms. The earlier Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini, whom Jo√£o Maria de Jesus was said to resemble Jo√£o Maria de Jesus became famous as a healer, and his medicine was thought to be miraculous. It was said he could cure a person simply by praying for their health and prescribing a tea from a common herb called \\"monk's broom\\". He was quoted as saying, \\"He who does not know how to read the book of nature is illiterate in God's eyes.\\" His devotees thought that all objects or places that he touched became sacred, and would provide the hermit's blessings after he had disappeared. Jo√£o Maria de Jesus avoided gatherings of followers, and did not spend long in one place, so was less of a hermit than the first Jo√£o Maria. He performed sacraments such as baptism despite being a layman, which caused conflicts with the clergy. Jo√£o Maria de Jesus disappeared in 1908. He may have died in 1908 in hospital in Ponta Grossa, Paran√°, or may be buried in Lagoa Vermelha, Rio Grande do Sul. His devotees think the monk is still living in the Morro Tai√≥, a hill in Santa Catarina. Legends One legend tells that when Jo√£o Maria de Jesus was passing through Ponta Grossa early in the 1900s some children playing in the street threw stones at him. The monk calmly called for retribution, saying, \\"Rude city, the stones that hurt me now will multiply and come back to you one day.\\" According to the legend on 11 September 1906 an intense rain of stones fell in the town, damaging or destroying several houses. This is just one of several legends in which a cruel streak appears when the monk was offended in some way. A common legend is that in the middle of storms the monk sat outside but did not get wet. Others said he could be praying in his cave and at the same time be next to a sick man, helping him. He was said to be able to become invisible to his persecutors, walk over the water of rivers, drive out evil spirits and calm storms, among other miracles. He was said to be immune to Indians and wild animals, who never attacked him. There are many stories of healing. The legends have become part of the folklore of the region. Legacy Hand- colored photograph from 1898 Jo√£o Maria de Jesus and Jo√£o Maria D‚ÄôAgostini were the two best-known of the monks named \\"Jo√£o Maria\\" who wandered in the region preaching in the last part of the 19th century. There is a large literature about the monks called Jo√£o Maria, but the devout population have little interest in their historicity and are much more concerned with the sacred characteristics attributed to them. There are people today who think that Jo√£o Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles. There are many places in the center and east of Paran√° and Santa Catarina, the south of S√£o Paulo and the north of Rio Grande do Sul, where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the \\"Jo√£o Marias\\" would have passed. The various wanderers recognized as the monk or prophet Jo√£o Maria all have strong similarities. They are pilgrims, without home or family. They have withdrawn from the pleasures of the world to do penance by serving God. They preach the Apocalypse, when God will punish all sinners. They have the miraculous power of healing, and they are immortal. Jo√£o Maria de Jesus was photographed by Herculano Fonseca of Ponta Grossa in 1898, and these photographs were copied by a photographer from Caxias do Sul, Gi√°como Geremia, who sold many copies of them. In the 1970s and 1980s the images were widely distributed among the local Kaingang and Xokleng people by leaders of the Indian Missionary Council. These photographs continue to be widely reproduced in southern Brazil today. Some have the legend \\"Proph√©ta J√µao Maria de Jes√∫z, 180 anos\\". Others calls him \\"Santo\\" (saint) with the legend \\"Jo√£o Maria de Jesus com 188 anos\\", which would give a birth date around the time when the first Jo√£o Maria was born. A painting that copies one of the photographs has the legend \\"J√µao Maria de Agostinho Propheta\\", reflecting the confusion with the earlier Jo√£o Maria. The monk stayed near a spring of water in the Uvaranas neighborhood of Ponta Grossa. The place was still being visited by devotees in 2012. A woman who cares for the site at that time said she had witnessed three apparitions of Jo√£o Maria de Jesus.

Unlike its isomer phytane, crocetane has a tail-to-tail linked isoprenoid skeleton. Crocetane has been detected in modern sediments and geological records as a biomarker, often associated with anaerobic methane oxidation. Research Crocetane was first studied in the late 1920s and early 1930s for the structural identification of crocetin, which is its polyunsaturated diacid analogue. The infrared spectrum was reported in 1950, the mass spectrum was described in 1968 and the 1H and 13C NMR spectra was obtained in 1990s. In 1994, Liangqiao Bian first reported strong 13C depletion in crocetane from anoxic sediments in the Kattegat. Such low 13C content is thought to originate from microbes harvesting biogenic methane, which is always 13C depleted, as a carbon source. Years later several groups made similar observations in either modern or ancient sediments near methane seeps. Crocetane was found in environments with anaerobic methane oxidizing consortium, composed of methanotrophic archea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. These work makes crocetane the first biomarker of anaerobic methanotrophy. In 2009, Ercin Maslen and her colleagues detected crocetane in highly-mature Devonian sediments and crude oils of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. They propose that natural product precursor for this crocetane is green sulfur bacteria derived isorenieratene and palaerernieratene, which means that crocetane can also be related to photic zone euxinia in highly matured samples. Analysis Due to structural similarities, crocetane often co- elutes with phytane and is hard to identify. People have been using specialized gas chromatographic methods to achieve partial separation. For example, Volker Thiel and his colleagues used a 25-m squalene capillary column with hydrogen as a carrier gas. For the same reason mass spectra of crocetane and phytane are very similar except for that crocetane does not have intense m/z=183 fragments. To identify crocetane, the mass spectrometer can be operated in selection ion monitoring(SIM) mode to monitor m/z 113, 169, 183, 197 and 282. Paul Greenwood and Roger Summons in 2003 reported using GC MS-MS instrument to measure the daughter ion of m/z 196‚Üí127/126 and 168‚Üí126 to distinguish crocetane from phytane.

Through the performances which exhibit unparalleled religious devotion and energy, the performers narrate the many stories of Krishna often moving the spectators to tears. It is practiced primarily by the Vaishnava community in Manipur and by the Vaishnava Manipuri population settled in the neighbouring States of Tripura and Assam. \\"Sankirtana: Ritual singing, drumming and dancing of Manipur\\" was inscribed on the Representative List of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity during the eighth session of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, held in December 2013. An outline of the performance The Nomination file for Inscription on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity prepared by Sangeet Natak Akademi describes this performing art thus: \\"Starting with ritual observances which involve singing and dancing in the temples of Manipur, Sankirtana encompasses an array of arts performed also in the home and the street to mark occasions of religious import and stages in the life of the Vaishnava people inhabiting the Manipur plains. The theology and lore of Krishna is central to these performances, but they assimilate in their rendering formal features carried over from music and dance in Manipur‚Äôs pre-Vaishnavite past. The core of Sankirtana practice is to be found in the temple, where it narrates through song and dance the lives and deeds of the Lord. These are typically presented in the round, in a hall (Mandapa) attached to the temple before devotees. The main repertoire consists of Nata Pala, which is performed all over the Manipur valley. The Ariba Pala and Manohar Sai Pala, less often in evidence today, are also temple-centred. Outside the temple, Sankirtana assumes forms such as the Holi Pala celebrating the festival of colours in springtime or Shayan performed in the winter months. Khubak Eshei is celebrated within the temple during the rains, marking the chariot festival of the Lord. In the setting of the home, Sankirtana is offered as prayer at all life-cycle ceremonies, such as the ear-piercing ritual (for both males and females in childhood), the donning of the sacred thread (for adolescent males), marriage, and the rites of passage at death. Thus pervading the life of the Manipuri Vaishnava, Sankirtana is regarded as the visible manifestation of God.\\" References External links *A video on Sankirtana, ritual singing, drumming and dancing of Manipur, prepared by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India, and published by UNESCO (duration 9 minutes 57 seconds): Sankirtana Culture of Manipur Dance in India ","title":"Manipuri Sankirtana"},{"id":"52448763","text":"In Embryology a phylotypic stage or phylotypic period is a particular developmental stage or developmental period during mid-embryogenesis where embryos of related species within a phylum express the highest degree of morphological and molecular resemblance. Recent molecular studies in various plant and animal species were able to quantify the expression of genes covering crucial stages of embryo development and found that during the morphologically defined phylotypic period the evolutionary oldest genes, genes with similar temporal expression patterns, and genes under strongest purifying selection are most active throughout the phylotypic period.  Historical origins of concept  reproduced by G.J. Romanes in 1892. Early embryologists, including Haeckel and von Baer, noted that embryos of different animals pass through a similar stage in which they resemble one another very closely. Karl Ernst von Baer, whose third law of embryology gave the basis for the idea of the phylotypic stage The idea that embryos of different species have similar morphologies at some point during development can be traced back to Aristotle. Aristotle observed a number of developing vertebrate embryos, noting in his text The Generation of Animals that the morphological differences among the different embryos arose late in development. In 1828, Karl Ernst von Baer created his laws of embryology, which summarized the results of his comparative embryogenesis studies. In his first law, he proposed that the more general characters of a group appear earlier in their embryos than the more special characters. In 1866, Ernst Haeckel proposed that each developing organism passes through the evolutionary stages of its ancestors, i.e., ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. The hypothesis that different organisms pass through the developmental stages of closely related organisms is outdated. However, the idea that early stages of development are conserved among species, with increasing divergence as development progresses, has influenced modern evolutionary and developmental biology. The early conservation or funnel model of development (see below) is closely tied to these historical origins.  Phylotypic period  The first formulation of the phylotypic period concept came in 1960 from Friedrich Seidel's K√∂rpergrundgestalt, which translates to ‚Äúbasic body shape.‚Äù In 1977, Cohen defined the phyletic stage as the first stage that reveals the general characters shared by all members of that phylum. Klaus Sander revised this concept in 1983 and named it the phylotypic stage, which is ‚Äò‚Äòthe stage of greatest similarity between forms which, during evolution, have differently specialized both in their modes of adult life and with respect to the earliest stages of ontogenesis.\\" Note that this definition demonstrates his support for the hourglass model (see below). Recent papers refer to the phylotypic period, or the phylotypic stage, as a period of maximal similarity between species within each animal phylum. While this concept was originally devised using morphological comparisons of developing embryos from different species, the period of maximal similarity has recently been identified using molecular evidence. The phylotypic period has been identified using conservation of gene expression, estimates of gene age, gene sequence conservation, the expression of regulatory genes and transcription factors, and the interconnectivity of genes and proteins.  Funnel and hourglass models  The funnel model is the hypothesis that the most conserved stage of development (the phylotypic period) occurs at the beginning of embryogenesis, with increasing divergence as development progresses. This is also known as the early conservation model of development. Evidence for an alternative model arose from careful comparisons of the temporal divergence in morphology of the embryos of different species. For example, Klaus Sander noticed that the ‚Äúincredible variation in larvae and adults‚Äù of insects occurs after they \\"develop from nearly identical rudiments in the germ band stage\\". The most conserved stage of development, the germ band stage, occurs near the middle of development rather than at the beginning, supporting a mid-developmental period of maximal similarity between species. This model, called the hourglass model, is the idea that early embryos of different species display divergent forms but their morphologies converge in the middle of development, followed by a period of increasing divergence. = Support for hourglass model = Contrary to the early morphological work by von Baer and Haeckel, recent morphological studies have demonstrated the greatest divergence among closely related species both early in development (gastrulation) and late in development, supporting the hourglass model. Further support for the hourglass model came from the discovery that Hox genes, a group of sequentially activated genes that regulate anterior-posterior body axis formation, are activated during the middle of development at the phylotypic stage. Because these genes are highly conserved and are involved in body axis formation, the activation of Hox genes could be an important player in the heightened conservation among embryos of closely related species during mid-development. The advent of next-generation sequencing enabled scientists to use molecular methods to identify the period of development that has the most conserved gene expression patterns among different species. In 2010, two studies found molecular evidence that supports the hourglass model. Kalinka et al. sequenced the transcriptome of six Drosophila species over developmental time, identifying the most conserved gene expression in mid-development during the arthropod germ band developmental stage. Genes that were enriched in the developing embryos at the germ band stage are involved in cellular and organismal development. Domazet- Lo≈°o and Tautz analyzed the transcriptome of zebrafish (Danio rerio) over developmental time, from unfertilized eggs to adults. They used a method called genomic phylostratigraphy to estimate the age of each gene during development. In zebrafish, as well as in additional transcriptomic datasets of Drosophila, the mosquito Anopheles and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the authors found that genes expressed during mid-development are older than those expressed at the beginning and end of development, supporting the hourglass model. Other recent genomic studies have supported a mid- developmental phylotypic stage in vertebrates and in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The temporal gene expression profiles for a developing mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus), frog (Xenopus laevis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) revealed that the most conserved gene expression in vertebrates occurs in mid-development at the pharyngular embryo stage. The pharyngula stage occurs when the four distinguishing features of vertebrates (notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, post-anal tail, and a series of paired branchial slits) have developed. = Support for early conservation (funnel) model = Recent molecular data also provide support for the early conservation model. For example, Piasecka et al. re-analyzed the zebrafish dataset published by Domazet-Lo≈°o and Tautz. They found that applying a log-transformation to the gene expression data changed the results to support highest conservation in early development. Further, after clustering the zebrafish gene expression data into ‚Äútranscription modules‚Äù reflecting each stage of development, they found multiple lines of evidence supporting the early conservation model (gene sequence, age, gene family size, and expression conservation) while only the analysis of gene regulatory regions supported the hourglass model. One hypothesis for the evolutionary conservation during the phylotypic period is that it is a period characterized by a high level of interactions as the body plan is being established. In zebrafish, the interconnectivity of proteins over developmental time was found to be highest in early development, supporting the early conservation model. Another way to examine the point in development at which developmental constraints are the strongest is through experimental gene loss, because the removal of a gene should be more deleterious when it is expressed at a developmental stage with stronger evolutionary constraints. Gene knockout experiments from mice and zebrafish demonstrated that the ratio of essential genes to non-essential genes decreases over developmental time, suggesting that there are stronger constraints in early development that are relaxed over time. Despite increasing evidence supporting the hourglass model, identifying the point in development that is most conserved among species with a phylum (the phylotypic period) is a controversy in the field of developmental biology.  Intra- phylum vs. inter-phylum phylotypic period  The phylotypic period is defined as a period of maximal similarity between species with a phylum, but a recent study compared the phylotypic period across different phyla to examine whether the same conserved periods during development have been maintained across deeper phylogenetic relationships. Levin et al. compared the developmental gene expression patterns among ten individuals from ten different animal phyla and found evidence for an inverse hourglass model of gene expression divergence among different phyla. This inverse hourglass model reflects the observation that gene expression was significantly more divergent among species at the mid-developmental transition, while gene expression was more conserved in early and late stages of development. While this intriguing pattern could have implications for our definition of a phylum, a follow-up paper argued that there are a few methodical issues that must be addressed to test the hypothesis that the timing of developmental constraints are different among phyla compared to within a phylum. First, the comparison of a single representative of ten different phyla could reflect differences between phyla as well as the deeper or shallower phylogenetic branches that fall between those ten individuals, so greater sampling within each phyla is necessary. Second, pairwise comparisons treat each of the ten species as independent observations, but some species are more closely related than others.

During his long career, American film director David Lynch has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell into development hell or were officially cancelled.  1970s  = Gardenback = Before starting work on Eraserhead, he worked on a script titled Gardenback, based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. Gardenback was a surrealist script about adultery, featuring a continually growing insect that represented one man's lust for his neighbor. He presented the script to the AFI, but they rejected it as they felt the planned 45-minute runtime was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script. = Ronnie Rocket = After the success of Eraserhead, Lynch decided to focus on the screenplay of his second film, entitled Ronnie Rocket, which he also wanted to direct. The film's plot would have told the story of a detective seeking to enter a mysterious second dimension, aided by his ability to stand on one leg. He is being obstructed on this quest by a strange landscape of odd rooms and a threatening train; while being stalked by the \\"Donut Men\\", who wield electricity as a weapon. In addition to the detective's story, the film was to show the tale of Ronald d'Arte, a teenage dwarf, who suffers a surgical mishap which leaves him dependent on being plugged into an electrical supply at regular intervals; this dependence grants him an affinity over electricity which he can use to produce music or cause destruction. The boy names himself Ronnie Rocket and becomes a rock star, befriending a tap- dancer named Electra-Cute. Michael J. Anderson and Dexter Fletcher were attached to the lead role at different times. However, the project never materialized due to financial conflicts, so Lynch left the production and decided to direct The Elephant Man instead. Also, Anderson finally worked with Lynch in Twin Peaks.  1980s  = The Metamorphosis = At some point in the 1980s, Lynch adapted Franz Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis into a feature film screenplay. The project never came to fruition due to budgetary concerns to do with the expense of realizing Lynch's vision of the insect the protagonist of the story transforms into and also Lynch's eventual reluctance at adapting the novella, himself believing it was \\"better left as a book\\". = Venus Descending = In 1987, after the success of Blue Velvet, Lynch was hired by a Warner Bros. executive to direct a film based on the life of famous actress Marilyn Monroe, based on the best-selling book Goddess. He co-wrote the script with writer Mark Frost, the first of many collaborations for the two. The film would have revolved around the last few months of life of Monroe (named Rosilyn Ramsay for legal reasons), before her supposed assassination at hands of Bobby Kennedy (renamed Phillip Malloy). However, one of the project's producers decided to drop it, and Lynch decided to focus on One Saliva Bubble. = One Saliva Bubble = On May 20, 1987, Lynch and Mark Frost finished their script for a film project entitled One Saliva Bubble. The film's plot centered around the small town of Newtonville, Kansas, where a secret government project goes amok. The result is an exchange of identities of several of the townsfolk. Steve Martin was attached to star in the lead role, although Martin Short was also rumored to take that part. In the chapter 'Marty Throws A Party Just To Sing' of his 2014 autobiography, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, Martin Short states, \\"We bought the house on the basis of the income I was about to make from two pending movies. You can guess what happened next. Practically the second we signed the mortgage, one of the two movies, a David Lynch film with Steve Martin entitled, 'One Saliva Bubble', fell through.\\" However, the film never came to fruition for unknown reasons, so Lynch left the project to focus on Northwest Passage (which would later become Twin Peaks).  1990s  = Untitled Twin Peaks spin-off = During the filming of Twin Peaks around the 1990s, Lynch considered at one point to release a spin-off film of the series film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me centered around the character Audrey Horne. Actress Sherilyn Fenn was attached to reprise her role. While the project was not ultimately made, elements of the planned story later inspired Lynch's film Mulholland Drive. = Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me sequel = Before the release of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, Lynch planned to release a sequel to the film for being a continuation of the series after its cancellation. He also planned a third film. However, these plans were scrapped after the bad reception of Fire Walk with Me. = Dream of the Bovine = Around 1994, Lynch and Twin Peaks writer Robert Engels co-wrote a script entitled Dream of the Bovine. Engels described the script as being about \\"three guys, who used to be cows, living in Van Nuys and trying to assimilate their lives.‚Äù Harry Dean Stanton was attached to star and he and Lynch tried to convince Marlon Brando to co-star, but Brando was not interested, calling the script \\"pretentious bullshit\\". = Mulholland Drive television series = In 1998, Lynch conceived the idea to make a TV series entitled Mulholland Drive. The project started as a 90-minute pilot produced by Touchstone Television and intended to be picked by the ABC network. However, during the filming of the pilot, ABC decided to not pick up the series. Lynch reworked the pilot as a feature film, which was released in 2001. = Woodcutters from Fiery Ships = In 1998, Synergy Interactive, a Japanese video game production company, announced that they were developing a computer game entitled Woodcutters from Fiery Ships, designed primarily by Lynch. Lynch was impressed with their earlier game Gadget: Invention, Travel, & Adventure, which he said \\"delivered an immersive experience to the user\\". Lynch described the plot of Woodcutters as such: \\"Certain events have happened in a bungalow which is behind another in Los Angeles. And then suddenly the woodcutters arrive and they take the man who we think has witnessed these events, and their ship is... uh, silver, like a 30\`s kind of ship, and the fuel is logs. And they smoke pipes.\\" The game was cancelled in November of 1999, due to concerns that its \\"conundrum\\"‚Äìlike story would be uninteresting to computer game players.  2010s  = Antelope Don't Run No More = In 2010, Lynch wrote his first film since Inland Empire, entitled Antelope Don't Run No More. The film is said to be set in Los Angeles and features \\"space aliens, talking animals, and a beleaguered musician named Pinky\\". Lynch was unable to secure financing for the project.

The species is known from Miocene sediments exposed in central Oregon, US. It is one of several extinct species belonging to the living section Rubra. History and classification A. taggarti is known from a number of isolated leaves and fruits found at two related locations in Northeast central Oregon. Fruits and leaves, including the holotype specimen, were collected from the White Hills site, while an additional leaf was identified from the Meadow site, both of the Mascall Formation. The Mascall formation is composed of temporary lake beds interbedded with lava flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. The alluvial system was active along the southern slope of the Columbia River Plateau during the Miocene climatic optimum. The climatic optimum and low topological relief resulted in a paleoclimate that was temperate and humid, experiencing cool to cold winters and warm dry summers. Leaves from the Mascall formation were examined by Ralph Chaney and Daniel Axelrod in their 1959 Miocene floras of the Columbia Plateau. They suggested the Acer fossils were from three distinct species Acer bendirei, Acer bolanderi, and Acer glabroides. The Acer fossils were re-studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. They determined that some of the Mascall formation fossils belonged to an undescribed Acer section Eriocarpa species. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. taggarti in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name taggarti is in recognition of Ralph E. Taggart, who supplied access to collections of Succor Creek Formation fossils and for his work on successional aspects of Neogene plant assemblages. The A. taggarti holotype specimen, a leaf from the Meadow site numbered UCMP 9104, is housed in the University of California Museum of Paleontology collections along with the twelve paratypes - six leaves and six fruits - that are all (except for one leaf) from the Meadow site. Acer taggarti is one of a number of Acer species described from the Mascall Formation which Wolfe and Tanai placed into 9 sections in the genus, following the Acer taxonomy structure defined by Japanese botanist Ken Ogata. Of the eleven species in the Mascall Formation, two, including A. taggarti, were placed into the Section \\"Eriocarpa\\", now considered part of Section Rubra. The two other species placed into Section Rubra are A. chaneyi and A. tigilense. Based on the vein structuring in the fruits, Wolfe and Tanai inferred that the middle miocene Acer whitebirdense was a probable descendant of A. kenaicum, known from the Oligocene of Alaska. They also suggested that A. taggarti was a descendant of A. whitebirdense, based on similarities in the leaves. Description Leaves of A. taggarti are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and have an asymmetrical ovate outline. the asymmetry results in leaf bases ranging between cordate and rounded on either side of the petiole. The leaves are between three and five-lobed, though they tend towards being three lobed. The upper-middle side lobes are a least two thirds as long as the middle lobe, while the outermost side lobes are small when present. There are typically one or two teeth on the outside margins of the outside lobes, one tooth at most on the inside of the lobes, and one or two teeth on each side of the middle lobe. The leaves have an overall size range of approximately to an estimated , and widths ranging between . The leaves have three to five secondary veins that diverge from the most apical primary veins and three to five medial secondary vein pairs running between lobes. The third order veins are spaced between apart and the fourth order venation form a pattern of irregular polygons. The fifth order veins are not preserved in the fossils. The fruits are a samara with the nutlet at the base and a wing extending up from the nutlet. The elliptical nutlet ranges between in length, with a long attachment scar along the wing base. Eight to twelve veins spread from the attachment scar across the nutlet and then converge at the nut tip. Six to eight veins extend into the wing, running along the proximal edge and the forking veins running from the vascular group fork at angles between 10¬∞ and 30¬∞. The wings are between long with a straight upper margin that broadly curves towards the wing apex, and the distal margin forming a wide v-shaped sulcus. Chaney & Axelrod suggested the fruits belonged to a Acer section Saccharina species, but Wolfe and Tanai note the lack of reticulated venation on the nutlet excludes that placement, and placed the fruits into Acer section Rubra. Many of the fruits show irregular folds on the nutlet, that Wolfe and Tanai suggested were the result of a thin endocarp.

Although it is similar to styles of hot pot common in this region, its chief difference lies in the fact that the ingredients are already cooked when served, and hence no simmering is done at the table. Maocai Raw vegetables and meat to be selected at a maocai restaurant Common Ingredients Although there is great variation in the ingredients used in maocai, typically any of the following vegetables are included: lotus root, potato slices, Chinese cabbage, cucumber, winter melon, cauliflower, wood ear, enoki, oyster mushrooms, seaweed, bamboo shoots, tofu, yuba, beansprouts, as well as rice vermicelli and cellophane noodles made of sweet potato starch. The meats most frequently encountered are beef, pork and lamb, although other meats and more specific cuts may be used too. Preparation The name maocai is derived from the verb mao (; Chengdu dialect: ) which in Sichuanese Mandarin refers to the blanching of the ingredients in a colander in hot water by moving the colander up and down repeatedly. This pre-cooking of the ingredients before immersion in the stock sets it apart from most types of hot pot. References Chinese cuisine ","title":"Maocai"},{"id":"52449456","text":"Albert L.

Royalton used to be a farming community with a population of 150 and one church. Today Royalton remains a farming community, made up mainly of larger potato farms along with a large Christmas tree farm and maple sugar bush and some cattle farming. The Royalton Community Church, formerly the Royalton Wesleyan Church, is still in operation after more than 100 years at the corner of Royalton Road and Crawford Road. Crawford Road, a dirt road that links Royalton to Knoxford, was first given the name Piper Road when the 911 system was introduced in New Brunswick. A complaint was made pointing out that the only tie the Piper family had to the road was a pasture filled with cows on the Knoxford side, while the Crawford family had a home and farm on the Royalton side. The name was changed. Around the same time, that area of Royalton was named Lower Royalton, but community members argued that it had always simply been known as Royalton, and so the name of the community was officially changed to Royalton.
