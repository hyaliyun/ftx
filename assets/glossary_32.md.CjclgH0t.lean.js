Mosaics were some of the most popular and historically significant art forms produced in the empire, and they are still studied extensively by art historians. Although Byzantine mosaics evolved out of earlier Hellenistic and Roman practices and styles, craftspeople within the Byzantine Empire made important technical advances and developed mosaic art into a unique and powerful form of personal and religious expression that exerted significant influence on Islamic art produced in Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates and the Ottoman Empire. In addition, Byzantine mosaics went on to influence artists in the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, in the Republic of Venice, and, carried by the spread of Orthodox Christianity, in Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania and Russia. In the modern era, artists across the world have drawn inspiration from their focus on simplicity and symbolism, as well as their beauty. Historical context Further information: Roman mosaic Further information: Hellenistic art Further information: Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy The byzantine mosaic art originated in the Greek tradition of road-building, since Greek roads were often made using small pebbles organized into patterns. By the Hellenistic Period, floor and wall art made of natural pebbles was common in both domestic and public spaces. Later, as the Roman Empire expanded and became the dominant cultural force in the Mediterranean and Near East, Roman artists were heavily influenced by the Greek art they encountered and began installing mosaics in public buildings and private homes throughout the empire. They also added small clay or glass pieces called tesserae, a material that were also being in use during the Hellenistic period creating more colorful and finely-detailed images. Justinian I, as depicted in mosaic in the 383x383px In 330CE, the emperor Constantine moved the empire's capital from Rome to Byzantium (modern- day Istanbul), renaming it Constantinople after himself. Historians generally use this date for the beginning of the Byzantine Empire and divide Byzantine art into three historical periods: early (c. 330‚Äì750), middle (c. 850‚Äì1204) and late (c. 1261‚Äì1453).  The early period  Sixth century mosaic ceiling of the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy Further information: Mosaic#Ravenna Further information: Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East Constantine's conversion to Christianity lead to extensive building of Christian basilicas in the late 4th century, in which floor, wall, and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses. The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and Santa Pudenziana, both from the 4th century, still exist. In another great Constantinian basilica, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The reign of Justinian I in the 6th century coincided with the first golden age of the Byzantine Empire. In 537, he completed the construction of a new patriarchal cathedral in the capital city of Constantinople that would be the global center of the Orthodox Church: the Hagia Sofia. At the time, it was the world's largest building and considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture. The cathedral was decorated throughout with what were undoubtedly some of the most incredible figurative mosaics of this time period, but unfortunately these were all destroyed during the Iconoclasms that followed. The oldest mosaics that exist today in the Hagia Sofia date from the 10th through the 12th centuries, not this earlier period. After Rome was sacked, Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until 476, when the empire collapsed after being conquered by Theodoric the Great and the Ostrogoths. While Ravenna was under Gothic control, Arian patrons had embarked upon a notable building program of chapels and baptisteries in Ravenna. In 535, the city was conquered by Justinian I, who created the Exarchate of Ravenna, effectively making Ravenna the seat of Byzantine power on the Italian Peninsula. Orthodox bishops under Justinian continued and expanded the construction of basilicas to the adjacent port city of Classe, commissioning some of the finest mosaics anywhere in the world. Surviving monuments, some of which predate Exarchate, include the Basilica of San Vitale, the Archiepiscopal Chapel, the Arian Baptistry, the Neonian Baptistry, the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the Basilica Sant‚ÄôApollinare Nuovo, the Mausoleum of Theodoric and the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe. All eight of these monuments have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as superb examples of early Christian mosaic art. Rotunda in Thessaloniki, Greece, which are some of the earliest remaining examples of early Christian mosaic art Although it might be the most famous, Ravenna is by no means the only place where early Byzantine Mosaics are well-preserved today. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece was the second most important city in the empire in terms of both wealth and size, and like Ravenna its early Christian monuments have been designated UNESCO World Heritage sites. Masterpieces of early mosaic art in Thessaloniki include the Church of Hosios David, the Hagios Demetrios, and the Rotunda. In addition, archeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries unearthed many Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East, including the Madaba Map in Jordan as well as other examples in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Palestine. The Iconoclasm 10th century mosaic in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey The events that mark the division between early and middle Byzantine art are called the Iconoclastic Controversies, which took place from 726‚Äì842. This period is defined by a deep skepticism towards icons; in fact, Emperor Leo III placed an outright ban on the creation of religious images, and authorities within the Orthodox Church encouraged the widespread destruction of religious art, including mosaics. As a result, the iconoclastic period drastically reduced the number of surviving examples of Byzantine art from the early period, especially large religious mosaics. Middle and late Byzantine mosaics Further information: Macedonian Renaissance Following the Iconoclasm, Byzantine artists were able to resume creating religious images, which people accepted not as idols to be worshiped, but as symbolic and ceremonial elements of religious ritual spaces. The first part of this period, from 867‚Äì1056, is sometimes called the Macedonian Renaissance and is seen as the second golden age of the Byzantine Empire. Churches throughout the empire, and especially the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, were redecorated with some of the finest examples of Byzantine art ever created. For instance, the monasteries at Hosios Loukas, Daphni, and Nea Moni of Chios have all been recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and they contain some of the most magnificent Byzantine mosaics from this period. 11th century mosaic by Byzantine artists in Torcello Cathedral, Venice, Italy Until the disastrous sack of Constantinople in 1204 at the hands of the Fourth Crusader Army, Byzantium was seen by many in Europe as the last light of civilization due to its inherited legacy of Rome and continued cultural sophistication. So during the 10th and 11th centuries, even states that were at odds with the Byzantine Empire imitated Byzantine style and sought out Greek artists to create religious mosaic cycles. For instance, the Norman King Roger II of Sicily was actively hostile to Byzantium, but he imported Greek craftspeople to create the mosaics for Cefal√π Cathedral. Similarly, the earliest surviving mosaics in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice were probably created by artists who had left Constantinople in the mid-11th century and also worked at Torcello Cathedral.  Techniques  Like other mosaics, Byzantine mosaics are made of small pieces of glass, stone, ceramic, or other material called tesserae. During the Byzantine period, craftsmen expanded the materials that could be turned into tesserae, beginning to include gold leaf and precious stones, and perfected their construction. Before the tesserae could be laid, a careful foundation was prepared with multiple layers, the last of which was a fine mix of crushed lime and brick powder. On this moist surface, artists drew images and used tools like strings, compasses, and calipers to outline geometric shapes before the tesserae were carefully cemented into position to create the final image. 11th century Byzantine mosaic of Daphni Monastery in Haidari, a suburb of Athens, Greece  Aesthetics  In Byzantine religious art, unlike the Classical Greek and Roman art that preceded it, symbolism became more important than realism. Instead of concentrating on making the most realistic images possible, mosaic artists of this time wanted to create idealized and sometimes exaggerated images of what existed inside the soul of a person. In addition, when used in a religious space, the overall effect created by a sea of glittering, brightly-colored and gilded tesserae took precedence over literal realism. The goal of the artist was to create an overall feeling of awe, of being in a spiritual realm, or even the sense of being in the presence of God. Details were not supposed to distract from the main themes. However, not all Byzantine mosaics were religious in nature. In fact, mosaic art was commonly used to decorate the floors and walls of public and private spaces with geometric patterns and secular figurative subjects.  Influence and legacy  The mosaics in the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem show the influence of Byzantine designs Some Western art historians have dismissed or overlooked Byzantine art in general. For example, the deeply influential painter and historian Giorgio Vasari defined the Renaissance as a rejection of \\"that clumsy Greek style\\" (\\"quella greca goffa maniera\\"). However, Byzantine artists and their mosaics in particular were highly influential on the rapidly expanding Islamic decorative arts, on Keivan Rus', and modern and contemporary artists across the world. Islamic art began in the 7th century with artists and craftsmen mostly trained in Byzantine styles, and though figurative content was greatly reduced, Byzantine decorative styles remained a great influence on Islamic art. As Eastern Orthodox Christianity spread northward and eastward, the Byzantine empire became economically and culturally tied to Kievan Rus'. In the late 10th century, Vladimir the Great introduced Christianity with his own baptism and, by decree, extended it to all inhabitants of Kiev. By the 1040s, Byzantine mosaic artists were working in the Hagia Sophia at Kiev, leaving a lasting legacy not only on Russian decorative arts but also medieval painting. In the modern and contemporary eras, artists like Antoni Gaud√≠ have continued to draw inspiration and influence from the indelible beauty of Byzantine mosaic art.

It is a stream of \\"local importance\\" according to History of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, and is located between Little Mountain and the Shamokin Hills. The area in its vicinity was settled by the first half of the 1800s and several bridges have been constructed over the stream. Its watershed is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Hallowing Run looking upstream in its lower reaches Hallowing Run begins in a small valley in Lower Augusta Township. It flows north for a few tenths of a mile and enters a much larger and deeper valley. Here, the stream flows north-northwest for a short distance before turning west-southwest for a few miles. In this reach, it flows through the valley alongside Hallowing Run Road and receives several unnamed tributaries: seven from the left and three from the right. The stream then turns south-southwest and its valley narrows. It begins flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 147. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it leaves its valley and turns west. The stream then crosses Pennsylvania Route 147 and a railroad and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Hallowing Run joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Hydrology Hallowing Run is not designated as an impaired waterbody. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Hallowing Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. A total of 125 tons of riprap were once placed along of Hallowing Run. Dark olive rocks of the Chemung Formation occur in the vicinity of the stream's mouth. Hallowing Run was described as a stream of \\"local importance\\" in J.J.

The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Sunbury. The stream's designated use is for aquatic life. Flash flooding impacts some reaches of Hallowing Run. Such flooding damages agricultural land in the area and causes streambank erosion. However, stormwater drainage and moderate flooding does not typically cause problems on the stream. Hallowing Run and a number of other streams in its vicinity experienced bank flooding in January 1996. However, recovery and damage repair were underway later that year. In 2013, the Northumberland County Conservation District was awarded a $356,000 Growing Greener grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for Hallowing Run and Schwaben Creek. History Hallowing Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1176401. The stream is also known as Hollowing Run. This name appears in Israel C. White's 1883 book The geology of the North Branch Susquehanna River Region in the six counties of Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour and Northumberland. By the early to mid 1800s, the area in the vicinity of Hallowing Run was somewhat settled, with farms, mills, and a small number of schoolhouses. A roadway known as Hallowing Run Road also passed through the area, connecting with the Harrisburg Road and the Tulpehocken Road. Many of the early settlers in the area were Scotch-Irish. A Mr. DeWitt constructed a mill from Sunbury in 1840 and used Hallowing Run as a power source. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Township Road T-394 over Hallowing Run in 1904. It is located south of Sunbury and is long. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 4020 over the stream was built in the village of Asherton in 1921. This bridge is long. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying the same road over Hallowing Run was built in 1973. It is long and is located west of Augustaville.

The district extends along Church Street roughly between Franklin and High Streets, and encompasses a neighborhood of homes dating from the early 19th to the early 20th century, the major period of the city's growth. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and is contained within the larger Belfast Historic District. Description and history The city of Belfast, located on Penobscot Bay on the central Maine coast, became a major shipping and shipbuilding port after the War of 1812, and diversified economically as the 19th century progressed. Church Street, which extends south from the city's central business district and runs parallel to, but several blocks inland from, the city's waterfront, was the city's fashionable residential area. As a result, the street is lined with a succession of high-quality houses, reflecting primarily the styles of the first three quarters of the 19th century: the Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate. These houses were built by sea captains, shipbuilders, businessmen, and industrialists, all of whom contributed to the city's economic growth. First Church of Belfast The historic district's boundaries include all of the houses on the west side of Church Street between High and Miller Streets, and those on the east side between Spring and High Streets. It also includes houses on the west side of High Street north of Church, as well as two blocks of Court Street (which parallels Church to the west) between Franklin and Miller Streets. The district is anchored at its northern end by the 1818 First Church of Belfast, one of two churches in the district, and at the southern end by the James P. White House, a fine Greek Revival house built in 1840. The White House was designed by Calvin Ryder, a local architect whose work appears throughout the district. The Williamson House at 18 Church Street, also designed by Ryder, is a particularly handsome Greek Revival house with a full temple front treatment.

The Guardian noted that the series has a \\"great sense of the sludge and the trudge, and depression and rain, the heartache, and the general constant filthy low-level stress of a long sneaking war in which the most precious ‚Äì the only ‚Äì currency was trust, given as grudgingly as you would proffer your soul.\\" Cast *Pauline Burlet as Lili Franchet *Tom Hudson as Jeannot *J√©r√©mie Petrus as Andre Kirschen *Robert Plagnol as Boris Vilde *Pascale Arbillot as Victoria *St√©phane Debac as Albert Mulveau *Nicolas Koretzky as Morlot *Val√©rie Karsenti as Maryka *Isabelle Nanty as Paulette *C√©sar Domboy as The Kid *Richard Berry as Lili's father *Fanny Ardant as The Countess *Jochen H√§gele as Doering References External links * R√©sistance website at TF1 * Resistance website at Channel4 Resistance at PBS Category:2010s French television series Category:2014 French television series debuts Category:French drama television series Category:Television shows set in France Category:Television shows set in Paris Category:French Resistance Category:World War II television drama series Category:Television series set in 1940 ","title":"Resistance (TV series)"},{"id":"47699162","text":"George Minatto Paulino (born 25 March 1991), commonly known as Georginho, is a Brazilian professional association football who plays for Beitar Jerusalem of the Israeli Premier League.

Characteristics of Anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators, and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Within species there may be color variations, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. Description The body of A. fuscocaudatus is dark brown to blackish, with the white bars and yellow or orange snout, breast, belly, pelvic and anal fins. The caudal fin has a dark central area and longitudinal streaks separated with lighter areas. They have 11 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 15-16 dorsal soft rays and 14 anal soft rays.

By virtue of the Gauss‚ÄìLucas theorem, P'(z) + \\\\varepsilon\\\\ Q'(z) has all its zeros in z < 1 as well. It follows that P'(z) < Q'(z) on z \\\\geq 1, otherwise we could choose an \\\\varepsilon with \\\\varepsilon \\\\geq 1 such that P'(z) + \\\\varepsilon Q'(z) has a zero in z\\\\geq 1. For an arbitrary polynomial P(z) of degree n, we obtain Bernstein's Theorem by applying the above result to the polynomials Q(z) = C z^n, where C is an arbitrary constant exceeding \\\\max_{z=1}P(z). Bernstein's inequality In mathematical analysis, Bernstein's inequality states that on the complex plane, within the disk of radius 1, the degree of a polynomial times the maximum value of a polynomial is an upper bound for the similar maximum of its derivative. Taking the k-th derivative of the theorem, :\\\\max_{z \\\\le 1}( P^{(k)}(z) ) \\\\le \\\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\\\cdot\\\\max_{z \\\\le 1}( P(z) ).  Similar results  Paul Erd≈ës conjectured that if P(z) has no zeros in z<1, then \\\\max_{z = 1} P'(z) \\\\le \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\max_{z = 1} P(z). This was proved by Peter Lax.P. D. Lax, Proof of a conjecture of P. Erd√∂s on the derivative of a polynomial, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 50 (1944), 509‚Äì513. M. A.

After a couple of years they moved to the island of Als. In his late teens he moved to Aarhus to study for the Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) at Langk√¶r Gymnasium & HF followed by studying Humaniora at Aarhus University. He did not finish his studies, because he took a job with the Dr. Dante theater.

In 2006 he resigned as Secretary-General after it was brought to light that [https://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/article4986741.ece he had cheated with his resume. Lumbye had falsely claimed to have a bachelor's degree in dramaturgy and several board positions. He ascribed his resignation to personal reasons, while several sources at Aarhus Festuge attributed his resignation to internal turbulence and criticism from his own staff. A range of prominent art and culture experts also questioned Lumbye's professional qualifications.  Momondo  In June 2006 he joined a team of four persons to develop and launch a travel metasearch engine named Momondo. Based in Copenhagen they launched Momondo.com in September 2006. It developed into an internationally recognized travel site and was honored in international media like CNN and The Sunday Times.

Journal of Psychophysiology, 24(4), 213-214. \\"Alcohol consumption is recognized worldwide as a leading risk factor for disease, disability, and death\\" and is rated as the most used and abused substance by adolescences. Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical and psychological changes, usually a time in a person life in which they go through puberty.Schindler, A. G., Tsutsui, K. T. and Clark, J. J. (2014), Chronic Alcohol Intake During Adolescence, but not Adulthood, Promotes Persistent Deficits in Risk-Based Decision Making. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 38: 1622‚Äì1629. Combining these transitional stages and the intake of alcohol can leave a number of consequences for an adolescent.  Consequences of alcoholism throughout Adolescence  In 2012, 27% of UK 16- to 24-year-olds drank very heavily at least once in the last week, more than any other age group Most research is based on alcohol and the effects on people in general, essentially relating to adults. Little to no research is shown on the intake of alcohol throughout adolescents and the consequences that binge drinking from a young age can create. \\"The rate of alcohol use increases sharply between the ages of 12 and 21 years, and adolescents frequently adopt a binge-like drinking pattern\\".Foltran, F., Gregori, D., Franchin, L., Verduci, E., & Giovannini, M. (2011). Effect of alcohol consumption in prenatal life, childhood, and adolescence on child development. Nutrition Reviews, 69(11), 642-659. These patterns can then lead to various consequences including automobile accidents, drug abuse, sexual activity, skipping school and failing grades.DiClemente, R. J., Santelli, J. S., & Crosby, R. A. (Eds.). (2009). Adolescent Health : Understanding and Preventing Risk Behaviors. Hoboken, NJ, USA: Jossey-Bass. Retrieved from http://www.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au \\"Recent studies show that alcohol consumption has the potential to trigger long-term biological changes that may have detrimental effects on the developing adolescent brain, including neurocognitive impairment.\\" Under age drinking is a danger that brings many dangers and risks for all. Underage drinking causes 5,000 deaths a year. 1,900 by motor vehicle, 1,600 involving homicides, 300 suicides.  Reason for Occurrence  Marquis states how \\"Adolescent alcohol use is not an acceptable rite of passage but a serious threat to adolescent development and health, as the statistics related to adolescent impairment, injury, and death attest.\\" Research shows how an adolescent makes the decision to consume alcohol because they are influenced by various factors. \\"These factors include normal maturational changes that all adolescents experience; genetic, psychological and social factors specific to each adolescent and the various social and cultural environments that surround adolescent, including their families, schools and communities\\". It is also shown that early onset of alcohol intake can lead to high levels of alcohol use in adulthood. Alcoholism throughout adolescents is increasing yearly for a number of different reasons. These reasons include: * Availability of alcohol * Peer pressure * Role model * Television * Anxiety or stress K. S. Kendler, C. Gardner and D. M. Dick (2011). Predicting alcohol consumption in adolescence from alcohol-specific and general externalizing genetic risk factors, key environmental exposures and their interaction. Psychological Medicine, 41, pp 1507-1516. .  Prevention  There are a number of ways to preventing alcoholism throughout adolescents. One of the main ways to do this is to \\"Promote an understanding of underage alcohol consumption in the context of human development and maturation that takes into account individual adolescent characteristics as well as environmental, ethic, cultural and gender differences\\".Marquis, N. P. (2009). Substance Abuse Assessment, Interventions and Treatment : Preventing and Reducing Underage Drinking. New York, NY, USA: Nova.

Another important component to preventing alcoholism throughout adolescence is the responsibility of the government, to send a message to underage drinkers informing them how themselves and the rest of society strongly disapprove underage alcohol use because of the severe consequences it can cause and also informing that it will not be tolerated.  Minimum legal drinking age  Map of the world, stating the legal drinking ages in each country A minimum legal drinking age for the buying or consuming of alcohol is in place in many of the world's countries, typically with the intent to protect the young from alcohol-related harm.Callaghan, R.

It consists of 21 glass panels among one hundred red forest gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis) which run along a one hundred metre grassed ridge between two parallel roads.  Description  The panels are made of glass edged with Corten-steel containing LED lighting. Some panels enclose historically native seeds, ash, honey and resin, while others have verses from poetry written by Australian writers and poets. The play of light on the translucent glass create a passage of reflection, and memory. The work aims to highlight the native natural environment and indigenous history, as well as the importance of historical preservation through botanical conservatories. The red gums refer to the forest of original gums axed as a result of early European settlement with hopes to rejuvenate the site with its native trees and grass plants.

The property was operated as a summer guest house by Clayton and Hazel Sinclair between 1946 and 1977, and is one of the few known places in Maine that explicitly welcomed African-American guests in an era when racial discrimination in public accommodations was common. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history Rock Rest is located on the northwest side of Brave Boat Harbor Road (on this section designated Maine State Route 103), just east of its junction with Galley Farm Lane. The main house, set close to the road, is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house, with full shed-roof dormers to the front and rear providing a substantial second floor. A large glassed-in porch extends to the right, and a gabled porch shelters the front entry. To the right (north) of the house is a driveway, with a guest house/garage set back from the street. From the street it appears as a two-bay garage with a half story above; from this a larger and wider structure extends to the rear. This rear space housed a common area on the ground floor and guest rooms on the second floor. The property was purchased in 1938 by Clayton and Hazel Sinclair; both were originally from New York City, and had served on the staffs of summer visitors before they met. They enlarged what was originally a modest Cape, and began taking in guest lodgers at some point before the end of World War II. Drawn in part by Hazel's reputation as a cook, word of mouth brought them additional business, and they formally opened Rock Rest as a summer guest house in 1946. The property accommodated 16 guests at its height, and house as many as 50 parties during the summer season in the 1950s. The predominantly African-American clientele was drawn mostly from the northeastern United States, and the business was successful even though it did not advertise in publications catering to the African-American traveling public. The Sinclairs continued to operate the business after Maine passed a civil rights law governing public accommodations in 1971, and only closed in 1977 due to poor health.

It was designed to explore the possibility of controlling roll and yaw with fine jets of air bled from the engine's compressor. Design and development The Deltaviex, its name derived from the Delta VX design of Alliet at ONERA and built by SNCASO at Courbevoie, was intended to explore lateral control by blown flaps instead of ailerons. Despite its name it did not have a delta wing but wings which were strongly swept and straight tapered to pointed tips. The leading edge sweep was 70¬∞, that of the trailing edge about 40¬∞ and the thickness to chord ratio less than 6%. The wing trailing edges carried flaps from the wing roots almost to the tips and these were blown with air bled from the centrifugal compressor of the Deltaviex's Turbomeca Marbor√© gas turbine engine, exiting the flap trailing edges via holes. There were also more conventional ailerons, though they were unusual in that they were irregular quadrilaterals in shape and formed the wing tips. Yaw was similarly controlled by passing more of the compressor bleed out though fine holes in the tall fin, which was swept on both edges and straight tapered to a squared-off tip; there was no rudder. The horizontal tail was likewise straight edged and swept, though its trailing edge was less strongly swept than that of the wing. Its tailplanes were triangular and the elevators balanced. The fuselage of the Deltaviex was more conventional. It was round in cross section, with a pointed nose and air intakes on is upper flanks over the wings for the low power () Marbor√© engine which exhausted through a tail pipe. The original canopy over its single seat cockpit was raised above the rear fuselage line and had single oval windows both on the sides and as a windscreen. The oval shape made the lower forward window frames broad close to the fuselage, limiting the pilot's view and the cockpit was modified at least once in the period 1954-6, leading to more conventional glazing with straight lower edges and thin windscreen frames. The Deltaviex had conventional tricycle landing gear, with the narrow track mainwheels retracting into the fuselage. Development The Deltaviex was first flown 30 April 1954 by Robert Fouquet, followed by a period of testing and modification at the ONERA's airfield at Br√©tigny-sur-Orge. Details of the development are sparse but photographs from the later stages show the revised cockpit and also the addition of a rectangular ventral fin in place of a tail bumper wheel used in the early tests. The first flight with the blown flaps was made on 21 September 1955. The aircraft received no publicity for two years until it appeared with other SNCASO aircraft at a Br√©tigny-sur-Orge press event on 8 November 1956. Shortly afterwards, Flight reported it was soon to be scrapped. Because the Deltaviex's span was so small (, it was possible to fit the whole aircraft into existing supersonic wind tunnels. Its testing in ONERA's tunnel at Meudon is well recorded and after the fight tests were over it went to another ONERA tunnel at Modane. Aircraft on display After these final tests the airframe was acquired as a feature by a local garage then retrieved in 1984 by members of the historic aircraft preservation group Ailes Anciennes Toulouse who have gradually restored it. In 2015 it is largely complete externally, though with much still to be done.

She worked on a wide range of buildings in the region, ranging from residential to commercial. Early life and education Edith Mortensen Northman was born October 8, 1893, in Denmark to a Danish father and a Swedish mother. The family moved to Norway when she was nine and remained there through her high school years. She moved to Copenhagen to study art at the Studio School of Arts. The family immigrated to the United States in 1914, and a couple of years later Northman moved to Brigham City, Utah, where she worked as a librarian. She became interested in architecture and in 1918 moved to Salt Lake City, where she got work as an architectural draftsman for Eugene R. Wheelon. For health reasons, Northman moved out to Los Angeles in 1920, where she found work with the architect Clarence J. Smale and rose to the position of his chief draftsman. She opened her own firm in 1926 but then almost immediately enrolled at the University of Southern California to study architecture. She received her degree from USC in 1930 and her state architectural license the following year. Career In a career that started during the Great Depression and lasted a quarter century, the prolific Northman designed well over a hundred buildings in a wide range of types: single-family homes, multi-family dwellings and hotels, a church, a synagogue, factories, gas stations, and other commercial buildings. She designed residential buildings all over southern California, including in Beverly Hills, Hancock Park, Wilshire Park, Los Feliz, Los Angeles, and Palm Springs. Stylistically, her work is eclectic, with elements of European traditional styles (e.g. in her Danish Lutheran Church and Normandie Mar Apartment Hotel) and American Minimal Traditional modernism melded with Streamline Moderne. Some of her clients were connected with the film industry, including actor Jean Hersholt. She also served as an adviser on the film Woman Chases Man, in which the heroine is an architect. One of her biggest contracts was with the Union Oil Company, for which she designed over 50 gas stations along the west coast from San Diego to Vancouver. The company received two patents for her gas station designs in 1934. Northman's two-story Normandie Mar Apartment Hotel in Fresno was inspired by French chateaux and features a steeply pitched roof, multi-paned windows with muntins, and decorative turrets and plaster reliefs. It is the only known work by Northman in the San Joaquin Valley. During World War II, Northman worked on fortifications, hospitals, latrines, and other building-related projects for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. After the war she went back to private practice, specializing in large apartment buildings and hotels in Los Angeles and Palm Springs. In the early 1950s, Northman developed Parkinson's disease and, unable to hold a pencil, was forced into retirement. She died in 1956 in Salt Lake City. The Washington, D.C‚Äìbased columnist Jack Anderson was Northman's nephew.

It was designed by Chester Beach. Members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation introduced legislation in 1924 which would provide for a commemorative half dollar for the anniversary. The bill passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Calvin Coolidge. Beach had to satisfy committees from both Lexington and Concord, and the Commission of Fine Arts passed the design only reluctantly, feeling Beach had been given poor materials to work with. The coins were sold for $1 at the anniversary celebrations in Lexington and in Concord; they were also sold at banks across New England. Although just over half of the authorized mintage of 300,000 was struck, almost all the coins that were minted were sold. Depending on condition, they are catalogued in the hundreds of dollars.  Background  The Battles of Lexington and Concord took place in those neighboring Massachusetts towns on April 19, 1775. The enmity between the British government and the American colonials that preceded the Revolutionary War had led, by early 1775, to militia groups, hostile to the British, being formed in the Boston area. These groups, under the control of Massachusetts leader John Hancock's Committee of Safety, were often dubbed minutemen for their readiness to assemble to fight at a moment's notice. Caches of munitions were stored at various towns for their use, including at Concord. BEP engraved vignette Battle of Lexington which appeared on the alt=A printed engraving in black and white showing several people in 18th-century garb; one is firing a rifle. Another lies on the ground, dead or wounded; a woman tends to him. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Dartmouth, instructed the British commander in Boston, General Thomas Gage, to stamp out this resistance. On April 18, 1775, Gage secretly ordered Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith to go with 700 men to Concord and destroy the munitions there. It is uncertain how the Americans came to hear of the plan: Gage's wife Margaret was born in New Jersey and may have been a spy. Another local leader, Joseph Warren, informed Paul Revere and William Dawes, and the two men went by separate roads to Lexington to alert leaders and militia officers there that the British were coming. Both got through to Lexington, where they met with Hancock and Samuel Adams. The supplies in Concord were moved. British troops began their march at 2 am on April 19, and Smith sent troops ahead under Major John Pitcairn. When Pitcairn and his men found a company of armed colonials at Lexington's town common, he ordered them to disperse. In the confusion, a shot was fired from an unknown source, which brought several volleys from the British troops. Eight of the local men were killed and one British soldier was wounded. The British burned or otherwise destroyed what supplies they could find in Concord, and a second confrontation took place at the North Bridge, in which the legendary \\"shot heard round the world\\" was fired. The bridge was held by the British, and by then about 400 minutemen had assembled. Seeing the smoke from Concord, the colonials believed the town was being burned, and attempted to cross the bridge to succor it. The British fired on them but the colonials returned fire and defeated them. The British, who had gotten reinforcements once they realized the countryside was roused against them, began their march to Boston harassed by at least 2,000 militiamen who inflicted a steady toll by gunfire until the British gained the protection of the cannon near Boston. The encounters at Lexington and Concord were the first battles of what became the Revolutionary War.  Legislation  Identical joint resolutions to establish a United States Lexington‚ÄìConcord Sesquicentennial Commission and to authorize federal participation in the celebrations surrounding the 150th anniversary of the battles were introduced into the House of Representatives by Massachusetts congressmen John Jacob Rogers and Frederick Dallinger on May 5, 1924. Robert Luce, also of that state, introduced an identical copy. Rogers represented Concord's district in Congress, while the townsfolk of Lexington were among Dallinger's constituents. All three bills were referred to the Committee on the Library, presided over by Luce. Hearings were held on May 8, 1924, with both Rogers and Dallinger present. Rogers spoke of the 1875 celebrations of the Lexington and Concord centennials, which President Ulysses S. Grant, Vice President Henry Wilson, Speaker of the House James G. Blaine and other notables had attended. These celebrations were not jointly held by Lexington and Concord; instead, there were two separate programs, though there was full cooperation between the two towns. They intended to follow this pattern for the 150th anniversary in 1925: although there would be considerable coordination, each town would have its own committee and its own events. Rogers outlined the request for the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rogers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920‚Äì1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government‚ÄîCongress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from the Senate Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass. The resolution was brought to the House floor on June 7, 1924, when Luce asked that the House pass the legislation. In his report, he had alluded to the well-known Ralph Waldo Emerson poem \\"Concord Hymn\\" by including the phrase \\"embattled farmers\\", a reference which Arkansas's Otis Wingo used as an excuse to deliver a lengthy speech on tariffs, accusing the Republican majority of harming the farmer. Once Wingo had finished to applause from the Democratic side, the House passed the bill without a recorded vote, with Rogers presiding over the House in the absence of the Speaker. The resolution was transmitted to the Senate the same day and was referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee. On January 5, 1925, the resolution was reported back to the Senate by Wyoming's Francis Warren, unamended, with the recommendation that it pass. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas asked for the amount of the appropriation being made in the bill, and when told it was $15,000, had no additional questions. The bill passed without opposition, and was enacted with the signature of President Coolidge on January 14, 1925.  Preparation  Daniel Chester French's statue The Minute Man In 1923, the committees from Lexington and Concord each had considered pressing for a commemorative coin, and each, unbeknownst to the other, had contacted Chester Beach, credited with the design for the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar. Beach got them to combine their efforts and each agreed to pay half of his fee of $1,250. Each town would decide the design for one side of the half dollar. Judge Prescott Keyes, who led the Concord committee, sent Beach the proposed design for the obverse (the Concord side) on February 2, 1925, letting him know the Lexington design for the reverse, or Lexington side, would soon follow. The following day, Edward Stone, attorney for the Lexington committee, sent Beach a letter formalizing the contract. Beach would not be paid unless the Commission of Fine Arts approved the plaster models. Beach replied to Stone on the 4th, relating that he had spoken to James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel and sculptor member of the commission, and had been informed that the commission had just had its monthly meeting, but a quorum could be assembled to approve the coin. Beach noted that the Mint would take three or four weeks to begin striking coins once final approval was given; he had discussed this with Chief Engraver George T. Morgan in 1924. Morgan had recently died, but Beach did not expect the new chief engraver, John R. Sinnock, to cause any additional delays. Chester Beach in 1910 On February 4, Concord artist Philip Holden sent Beach improved sketches for both sides. Beach had been under the impression that the year must appear on the coin by itself, in addition to the anniversary dates 1775‚Äì1925; on February 5 Keyes wrote to Beach that he had viewed the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar and the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar. Both bore their dates only as part of anniversaries. Keyes noted that the two coins had the words \\"PILGRIM\\" and \\"HUGUENOT\\" respectively before \\"HALF DOLLAR\\", and proposed that the word \\"PATRIOT\\" appear in the same place on the new coin. Keyes noted that April 19, the anniversary of both battles, is Patriot Day in Massachusetts. He insisted that the words \\"THE CONCORD MINUTE MAN\\" appear even if it was illegible, \\"the public in these two towns are sometimes pretty sensitive about petty matters and so Mr. Stone and I have been very particular to come to an agreement as to all details.\\" Beach agreed to the wording changes, subject to approval by the authorities in Washington. On February 12, 1925, Keyes wrote again to tell him that Harry B. Little, architect of the National Cathedral, had looked at the designs and had suggestions, including moving the words \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\\" from the lower part of the Concord side to the left of the minuteman. He also proposed putting \\"April 19\\" on the coin; Beach did not do so, though he adopted other suggestions from Keyes. The Commission of Fine Arts felt that French's statue, due to its narrowness, was not suitable for a coin. Nevertheless, it approved the design, with Moore writing to Mint Director Robert J. Grant on March 5 that \\"a designer should be permitted to use symbols as he best knows how to use them in filling the spaces of a coin or medal.\\" By March 27, trial strikes had been made of the new coin at the Philadelphia Mint. Stone ordered an initial quantity of 100,000 half dollars on March 31\\\\.  Design  The obverse reproduces Daniel Chester French's 1874 statue, The Minute Man, that stands in Concord. Commemorating the minutemen, volunteer militia who fought the British in 1775, it depicts a farmer, rifle in hand. His coat is draped over his plow, and he is ready to respond to the signal to assemble, presumably to be given by the bell in the Old Belfry at Lexington, the subject of the reverse of the coin. The minuteman's head obscures part of the name of the country he helped to establish, and he is flanked on the left by the words \\"CONCORD MINUTE-MAN\\" and on the right by \\"IN GOD WE TRUST\\". Not shown on the coin, but on the base of the statue in Concord, is the first stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's poem, \\"Concord Hymn\\", verses dutifully memorized by generations of American schoolchildren. The alt=The statue of a minuteman, reproduced upon a blue, five-cent stamp The reverse depicts the Old Belfry, located in Lexington, where a bell was sounded to assemble the local militia. The belfry was not then old, having been built following the donation of a bell weighing by Isaac Stone to the town of Lexington in 1761. The bell was sounded after Revere and Dawes arrived, but when no British soldiers appeared, Captain John Parker sent his men home, with instructions to remain ready. It was sounded again at 5:30 am, when word came the British were not far away. Numismatist John F. Jones, in his 1937 survey of commemoratives, felt the statue and belfry highly appropriate subjects for the coin, but regretted that it lacked the clear, sharp lines of earlier special issues. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his book on U.S. coins and medals, stated that the Lexington‚ÄìConcord half dollar \\"is almost reduced to the artistic level of a photograph, for little is left that is original on the part of Beach\\". Vermeule deprecated the many inscriptions, though admitting they were forced on Beach, and especially disliked the placement of \\"In God We Trust\\": \\"nothing is more out of place than the religious motto.\\" Vermeule opined that \\"although less irritating than his half-dollar for the Monroe Doctrine Centennial, this coin does no credit to Beach's stature as a first-class artist. What the coin exudes in patriotism, it lacks in art.\\" Production, distribution, and collecting alt=The brick building from the coin. It is seen at a distance, and snow covers the ground. A total of 162,099 Lexington‚ÄìConcord Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in April and May 1925, with 99 pieces set aside for inspection and testing by the 1926 Assay Commission. The coins were made from blanks, or planchets, that had been intended for mintage into 1924 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars, but had not been used. The first coin struck was presented to President Coolidge. The half dollars were sold at the anniversary celebrations in Lexington and at those in Concord, both held April 18‚Äì20, 1925, with 39,000 sold in Lexington and 21,000 in Concord. Distribution was handled by the Lexington Trust Company and the Concord National Bank, which sold them in wooden boxes decorated with images of the statue and belfry. They were sold by banks throughout New England, and to some extent elsewhere in the country. Only 86 coins were returned to the Mint, likely representing damaged pieces.

It is located on the corner of Kraljeviƒáa Marka and Gavrila Principa Streets in Belgrade, Serbia. It was declared a cultural monument by the Cultural Heritage Preservation Institute of Belgrade on 9 May 1963. History In the early 19th century, Palilula and Savamala were the only suburbs inhabited predominantly by Serbs. The latter started from what is now Kraljeviƒáa Marka Street and encompassed the area around Zeleni venac, Bosanska (Gavrila Principa) and Abad≈æijska Streets (Narodnog fronts). During that time, Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá received the Sava Embankment as a gift from the Turkish Pasha. Unsatisfied with its primitive settlements of single-story houses and dilapidated fishing huts, Milo≈° begun to transform the area in the hopes of turning Belgrade into a modern city. Reconstruction of the town proceed slowly. Prince Milo≈° declined Felber's suggestion to hire an architect from Vienna. Instead, he hired builders from Serbia. Though skilled and experienced craftsmen, the Serbian builders lacked engineering and architectural knowledge. The lack of a methodical city plan led individuals to purchase properties and construct houses--something the prince and his advisers had not foreseen. The exact period of Savamala's construction is unknown, although it may have been built at the time of the construction of Konak, the residence of Princess Ljubica. Reconstruction resulted in Savamala, which is now the centre of Serbian national, political, and economic life in Belgrade.Todor Stefanovic Vilovski, Savamala Genesis (First attempt of regulating the Serbian town of Belgrade 1834‚Äì1836, Archival studies), New Spark Vol. X p.76‚Äì79, Belgrade 1911. Manak's House was one of the buildings the prince ordered to be preserved as the \\"ind≈æiliri\\". Engineers demolished and created new streets throughout Savamala. According to legend, Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá's tatar (post office) was located in this house. At the time no regulated posts or postal lines had been established. The mail transfer was performed by postmen on horses who were called Tatars. During their journey, Tatars had short stopovers at post stations where they would change horses, rest and eat. Postal stations were named after them, and according to tradition, Manak's House was on the line on which Tatars carried official letters and public documents. The house was designed for the Turkish Aga Khan and his harem. The house was later bought by the Greek Manojlo Manak, who in the late 19th century had a bakery and a tavern on the ground-floor, and abided on the second floor. It was named after his cousin Manak Mihailoviƒá. A photograph at Belgrade City Museum shows an inscription with the name of Arsa Petroviƒá, in front of which are tables on the sidewalk. Besides the interest of photographers, the layout of Manak's House was drawn by architect ≈†taudinger and graphic artist Luka Mladenoviƒá. Architecture The house reflects the construction methods and dwelling culture of its time. It was built in bondruk, consisting of timber framing filled in with brickwork, in this case mud brick. It has a basement, ground floor, mezzanine and first floor. The layout of its rooms is the result of regulation and uneven terrain. By the mid-1950s, the building was dilapidated and scheduled for demolition. However, its destruction was prevented: between 1964 and 1968, the Cultural Heritage Preservation Institute of Belgrade performed the necessary restoration and conservation work to revive it. Under the supervision of architect Zoran Jakovljeviƒá, the foundations were reinforced and the wooden bondruk structures were replaced. The layout and the size of rooms were retained. Interior details were also preserved. The porch was completely reconstructed. The reconstruction was inspired by similar architecture in Belgrade, Grocka and Sopot. The structure now hosts the ethnographic collection of Hristifor Crniloviƒá (1886-1963), a painter and collector of objects of folk heritage and art. The building was given to the city of Belgrade and now serves as an integral part of the Ethnographic Museum. Bibliography # B.

QDL comprises one of the largest online collections of historic records on the Persian Gulf countries. History Qatar Digital Library was first announced in 2012. The starting budget was reported as ¬£8.7 million. The partnership sought to digitize a rich trove of heritage material documenting Arab and Islamic history and to make it freely accessible to the public through the QDL, which was launched online in October 2014. The launch of the QDL's website marked the first phase of its launch. On 19 January 2015, the second phase of the QDL was commenced and is expected to last until December 2018. The second phase will witness the digitization of 1,125,000 pages of historical documents. The website was designed and built by Cogapp. It has won multiple awards. Content The digital library, with an English and Arabic bilingual interface, encompasses a total of 500,000 pages of items held by the British Library pertaining to the history of the Persian Gulf region. Some 475,000 pages, dating from the mid 18th century to 1951, are from the India Office Records and Private Papers (including the archives of the East India Company and its successor institutions); and 25,000 pages are of medieval Arabic scientific manuscripts.

This subjective burden is one of the most important predictors for negative outcomes of the care situation ‚Äì for the caregivers themselves as well as for the one who requires care. Caregivers are all persons who support and help a person in need of care regularly because of personal ‚Äì not professional ‚Äì reasons. That means every kind of help and support. It doesn‚Äôt need to be health care in the narrow sense. The caregiver doesn‚Äôt need to be akin with the person they support. Often friends, neighbors or acquaintances provide support, too.  Theory  From a scientific perspective, caregiver burden is a theoretical construct. The conceptual basis for the appraisal of the care situation is the Transactional Model of Lazarus and Folkman.R. S. Lazarus, S. Folkman: Stress, appraisal, and coping. Springer, New York 1984. The subjective evaluation of the care situation (stressor) by the caregivers is critical for the development and maintenance of subjective burden. According to the Transactional Model, people deal with stressful situations by appraisals of stressor and resources. The primary appraisal deals with the individual meaning of the specific stressor, which is the care situation in this case. The secondary appraisal analyzes the own abilities and resources to cope with that situation. On this basis, the individual coping efforts are used to deal with the stressful situation. As per Carver,C. S. Carver: You want to measure coping but your protocol's too long: Consider the brief COPE. In: International Journal of Behavioral Medicine. 1997, 4(1), pp. 92‚Äì100. these efforts can focus on problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too.

Sarno: The burden of distress in caregivers of elderly demented patients and its relationship with coping strategies. In: Neurological Sciences. 2008, 29(6), pp. 383‚Äì389. found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don‚Äôt solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse). The (dis)balance between burden/vulnerabilities and resources of the caregiver determines the consequences of a care situation.E. Gr√§√üel, R.

Baronet (2003): The impact of family relations on caregivers' positive and negative appraisal of their caregiving activities. In: Family Relations, 52(2), pp. 137-142.  Triggers for caregiver burden  Caregiver burden comes out when the caregiver perceives the home care situation as a negative experience. Caregivers are typically not trained. Caring is a serious challenge for them. An intensive adaptiation to the care situation is necessary. The caregiver burden can be based on a variety of aspects of the care situation (e.g. lack of recovery time, challenging behavior of the care requiring person, limitation of social activities and contacts).

In: BMC Geriatrics. 2010, 10:24. showed that four aspects are particularly burdensome: * Care costs much energy * Desire for recovery * Too little time for own interests * Sadness over the fate of the supported person  Meaning of subjective burden  Negative outcomes are often not determined by the specifics of the caregiving situation itself, but by the reaction and response of the caregiver. The term ‚Äúcaregiver burden‚Äù refers to the high level of stress that some caregivers may feel in response to the situation. Because the caregiver burden may be felt strongly by one person and not at all by another, regardless of the caregiving situation, it is considered to be subjective and it may be called the ‚Äúsubjective burden‚Äù. The subjective burden is considered to be one of the most important predictors of negative outcomes from the home care situation. = Impact on health = Pinquart and S√∂rensen (2003)M. Pinquart, S. S√∂rensen: Differences between caregivers and noncaregivers in psychological health and physical health: A meta-analysis. In: Psychology and Aging. 2003, 18(2), pp. 250‚Äì267. researched the health of caregivers compared to the health of non-caregiving relatives. The researchers found that while caregivers are generally only slightly less physically healthy than non- caregiving relatives, they reported depressive symptoms significantly more often, pointing to a negative effect on their mental health. This meta- analysis did not consider the impact of subjective burden. In another extensive meta-analysisM. Pinquart, S. S√∂rensen: Correlates of physical health of informal caregivers: A meta-analysis. In: Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences. 2007, 62B(2), pp. 126‚Äì137.

In: The Journal of Gerontology: Series B. 68(4), pp. 504-512. found an increased mortality of caregiving spouses. This effect was only found for spouses who felt burdened due to the care situation. Thus, it is not the home care per se that is a risk but the subjective burden. Without consideration of the caregiver burden, the mortality of caregivers is even slightly reduced compared to non-caregivers.D. O'Reilly, S. Connolly, M. Rosato, C. Patterson (2008).

(2015). = Caring style = People who experience caregiver burden can display a wide range of behaviors towards the person in need of care, from loving devotion to abusive behavior (which can manifest as neglect and/or mistreatment). The most common form of abusive behavior is verbal aggression,C. Cooney, R. Howard, B. Lawlor (2008). Abuse of vulnerable people with dementia by their carers: Can we identify those most at risk? In: International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 21(6), pp. 564-571. mainly due to challenging behaviour of the person in need of care.M. R. Hansberry, E. Chen, M. J. Gorbien: Dementia and elder abuse. In: Clinics in Geriatric Medicine. 2005, 21(2), pp. 315‚Äì332.

Ending home care  The caregiver burden often influences the caregiver‚Äôs decision to eventually institutionalize (or, ‚Äúput someone in a nursing home‚Äù. Caregiver burden is particularly associated with the care of people with dementia, meaning that the likelihood of institutionalization is especially heightened in those experiencing caregiver burden who care for people suffering from dementia.S.

Measuring caregiver burden  The assessment of caregiver burden enables to judge the situation of the caregiver. The correct measurement of subjective burden is necessary to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of family interventions. The care situation is an important, highly specific stressor which should be treated with specific interventions. A measurement with general stress-scales is therefore not useful, because in this case the score represents all kind of stress, indiscriminately of its origin. Valid, economic and internationally standardized measurement tools for the specific stressful situation of family caregivers are therefore inevitable. In Anglo-American countries, a number of burden scales have been developed; e.g. the Burden Interview,S. H. Zarit, K. E. Reever, J. Bach-Peterson: Relatives of the impaired elderly: Correlates of feelings of burden. In: The Gerontologist. 1980, 20(6), pp. 649‚Äì655. the Caregiver Strain IndexB. C.

Keller: Components of burden: Interventive implications. In: The Gerontologist. 1990, 30(2), pp. 236‚Äì242. The Burden Scale for Family Caregivers, which has been developed in Germany, is now available in 20 languages. = Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC) = The BSFC exists in a detailed version with 28 items, and in a short, more efficient version (BFSC-s) with ten items. Compared to other burden scales, the BSFC has two benefits. There is a long and a short version, both validated in separate studies. Furthermore, both versions are free in 20 languages inclusive introduction for evaluation and interpretation.  Development  A first, reliable and valid version of the German version was published in 1993.E. Gr√§√üel, M.

Berth: The subjective burden of informal caregivers of persons with dementia: extended validation of the German language version of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC). In: Aging & Mental Health. 2014, pp. 1‚Äì10, . have been published.  Scale  The BSFC consists of 28 items in the detailed or 10 items in the short version. The caregivers have to rate these items on a four-point scale from ‚Äústrongly agree‚Äù to ‚Äústrongly disagree‚Äù. An evaluation is possible both on item level and on score level. A differentiated detection of the critical aspects of home care is possible with the analysis on item level. The score measures the total burden. This is an important factor to judge the caregiver's situation.  Interventions  Due to the high importance of the caregiver burden with regard to the care giving process, it is necessary to develop interventions to reduce this burden and to examine their effectiveness. Successful interventions should be available to as many caregivers as possible. \\"The usefulness of an intervention is the multiplication of effectiveness and usage.‚Äù (Elmar Gr√§√üel) It is therefore both necessary to develop interventions and to improve and to find ways to strengthen the awareness and use of these interventions. =Interventions and services= Unburdening interventions for caregivers should consider four central aspects:A.

In: Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences. 27(4), pp. 792-803. . # Information and training # Professional support # Effective communication # Public and financial support There are different supporting services, e.g. caregiver counselling, professional training, self-help groups, ambulant nursing services or technical help like intelligent light to preserve the autonomy of the person in need of care.H.

Another effective relief is the support given to caregivers by family members, friends and acquaintances. They provide emotional and instrumental support and are an important source to access supporting services.G. Lamura, E. Mnich, B. Wojszel, M. Nolan, B. Krevers, L. Mestheneos, H. D√∂hner (2006).

St Matthew's church, built in 1854-55 and originally intended to be the school, served both the mission and the local community. It survives and remains in use today. Hale ran the Aboriginal Training Institution at the mission. His friend, the Anglican Archbishop of Adelaide, Augustus Short, visited the mission, which prospered.

Background Historically, the term \\"album\\" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early 19th century. Later, collections of related 78rpm records (singles) were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). The only way an ‚Äúalbum‚Äù could be put together was to sell three or four 78s in a bound set of sheathes. These sets, known as folios were increasingly popular. Whilst they had originally been neutral ‚Äì blank albums into which the distributor could insert whatever 78s he liked ‚Äì the idea of using a theme to link the records in the folio was catching on. By the late 1930s, this trend had developed to the point where artists were going into studios to record six or eight titles with a folio set in mind. This in effect was the birth of the concept album, although it would not be until LPs became commonplace that the phrase gained any currency. The first album issued by Decca Records, probably in 1938, was Moussorgsky Songs by Vladimir Rosing, on catalogue number A-1. Another early concept album was Music of Hawaii and eight songs were recorded for this in 1938. Possibly to boost its commercial appeal, two Hawaiian songs by Bing Crosby, which had been recorded two years earlier, were added to the album.

The device was launched globally in October and was launched in the United States as an unlocked device in February 2016. It is the successor to the Sony Xperia Z3+. Similar to its predecessor, the device is water and dust proof with an IP rating of 65 and 68. It is Sony's first device to feature a fingerprint sensor. The device comes with 23 Megapixel camera with 0.03 seconds Hybrid Autofocus that utilizes phase detection autofocus, similarly found in the Xperia M5. In February 2016, it was confirmed by Sony Mobile's senior product marketing manager Jun Makino that the Sony Xperia Z5 will be the final smartphone in the Sony Xperia Z series, with all future releases being released as part of the Sony Xperia X series. However this rumor was dismissed as Sony's Head of Marketing, Don Mesa has clarified that the X Series will not replace the Z Series. Specifications =Hardware= Unlike its predecessors, the Xperia Z5's body design consists of an aluminum frame with a frosted glass backing to reduce fingerprints appearing on the back of the phone. The device carries an IP rating of IP65 and IP68, making it dust and water resistant. The device features a (marketed as 5.2-in) 1080p display with a density of 424 ppi, featuring Sony's \\"Triluminos\\" technology.

Odaka had previously represented Uganda at the 1963 negotiations in Addis Ababa which established the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), now called the African Union. A member of Obote's Uganda People's Congress (UPC), Odaka, who was seen as a more liberal politician than Obote, was also a negotiator for Obote's regime. Sam Odaka was credited with aiding Uganda's first President, Edward Mutesa, who was forced from office by Obote in 1966. Mutesa, also known as Mutesa II of Buganda, went into exile in the United Kingdom. Odaka, in a compromise, offered to send Kabaka's assets to him in the United Kingdom, with the stipulation that Kabaka recognize the new Obote regime. Odaka (left) with Miriam Eshkol and Idi Amin, 1966 President Obote and the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) announced their intention to \\"Move to the Left\\" during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The announcement, issued in the Common Man's Charter, alarms business interests in Uganda, which feared a socialist-leaning economic policies. Foreign Minister Odaka was tasked by Obote's government with the leading the public relations to support the Move to the Left. However, the Move to the Left was fully implemented. President Milton Obote was overthrown by Idi Amin in the 1971 Ugandan coup d'√©tat on 25 January 1971, ending the first Obote regime and the \\"Move to the Left\\" policies. Sam Odaka fled into exile following the coup. Milton Obote regained power in 1980 following the 1980 general election, beginning the Obote II administration. Sam Odaka became Uganda's Minister of Planning and Economic Development during Obote's second tenure (1980‚Äì1985). Sam Odaka died from kidney failure at International Hospital Kampala on 4 August 2015, at the age of 83. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Namwanje Kavuma Odaka, four daughters, and five grandchildren. A vigil was held at his home in the Mbuya neighborhood of Kampala. Odaka's funeral was held at Kampala's All Saints Cathedral. He was buried in Busia District on 8 August 2015.

The volcanic field is part of a larger volcanic province that clusters around the Colca River and is mostly of Pleistocene age, although the Andagua sector also features volcanic cones with historical activity, with the last eruption about 370 years ago. Eruptions were mostly effusive, generating lava flows, cones and small eruption columns. Future eruptions are possible, and there is ongoing fumarolic activity. Volcanic activity in the field has flooded the Andahua valley with lava flows, damming local watersheds in the Laguna de Chachas, Laguna Mamacocha and Laguna Pumajallo lakes and burying the course of the Andagua River. The Andahua valley segment of the larger volcanic province was declared a geopark in 2015.  History and name  The volcanoes were first mentioned in a 1904 report but scientific investigation began by 1960; owing to the small size of Andagua volcanoes and their remote location they have not gained as much scientific interest as the large stratovolcanoes in the region. Eruptions have been dated on the basis of radiocarbon dating, potassium-argon dating and the morphology of the resulting vents as younger structures are steeper. The term \\"Andagua volcanic field\\" has not been used consistently and sometimes the term \\"Andagua Group\\" or variants with \\"Andahua\\" are used, even though the name of the village is Andagua; the field is also known as Andagua-Orcopampa volcanic field. The term \\"Valley of the Volcanoes\\" is a reference to the volcanoes that fill the valley floor.  Geology and geomorphology  The Andagua volcanic field lies in southern Peru, from the city of Arequipa and within the Arequipa Department and its provinces Castilla, Caylloma and Condesuyos. The towns of Orcopampa, Andagua/Andahua, Soporo, Chachas, Sucna and Ayo lie in its area along with mines and the Inka sites of Antaymarca, Ayo and Jello Jello; economic activity includes farming and mining as well as commerce and industrial activity. The volcanic field consists of cinder cones, lava domes, lava flow fields, pyroclastic cones, and scoria cones. Lava flows emanated from cones, domes and fractures; some cones have been breached by lava flows. Lava flows reach lengths of and thicknesses of ; their surfaces are blocky and feature channels. The highest individual volcano is high although the average height of cones is about or and their width is about ; lava domes reach heights of . Most of the vents are concentrated in the Valley of the Volcanoes, a long valley that descends to the Colca River, where they form clusters and alignments which have flooded the valley and tributary valleys with lava flows; most vents are situated on the valley floor while others lie on its flanks. Aside from the Andagua Valley proper, the volcanoes spread across the Apune Valley to the northwest and the Ayo Valley to the south. These are not monogenetic volcanoes as some of them show evidence of multiple eruption episodes. Colours range from grey over reddish to black, with reddish colours appearing on weathered lavas. The valley is flanked by high mountains. Among the vents are: * West-northwest from Orcopampa lies the wide Mauras cone with a surrounding lava flow field. Farther northwest still the Jullulluyoc and Umajala lava domes and lava flows which reach the road between Orcopampa and the Poracota gold mine. All three are of Pleistocene age and the second two developed on ridges flanking the valley; Umajala bears signs of glaciation. * In the valley of the Sora River lie a number of lava domes and three pyroclastic cones along with a lava flow field that reaches to the Andagua River. The cinder cones from north to south are Misahuana Mauras, Pabell√≥n and Yana Mauras, while one of the lava domes is known as Jochane. An additional lava flow lies in the Pallca River valley, which joins the Sora River valley from the west, just before the entry of the Sora River valley into the Andagua Valley. These are of Pleistocene to Holocene age. * South of Misahuanca in the Andagua valley lie six vents with a surrounding Pleistocene lava flow field; these vents are the Cerro Mauras cinder cone and two lava domes forming a northern cluster, and the cinder cone Challhue Mauras, the lava dome Tororocsa and the cinder cone Panahua aligned in west‚Äìeast direction. Some of the vents predate the surrounding lava flows, while others post-date them such as Cerro Mauras which formed atop an older vent; the lava flows themselves blocked the valley and formed a large lava flow field. An additional also Pleistocene lava dome and lava flow are located farther east and fill a hanging valley. * The Santa Rosa cinder cones and the Cerro Puca Mauras cinder cone, the largest in the Andagua volcanic field, along with a few lava domes such as Chipchane and an unnamed over wide dome lie within a Pleistocene to Holocene age lava flow field that spreads northwards, westwards and southwards towards the Andagua River, covering the entire valley. Consequently, the Andagua River cut a gorge across the lava flow fields, which ends in a waterfall farther south. This part of the volcanic field produced the most volcanic activity; its vents were controlled by faults. Puca Mauras is the largest cone and features pre-Hispanic buildings. * Around the town of Andagua and along the road to Viraco west of Andagua lies a Pleistocene lava flow field that propagates from interconnected lava domes/lava craters in the El Tambo River valley east-southeastwards towards Andagua. The largest of these lava domes lies east of Andagua, is called Cochapampa and features a lava dome nested within its crater; additionally, the cinder cones Yanamauras, Yanamauras Sur directly north of Andagua and Ticsho northwest of the town are also part of this field. The vents here are spread across the valley, are smaller and have different ages. For example, the Pra-Ticsho lava dome is 270,000 years old while Ticsho only 4,050. * Southeast of Andagua, the valley is mainly filled by Holocene lava flows, except around Soporo and east of Chachas where there are Pleistocene lava flows; this part of the volcanic field is known as the Chilcayoc lava field. Along with these are dispersed cinder cones such as Jenchana south of Andagua, Ninamama east of Andagua, Pampalquita, Ucuja, Chico, Chilcayoc, Jechapita clockwise around Soporo and Chilcayoc Grande farther east, along with a number of lava domes such as the cluster west of Sucna. One of the domes around Soporo is heavily eroded, the cinder cones are in part breached by lava flows. Chilcayoc Grande is the most prominent cinder cone of the Andagua volcanic field. * North of the Chachas lake lies another lava flow field, with two lava domes aligned in southwest‚Äìnortheast direction and a cinder cone Cerro Ticlla; the flows reached Chachas lake. This field is of Pleistocene age and bears signs of glaciation but the Cerro Pucamauras cinder cone in its middle is younger. Older volcanic landforms are vegetated and have developed a soil cover, and sometimes are altered by river or glacial erosion or have been converted into farmland. Overall, in outcrops the volcanic rocks of the Andagua valley reach great thickness, forming plains of lava and occasionally accumulations or fields of volcanic ash; the total volume of volcanic rocks is about and thicknesses are about . The Andagua River flows through the Valley of the Volcanoes; it originates from the confluence of the Chilcaimarca and Orcopampa Rivers and receives several tributaries over its course in the valley. In the Valley of the Volcanoes, the Andagua River has cut a gorge into the lava fields and has formed waterfalls, while elsewhere it disappears under the lava flows. Lava flows have formed lakes by damming drainages, such as Laguna de Chachas, Laguna Mamacocha and Laguna Pumajallo; additionally sediments from older lakes have been found at Canco. The waters of the Andagua River disappear in lava flows over a path of over ; the Laguna Mamacocha produces the Mamacocha River whose water ultimately originates in the Andagua River and which eventually flows into the Colca River. File:Valle de Volcanes Peru.JPGVolcanoes seen from Mirador Antaymarca File:Valle de Los Volcanes-Springer.pngA lava flow in the volcanic field = Composition = The volcanic field has erupted rocks ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite, with composition varying from one individual volcano to the other but dominantly sodic although it has also been described as potassic owing to the poassium-silica ratio. Generally, the rocks fall into the categories benmoreite, latite and mugearite with rare andesite and basalt. Phenocrysts include hornblende, olivine, plagioclase and pyroxene and less commonly alkali feldspar and biotite, and xenoliths have been reported as well. Overall, the composition of the magma is the most primitive of the magmas of southern Peru and underwent crystallization in deep magma chambers which \\"overflowed\\" in the form of an eruption once new magma entered them. In addition, the magma underwent some degree of contamination with crustal materials. = Geologic context = Subduction off the western margin of South America probably commenced during the Paleozoic and has continued to the present day between the Nazca Plate and the South America Plate, where the former subducts at a rate of below the latter. It has been accompanied by orogeny and volcanic activity, with three distinct phases of folding known as the Mochica, Peruvian and Inca phases which gave rise to faults and folds. The volcanic activity manifested itself as a set of volcanic arcs, such as the Tacaza arc with mineral-bearing calderas and the presently active Central Volcanic Zone which includes the Andagua volcanic field. In turn, the Central Volcanic Zone is one of three main volcanic arcs in the Andes which are separated by gaps without volcanic activity. Small volcanoes such as these of the Andagua volcanic field are a subordinate part of the Peruvian Central Volcanic Zone; most volcanoes are large and among these is Sabancaya with historical activity, El Misti with solfataric activity, Coropuna, which is the highest volcano in Peru and features Holocene activity, Firura and Solimana north and west from Coropuna, and Mismi, Hualca Hualca, Ampato, Chachani and Pichu Pichu. Additional volcanoes of this volcanic zone occur in Bolivia and Chile. The terrain surrounding the volcanic field features alluvium of Pleistocene to Holocene age, the volcanic Neogene/Pliocene Barroso Group and Mesozoic sediments of the Yura Group and the Socosani Formation. Faults crisscross the volcanic field, magma may have used them as ascent paths; the Valley of the Volcanoes itself is a fault-limited graben and some faults offset Quaternary deposits. The Andagua volcanic field is sometimes considered to include an area outside of the Valley of the Volcanoes, which itself features seven separate clusters of volcanoes including the Valley of the Volcanoes but also the Antapuna, Colca Valley, Huambo-Cabanaconde, Laguna Parihuana, Molloco Valley and Pampa Jaran; these clusters are separated from each other by geographic and geologic traits. Alternatively, some of these are considered to be a volcanic province of which Andagua is only one field of. Among these are: * The Antapuna field is located just north of the Andagua volcanic field and is centered on the heavily glacially eroded Antapuna volcano. Several lava domes and lava flows occur in this area, such as Cerro Antapuna west of Antapuna, Tanca southwest of Antapuna, Pampa Pisaca and another lava dome southeast of Antapuna and several unnamed cinder cones and lava flows northeast of Antapuna. The vents are glacially eroded and of Pleistocene age with the exception of Pumaranra northwest from Antapuna. * The Molloco River valley features several Pleistocene to Holocene lava domes such as Uchuychaca and Cerro Coropuna (not to be confused with Coropuna, a stratovolcano), which are located around the Marhuas cinder cone. Two small lava flows lie in the Colca River valley upstream of the junction with the Molloco River. * Several lava domes with associated lava flows are found in the Colca River valley at Chivay; they are between 400,000 and 90,000 years old but thermal springs occur there. * South of Caylloma several volcanoes are found on an upland; they are Antaymarca, Saigua, Challpo, Andallullo, Antacollo and Sani and appear to be old given their vegetation. * Finally, there are volcanoes associated with the Andagua volcanic field south of the Colca River. These are from west to east the Luceria field west of Gloriahuasi with the Honda and San Cristobal cinder cones, the Gloriahuasi field north of Gloriahuasi with two branches of lava flows, the Timar field northeast of Gloriahuasi with the Gloriahuasi stratovolcano - the only stratovolcano that is part of the Andagua volcanic field -, the Jaran field northwest from Lagunillas Pass which has the Marbas Grande cinder cone, the Marbas Chico cinder cones and Llajuapampa cinder cone, and finally the Uchan field south of the Lagunillas Pass with the Uchan Sur and Tururunca cinder cones, some lava domes farther south and a lava flow field that also runs south. With the exception of the Huambo volcanic field which features Holocene vents they are all of Pleistocene age.  Climate and vegetation  Temperatures vary between parts of the volcanic field, with Ayo having a semi-warm climate with temperatures of while Chachas has and Orcopampa of . The climate in the region is dry with a wet season that lasts from November to April, although humid periods have occurred recently, including two around 600 and 1000 AD linked to El Nino phenomena. Vegetation in the volcanic field corresponds to the puna and suni vegetation types, but farmland also occurs on agricultural terraces. Plants include xerophytes as well as ichu and yareta and varies with elevation; the Laguna Mamacocha and Chachas are populated by fish and form oases.  Eruption history  The oldest activity of the Andagua volcanic field occurred between 400,000 and 64,000 years ago and has been identified close to Chivay in the Colca Valley. Three separate generations of volcanic activity have been defined, a Pleistocene generation, a Pleistocene-Holocene generation and a Holocene generation, with about 3-4 vents forming every ten thousand years. The eruptions of the Andagua volcanic field cones have been accompanied by the emission of slow-moving lava flows and ballistic ejecta which reached less than distance from the vents; estimated volcanic explosivity indexes are 0-2 and the volcanic activity has been described as Strombolian eruptions or phreatomagmatic and accompanied by small eruption columns. Hawaiian eruptions and Strombolian eruptions generated scoria cones. Ticsho was emplaced 4,050 years ago, Mauras and Yana Mauras 2,900 years ago while the eruption of Chilcayoc Grande occurred 1451 - 1523. The youngest eruptions occurred along the Jenchana-Ninanmama fault and the most recent event was dated to 370 years ago and took place at Chilcayoc Chico. A more recent eruption was reported in 1913, but it is not clear that it actually occurred in the Andagua volcanic field. Neither historical records nor local records such as legends mention volcanic activity although pre-Inka agricultural areas were impacted by lava flows and two towns were destroyed by volcanic activity later than the Spanish conquest. Presently, hydrogen sulfide emanates from the Ninamama flow and has generated gypsum and sulfur deposits, and fumarolic activity was reported in 2003 although other sources state that no fumarolic activity occurs; future eruptions are certainly possible. = Hazards from future eruptions = Various towns with a total population of about 11,800 people are located at the feet of extinct vents, but usually at a distance from the youngest volcanoes although shifts in vent location during the course of an eruption could bring hazards to these towns. Explosive eruptions could result in fallout of lava bombs, tephra and volcanic ash, but the impact would be limited to the surroundings of the vent, probably less than . The volcanic field however also produced lava flows in the past, which can reach larger distances and also infrastructure such as the Mantaro-Socabaya power line and could also bury the ground for perhaps thousands of years.  Access and national park project  A number of paths and roads pass through the volcanic field. Andagua's surroundings are considered to be a typical expression of the volcanic field and the creation of a national park covering parts of the volcanic field has been proposed. A geopark was created in 2015, some volcanoes of the Andagua volcanic field are considered to be geosites with some spots already protected in some way; the area is of value from the perspectives of both geotourism and science. A concentration of such small volcanoes such as Andagua in an easily accessible location is not common in the world. In general, aside from their role as hazards, volcanoes are important sources of tourism-based income.

Burgess School is a historic former school building in Berlin, New Hampshire. Built in 1905 as a public elementary school, it is a well- preserved example of an early 20th-century public school building. It became Notre Dame High School in 1942, operated by the local Roman Catholic diocese, and was the city's first Catholic high school. Closed in 1972, it has since been converted into senior living. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The former Notre Dame High School building stands northeast of downtown Berlin, on the north side of School Street between Houle and Spring streets. The area is a sloping hillside overlooking the Androscoggin River, and the school is set high above the street, its main entrance accessed by two flights of stairs across a sloping lawn. It is a roughly L-shaped two-story brick structure, with an original main section that has been added to several times. The facade of the original section is Classical Revival, with brick quoining at the corners and brick banding between the ground-floor windows. Windows are generally rectangular, and set in openings with stone sills and splayed brick lintels. The main entrance is set in a round-arch opening, and has a window in a rounded segmental-arch opening above it on the second floor.Driemeyer, Laura, et al (2014). NRHP nomination for George E. Burgess School-Notre Dame High School; available by request from the New Hampshire SHPO The original main block has matching wings extending to the east and west, with less elaborate brickwork. Attached to the left wing is the former convent wing, which projects forward, and has three stories owing to the sloping terrain. The main block was built in 1905 as a public school, and is a well-preserved example of an early 20th-century public school building. It was closed when Berlin's school enrollment declined during the Great Depression, and was leased to the local Roman Catholic diocese in 1942, which opened it as the Notre Dame High School, the first high school available to Berlin's students. It was sold to the diocese in 1946, which enlarged the building in 1949 and 1954 with the two side wings and convent. The diocese operated the school until 1972. It then stood vacant for a time, suffering from vandalism and neglect, which included the loss by fire of its gymnasium. It was converted to senior housing in the 2010s.

He studied the Lingnan style of painting, which fuses elements of Western and Japanese realism with Chinese ink painting on rice paper. He learned Chinese brush painting and western art forms enthusiastically when he was an adolescent. His interest was furthered when he continued his academic studies in Taiwan and Hong Kong after he graduated from secondary school. Thereon, he sought to refine his artistic skills under the guidance of many eminent masters. Former Principal of the Central Academy of Art and President of Central Research Academy of Art, Malaysia. He is currently a visiting professor of Renmin University of China, Ningbo University, Changshu University of Technology, and Handan College, and a life-long consultant of Ningbo Art Museum. He studied under Chao Shao-an ÔºàË∂ôÂ∞ëÊòÇÔºâ and visited Rao Zongyi ÔºàÈ•íÂÆóÈ†§Ôºâ in Hong Kong respectively.

Subsequently, he visited more celebrities in China, and had the presence of numerous revered figures in the cultural scene at the opening ceremony of his exhibition in China. Cheng Haw-Chien also studied poetry, calligraphy and painting under Ven. Zhu Mo (Á´∫Êë©ÈïøËÄÅ) and Liu Taixi (ÂäâÂ§™Â∏åÔºâ. He has also been conferred a master's degree in the history of fine art by Summit University, Louisiana, and doctorate degree by St. George University, Cambridge, for his achievement in research. He has won high accolades from artist and scholars in and outside of China. He has chosen to work with two of the three traditional subject categories of Chinese painting landscape and bird and flowers. The formats which he uses are also traditional and include fans, albums, hanging scrolls, and scrolls which are cross between handscrolls and album-extended horizontal compositions meant to be viewed all at once. His exhibits have graced halls throughout Asia, America, and Europe. Cheng Haw-Chien is equipped with the Lingnan School (Â∂∫ÂçóÁï´Ê¥æÔºâas well as Western painting techniques. As an important contemporary representative of the school, Cheng Haw-Chien is impressive in two ways. First, his characteristic of creating a symphony between ink and colour enables him to bring out the features typical of his region. The second aspect is most interesting: his painting reflect a poetic ambience which is moving. It may be said that he embodies the spirit of the Lingnan School in 'learning from nature and being endowed by spiritual inspiration'. After his graduation from the university in 1974, he toured South East Asia and European countries, holding solo exhibitions which received very positive press reports, especially on his masterpieces such as Bridge Over the River Kwai and Tour to the Kingdom of Buddha. His other exhibitions in Malaysia and Europe, The Exhibition on Europe Tour series featuring Scene of Cambridge and Winter in Paris also received similar positive reviews.

He and his turret gunner shot down 12 enemy aircraft over the Dunkirk evacuation beaches and during the Battle of Britain. Thorn survived the war but was killed in a crash of an early jet fighter in 1946. Early life Edward Rowland (or Roland) Thorn was born at North End, Hampshire on 15 April 1913, the son of Thomas Thorn, a chef from Newport, and his wife Ellen Maria. In 1916, when Rowland was three, his father was killed in the First World War.British Army Service Records 1914‚Äì18, 83803 Thomas Rowland Thorn The two children were educated at local council schools in North End.

War broke out in September 1939 and one month later Thorne was posted to the newly formed No. 264 Squadron RAF at RAF Sutton Bridge to fly the Boulton Paul DefiantWynn (1999), p.403 An unusual fighter for its era, the Defiant had a single engine but was armed with four .303 machine guns in a rear turret operated by an air gunner. As the squadron began to take shape, its new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Philip Hunter, arrived. Thorn had teamed up with leading aircraftman Frederick James Barker from Bow in London.264 Squadron Website ‚Äì nominal roll of airmen They formed part of the flight commanded by Nicholas Gresham Cooke. In early operations the Defiant was often mistaken for the similarly-shaped Hawker Hurricane by German pilots who dived to attack from above and behind, the blind spot for a Hurricane pilot, but directly into the fire from the gunner‚Äôs turret on a Defiant. =Battles of France and Dunkirk= On 27 May 1940 Thorn and Barker are reported to have shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 near Dunkirk,Foreman (2003), p.69 but this is not mentioned in other records. On 28 May 1940, just north of Dunkirk, their flight was attacked by a formation of Bf 109 fighters; handling his aircraft skillfully Thorn enabled Barker to shoot down three of them very quickly.Franks (1983), p.94Battle of Britain memorial ‚Äì Thorn and Barker On 29 May 1940, again over Dunkirk, the crew were involved in 264 Squadron's major success when they went into combat at about 1515 hours, shooting down a Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin-engined fighter at about 1515 hours. On a second mission at 1930 hours they shot down another Ju 87 and another Bf 110;Foreman (2003), p.73-74 Shores also records a share in the destruction of a Heinkel He 111 bomber on that date.Shores (1994), p.587 On 31 May 1940, also over Dunkirk, they shot down two Heinkel He 111 bombers and damaged two more as the Luftwaffe attempted to prevent the beachhead evacuation operations.Foreman (2003), p.76Franks (1983), p.101 and 127‚Äì128 Their flight commander, Nicholas Cooke, failed to return from that mission. After the completion of the Dunkirk evacuation, the Luftwaffe had gained operational experience in fighting against the Defiant fighter and it had become an extremely vulnerable aircraft to operate in daylight against formations escorted by Bf 109 fighters. The months after Dunkirk were spent rebuilding the squadron, which had suffered heavy losses, and preparing for the Battle of Britain, which was to come. They moved to RAF Hornchurch to participate in the Battle of Britain, although seriously out-classed by the enemy. On 14 June 1940 both Thorn and Barker were awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal for their bravery in action and success as a fighter crew. Barker was also promoted to sergeant. =Battle of Britain= In five days of operations in the Battle of Britain against the attacking Luftwaffe from 24 to 28 August 1940, 264 Squadron was almost wiped out, losing three aircraft and crews on 24 August, three more on 26 August and three more on 28 August.Franks (1997), p.62-66Mason (1969), p.298-310 On 24 August,Shores (2000), p.190 in action against a formation of Junkers Ju 88 bombers which had just bombed RAF Manston, Thorn and Barker shot down one of the enemy,Foreman (2003), p.164 but Boulton Paul Defiant Mark I serial number ‚Äò‚ÄôN1535‚Äô‚Äô (codes PS-A) was last seen chasing an enemy bomber out to sea, Philip Hunter the squadron commander and his gunner were posted missing when they failed to return.Franks (1997), p.62Wynn (1999), p.207Mason (1969), p.298Ramsey (1989), p.376The Kings School, Canterbury, P A Hunter On 26 August 1940 at mid-day, Thorn and Barker were in action against the Luftwaffe bomber streams again and shot down two Dornier Do 17 bombers over Dover. As they commenced an attack on a third Do 17, a Bf 109 attacked them, badly damaging their Defiant (serial number L7005). Thorn dived quickly away to crash land the crippled aircraft, which had caught fire, but the Bf 109 came in for a second attack; Barker assisted a Hurricane in shooting it down, before he and Thorn baled out.Foreman (2003), p.170 The aircraft crashed quite close to each other at Marshside, Kent near Chislet.

In recognition of their success and great bravery during the Battle of Britain Thorn and Barker were both awarded a Bar to their Distinguished Flying Medals on 11 February 1941. Flying as night fighters, Thorn and Barker destroyed a Heinkel He 111 on the night of 9 ‚Äì 10 April 1941 as it took part in the Blitz on England‚Äôs cities. The bomber crashed near Bushbridge, Surrey and was identified as an aircraft of 5 Staffel/KG 55.Ramsay-Blitz (1989), p.519Foreman (2005), p.31 By now an acting warrant officer, Thorn was commissioned pilot officer with service number 46957 on 11 October 1941 and assigned to No. 32 Squadron RAF flying Hurricane fighters and breaking up the successful partnership of Ted Thorn and Fred Barker. Barker remained with the squadron for two more years before becoming an instructor in the Middle East. Thorn was promoted flying officer on 26 February 1942, and then flight lieutenant on 6 July 1942, and appointed acting squadron leader commanding No. 32 Squadron RAF from April until September 1942. The squadron saw heavy action over the Dieppe Raid commando landings on 19 August 1942, and he was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross on 22 September 1942 for his achievements in command and particularly for his bravery over Dieppe. He completed a tour of duty as an instructor with No. 61 Operational Training Unit from November 1942 at the end of which he received a Mention in Despatches on 14 January 1944 for his dedication to the training of the young pilots under his command. Posted to No. 169 Squadron RAF as a flight commander he led night fighting and night intruder missions against the Luftwaffe night fighters over occupied Europe. For his achievements in this role Thorn was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross on 8 December 1944. At the end of the war in Europe he was transferred to command a training unit. In this position on 1 January 1946 he was again Mentioned in Despatches for his skill and dedication as a flying instructor and commander. Death On 12 February 1946 Thorn was a squadron leader and member of staff at the Empire Central Flying School, where early jet fighters were being flown, when he died in an accident. It is sometimes reported that he was aboard Mosquito TA525, although most reports state that the Dutch pilot of that aircraft was on a solo mission.

Baggott is the author of nine books, including Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth (also titled Farewell to Reality: How Fairy-tale Physics Betrays the Search for Scientific Truth), Origins: The Scientific Story of Creation, Higgs: The Invention and Discovery of the God Particle and The Quantum Story: A History in 40 moments. Early life and education Baggott told science writer Brian Clegg that the reason why he went into the sciences was because he had some great schoolteachers. He loved physics but did not think he had a strong enough talent for the mathematics that would be required. \\"That said, my desire to seek explanations for things led me to chemical physics and it was with a great sense of pride and pleasure that I did manage to publish some entirely theoretical research papers, full of mathematical equations!\\" He obtained his degree at the University of Manchester in 1978 and his DPhil in chemical physics at the University of Oxford. He worked as a professor for the University of Reading and left academia to work for Shell International Petroleum. After several years he opened his own training and consultancy business. He calls himself a \\"science communicator\\" and publishes a science book approximately every 18 months. He selects the topics for his books by writing about things he wants to know more about. The advent of the Internet makes it much easier to do research than back when he first started writing books in the early 1990s. Higgs: The Invention and Discovery of the 'God Particle' Baggott felt that the CERN people were getting really close to discovering the Higgs boson and approached his editor about writing on the topic. His idea was to start writing the book, get about 95% done, and then, when the discovery was announced, he would be able to finish the last 5% and the book would be on the shelves very soon after the announcement. Throughout 2011 and 2012 he kept updating the book, leaving the last 1,500 words unsaid. He watched CERN's live webcast announce the discovery of the boson on 4 July and finished writing the book the next day. Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth Baggott got the idea to write Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth and become a science activist when watching the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls \\"fairy tale physics\\" when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are \\"abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation\\" and \\"not science\\". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the \\"fuzzy science theory\\" and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, \\"When you start asking 'Do we live in a hologram?' Then you are crossing into metaphysics, and you are heading down the path of allowing all kinds of things that have no evidence to back it up, like creationism.\\" In an interview with Massimo Pigliucci on the Rationally Thinking podcast, Baggott stated that science is a human endeavour with a \\"fuzziness around the edges\\". He went on to say that there are no rules and, when training to be a scientist, no one gives you an instruction book on how to do science. \\"We kinda make it up as we go along... and it is perfectly reasonable for the scientific community to want to change those rules.\\" Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right \\"although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains.\\" Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists who speculate because \\"conjecture injects vitality into science.\\" Baggott, along with Jon Butterworth, Hilary Rose and Stephen Minger, discussed the idea of futurist science theories with BBC Radio 4 interviewer Allan Little. They discussed the likelihood that string theory and other theories that have yet to show empirical data will eventually be proved. Baggott expressed concern that \\"a body of professional theorists want to change the definition of what it means to do science\\". He feels that empirical data provides an anchor for these people to \\"return to reality\\" and that science without evidence is \\"most dangerous\\". Beyond Measure Jim Baggott addressing \\"Crossing the Line: The Challenge of Post-Empirical Science\\" at The Amaz!ng Meeting 13 (TAM 13), Friday 17 July 2015 at Tropicana, Las Vegas, Nevada. Science writer Tony Hey writes that Beyond Measure was written for graduate and undergraduate physics students as an overview of quantum mechanics. The book has wider appeal by keeping the equations to the appendices for optional review. The book is divided into five parts starting with the history behind quantum theory, followed by the more recent experiments. \\"Chapters on consciousness and on the ever-popular many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory form the conclusion.\\" Awards and honours *Royal Society of Chemistry ‚Äì Marlow Medal (1989) *Glaxo Science Writers Award (1991) Publications Baggott is a regular contributor to New Scientist and Nature. =Books= * Quantum Reality: The Quest for the Real Meaning of Quantum Mechanics - A Game of Theories, (2020), Oxford University Press, 2020 * Quantum Space: Loop Quantum Gravity and the Search for the Structure of Space, Time, and the Universe, (2019), Oxford University Press, 2019    * =Selected articles= *Debate between Baggott and Mike Duff about the limits of physics ‚Äì The Guardian, 2013.

He is the father of fellow professional snooker player Neal Foulds. Career Born in 1939, Foulds turned professional in 1981 after a successful amateur career that included winning the London championship in 1971 and each year from 1975 to 1979. His first two seasons brought little success, but in the 1983‚Äì84 snooker season, he reached the last 32 at the UK Championship, where he defeated Steve Duggan 9‚Äì8 and Les Dodd 9‚Äì7, before losing 1‚Äì9 to Steve Davis. The next season saw Foulds progress to the last 48 at the 1985 Classic, beating Bob Chaperon, Frank Jonik and Jack Fitzmaurice to set up a meeting with Mike Hallett. Their match was closely fought, with Foulds leading 4‚Äì3 before succumbing 4‚Äì5. A run to the same stage of the 1985 World Championship, featuring victories over Maurice Parkin, Clive Everton and Colin Roscoe, concluded his 1984/1985 season with a 6‚Äì10 loss to Joe Johnson. Foulds' son, Neal, had joined him in the professional ranks in 1983 and the two met in competition at the 1986 English Professional Championship; Geoff held Neal to 6‚Äì4, but the latter made consecutive breaks of 53, 71 and 76 to prevail 9‚Äì4.http://cuetracker.net/Players/Geoff-Foulds/1985-1986 At the 1986 International Open, Foulds defeated Leon Heywood, Vic Harris and Bill Werbeniuk, but was beaten in the last 32, again by his son. This time the match was less evenly contested, as Neal won 5‚Äì0. Runs to the last 64 at several other tournaments meant Geoff Foulds entered the next season ranked 62nd, a career best. However, after breaking into the top 64, Foulds' form declined sharply. He earned no prize money during the following three seasons, recording his final victory in the last 128 at the 1990 Dubai Classic, defeating Mark Rowing 5‚Äì4. A 5‚Äì10 loss to Australian Greg Jenkins in qualifying for the 1990 World Championship was Foulds' last match as a professional; finishing the 1989/1990 season ranked 129th, he left competitive snooker at its conclusion, aged 50. He was a director of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) from December 1989 to 11 April 1997 and served as the Association's chair from December 1996 until 1 April 1997. In 1995 Foulds was part of a three-man expert panel that adjudicated on a WPBSA panel that ruled against Peter Francisco who had been accused of match fixing to manipulate a 10‚Äì2 defeat to Jimmy White at the 1995 World Snooker Championship.

The people of this coastal area are mainly Lebu and the Serer. There are, unusually, Catholic communities here and a Catholic church in Nguering 5 km away. Ngaparou had 5735 inhabitants and 654 households before the creation of a town in 2004. Today, the town has a population of more than 15,000. Ngaparou's economy is based on fishing, handicrafts, trade and tourism. It is basically a fishing village which has been opened to tourism in the early twenty century because of its wide beaches and pleasant climate. The town does not have large buildings to accommodate tourists because of local opposition. The fishing industry has been under threat because of illegal overfishing which means that several fish species are no longer available. The fishermen have joined together to plan areas that will not be fished so that stocks can recover. A grant from the World Bank has enabled them to purchase refrigerated transport so that their catch can be transported to towns where it can attract higher prices. Nearby localities are Keur Timak, Somone, Keur Youngar, Nguering and Saly.

Life Burchardt, born in Berlin in 1857, gave up his unwanted merchant profession at the age of 30, following the death of his father who left him with a large inheritance. Around this time, Burchardt who had a developed a keen interest in photography, chose to become a privateer - that is, a man who travelled for pleasure. Before disembarking on his journeys to Africa and the Middle East, he learnt systematically, both, Arabic and Turkish, while studying in Berlin's Department of Oriental Languages (Seminar f√ºr Orientalische Sprachen) between the years 1890‚Äì1892, as also learnt the rudiments of Swahili and Persian (Farsi). His inherited wealth enabled him to rent an apartment in Damascus, Syria, where he lived for several years, using the city as his base for disembarking on his more extended travels. In his travels throughout the Muslim world, he was usually accompanied by his Syrian Arab guide and confidant, Abu Ibrahim. The beginning of his journeys took him to Tangier, in Morocco, and from there to Samarkand in Central Asia. Eventually, his tours would lead him to East Africa and, particularly, to the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. On these trips he was furnished with his own complete, state-of-the-art photographic equipment, enabling him to take photographs of peoples and the places he visited. He had also taken along with him the necessary tools for developing the plates and for the production of prints. Burchardt first arrived in Sana'a, Yemen in 1901, where he spent almost one year with the Jewish community. On the third of these extensive travels, in December 1909 he made arrangements to join-up with the Italian vice-consul Marquis Benzoni in Mocha, and to escort him on his journey to Sana'a via Taiz and al- øUdayn. In Burchardt's last missive sent by postcard from Mocha and dated 8 December 1909, he wrote: \\"This card will reach you from one of the most godforsaken little places in Asia. It exceeds all my expectations, with regard to the destruction. It looks like a city entirely destroyed by earthquakes. The path from Taiz to here, which takes 3 days, was or should have been insecure. There were the usual disorders with the tax collectors, with whom there were deaths on both sides. Here lives the Italian consulate, and the consul will go back with me to Sanaa. Photos from here will be very interesting. The last stage in the plain is terribly hot; bad water; quinine is given to all my people (11 people in number, including 8 Gendarmerie). Will be glad to once again reach the high plateau of Arabia Felix.\\"Original German: Postkarte. Mokka, den 8. Dezbr. 09. Diese Karte erh√§ltst Du aus dem gottverlassensten Neste Asiens. Es √ºbertrifft alle meine Erwartungen, was Zerst√∂rtsein anbetrifft. Es sieht aus wie eine durch Erdbeben g√§nzlich zerst√∂rte Stadt. Die Weg von Taiz nach hier, 3 Tage, war oder sollte unsicher sein. Es waren wohl die gew√∂hnlichen Unruhen beim Steuereintreiben, bei denen es auf beiden Seiten einige Tote gegeben. Hier wohns im italienischen Konsulat, und der Konsul reist mit zur√ºck nach Sanaa. Photos von hier werden sehr interessant sein. Die letzte Etappe in der Ebene f√ºrchterlich heiss, schlechtes Wasser, Chinin gebe allen meinen Leuten (11 an der Zahl, inkl. 8 Zaptijeh). Werde froh sein, sobald wieder das Hochplateau des gl√ºcklichen Arabien erreiche (Michael Friedl√§nder, Hermann Burchardt: Mitteilungen aus seinen letzten Briefen [Messages from his last letters], published in Journal: Ost und West [Illustrated monthly magazine for all of Judaism], issue 2 / February 1910, Berlin, p. 108). While their small caravan was en route to Sana'a, when they had come within three to four days' walking distance from Sana'a, and had just crossed the riverine gulch, WƒÅdƒ´ ad-Door (), to the west of Ibb, they were ambushed and killed by gunmen, in what some say was a case of mistaken identity.Michael Friedl√§nder, Hermann Burchardt: Mitteilungen aus seinen letzten Briefen (Messages from his last letters), published in Journal: Ost und West (Illustrated monthly magazine for all of Judaism), issue 2 / February 1910, Berlin, p. 109 (German); in 1926, in the Vienna publication, Menorah: Jewish family journal for science, arts and literature (issue 8, p. 436), the author had written that Hermann Burchardt was \\"murdered in communion with his companion Marchese (sic) Benzoni, in Yemen, on the way from Mocha to Sanaa.\\" Aus dem Jemen (ed. Eugen Mittwoch), Leipzig 1926, p. 39 (German). In Sana'a and the port city of Hodeida the news aroused general mourning among the European colony. The consulate's flag flew half-mast. The Christmas celebrations were canceled. The Italian merchant, Caprotti, who was a resident of Sana'a and a friend of Burchardt's since his first visit to Yemen, closed his epistolary communication of 23 December 1909 from Hodeida to the relatives of Burchardt with these words (in French): \\"Our poor, unfortunate friend was, by all who knew him, sincerely loved. The poor of Sana'a certainly weep over his tragic death. God will remember his kindness and charity. I know very well what he had done to comfort the poor.\\"Michael Friedl√§nder, Hermann Burchardt: Mitteilungen aus seinen letzten Briefen (Messages from his last letters), published in Journal: Ost und West (Illustrated monthly magazine for all of Judaism), issue 2 / February 1910, Berlin, p. 110 (German). Expeditions His first trip in the Spring of 1893 brought him to the Siwa Oasis in Egypt.Many of the photographic images of this place relate to the architecture of the town Siwa, photographs that are now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. See, for example, Siwa, viewed from the east, by Hermann Burchardt; Siwa, eastern part; Siwa, western part; Siwa, viewed from the south; Siwa, main street. Later he settled in Damascus for a few years, using this as a base for his travels throughout the region until he was killed in Yemen while en route from Mocha to Sana'a. Most of Burchardt's photographs have now been dated and their geographical location determined. A small but exquisite part of the collection has now been masterfully edited and commented in a volume with texts in both English and German. It covers Burchardt's journey over the period of December, 1903 to March, 1904, when he traveled from Basra to Kuwait and on to Bahrain, Hofuf,The town al-Hofuf, as photographed by Hermann Burchardt in 1904.

From Basra to Muscat on basic own travel, in: Journal of the Geographical Society 21 (1906)], pp. 305-322. Of particular interest is Burchardt's travels to Yemen where he photographed the Jewish communities in Sana'a,Photo of Rabbi SƒÅlem al-JamƒÅl (left) and Rabbi Yi·∏•ya al-Abyadh (right), in 1907, by Hermann Burchardt. in RadƒÅ ª,Three companions, RadƒÅ ª, circa 1902. in MaswƒÅr and in Rouda.Jewish family in Rauda Particularly where Yemenite Jewry is concerned, a visually- based ethnography also preserves facts that are forgotten in oral traditions and are not mentioned in written sources. Hermann Burchardt visited Yemen in 1902, 1907, and again in 1909, the year in which he was killed in Yemen. Hermann Burchardt (left) with his Yemeni secretary, A·∏•med Mu·∏•ammad el-«¶arƒÅdƒ´ (ca. 1909) Personal effects After his death, Burchardt's nephew, Max Ginsberg, donated in 1911 more than 500 photographic plates and contact sheets of the traveler (taken from the estate of Hermann Burchardt) to the Berlin Museum of Ethnology (Museum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde), today, the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, for a total of nearly 2000 negatives, glass and celluloid plates, where they lay dormant and forgotten in their boxes, until after the year 2000, at which time, with support from the German Research Foundation, they were scientifically analyzed and published. Burchardt kept a diary of his travels, but for many years it was thought that his diary was lost. Burchardt's private notes in his diary were necessary to identify many of his photographs, without which it would have been nearly impossible. In a search for the estate of Eugen Mittwoch, who evaluated Burchardt's papers on Yemen as late as the 1920s, part of Burchardt's estate came to light in the National Archive in Jerusalem. In these boxes were diaries, letters and lists with picture titles.Unterwegs am Golf: von Basra nach Maskat (ed. Annegret Nippa, Peter Herbstreuth), Berlin 2006, p. 5.Annegret Nippa, Lesen in alten Photographien aus Baalbek [Photos von Hermann Burchardt], Z√ºrich 1996, p. 9; The National Library of Israel (Jerusalem), ARC. Ms. Var. 525 (Hermann Burchardt Archive). At the end of processing of the photographic estate, about 90% of the almost 2,000 pictures could be identified and dated. The results of this work were partly issued in Yemen and the Arab States of the Gulf Coast and reviewed there with great interest. The National Museum in Sana'a has a small permanent exhibition of black-and-white photographs of the German traveler, Hermann Burchardt. As an avid traveler Burchardt had photographed extensively not only in the Arabic Middle East (e.g. archaeological sites in Hauran of Syria, etc.)Early photographs of Hauran's archaeological sites, taken in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by German explorer and photographer, Hermann Burchardt, are now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.

It is believed by some that Burchardt used the home of Gustav Sachs in Moabit, Berlin, as his home base on return from travels, as well as a mailing address. In February 1906, he gave a lecture at the General Assembly of the Berlin Society for Geography. Max Freiherr von Oppenheim made extensive use of Burchardt's photographic work which he published in his own studies of the Orient.

A. T. Lane, Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, Vol. 1, pp. 224‚Äì226. Alexander died aged 85 at 17 Sutherland Street in Partick, Glasgow. In 1944 Helen remarried, to widower George Anderson of Anderson Brothers Engineers, Coatbridge. He was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He died on 2 February 1952 and Helen died at Mahson Cottage, Kilbride Avenue, Dunoon, Argyll, aged 76. Political activity Crawfurd first became active in the women's suffrage movement around 1900, then in 1910 during a meeting in Rutherglen. Helen was jailed three times for \\"militant\\" political activity throughout her career as an activist. In 1912, she smashed the windows of Jack Pease, Minister for Education, and received a one-month prison sentence. In March 1914, Helen was arrested in Glasgow when Emmeline Pankhurst was speaking, received another month in prison, and went on an eight-day hunger strike. After one more arrest, she left the WSPU in protest at its support of World War I and in 1914 she joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Mary Barbour Statue - Front view During the war, Crawfurd was involved with the Red Clydeside movement, including the Glasgow rent strikes in 1915 when she led the South Govan Women's Housing Association to resist rent increases and prevent evictions, alongside Mary Barbour, Mary Laird, Mary Jeff and Agnes Dollan. She had co-founded the Glasgow branch of the Women's International League and become secretary of the Women's Peace Crusade. On 23 July 1916, she organised the first demonstration of the Women's Peace Crusade, which was attended by 5,000 people. She formed a branch of the United Suffragists in Glasgow. In 1918 she was elected as vice-chair of the Scottish division of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Shortly afterwards, she became a founder member of the ILP's left-wing faction, which was campaigning for it to affiliate to the Communist International. Crawford went to Moscow in 1920, with Marjory Newbold, Sylvia Pankhurst, Willie Gallacher and others for the Congress of the Third Communist International and interviewed Lenin. When the affiliation policy was defeated, she joined the new Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and served on the central committee and was involved with various journalistic projects. She became secretary of Workers' International Relief. In 1919, Crawfurd was a delegate to the Congress of the Women's International League in Z√ºrich. Crawfurd ran in 1921 as the first Communist Party candidate in the Govan ward. In 1927, Crawfurd was an official delegate to the Brussels International Conference against Oppressed Nationalities, at which the League against Imperialism was established. Crawfurd became a member of the executive of the British section. Crawfurd stood for the CPGB in Bothwell at the 1929 general election, and Aberdeen North in 1931, but did not come close to being elected. During the 1930s, Crawfurd was prominent in the Friends of the Soviet Union. She unsuccessfully stood for Dunoon Town Council in 1938, but she was elected as Dunoon's first woman town councillor shortly after the war, retiring in 1947 due to poor health.\\"Crawfurd Helen\\", Compendium of Communist Biography Helen Crawfurd died in 1954.

According to correspondence sent to Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries, the apple Tom Putt was supposed to have been named for an 18th-century landowner, Thomas Putt of Combe, who died in 1787 and was nicknamed \\"Black Tom\\".Amery (ed). Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries v7, pt 1 (1913), 64 Putt, a barrister, is reputed to have perfected the variety and is also said to have won prizes for his fruit trees at agricultural fairs in Honiton.History of Combe House, accessed 02-09-15 However older growers in Somerset, according to Harold Taylor in The Apples of England, told a story that the Putt commemorated by the apple was a rector, Rev. Thomas Putt of Trent, a nephew of Thomas Putt of Combe.Sandison, A. Trent in Dorset, Friary Press, 1969, p.89 It is possible that \\"Black Tom\\" Putt first developed the variety and subsequently gave a tree to his nephew. Characteristics Tom Putt was grown widely across Devon and Somerset for many years, in gardens as well as orchards, leading to it being nicknamed the \\"Cottage Apple\\". Although due to this wide propagation it is now somewhat variable in form it is usually a red-streaked apple of medium size. It is an early-bearing triploid variety, classed as a \\"sharp\\" type under the usual classification of cider apples. Although primarily a cider apple, Tom Putt can also be used as a cooking or eating apple. Taylor, who stated that it \\"looks attractive on the table as dessert, and has a characteristic sharp flavour of its own\\" noted that it was used for all three purposes in Somerset.

Since October 2014 people eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare were given the legal right to have a personal health budget. NHS England‚Äôs Five Year Forward View called for a ‚Äòmajor expansion‚Äô of the scheme. NHS Choices describes personal health budgets as a way \\"to give people with long-term conditions and disabilities greater choice and control over the healthcare and support they receive.\\" Practical arrangements A personal health budget may be used by a patient to buy a range of services to meet their health and well-being needs. This might include things not traditionally commissioned by the NHS, or may be used to pay for services like nursing care which are provided by the NHS, but giving them more autonomy in deciding where, how and when their care and support is provided. A personal health budget can be managed in three different ways: *A notional budget where no money changes hands and an NHS organisation manages the money on someone's behalf *A third-party arrangement: an organisation legally independent of the patient and the NHS manages the money *A direct payment: money is transferred directly to the patient, and they buy the goods and services agreed in their personalized care and support plan The Royal College of General Practitioners produced guidance for its members on the use of Personal health budgets in 2012. PHBs have been mainly used for people with continuing health needs. The RCGP explained that \\"At the heart of a personal health budget is a care or support plan ‚Äì an agreement between the local NHS and the individual that sets out the person‚Äôs health needs, the amount of money available to meet those needs and how this money will be spent.\\" By 2015-16 expenditure on PHBs was estimated at ¬£123 million per year, just over 0.1% of NHS spending. The number of people with a budget was 4,800, so the average package costs ¬£25,600. PHBs have been targeted on people with most significant needs, generally people on continuing care packages. Expansion In April 2018 the Department of Health and Social Care proposed to increase the scope of the scheme, claiming that personal health budgets had reduced NHS continuing healthcare costs by 17%. At present only people receiving continuing healthcare funding have a right to a personal health budget, though clinical commissioning groups may offer personal health budgets to others. The new groups proposed to be eligible are: * people with ongoing social care needs; *those eligible for section 117 aftercare services and who make ongoing use of community mental health services; *those leaving the armed forces; *people with a learning disability, autism or both; and *people who access wheelchair services whose posture and mobility needs impact their wider health and social care needs. It is proposed that those eligible should have an explicit right to receive direct payments. By May 2019 54,143 people had used a Personal Health Budget. These can also be used to purchase technical devices to control curtains, lighting, heating and door intercoms. It is expected that the number of users will increase substantially. There has not been any increase in funding, but the system now gives people more control. From December 2019, about 100,000 people eligible for an NHS wheelchair or requiring aftercare services under the Mental Health Act 1983 are entitled to a personal health budget. Advocates Personal budgets have been widely adopted in social care and have been championed by, among others, Liz Kendall, who advocated extending the idea into health services. Simon Duffy, who was the chief executive of the influential social enterprise company In Control, was one of the creators of Self Directed Support which piloted the idea with people with learning disabilities. According to him \\"If you don't tell people what the budget is, as a local authority you are forced into a position of planning for them in order to ration, but if you give them a budget, doing the rationing up front, you liberate people and their families to do their own planning, and liberate service providers to do creative planning. Philosophically, this is a shift towards clarity about rights and duties.\\" His ideas were formulated in the Deinstitutionalisation of social care, where there has been much greater progress in the development of personal budgets. He was awarded the Albert Medal by Ivan Lewis who was at that time the minister for social care and championed his ideas in the Department of Health. The Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley is piloting both individual social care budgets and the Right to Control scheme to provide personal budgets integrated across different services. Martin Farran, who is the council‚Äôs executive director of adults and community services and also leads in this area for the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services is keen to extend personalisation into health, particularly mental health. He says this would \\"free up a lot of resources for better outcomes and at a lower cost.‚Äù Criticism A survey by Pulse in September 2015, based on Freedom of Information requests to Clinical Commissioning Groups was headlined \\"Revealed: NHS funding splashed on holidays, games consoles and summer houses\\" and generated considerable publicity. An angry 81-year-old widow in Gateshead complained that the NHS ‚Äúcan afford to pay for horse riding lessons but can‚Äôt get me to hospital.‚Äù According to Pulse the scheme has been used to pay for unevidenced treatments at the expense of long-established services, which are no longer provided. Duffy said PHBs made up a tiny percentage of NHS spending. It was assessed and approved by health professionals. \\"You cannot simply turn up to your GP and ask for a summer house.\\".... \\"There would have been no advantage in people carrying on spending the money exactly as the NHS used to spend the money.\\" Critics claim that giving money to individuals, rather than providing services, represents further fragmentation and is a move towards privatisation of public services, using a more consumerist approach. There are also worries that vulnerable people can be given heavy responsibilities that may add to their stress. Holland A similar scheme was introduced in the Netherlands in 1997. Because the number of personal budget holders increased tenfold between 2002 and 2010, and expenditure increased on average by 23% a year, restrictions were introduced. From 2014, only people who would otherwise have to move to a nursing or residential home could keep their budget or apply for one to enable them to continue living at home. There were reports of fraud and improper behaviour by brokers who handled money on behalf of vulnerable people who were not able to manage the budget themselves.

In the 1980s he was the principal advisor of Albania's premier, Ramiz Alia, with regard to Albania's international relations. Lazri was the founder, in 1981, of the Institute of Studies of International Relations (). He is also known as a publicist (mainly non-fiction). His name has attracted controversy in Albania as some media have deemed him to be a secret agent of the Soviet Union's KGB. Life Born in Vuno, in the Himara region, in 1923, Sofokli Lazri studied at Shkod√´r and Tirana high schools, and was involved in the National Liberation Movement, in the 5th Attacking Brigade, in which he participated in the liberation of Albania and Kosovo from Nazi Germany. He graduated in journalism at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Upon his return from his studies he worked as a journalist, eventually becoming the chief editor of the Bashkimi newspaper, as well as secretary of the council of editors of Z√´ri i Popullit. He was also a professor of the University of Tirana, where, in 1971, he obtained the Professor title. At the university he founded the chair of journalism, and focused on teaching international studies. In 1981 he founded the first Institute of Studies of International Relations in Albania. He was head of the Albanian Commission of Unesco, and from 1982 to 1991 political advisor of President Ramiz Alia. Lazri headed special missions such as the reestablishment of relations with the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania. Among Lazri's several publications is Rikthimi i dhimbjes (), a non-fiction book about World War II fighter Ramize Gjebrea and her tragic death, which was published post-mortem and reviewed by critic Dhimit√´r Shuteriqi. Controversy According to a book by Mehmet Elezi, entitled ‚ÄúEnigma e v√´llez√´rve siamez√´‚Äù, 2011, Lazri was one of the most powerful people in communist Albania. It is claimed he made key decisions in the international politics of Albania and that he ranked higher than Ramiz Alia in the eyes of the Soviet Union. Other publications describe Lazri as merely the chief of secret services of the KGB in Albania.

It is directed by Kenneth Branagh, from a screenplay co-written by Conor McPherson and Hamish McColl. The film stars Ferdia Shaw, Lara McDonnell, Josh Gad, Tamara Smart, Nonso Anozie, Colin Farrell, and Judi Dench. It details the adventures of Artemis Fowl II, a 12-year-old Irish prodigy who teams up with his faithful servant, as well as a a dwarf and a fairy, in order to rescue his father, Artemis Fowl I, who has been kidnapped by another fairy looking to reclaim an item the Fowl family has stolen. Originally intended to be launched as a franchise by Miramax in 2001, the film languished in development hell with several writers and directors attached until Walt Disney Pictures acquired the rights in 2013. Branagh was hired in September 2015, and much of the cast joined in 2017. Filming began in March 2018, taking place around Europe. Artemis Fowls intended theatrical release was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it was released digitally worldwide exclusively on Disney+ on June 12, 2020 and it is unknown if there will be a DVD or Blu-ray release. Reviews for the film were \\"pretty brutal\\". Plot On the coast of Ireland, a media frenzy descends on Fowl Manor, where a stolen collection of world-famous relics is linked to wealthy businessman Artemis Fowl. Arrested at the manor, Mulch Diggums is interrogated by British intelligence and claims that his employer has stolen the powerful \\"Aculos\\". Offering to prove the existence of magic, Diggums tells the story of Artemis Fowl, Jr. Three days earlier, Artemis, a 12-year-old genius, lives at Fowl Manor with his widowed father Artemis Sr., who passes on his knowledge of Irish fairy tales. Artemis Sr. goes missing from his boat, the Fowl Star, accused of the theft of several priceless artifacts found aboard, and Artemis receives a call from a hooded figure. Holding his father captive, the hooded figure gives Artemis three days to recover the Aculos, which Artemis Sr. has stolen and hidden. Domovoi \\"Dom\\" Butler, Artemis' bodyguard, shows him a hidden library where generations of Fowls have catalogued proof of the existence of magical creatures. Deep underground in Haven City ‚Äì home to a secret civilization of fairies ‚Äì Mulch, revealed to be an oversized dwarf thief, encounters Lower Elements Police reconnaissance (LEPrecon) officer Holly Short as he is taken to prison. Commander Julius Root dispatches the LEPrecon force to search for the missing Aculos, the fairies' greatest resource. Foaly, LEPrecon's centaur technical advisor, discovers an unauthorized creature has reached the surface. Holly is sent to investigate, despite the fact that her father, Beechwood Short, stole the Aculos and was killed. In Martina Franca, Italy, Holly intervenes as a rogue troll attacks a human wedding party. Using a \\"time freeze\\", LEPrecon subdues the troll and wipes the humans' memories. Dom's 12-year-old niece Juliet arrives at the manor. From his father's journal, Artemis learns that Beechwood brought the Aculos to Artemis Sr. to keep it from the hooded figure, who is revealed to be Opal Koboi, a powerful fairy planning to wipe out humankind. Studying his father's notes, Artemis sends Dom to stakeout the Hill of Tara. Holly, determined to clear her father's name, disobeys orders and flies to the Hill of Tara, where she finds Beechwood's ID tag, but is captured by Dom and imprisoned inside the manor. Root and an army of LEPrecon officers seal Fowl Manor in a time freeze, but Artemis and Dom fight them off using Holly's equipment. Artemis demands the Aculos in exchange for Holly's release, and forbids any fairy to enter his home while he is alive. Bound by fairy rules, Root is forced to retrieve Mulch from prison, offering him a reduced sentence to infiltrate Fowl Manor. Mulch tunnels inside and breaks into Artemis Sr.'s hidden safe, finding the Aculos, while Artemis frees Holly and asks for her help. Lieutenant Briar Cudgeon, a spy for Koboi, seizes command of LEPrecon and releases the captured troll into the house, jamming all magic inside. Mulch swallows the Aculos as Artemis, Holly, Juliet, and Dom evade the rampaging troll, which is subdued when it falls from a chandelier. Pushing Artemis out of the troll's way, Dom is mortally wounded. Against Cudgeon's orders, Holly's fellow officers unblock her magic, and she revives Dom. Mulch and the LEPrecon army escape as the time freeze collapses. Left with the Aculos, which no human can wield, Artemis refuses to give such a powerful weapon to Koboi, and Holly agrees to use it to rescue Artemis' father. As Koboi attempts to kill Artemis Sr., Holly summons him safely to Fowl Manor. Reunited with his son, Artemis Sr. tells Holly that her father gave his life to protect the Aculos, giving her a list of Koboi's accomplices. Holly returns the Aculos to Haven City, where Root, back in command, directs her to investigate every name on the list. Artemis calls Koboi with a promise to come after her, and joins his father and Dom in a helicopter. Mulch's interrogator offers him freedom in exchange for help capturing Artemis Sr., but Mulch reveals that Artemis arranged his arrest to prove the incident to the authorities, before proceeding to confirm the existence of magic and his own status as a dwarf on camera. As the interrogator calls for backup, the Fowls' helicopter rescues Mulch and, joined by Holly, they fly off to their next mission. Cast Miranda Raison and Laurence Kinlan, in scenes that were filmed but not used, respectively portrayed Angeline Fowl, Artemis' deceased mother, and Beachwood Short, Holly's deceased father and a former member of the LEP. Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer also filmed a cameo appearance as an extra. Production =Development= In 2001, plans were announced for a film adaptation of the series. Miramax Films purchased the film rights with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct and Jeff Stockwell to write. In 2003, Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year but expressed skepticism over whether or not this would come to pass. The film remained in development and was assumed to be in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie, with Saoirse Ronan attached as Holly Short. In July 2013, Walt Disney Pictures announced that they would produce an Artemis Fowl film, with The Weinstein Company, covering the events of the first and second novels of the series, and written by Michael Goldenberg. Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal signed on to the project as executive producers. On September 1, 2015, Variety reported that Kenneth Branagh had been hired to direct the film for Disney, with Irish playwright Conor McPherson as screenwriter and Judy Hofflund as an executive producer. On September 12, 2017, Disney announced that the film adaptation would be released on August 9, 2019. The following month, Disney removed Harvey Weinstein as producer of the film and terminated its production partnership with The Weinstein Company following a sexual misconduct scandal involving Weinstein. Instead, Judy Hofflund co-produced with Branagh. Colfer has stated that he supports the changes from the source material in the film. =Casting= On September 18, 2017, it was reported that Judi Dench was in talks for an undisclosed role. On December 20, 2017, it was announced that Irish newcomer and grandson of Robert Shaw, Ferdia Shaw, had been cast as Artemis Fowl II, alongside Dench as Commander Root, Josh Gad as Mulch Diggums, Lara McDonnell as Captain Holly Short, and Nonso Anozie as Butler. Colin Farrell was added to the cast as Artemis Fowl I during reshoots, and his involvement was revealed through the second trailer in March 2020.Artemis Fowl Trailer Reveals Colin Farrell Casting McDonnell's casting as Short brought accusations of whitewashing, given the character in the book series is described as having dark nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion. Similarly, Anozie's casting as Butler was criticized, as the books describe him as a Eurasian who can pass as Japanese and Russian; and because the character's physical description of terrifying anyone in his presence, combined with his backstory of his family having served the Fowl family for centuries, was seen with Anozie's casting as embodying several stereotypes of African Americans and Africans, in particular the \\"scary black man\\" and \\"black servant\\" tropes. Author Eoin Colfer filmed a cameo appearance as an extra. Describing his one scene, filmed in Northern Ireland, Colfer said, \\"I walked across a field with a lot of other people. It wasn‚Äôt too taxing ‚Äì although I did manage to get it wrong a few times. The only direction they gave was: 'Walk across the field and don‚Äôt look at the camera.' I must have looked at the camera about 20 times. I have a new respect for actors.\\" =Filming= On March 12, 2018, the rest of the cast was announced (including Nikesh Patel as Foaly) as principal production commenced. The film was shot at Longcross Studios, and in England, Northern Ireland and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, as well as in Italy and Scotland. Release The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on August 9, 2019 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. In May 2019, the film was pushed back to May 29, 2020. Later however, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, the film's theatrical release was cancelled and it was exclusively released on Disney+ on June 12, 2020. =Critical response= As of September 2020, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 9% based on reviews from 163 critics and an average rating of 3.70/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A would-be franchise-starter that will anger fans of the source material and leave newcomers befuddled, Artemis Fowl is frustratingly flightless.\\" On Metacritic, as of September 2020, the film has a score of 31 out of 100 based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Comic Book Resources wrote that critics were \\"blasting the film for not being entertaining enough and [for] poor execution.\\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a \\"D+\\" and noted that it lacked \\"an effective star, good effects, general coherency, and any sense of actual magic,\\" adding, \\"Taking serious liberties from the first two books in the series ‚Äî all the better to slim down a packed plot, one of the few good creative choices that went into the film's making ‚Äî Conor McPherson and Hamish McColl's screenplay eventually thins down a convoluted story to near- nothingness.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety said the film feels \\"tortuously long at just 93 minutes\\" and that \\"we get a movie with a loosely defined hero, an even vaguer villain and a whole lot of things flying at the screen, in service of one of those endings that suggests we've just watched the origin story for a character we'll never hear from again.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"this big-budget fantasy adventure from Disney is busy and exhausting.\\" Scott Mendelson called it one of the worst YA adaptions ever. Fortress of Solitude called it \\"one of the worst films ever made\\".

He was involved in most of the core historiography projects undertaken in the German Democratic Republic (1949‚Äì1989). His work on the nineteenth-century German Labour movement places him firmly in the mainstream tradition of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist historical interpretation. Life Horst Bartel was born in Cottbus. His father worked in street construction. By the time Bartel left school, in 1942, war had broken out. He started a teacher training course at Orlau in Upper Silesia, but he left the course in 1944 without completing it. In the meantime, in 1943 he joined the Hitler Youth organisation, and during the same year was conscripted for National Labour Service. As Germany's eastern frontier moved west to the accompaniment of industrial scale ethnic cleansing, he appears to have moved west, since in 1945 he was captured not by the Red army but by the Americans who held him as a prisoner of war between May and September 1945, initially at Heilbronn and subsequently at Linz. Between September 1945 and 1946 Bartel worked as a messenger at a hospital in Cottbus. In April 1946 he was one of many thousands in what had by now become Germany's Soviet occupation zone to join the newly formed Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) which a few years later would become the ruling party for a new standalone \\"East German\\" state. Later the same year he embarked on an accelerated on-the-job teacher-training course.The Neulehrer (New teacher on- the-job training) programme was an emergency measure implemented directly after the end of the war to address a desperate shortage of teachers, in the broader shortage, especially in the eastern part of the country, of a growing shortage of working age population, reflecting wartime deaths and a steady migration towards the US and British occupation zones during the later 1940s. The course included work as a teacher at a primary school at Peitz, a small town a short distance to the north of Cottbus. In Bartel's case, however, teaching was quickly superseded, still in 1946, by a period of university level study at Berlin's Humboldt University, focusing on history, German studies and pedagogy. His student studies continued until 1949. In 1949 Bartel became a teacher, and then a school head, in Wandlitz, just outside Berlin on its north side. Between July and September 1950 he then undertook a training course at the Regional Party Academy in Schmerwitz, before being an appointed, in 1951, Schools Advisor (Stadtschulrat) in the important Potsdam District. That same year he started a higher level study course at the Party Central Committee's Social Sciences Institute (Akademie f√ºr Gesellschaftswissenschaften beim ZK der SED / IfG). This led him to a doctorate, awarded in February 1956. The subject matter for his doctoral dissertation was the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels for the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat during the period of the Anti-Socialist Laws (1878 - 1890). Between 1956 and 1960 he worked as a lecturer, while at the same time heading up the teaching department at the IfG. In 1960, on the recommendation of Ernst Engelberg, Bartel took over as Director of the Institute. He was also appointed deputy director of the Historical Institute of the (East) German Academy of Sciences, an appointment made despite opposition from the Academy founder and well regarded economist J√ºrgen Kuczynski.Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk: Legitimation eines neuen Staates. Parteiarbeiter an der historischen Front. Geschichtswissenschaft in der SBZ/DDR 1945 bis 1961. Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 1997, p. 250. From 1966 Bartel also served as associate professor with a teaching post and a professorial chair covering the History of the German Labour Movement at the important Party Central Committee's Social Sciences Institute / Academy (IfG/AfG).At around this time the IfG itself was renamed AfG, becoming an \\"Academy\\" instead of an \\"Institute\\". From 1956 till 1959 Bartel was a member of the editorial collective on the Journal for Historical Science (Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaft). He then joined the editorial collective of the academic journal Contributions to the History of the German Labour Movement (Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung), remaining with the journal until his death. Between 1967 and 1973 he was the editor of the History Yearbook (Jahrbuch f√ºr Geschichte). A further academic followed in 1969 when he received his habilitation for a work entitled \\"A Study of Contributions to the History of the Implementation of Marxism in the German Labour Movement during the final third of the Nineteenth Century\\" (\\"Studie Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Durchsetzung des Marxismus in der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung im letzten Drittel des 19. Jahrhunderts\\"). It was also in 1969 (again in the teeth of opposition from Kuczynski and others) that he was appointed to succeed Ernst Engelberg as director of the Historical Institute at the German Academy of Sciences, a position he retained until his death in 1984. Horst Bartel provided information to the Ministry for State Security as a Gesellschaftlicher Mitarbeiter Sicherheit (a professionally high ranking category of informal Stasi collaborator). At the same time he served as deputy chairman of the National History Council. He became a corresponding fellow of the German Academy of Sciences in 1969, progressing to a full fellowship in 1972. From 1975 he chaired the German Democratic Republic section of the German-Soviet Historical Commission. It was in this capacity that in 1977 he undertook an extended study visit to Moscow, and in 1982 he became a foreign member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (as it was then known). Also in 1982 he became an associate professor of the Humboldt University in Berlin. Evaluation Horst Bartel was one of an initially small minority of committed communists in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany (from 1949 the German Democratic Republic) at the end of the war who not only worked together on constructing historical seminars and institutes, but together transformed the context of historical study so that it might comply with the precepts of the East German ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). , a prolific historian who was also noted as an uncompromising critic of the German Democratic Republic and its one party dictatorship, contended that Bartel, along with like-minded colleagues such as Walter Bartel, Karl Bittel, Rudolf Lindau and Albert Schreiner, lacked necessary academic competence, and that even within party corridors were widely viewed as simple propagandists.

It was known in the early 20th century as the Colonial School, when it was run by the Geographical Society of Lisbon. In 2016, ISCSP celebrated 110 years of continuous operation. As a higher education institution, ISCSP aims to equip students with skills in the cultural, scientific and technical fields; conduct fundamental and applied research; provide community service; and promote exchanges in the social and political sciences.  History of Escola Colonial (Colonial School)  The Colonial School was established by a decree of 18 January 1906 of the Portuguese Navy and Overseas Affairs Ministry. The decree created the School within the Geography Society of Lisbon, entrusting it to the same Society, under the overall inspection of the Government. The School had the special purpose of instructing those who were to participate in the operation of the Portuguese overseas possessions. On 4 October 1906, a decree approving the provisional regulation of the Colonial School was published, and on 13 November of the same year, the ordinance approving its provisional programmes was passed.  Functions of Colonial School  At the Colonial School, young men were recruited at an early stage to join the colonial administration. They manned the system and occupied positions in lower levels of the colonial machine. The graduates of the school moved up gradually to assume administrative and technical responsibilities in the different services that were created over the years in the process of development and transformation of the political and administrative organization of the so- called Overseas Territories.  Early Evolution  Ever since its creation, the School was subject constantly to changing ideas about Portugal's overseas policies, which was reflected in the School's various designations and instruction syllabuses. The \\"Colonial Course\\" had its initial study plan altered in 1919. The new name \\"General Colonial Course\\" was adopted. The course was expressly defined as higher education. In 1927, the School changed its name to Escola Superior Colonial (ESC). The Colonial Course was replaced in 1946 by courses in \\"Colonial Administration\\" and \\"Higher Colonial Studies\\". In 1954, the ESC was given a new name, Instituto Superior de Estudos Ultramarinos (ISEU) or Higher Institute of Overseas Studies.  Integration with Technical University of Lisbon  In 1961, the ISEU joined the Universidade T√©cnica de Lisboa (Technical University of Lisbon). Its overall mission remained largely the same: to deliver higher education in the \\"Overseas Sciences\\"; prepare staff for overseas administration; and promote scientific studies of Portugal's Overseas Territories, the people and their languages. In 1961, the list of subjects was revised and the taught courses came to be called the \\"Overseas Administration Course\\" and \\"Complementary Course of Overseas Studies\\". In 1962, the ISEU was renamed the Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias Sociais e Pol√≠tica Ultramarina (ISCSPU) or School of Social Sciences and Overseas Policy. Along this decade, the educational curricula expanded. New courses in Sociology and Anthropology were added, which made ISCSPU the first institution in Portugal to teach these academic subjects. In 1972 undergraduate degrees in Economics, \\"Labour Sciences\\" and Social Sciences were added.  Post-April 25 Revolution Era  With drastic political regime change, after 25 April 1974, the institution, along with other universities and higher education institutes, went through a difficult period. In December 1976 the restructuring ended. The institution has since been called Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias Sociais e Pol√≠ticas (ISCSP), which in direct translation means Institute of Social and Political Sciences. In the academic year 1977-1978, ISCSP resumed with a degree course in Political and Social Sciences which provisionally replaced the old syllabus. In 1980, by a decree dated 17 May, degree courses in Management and Public Administration, Social Communication, Anthropology and Social Work ‚Äî later renamed Social Policy ‚Äî were created. In the 1980s, ISCSP started to offer undergraduate courses in International Relations and Sociology of Work. By the end of the 1990s, an undergraduate programme in Political Science was added.  Integration with University of Lisbon  In 2013, ISCSP was integrated into the new University of Lisbon, as a result of the merger of the University of Lisbon (1911-2013) with the Technical University of Lisbon.  Courses  = Compliance with Bologna Process = The institution underwent changes to comply with the requirements of the Bologna Process. Currently, ISCSP offers nine undergraduate courses, fourteen master's courses and twelve doctoral courses, in full compliance with the Bologna Agreement. They are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd study cycles, respectively. = Undergraduate Degrees = * Public Administration; * Public Policy and Territorial Administration (after-work); * Anthropology (daytime); * Political Science (daytime); * Communication Sciences (daytime); * Human Resources Management (after-work); * International Relations; * Social Work; * Sociology = Master's = * Anthropology; * Social Communication; * Political Science; * Strategy; * African Studies; * Family and Gender; * Management and Public Policy; * MPA - Public Administration; * Social Policy; * Development Policies of Human Resources; * International Relations; * Society, Risk and Health; * Sociology; * Sociology of Organizations and Labour; In 2009, the MPA (Master in Public Administration) was created, the academic year beginning in 2009/2010. = Doctorates = * Public Administration; * Anthropology; * Political Science; * Strategic Studies; * Social policy; * International Relations; * Sociology  Buildings and Facilities  ISCSP is currently housed in its own building on the University Campus at Alto da Ajuda.

The sculptor was Francois Dieussart Sir Charles Morgan (1575 ‚Äì 1642) was an English army officer. He was the son of Edward Morgan of Monmouthshire and Frances Leigh from London. He distinguished himself as a skilled military officer during the Dutch Revolt. In 1626, the English Privy Council appointed him to lead an expedition in support of Charles I's uncle Christian IV of Denmark. In Denmark, Morgan faced constant problems securing provisions and pay for his troops, and had limited successes. He spent his final years as governor of Bergen op Zoom in the Netherlands. Service in the Netherlands Morgan began his military career in the Netherlands during the Dutch Revolt. There he married Elizabeth, the daughter of William the Silent's secretary, Philips of Marnix. He was a part of the joint Anglo-Dutch expedition which captured the Spanish city of Cadiz in 1596. Under the command of Sir Francis Vere, Morgan fought at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600 and in 1601 served in the defence of the city of Ostend. Morgan left the besieged city in 1603 to receive a knighthood from James I in England, and returned before the city was surrendered to the Spanish on 20 September 1604. Justice of the peace After the fall of Ostend, Morgan returned to Wales and served as a Justice of the peace (JP) in Monmouthshire. He was heavily criticised by the Bishop of Hereford Robert Bennet, who accused him of being overly lenient towards recusants, thereby encouraging Catholic rioting. He was briefly imprisoned for failing his duties as a JP, after he left for London whilst riots were ongoing in south Wales. Return to the Netherlands Morgan returned to the Netherlands in 1607, and remained there during the Twelve Years' Truce. When hostilities recommenced he returned to combat, commanding the English forces at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom, and serving in defence of the besieged city of Breda. His military prowess was praised by the Venetian ambassador to The Hague, who described him as one of the most accomplished officers of the Dutch campaign. Danish expedition In 1626, Charles I's uncle Christian IV of Denmark faced a heavy defeat at the Battle of Lutter to forces of the Catholic League commanded by Marshall Tilly. In response the English Privy Council appointed Morgan head of a military expedition to aid the Danish King. Morgan initially amassed 5,013 men, over half of whom had deserted by the time the regiments embarked from Enkhuizen for Denmark in March 1627. He blamed the desertions on the inexperience of his officers, many of whom were amongst the deserters. Morgan built a sconce on the river Weser from which he stopped supplies from the nearby city of Bremen reaching Tilly. Morgan's numbers were raised back to 4,913 in June through forced impressment, as he relocated to the confluence of the Weser and the Aller. Payment for the troops arrived irregularly and by July Morgan described his regiments as being too mutinous to defend themselves against enemy attack. By September he had been reduced to under 2,000 men, a quarter of whom were not fit for service. They were accompanied by 1,700 Dutch troops. As the situation worsened Morgan withdrew his troops to the city of Stade. In 1628, Morgan's regiments were surviving on what he described as a diet of cats and dogs. Stade's outworks were captured by Tilly who besieged the city and in one attack killed 500 of Morgan's men. In March, short on provisions and out of money, Morgan wrote to the Duke of Buckingham pleading for more support. Christian wrote to Morgan promising to send troops, but reneged on his promise. Morgan surrendered Stade on 28 April, having received no support from Buckingham or Christian. The sick and wounded were sent to Christian's fortress at Gl√ºckstadt, while Morgan accompanied his remaining troops to the Netherlands. There he was temporarily put under arrest for debt he had accrued in paying his men. He returned with his troops to England in June. In an audience with the king in July, he emphasised the need for pay and provisions for his regiments. He was ordered to return to Denmark, and on 31 October he arrived at Gl√ºckstadt with 1,200 men. Due to disputes with the town governor, his troops did not land until 1 December. He once again faced difficulties paying his troops. In England, Parliament was unwilling to support sending more troops to Denmark, instead proposing a public day of fasting. In March Morgan joined with the English companies that had wintered in Denmark as well as Scottish and Dutch troops, raising the number under his command to over 4,700. He successfully seized the island of Nordstrand from the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. In June, Christian announced a truce, and Morgan's troops were sent off to Holland with little ceremony. Final years After the Danish expedition, Morgan returned to service in the Netherlands. In 1631 he was briefly held captive by Dunkirk privateers. He fought for the Prince of Orange during the Siege of Breda. He spent his final years as governor of Bergen op Zoom, where he died in 1643.

Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters (COSCUP; ) is an annual conference held by Taiwanese Open source community participants since 2006. It's a major force of Free software movement advocacy in Taiwan. The event is often held in two days, with talks, sponsor and communities booths, and Birds of a feather (computing). In addition to international speakers, many Taiwanese local Open Source contributors often give their talks here. The chief organizer, other staffs, and speakers are all volunteers. COSCUP's aim is to provide a platform to connect Open Source coders, users, and promoters, and promote FLOSS with the annual conference. The conference is free to attend because of the enthusiastic sponsors and donators. Since the conference venue is limited, tickets are often sold out immediately after the online registration starts. The lightweight Desktop Environment LXDE was announced at COSCUP 2006.  History  COSCUP's predecessor was the community talks in International Conference on Open Source (, ICOS). In 2006, ICOS's topics no longer fit some attendees' demand; Taiwanese Open source community participators initiated COSCUP, as a \\"festival\\" for Taiwanese open source communities. The first event, COSCUP 2006, was held at National Taiwan University Sports Center, and was a great success with almost 200 attendees. The number of attendees grew to almost 2000 by COSCUP 2014. In 2014, COSCUP moved to Taipei International Convention Center, with 1,500 attendees, and 110 talks. Later in 2014, COSCUP was back to Academia Sinica Humanities and Social Sciences Building, but the conference also extends to the neighboring Academia Sinica Academic Activities Center. This was the first time COSCUP was held in two venues simultaneously.  Registration  COSCUP's registration set records in 2010, 2011, and 2012, as the server crashed within minutes after registrations began, the registration process is often done after hours, due to heavy server load. In COSCUP 2013, the conference started to use Registrano for registration.

Due to the short nature of that campaign, this was one of the only set-piece battles that transpired before its conclusion. During the battle, elements of the Japanese Fifth Army attempted to delay the Soviet Fifth Army and First Red Banner Army long enough to allow the bulk of the Japanese forces to retreat to more defensible positions. Though casualties on both sides were heavy, the Red Army forces were able to break through the hastily organized Japanese defenses and capture the city ten days ahead of schedule. Nevertheless, the Japanese defenders at Mutanchiang achieved their goal of allowing the main forces to escape. Background In February 1945 at the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan within three months' of Germany's defeat. In order to meet this deadline, it was necessary that the Soviet Union and the Western Allies cooperate in stockpiling supplies in the Far East while the Red Army dispatched additional forces along the Trans- Siberian Railway. While the Japanese monitored this buildup, they did not believe the Soviets would be ready to attack until mid-September, resulting in their being taken by surprise when the attack actually began on August 8. The Japanese force tasked with defending Manchuria, the Kwantung Army, was by this time reduced from the IJA's premier fighting force to a shell of its former self. Having been stripped of most heavy equipment and experienced formations, its forces had an average efficiency of under 30 percent relative to prewar units. The Soviets, on the other hand, hand-picked their best formations from the war in Europe based on their experience against certain types of terrain and enemy defenses. Key to the defense of eastern Manchuria was General Seiichi Kita's First Area Army, based at Mutanchiang. Subordinate to this Area Army were the Japanese Fifth and Third Armies, of which the Fifth Army, led by Lieutenant General Noritsune Shimuzu, would play the main part in the coming battle. Overall strategy in the event of a Soviet attack was for an initial stand to be made near the borders, allowing the main Kwantung Army forces to withdraw to a \\"redoubt area\\" around the city of Tunghua. Unfortunately for the Japanese, neither the redeployments necessary for such a plan nor the fortifications at Tunghua were ready at the commencement of hostilities. The Soviet strategy, on the other hand, was exactly the opposite. In order to prevent the Kwantung Army from withdrawing to relative safety, the Red Army leadership under Marshal A.M. Vasilevsky planned a lightning assault in the form of a pincer movement, designed to stun and envelop the Japanese before they had a chance to escape. In charge of operations opposite the First Area Army in Eastern Manchuria was Marshal K.A. Meretskov's First Far Eastern Front, whose objectives were to seize Jilin and cut off Manchuria from Korea. These orders would take Meretskov's forces through the vital centers of Mutanchiang and Harbin. Leading the drive to Mutanchiang would be A.P. Beloborodov's 1st Red Banner Army and N.I. Krylov's Fifth Army, fully half of their parent Front's combat strength. Having denounced its neutrality pact with Japan on April 5, Soviet forces crossed the border into Japanese-held Manchuria at midnight on August 8, 1945, achieving tactical surprise. In response, the Imperial General Headquarters ordered the commencement of all- out military action against the Soviet Union. The Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War had begun in earnest. Actions prior to August 12 The initial thrust was opposed by the 135th, 126th, and 124th infantry divisions of the Japanese 5th Army, which were driven back by the Soviet attack. The main land routes to Mutanchiang consisted of two mountain passes, one to the north and one to the east of the city. The Soviets would make use of both of them, with the 1st Red Banner Army attacking from the north and the 5th Army attacking from the east. The Soviets were ultimately successful in their advance, but losses, especially in tanks, were very heavy. Of particular concern were concealed anti-tank guns as well as suicide bombers with explosives strapped to their backs. These, together with the torrential rain, made advancing difficult. Battle begins By August 12 the Japanese 5th Army had been compressed into a semicircle around Mutanchiang. While the Soviets continued to gain ground, the shrinking Japanese lines and their recovery from the initial attack meant that resistance in all sectors was stiffening. Despite showing an ability to recover and repair damaged tanks which both impressed and disheartened the Japanese, Soviet armored losses continued to mount: in one sharp action the 257th Tank Brigade's original strength of 65 tanks had been reduced to 7. Japanese losses were also severe: on the morning of August 13, a convoy of troop trains was ambushed by Soviet tanks, which destroyed the trains and killed approximately 900 Japanese soldiers. Thirty cars were lost, carrying 24 artillery pieces, 30 vehicles, 800 rifles, and 100 machine guns. Among those who barely survived was the commander of the IJA 135th division. Over the course of the next few days the Japanese continued resistance around Mutanchiang from a series of fortified hills, from which they could rain fire on the Soviet corridors. The Red Army was forced to take these hills one by one, using its preponderance in armor and artillery to neutralize the defenses. During the struggle for Mount Shozu, an important Japanese stronghold, the weight of Soviet fire was so great that it appeared as if the top of the mountain had been blown completely off. Suicide bombers and anti- tank guns remained an ever-present threat: on August 14 Japanese forces near Ssutaoling knocked out 16 Soviet tanks with direct fire and a further 5 with suicide bombers; the latter vehicles being destroyed by only 5 men. Nevertheless, these attacks were reliant on the fanaticism of the individual Japanese soldier, and while they resulted in the destruction of Soviet armor, Japanese human losses were much higher. The unexpectedly strong resistance around Mutanchiang caused Marshal Meretskov to change the 5th Army's objective from capturing the city to simply bypassing it, leaving the 1st Red Banner Army to take the city itself. This move threatened the integrity of the entire Japanese defense, and the situation became untenable. On August 15, General Shimizu, acting under the authorization of General Kita, ordered the IJA 5th Army to begin a withdraw, leaving only minor forces behind as a rearguard. At 0700 hours on August 16, the final Soviet assault on Mutanchiang began. Rocket artillery pulverized the remaining Japanese defenders, while tanks and infantry rushed forward to attack the city itself. However, in attempting to cross the Mudan River to the east of Mutanchiang, the 1st Red Banner Army found that all three bridges spanning it had been destroyed by the Japanese, and heavy fire from the opposite bank made a landing by boat impossible. In response, the Soviet 22nd Rifle Division crossed the river farther to the north and surprised the Japanese defenders from behind, forcing their withdrawal. This allowed the bulk of the 1st Red Banner Army to cross directly over the river and begin the assault on the downtown area. By 1100, Soviet forces began the room-by-room conquest of Mutanchiang in the face of fanatical resistance. By 1300, the Japanese rearguard had abandoned the city under pressure from the south, east, and northwest, leaving only scattered groups of diehards to continue resistance from the devastated buildings. As the 1st Red Banner Army invested Mutanchiang, the Soviet 5th Army to the south continued its advance westward, enveloping and destroying the Japanese 278th Infantry Regiment, the survivors of which mounted a last-ditch banzai charge rather than surrender. By the end of the day, all of Mutanchiang had fallen into Soviet hands, and the battle for the city was over. Shortly afterward, the main strength of the Kwantung Army laid down its arms in surrender as per the Emperor's broadcast. The Battle of Mutanchiang, and World War II, had come to an end. Results Through the speed and audacious conduct of their offensive, the Soviet 5th and 1st Red Banner Armies won a major victory at Mutanchiang, advancing 150-180 kilometers and capturing the objective fully ten days ahead of schedule. The rapid advance preempted Japanese plans to establish a strong initial defensive line before Mutanchiang and forced them to begin their withdrawal early, fragmenting their forces. Despite these successes, however, stiff Japanese resistance and the fact that the main strength of the Soviet Armies failed to keep pace with their spearheads meant that the bulk of the IJA 5th Army was able to withdraw, albeit at only 50% of its already below-standard effectiveness. Soviet leaders acknowledged this, admitting the retreating Japanese still constituted \\"a very considerable force.\\" All of this would matter little though, as the war ended before any further major fighting could take place. Casualties on both sides were heavy. The Japanese reported 25,000 overall casualties, including 9,391 killed, from both the 5th Army and other units subordinate to the 1st Area Army that took part in the fighting. They also admitted the loss of 104 artillery pieces. In exchange, they claimed to have inflicted 7,000-10,000 Soviet casualties and destroyed 300-600 tanks. These claims may actually have been an underestimate: Soviet calculations place the 1st Far Eastern Front's losses in the Manchurian campaign as 21,069, including 6,324 killed, captured, or missing and 14,745 wounded and sick. At least half of these were incurred during the fighting at Mutanchiang.

The visceral pleura is the delicate membrane that covers the surface of each lung, and dips into the fissures between the lobes of the lung. The parietal pleura is the outer membrane which is attached to the inner surface of the thoracic cavity. It also separates the pleural cavity from the mediastinum. The parietal pleura is innervated by the intercostal nerves and the phrenic nerve. Between the membranes is a fluid-filled space called the pleural space. Structure Each lung is covered by a double membrane, called the pleurae; each membrane is a pleura ‚Äì the visceral pleura adheres to the surface of the lung and the parietal pleura attaches to the thoracic cavity. The pleurae of each lung are not connected in any way. =Visceral pleura= Diagrammatic view of exaggerated pleural space. The visceral pleura is the delicate membrane that closely covers the surfaces of the lungs and dips into the fissures that separate the lobes. =Parietal pleura= The parietal pleura is the outer membrane that attaches to and lines the inner surface of the thoracic cavity, covers the upper surface of the diaphragm and is reflected over structures within the middle of the thorax. It separates the pleural cavity from the mediastinum. The parietal pleura is differentiated into regions in line with the location in the thorax. The \\"cervical pleura\\" (or \\"cupula of pleura\\") is in the region of the cervical vertebrae extending beyond the apex of the lung and into the neck. The \\"costal pleura\\" lines the inner surfaces of the ribs and the intercostal muscles and are separated from them by endothoracic fascia. An extension of the endothoracic fascia known as the suprapleural membrane covers the apex of each lung in a thickened layer of connective tissue. The \\"diaphragmatic pleura\\" lines the convex surface of the diaphragm. The \\"mediastinal pleura\\" attaches to the other organs in the mediastinum and forms the separating lateral wall. Between the two membranes is a space called the pleural cavity or interpleural space, which contains a lubricating fluid. =Nerve supply= The parietal pleura is supplied by the intercostal nerves and the phrenic nerve. The costal pleura is innervated by the intercostal nerves. The diaphragmatic portion of the parietal pleura overlies the diaphragm and is innervated by the phrenic nerve in its central portion and by the intercostal nerves in its peripheral portion. The mediastinal portion of the parietal pleura forms the lateral wall of the mediastinum and is innervated by the phrenic nerve. Development The visceral and parietal pleurae both derive from the lateral plate mesoderm which splits into two layers the somatopleuric mesoderm forming the parietal membrane and the splanchnopleuric mesoderm of the visceral membrane. Function The contraction of the diaphragm creates a negative pressure within the pleural cavity which forces the lungs to expand resulting in passive exhalation and active inhalation. This breathing process can be made forceful through the contraction of the external intercostal muscles which forces the rib cage to expand and add to the negative pressure in the pleural cavity causing the lungs to fill with air. The fluid in the cavity provides lubrication and cushioning. Clinical significance Pleurisy is a condition of inflamed pleurae. Pleurisy can lead to a build-up of fluid known as pleural effusion in the pleural cavity. Pleural effusion can also occur from other causes.

Many pious Christians took the work at face value, and it was recommended to John Wesley, who however noted that the book was in fact intended to show that Christianity was not reasonable: \\"the great design uniformly pursued throughout the work was to render the whole of the Christian institution both odious and contemptible.\\" Although the book was published anonymously, it was well known that Dodwell was the author.

Guidry (dates of birth and death missing; probably March 21, 1921 - September 2, 1987) was a Democratic politician from Cecilia in St. Martin Parish in South Louisiana, who served from 1973 to 1981 as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives during the first two administrations of Governor Edwin Washington Edwards. Early life Guidry was the son of Thomas D. Guidry, Sr. (1895-1965), and the former Therese Angelle (1893-1963). He had a sister, Elizabeth L. Castille (1930-2013) of Breaux Bridge in St. Martin Parish, and a brother, Thomas Guidry, Jr. (February 23, 1932 - July 5, 2015), an accountant from Cecilia, also in St. Martin Parish. Political career Guidry won a special election in 1973 to succeed Representative J. Burton Angelle, who became the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in the first two Edwards administrations. Coincidentally, eight years later, Guidry himself succeeded Angelle as LDWF secretary in the single term of Republican Governor David C. Treen. Guidry's House tenure had also spilled over into the first year of the Treen administration. While he was LDWF secretary, Guidry was sued by Voison's Oyster House, Inc., of Houma in Terrebonne Parish on grounds that Guidry had denied the company oyster leases. The trial court ordered summary judgment on grounds that Guidry was exempt from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution (1791), which requires that suits filed against states be heard in state courts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans affirmed the Eleventh Amendment in 1986 and ordered dismissal of Voison's suit, not on the merits, but on the lack of proper jurisdiction. When Edwards returned to the governorship in 1984 after having unseated Treen, Angelle succeeded Guidry for a third term as the LDWF secretary. Like Guidry, Angelle also had ties to Cecilia. In 1988, the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries headquarters in the capital city of Baton Rouge was named in Guidry's honor.

Bred and owned by the Yorkshire businessman Guy Reed she was trained by Barry Hills at Lambourn. She was a specialist sprinter, who won both of her races as a juvenile but injury restricted her career to five races in two years until she emerged as a top class sprinter as a four-year- old. In 2005 she won four of her seven races including the Cammidge Trophy and Ballyogan Stakes before recording her biggest win in the Nunthorpe Stakes. La Cucaracha remained in training at five and recorded another major victory on her final racecourse appearance when she won the King George Stakes. Background La Cucaracha is a bay mare with a faint white star and a white coronet markings on her hind feet bred at Copgrove Hall in North Yorkshire by her owner Guy Reed, a former RAF engineer who had made his fortune in the frozen chicken business. She was sired by the sprinter Piccolo and thus was a male-line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who trace their ancestry to the Darley Arabian. Piccolo's biggest win came in 1994 when he was awarded the Nunthorpe Stakes on the disqualification of Blue Siren. He went on to have some success as a sire of sprint horses including Temple of Boom (The Galaxy), Flying Blue (Chairman's Trophy), Tiddliwinks (Duke of York Stakes) and Winker Watson (July Stakes). La Cucaracha's dam Peggy Spencer won three minor races for Reed from sixteen attempts between 1994 and 1996. She was descendant of the broodmare Be Careful, the ancestor of several other major winners including Agnes World and Dubai Destination. The filly was sent into training with the veteran Barry Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire and was ridden in all but two of her races by the trainer's son Michael. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= La Cucaracha began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 26 April. Ridden by Tony Culhane, she took the lead at half way and went clear of her thirteen opponents to win by five lengths from the colt Fine Silver. Three weeks later the filly started 1/2 favourite for a minor stakes race at Newbury Racecourse and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths from the Mick Channon-trained Ma'Soola. La Cucaracha was injured shortly afterwards and missed the rest of the season. =2004: three-year-old season= Eleven months after her last start, La Cucaracha returned in the Listed Lansdown Fillies' Stakes race over five furlongs at Bath Racecourse on 27 April 2004 and recovered from interference in the last quarter mile to finish second, three-quarters of a length behind the five-year-old mare Ringmoor Down. In May she started 3/1 second favourite for the Carnarvon Stakes at Newbury but finished sixth after Hills was unable to obtain a clear run in the closing stages. Ten days later she finished third to the six-year- old gelding Celtic Mill in the Leisure Stakes at Windsor Racecourse before further injury problems kept her off the course for the remainder of the year. Barry Hills later explained that the filly had sustained a stress fracture which was successfully treated by the Newmarket vet Ian Wright. =2005: four- year-old season= La Cucaracha returned from her second lengthy absence to contest the Listed Cammidge Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 2 April 2005 and started a 14/1 outsider in an eleven-runner field headed by the veteran handicapper Smokin Beau. After being restrained by Hills in the early stages, the filly took the lead a furlong out and recorded her first important win, beating the five-year-old gelding The Kiddykid by half a length. After the race Barry Hills said \\"I thought she needed this race. Hopefully, she will progress from this... She has a lot of speed and won't want more than six furlongs\\". In the Duke of York Stakes five weeks later, the filly failed to reproduce her Doncaster form, finishing ninth of the eleven runners behind The Kiddykid. For her next race, La Cucaracha was sent to Ireland for the Group Three Ballyogan Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 1 June and started 9/2 second favourite behind her fellow English raider Kind. After racing in fifth place, the filly took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by half a length and a head from Alexander Icequeen and Kind. Michael Hills commented\\" La Cucaracha is a good filly on fast ground like we had tonight. Things went against her in the race. She was drawn on the outside and had to race wide. She got on to the wrong lead on the final bend and that made it harder for her\\". La Cucaracha faced Kind again when she returned to England for the Summer Stakes at York on 8 July. After tracking the leaders, she took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten three lengths by the Richard Hannon Sr.-trained Lucky Spin. Over the same course and distance two weeks later, the filly was assigned top weight of 136 pounds in the Skybet Dash Handicap and started 9/2 favourite despite carrying at least ten pounds more than any of her fourteen opponents. Hills sent the filly into the lead a furlong out and she kept on well to win by three quarters of a length from the eight-year-old gelding Connect. York Racecourse, where La Cucaracha won the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2005 After racing over six furlongs for most of her career, La Cucaracha was dropped back to five furlongs and stepped up to Group One class for the first time when she contested the Nunthorpe Stakes on firm ground at York on 18 August. The French challenger Chineur started favourite after winning the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot ahead of Avonbridge with La Cucaracha next in the betting on 7/1 alongside The Tatling (winner of the King's Stand in 2004). The other runners included Balmont (Middle Park Stakes), Moss Vale (Sandy Lane Stakes), Benbaun, Fire Up The Band (King George Stakes), Boogie Street (Achilles Stakes), Majestic Missile (Molecomb Stakes, Cornwallis Stakes), Fayr Jag (Golden Jubilee Stakes), The Trader (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne), Orientor (Chipchase Stakes) and Bahamian Pirate (winner of the race in the previous year). Hills restrained the filly in the early stages as Boogie Street set the pace, but then made forward move in the last quarter mile. La Cucaracha accelerated into the lead inside the final furlong and held off a strong late challenge from The Tatling to win by a head, with Majestic Missile taking third ahead of Boogie Street and Benbaun. After the race Michael Hills said \\"It's a good feeling. She quickened so well for me. But as soon as she got to the front she thought she'd done enough ‚Äì she nearly gave me a heart attack. I felt I had enough horse to keep in front, but she was just pulling up when I got to the lead. She's improved and improved and she loves this surface. The race went perfect, the split came with just a furlong to run and I had loads of horse under me\\". Barry Hills commented \\"She's good and she will get better. She likes it quick, there's no doubt about that, and it helps stop some of the others when it's on the fast side\\". Guy Reed, who was winning his first Group One race in 37 years as an owner had backed the filly at 33/1: he commented \\"I backed her first show, and my bookmaker will have been watching this. He's a decent chap.\\" On her next appearance, La Cucaracha was moved back up to six furlongs for the William Hill Sprint Cup at Haydock Park in September. She finished second behind the three-year-old colt Goodricke with Somnus, Proclamation, Lucky Spin, The Kiddykid and the Stewards' Cup winner Gift Horse among the other beaten runners. The filly was expected to end her season in the Hong Kong Sprint in December but sustained an injury and was retired for the year. =2006: five-year-old season= La Cucaracha made little impact on her first two appearances as a five-year-old. In June at Royal Ascot she started joint second favourite for the King's Stand Stakes but finished unplaced behind the Australian sprinter Takeover Target after racing along the unfavorable stands-side of the course. In the following month she had no obvious excuse when finishing eleventh of the fifteen runners behind Les Arcs in the July Cup. After two disappointing runs at Group One level, the mare was dropped in class for the Group Three King George Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 3 August. She was made the 7/2 favourite in a field which included The Tatling, Fayr Jag, Strike Up The Band and Majestic Missile as well as the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Donna Blini. After being held up towards the rear, La Cucaracha began to make progress approaching the final furlong, took the lead 75 yards from the finish and won by three quarters of a length from the six-year-old gelding Desert Lord. In November 2006, she was auctioned at the Tattersalls December Mares Sale and was bought for 525,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent James Delahooke. Breeding record After being sold at Newmarket in 2006, La Cucaracha was exported to become a broodmare for the New Jersey-based Colts Neck Stable in the United States. In 2011 she was offered for sale at Keeneland in November. She was bought for $530,000 by Katsumi Yoshida and exported to Japan. She died on 9 February 2014 a week after foaling her last foal. Her foals include: *Yasmeena, a chestnut filly, foaled in 2008, sired by Mr Greeley. Won one race. *Senora Dancer, chestnut filly, 2009, by Distorted Humor. Unraced. *El Cumbanchero, bay colt, 2012, by Elusive Quality. Failed to win in seven races in Japan, as of August 2015 *Unnamed filly, 2014, by Stay Gold.

Plot introduction Keith Carr, an ex-Royal Air Force fighter pilot with combat experience in the Korean War is now living in Jamaica, where he makes a threadbare living flying charter cargo flights around the Caribbean in his mortgaged second-hand de Havilland Dove. After he discovers that a pilot he knows from his Korean War days now commands a squadron of de Havilland Vampire jet fighters for the hard-line military dictators on the Central-American nation of ‚ÄúRepublica Libra‚Äù, Carr suddenly finds life more difficult. And for some reason he can't understand, the United States FBI is keeping him under surveillance. Republica Libra at first offers him a job, and then impounds his plane when he refuses.

Life and work Fischer comes from a German-American family and was born and partly grew up in Germany. In 1935, at the age of 15, he moved to the US and attended college in Watertown, Wisconsin. He studied geology at the University of Wisconsin, where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1939 and a master's degree in 1940. From 1941-1943 he worked at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In 1943-44 he was a geologist for Stanolind Oil and Gas in Kansas and from 1944 to 1946 a geologist in Florida. In 1947 he taught at the University of Rochester and from 1948 at the University of Kansas, where he was an assistant professor. In 1950 he gained a doctorate at Columbia University. For five years from 1951 to 1956 he was a petroleum geologist (Senior Geologist) for Esso in Peru before becoming assistant professor in 1956 and professor in 1963 at Princeton University. In 1984 he was appointed professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, becoming emeritus professor in 1991. He was also a visiting professor in Innsbruck, T√ºbingen and Berlin. Fischer studied marine sedimentology and marine fossil fauna and was a leading scientist in the Deep Sea Drilling Project. He described in 1964 the phenomenon of rhythmically recurring sequences of sedimentary rock layers in some Keuper formations of the Alps, first discovered in Dachsteinkalken in the province of Salzburg. In the 1970s, he propagated the existence of global biorhythms in the fossil record and in 1977 the concept of cycles of low and high leves of biodiversity in the marine fauna over 32 million years. In 1982 he spoke in favour of the Earth's climate alternating between ice ages and warm periods due to the (Icehouse-Greenhouse concept).

Some regions of the upper plains unit display large fractures and troughs with raised rims; such regions are called ribbed upper plains. Fractures are believed to have started with small cracks from stresses. Stress is suggested to initiate the fracture process since ribbed upper plains are common when debris aprons come together or near the edge of debris aprons‚Äîsuch sites would generate compressional stresses. Cracks exposed more surfaces, and consequently more ice in the material sublimates into the planet‚Äôs thin atmosphere. Eventually, small cracks become large canyons or troughs.

The upper plains unit is thought to have fallen from the sky. It drapes various surfaces, as if it fell evenly. As is the case for other mantle deposits, the upper plains unit has layers, is fine-grained, and is ice-rich. It is widespread; it does not seem to have a point source. The surface appearance of some regions of Mars is due to how this unit has degraded. It is a major cause of the surface appearance of lobate debris aprons. The layering of the upper plains mantling unit and other mantling units are believed to be caused by major changes in the planet‚Äôs climate. Models predict that the obliquity or tilt of the rotational axis has varied from its present 25 degrees to maybe over 80 degrees over geological time. Periods of high tilt will cause the ice in the polar caps to be redistributed and change the amount of dust in the atmosphere.Head, J. et al. 2003.Madeleine, et al. 2014.Schon, et al. 2009. A recent ice age on Mars: Evidence for climate oscillations from regional layering in mid-latitude mantling deposits. Geophys. Res. Lett. 36, L15202.

His origins lie in the district of Chamart√≠n in Madrid (Madrid), although he spent part of his childhood in New York due to family reasons. There, he usually went to the church with his grandmother, and he soon became impressed by the Gospel choirs. He also surrounded himself with black musicians and was captivated with the blues they played. In fact, his style is unmistakably American, and arguably his voice, powerful and torn, is one of the most singular in the Spanish national scene. His relationship with the theatre and the big screen also starts very soon. Jimmy is certainly a multifaceted artist. He was born of the marriage between the writer Marcos Ricardo Barnat√°n and the journalist Rosa Pereda. Biography Jimmy Barnat√°n was born in Madrid, but his heart is divided between the capital of Spain, Madrid and New York. Since its early years, he showed great admiration for the performing arts, and soon experienced the desire to get on the stage of a theatre. His claim was answered in 1992, when he was just 11 years: then, the young Jimmy managed to join the cast of Les Mis√©rables, a musical produced by Jos√© Tamayo and Pl√°cido Domingo, in association with Cameron Mackintosh, which was presented on 16 September in the New Apolo Theatre in Madrid, as an adaptation of the classic that inspired the novel by Victor Hugo. The success was overwhelming. After that experience, Barnat√°n landed on television and performed sketches on entertainment programs as The Worst Week Program (El Peor Programa de la Semana) (1994) or Innocent, Innocent (Inocente, Inocente) (1995). That year took place his leap to the big screen thanks to director Alex de la Iglesia, who entrusted him the role of possessed child in the iconic film The Day of the Beast (El Dia de la Bestia). In 1996 he started in television fiction with Milk Brothers (Hermanos de leche), sharing cast with actors like Jose Coronado or Juan Echanove, and, a year later, he returned to the theatre, to represent Between two shores (Entre dos orillas) (1997) at the Teatro de la Maestranza in Seville. Since then, Jimmy has been part of a lot of projects in all formats, highlighting Torrente, the dumb arm of the law (Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley), Heart of the Warrior (El coraz√≥n del guerrero), The Biggest Robbery Never Told (El robo m√°s grande jam√°s contado) and Los Serrano, a TV series that gave him an enormous popularity thanks to the role of Chucky. He has participated in several short films, being director of three of them from 1998 to 2005. He did the same in a documentary (Racing Blues. History of a feeling) (Racing Blues. Historia de un sentimiento) (2007) in which, alongside Fernando Guisado, he narrated the adventures of an historic Spanish football team, the Racing de Santander. In music, the journey of Barnat√°n also began in New York, where he used to go due to family reasons. One day, he had the opportunity to get on a stage surrounded by black Blues singers, and his intervention was warmly applauded by them. Jimmy said in an interview with daily El Pa√≠s: In Spain, he began his career as a vocalist with Caronte's Ferry, and later went on to lead the San Telmo Blues Band, covering in both formations the great American classics. In 2010 he released his first studio album with the title Black Note, showing the influences received from those vinyl of Lionel Hampton, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong that he listened to at home. It was a subtle tribute to all those legends of Jazz, Blues and Soul that saw him grow. The album was presented at the legendary Sala Clamores of Madrid, causing a pleasant surprise to those who, until then, had enjoyed her performance in the big screen and in television. Soon after, he began recording with Back Door Band what turned out to be his second album, After the blue Times (2011), this time with the seal of Warner Music Spain. While preparing the above releases, the multifaceted artist had time to write two novels: Atlas (2005) and New York Blues (2012). After that, he continued his career in the music scene constituting the group Jimmy Barnat√°n & The Cocooners, with whom he has released Room 13: A Blues Tale (2013) and Motorclub (2015). Meanwhile, Jimmy has continued exercising his profession as an actor in projects like The Hurd, land with a soul (Las Hurdes, tierra con alma) (2015), documentary still unreleased for which he has also composed the soundtrack. Musically, he toured Spain accompanying the Texan guitarist Carvin Jones, and drew up part of the soundtrack of My big night (Mi gran noche) (2015), the new film by Alex de la Iglesia. Moreover, he has already prepared what will be his third novel, The Topper of Memphis (La Chistera de Memphis), whose publication is expected for the coming months.

The veneer layers are arranged crosswise at an angle of 90 degrees. Molded wood is used for flat furniture components such as seats, backrests and seat shells. When the veneer layers are arranged in the same direction, it is called laminated wood. It is used for armrests and chair frames. After pressing, the blanks are processed mechanically. A particular feature is the ability to produce different variations of shapes from the blanks.

He designed a chair made of glue-laminated wooden strips. However, in 1830 the famous furniture designer Michael Thonet had already begun to experiment with the gluing of veneer layers. He only managed to produce two-dimensional deformations though. He stopped these experiments and developed the bentwood process to produce three-dimensional molded wood components made of solid wood. With the model S43, the company \\"Gebr√ºder Thonet\\" launched the first cantilever chair in 1931. To make the chair very comfortable without padding and to give it a light appearance, designer Mart Stam used three-dimensionally shaped plywood parts for its seat and back. The Finn Alvar Aalto was the first to deliberately implement the natural spring effect of the material when he created his model \\"Piamio\\" in the 1930s. Marcel Breuer created the Long Chair in 1935-1936 (see image). Five years later, the architects and designers Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen won a furniture design competition in New York with a three-dimensionally shaped shell. After that, Charles Eames and his wife Ray developed the spectacular plywood furniture collection for the company Herman Miller (USA). In Europe, Arne Jacobsen presented a chair with the unusual name \\"Ant (chair)\\" in 1952 that should later become a great success. Seat and back are self-supporting and connected by a narrow waist. These million-selling classics are still in production today. Terminology =Molded plywood= Term for molded parts made from at least three thin veneers that are glued together with the grain of each running at a 90¬∞ angle to that in the next layer. This interlocking pattern greatly reduces swelling and shrinking and generates more resistance in the surface. These properties are used in two-dimensional moldings such as seats, backrests and shells. The veneer qualities can be put together for visible or upholstered molded plywood parts. The inner layers are made of less expensive peeled veneers. The top layers can be selected from peeled veneers, fine wood sliced veneers or laminates. =Laminated wood= Laminated wood is the term for moldings where the grain in all layers runs parallel. To increase the bending strength and reduce the swelling and shrinking behavior, laminated wood is interlocked with some transverse veneers for certain applications. Laminated wood is used for chair frames, cantilever side parts and armrests. By employing laminated wood gussets (triangular), the wood joints can be pressed at the same time (see picture). The thickness of the molded parts can be varied by using partially ground interior veneers. Compared to molded plywood, the tensile strength is significantly higher. Laminated wood Production The production process is divided into three steps. First the peeled veneer is produced, then it is pressed into molded plywood or laminated wood blanks which are subsequently processed. This results in ready to install furniture or interior design components. In Europe, beech wood is used. It is available in large quantities from sustainably managed forests. In Northern and Eastern Europe, birch wood is frequently used. In North America, Hard maple is used. The tree trunks are harvested only during the winter, outside the sap-flow period, and need to be sprayed with water in the storage area or stored under water. =Production of veneers= For the production of veneers, the logs are steamed with hot water vapor in steam pits at 85 degrees Celsius. This makes the wood high in moisture and pliable. The next steps are the logs separation and the debarking. The lengths of the log sections are based on the veneer sizes required for the orders. In the peeling line, the peeling blade is led with high pressure against the rotating log section. The result is a continuous veneer strip which is cut into the required widths. You can create veneers with thicknesses of 0.6 mm to 2.3 mm. The veneers are still wet when they come out and run through the drying area. Immediately after that the peeled veneers are automatically sorted according to their visual qualities. They are divided into two categories: one for visible use and one with knots and cracks that are used for moldings that will later be fully upholstered. =Pressing= When the veneer is prepared for an order, a pressing tool is incorporated into a press. The pressing tools can be made of two parts (for seats, backrests and shells) or several parts, e.g. for U-shaped moldings that also require pressure from the side. The pressing begins with glue being spread onto the veneer. The glue is made of urea-formaldehyde resin with a hardener that becomes thermosetting during the pressing process. A so-called veneer packet is then inserted into the pressing tool that is at 100 degrees Celsius. The press is fed in. The pressing pressure is approximately 25 N/cm¬≤. The pressing time depends on the thickness of the molded parts. The thicker the part, the longer it is pressed. Shells need about 5 minutes, thicker side panels may take up to 20 minutes. An exception is the high-frequency gluing, where the glued joint is heated via a capacitor field/ condenser field, which significantly reduces the pressing time. Therefore, this method is suitable for very thick moldings. Since veneer is a natural product, it is necessary to observe certain limitations in the pressing process. The smallest radius is dependent on the veneer thicknesses used and is 12 mm at a 90 degree angle. A taper of the moulded parts is possible. There are hardly any limits for the possibilities of three-dimensional deformation of upholstered parts. Decorative wood allows for light deformations up to the occurrence of cracking or buckling of the veneer. What can be formed out of firm cardboard can also be made of molded plywood, since both behave in a similar way. These limits can be exceeded by the use of special 3D veneers, which are, expensive to produce and therefore entail additional costs. =Processing= The three- dimensionally shaped molded plywood blanks for seats, shells and backrests are contour milled with multi-axis CNC milling machines and bored if needed. The variety here is very high because all it takes for another contour is to write a new milling program. After sanding the edges and the assembly of the fastening mounts the parts are ready for finishing. Molded plywood blanks for chair frames and components are automatically cut, ground and processed with fixtureless CNC milling machines. Special joining techniques can be used, such as screw, dowel, spring or mortise and tenon joints to produce pre-finished components or complete racks. Surfaces The surfaces of veneer cross- plywood and laminated veneer lumber can be designed in many different ways by pressing the top layers of fine wood sliced veneers, such as oak, maple, cherry, ash, walnut and other woods. Further design possibilities offer colored melamine films; decorative films, digital prints and decorative laminates (HPL / CPL) and of course the pickling and painting, either transparent or opaque. Modern water-based paint systems are used for this. Features Compared to other wood-based panels such as MDF or chipboard, molded plywood and laminated wood are very reliable. Therefore, they are suitable for a wide range of applications. =Strength= The tensile strength is 110-135 N/cm¬≤, depending on the type of wood. This ensures for the high load capacity and pleasant vibrations of cantilever chairs made of laminated wood, for example. =Compressive strength= With the types of wood that are used for molded wood, the compressive strength is between 50 and 62 N/cm¬≤. It guarantees long-lasting furniture that endures even frequent use as in schools, for instance. =Weather resistance= Beech wood is actually not suitable for outdoor use because it is very rapidly ruined by wood-destroying fungi. But through chemical or thermal changes it is possible to produce weather resistant molded plywood and laminated wood. =Flame retardant properties= By introducing salts in the production process, molded wood is made flame-retardant. This is an important aspect for interior design and in the creation of train seats.

She was the second matron of the Black Cross Nurses Association. She was one of the first formally trained nurses in Belize and was the first rural health practitioner in Gales Point and the Manatee River area of Belize. She also organized the first village council in the country, in Gales Point, recognizing the need for managing village affairs, especially in the case of hurricanes. Her model was replicated throughout Belize, and she is credited with the idea for the present village council system. She served in the relief efforts of the 1931 hurricane, Hurricane Janet (1955) and Hurricane Hattie (1961). She received a Victoria Medal in 1953 for her services from the British crown and in 1958, went to England to accept the medal of Member of the Order of the British Empire. Biography Cleopatra Eugenie White was born on 28 June 1898 in British Honduras, now Belize, to Joseph and Maria White. Her mother died when she was a child and she was raised by her father with one sister. White attended Miss Braddick‚Äôs School for Girls and Ebenezer Primary School before pursuing nursing. In 1919, when she was 21 White followed her mentor, Vivian Seay, a fellow nurse, into organizing and promoting the Black Cross Nurses Association as a home health care organization. Officially founded in 1920, with untrained personnel, the organization began in its second year to offer general nursing and maternity classes under Dr. K.M.B. Simon, the government medical officer, and Amy Clare Woods George, a certified British Honduran midwife who had studied in Britain. In 1931, after the hurricane, White helped set up the nursing facilities and supply stations for the relief effort. The barracks were located at what is now the Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport. In the 1940s, White and others began training for public health services. In 1943, she attended four- hour lectures each morning and completed rounds at the hospital for four hours each afternoon to obtain practical training. She graduated a year later and qualified as a rural health nurse. Initially she was appointed to serve in Double Head Cabbage village, but then moved on to Gales Point and the Manatee River area of Belize, where she spent most of the next sixteen years. She was the first rural health nurse in the area and her duties soon expanded into areas of social work. She became a mentor to many of the village children and taught hygiene practices to many young women. Recognizing the need for managing village affairs, especially when hurricane season or boating emergencies arose, White set up the first village councils in the country at Gales Point. At the time, most travel was via boat, either on the sea or by river and boating accidents were not uncommon. She has been credited with the idea for the present village council system, which soon spread throughout the country. She was awarded a Victoria Medal in 1953 from Britain for her role in helping develop community life. After Hurricane Janet (1955) the quasi- government of elected Belizeans, formalized the village council system setting up 7-member councils in each rural area to facilitate government dialogue. She moved back to Belize City and provided health care to the citizens there. In 1958, White's work was again recognized by the British crown and she traveled to England to receive the medal of Member of the Order of the British Empire. After Hurricane Hattie hit in 1961, White drove daily to care for those who had been gathered at what would become the village at Hattieville. She was the first nurse of the Hattieville Clinic. When she retired from the Hattieville Clinic in the mid-1960s, White returned to Belize City and attempted to revive the Black Cross Nurses training courses, which had begun to decline. She also organized the Women's League and spearheaded fundraising and entertainments for National Festival of the Arts. White wrote scripts and songs and was a gifted storyteller often earning prizes for her work. St. John's College professor E. Beck recorded a number of her songs to preserve them as evidence of White's efforts to create pride in Creole heritage through song. In 1986, the Women's Bureau of Belize established a prize in her honor, named the Cleopatra White Shield, for the winner of the National High School Quiz Contest. White made her last public appearance as the guest of honor at the inaugural ceremony. She died in 1987, as a pauper and resident of the Belize City Old Folks Home. After her death, the Cleopatra White Outpatient Clinic of Belize City, was established in her honor and in 1993, a postage stamp was issued picturing White and her clinic.

An 18-year-old Ivorian illegal immigrant was arrested on suspicion of their murder; the authorities stated that they suspected that accomplices, likely to be Italian nationals, remained at large. The identity of the suspect as an asylum seeker added to the debate on immigration to Italy. Victims and attack Solano, 68, and his Spanish wife Ib√°√±ez, from Catalonia, 70, met while working as immigrants in Germany, and had lived in Palagonia for over 40 years. They were charitable towards the migrants staying at the nearby Cara Mineo centre. The couple had two daughters, Rosita and Manuela, the former living in Milan and the latter in their town. Manuela's four-year-old daughter had been due to be at the couple's house on the day of the killing, but her mother took her to the beach instead. Solano and Ib√°√±ez were found dead at their house. Solano had had his throat cut, and Ib√°√±ez was believed to have been thrown from a balcony. The post-mortem examination found evidence that Solano was murdered in his sleep, while Ib√°√±ez was sexually assaulted; both were found to have been wounded by a large screwdriver and a pair of pliers. =Suspect= Mamadou Kamara, an 18-year-old from the Ivory Coast staying at Cara Mineo, was arrested on suspicion of murdering the couple. A police search of his bag found electronics and jewellery from their house, as well as blood-stained trousers. According to the investigators, at the time of his arrest, he was wearing clothing stolen from their wardrobe, including a pair of slippers that did not fit him. Kamara stated that he found all of these goods loose in a bin. The investigating judge declared that it was likely that Kamara had Italian accomplices, who knew of the valuables in the couple's house. According to him, it would have been impossible for a young man of Kamara's build to perform all the criminal acts together. Kamara was said to have a disturbed, inhuman personality given his coldness and detachment when going through proceedings. Reaction Rosita, 46, daughter of the couple, blamed the Italian government for their deaths, saying \\"They let these migrants come here and they do what they want, including burgling and killing\\". She demanded that no politicians attend the funeral, on the basis that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Minister of the Interior Angelino Alfano did not give condolences, including on Twitter. Renzi condemned the crime, and pleaded for the Italian public to remain calm. The migrants at Cara Mineo organised a prayer vigil for the deceased couple. The perceived role of the government in the attack was also claimed by right-wing opposition politicians, including Lega Nord leader Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of Brothers of Italy. Deputy Speaker of the Senate, Lega Nord's Roberto Calderoli, asked the public whether the death penalty should be considered for the perpetrator. Palagonia's mayor, Valerio Marletta, called for Cara Mineo to be shut down, saying \\"You can't put 3,000 or 4,000 people together. You can welcome them, yes, but while safeguarding the population and the dignity of the migrants who don't want to be confused with criminals\\". The planned march by Forza Nuova was opposed by some locals who saw it as a ploy for political gain on a tragedy, with the party's vice secretary Giuseppe Provenzale responding by claiming he was intending for it to not cause tension. Anti-racist activist Alfonso Di Stefano condemned the crime, but was physically attacked and spat at in a televised interview in Palagonia, by a crowd of locals and Forza Nuova activists. On 1 September, three locals bearing firearms attacked and robbed two Gambian migrants in Palagonia, resulting in one requiring hospital treatment. Local police treated this attack as revenge for the killings.

Robertson has represented Great Britain at three Summer Paralympics and with his colleagues Stephen Thomas and Hannah Stodel has won multiple medals in the Mixed Sonar class at the Disabled Sailing World Championships, including skippering his team to back to back gold medals in 2005 and 2006. Personal life Robertson was born in Sunderland, England in 1972. After leaving school he joined the Royal Air Force, but in 1994 a motorbike accident left him paralysed from the waist down and he was invalided out of the force. Sailing career Robertson was first introduced to sailing by his father when he was 11, piloting mirror's off the coast in Sunderland. After his accident in 1994, he was introduced to Paralympic trimarans by a spinal injuries charity during an outward bound course in the Lake District. In 1997 he began sailing Sonar's. By 2003 Robertson was joined by fellow British sailor Hannah Stodel and newcomer to the sport, ice sledge hockey Paralympian Stephen Thomas, to make up a Mixed Sonar crew. In 2003 he travelled with his teammates to Athens to take part in the IFDS World Disabled Sailing Championship, where they secured the bronze medal. The following year the trio qualified for their first Summer Paralympics, the 2008 games at Beijing, finishing sixth in the Sonar class. Robertson, Thomas and Stodel would remain as a team for over 12 years, with major successes coming in the 2005 World Championships in Sonderborg and the 2006 World Championships in Perth where Robertson skippered them to gold in the Sonar class. They represented Britain in their second Paralympics, in the 2008 Games in Beijing. They again finished sixth. Two silver medals in the 2010 and 2011 IFDS World Championships were followed by their third successive Paralympics, this time on home surf when the games came to London. The London Paralympics ended in disappointment for Robertson and his teammates after they were deducted four points after a team bosun cleaned the port side of their keel after being authorized to inspect the craft for damage. The deduction saw the British team drop to fifth and the bronze medal going to Norway, just three points ahead of them. In the run up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Robertson skippered his crew to a third World Championship, beating the Australian team by a single point.

Katembo's short films, photography and other projects focused on the daily lives of the people of Kinshasa, as well as the economic and social challenges facing the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was also a founding director of Mutotu Productions, his film production company, and the executive director of Yango Biennale, based in Kinshasa. Katembo was born on June 20, 1979, in Goma, Zaire (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo). He attended the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Kinshasa. Photography Katembo, a noted Congolese photographer, was best known for his series, Un regard, released in 2009. The exhibition used a photography technique called mirroring. In Un regard, Katembo photographed his subjects by capturing their reflections in puddles of water found on the streets of Kinshasa. Katembo explained his goals for Un regard in an interview, \\"Photography also provides a way of seeing beyond reflection as it opens up a poetic window on another world, the world in which I live. I want each image to tell of the children born here who have to grow up surrounded by pools of water, and of the families who survive while others leave to live in exile. To me, this is one way of campaigning for a healthier environment and to denounce through images what Kinshasa's inhabitants see as fate.\\" In a 2015 interview with Jenny Stevens of The Guardian, Katembo also explained that the Congolese, including Kinshasaians, don't usually like having the picture taken, noting .that a photographer usually has to ask permission. It was one of then reasons Kitembo used the mirroring of puddles in Un regard, saying \\"That's why I started shooting reflections ‚Äì it was a way to document people going about their lives.\\" Katembo's work has been featured at Bamako Encounters, the Royal Museum for Central Africa, the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, and the TAZ in Ostend, Belgium. Photos from Un regard collection were on display as part of the \\"Beaut√© Congo ‚Äì 1926‚Äì2015 ‚Äì Congo Kitoko\\" exhibition at the Foundation Cartier in Paris at the time of his death in 2015.

Film Katembo filmed his 2008 seven- minute, digital short film, Cardboard Car Film, which explores Kinshasa and its people, on a mobile phone. He established the Mutotu Productions and served as the company's founding director. Under Katembo, Mutotu Productions produced Atalaku, directed by Dieudo Hamadi, which won best documentary film at the Centre Georges Pompidou's Cinema du Reel festival in 2013. He also partnered with Hamadi and Divita Wa Lusala to co-direct the 2010 documentary, Congo in Four Acts, which won awards at the Africa Movie Academy Awards and the Cin√©ma du R√©el film festival in 2010. Katembo had also worked in feature films. He was assistant director on the 2010 Congolese crime thriller, Viva Riva!, which was directed by Djo Tunda Wa Munga.

(Joe) Holson, an American scientist, business executive, and educator in the disciplines of toxicology and product development, served as President of WIL Research Laboratories for 20 years (1988-2008). He is known for his contributions to the fields of developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART), pharmacokinetics, and risk assessment, including extensive experience with study design, data interpretation, and interspecies extrapolation of health effects data. He has served in numerous U.S. EPA/FDA advisory committees and as an expert toxicology witness. He was elected to two National Academy of Sciences toxicology committees. Dr. Holson is an editor and author of the textbook Regulatory Toxicology and an author of two significant chapters in the textbook Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology: A Practical Approach, Second Edition. Two of his peer-reviewed articles were recognized by the Risk Assessment Specialty Section of the Society of Toxicology as the Outstanding Published Papers Demonstrating an Application of Risk Assessment. He is the first author to receive this award in consecutive years for publications produced with two separate sets of coauthors.  Education  Joseph Holson received his Doctorate in Physiology in 1973 from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, having studied under the direction of Dr. James G. Wilson in the disciplines of developmental toxicology and research pediatrics. His doctoral research investigated the relative transport capabilities of chorioallantoic and yolk sac placentae during organogenesis in the rat. Prior to his doctoral training, he earned a B.S. (1967) and M.S. (1969) in Biology from East Carolina University (receiving the Poteat Award for his research on the teratogenicity of LSD). He also completed a Traineeship in Reproductive Physiology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1970.  Career  = National Center for Toxicological Research = Dr. Holson began his professional career in 1973 with the U.S. FDA/EPA-sponsored National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) in Little Rock, Arkansas, as a reproductive toxicologist. He became the Division Director in 1975 and organized a multidisciplinary research program, which became one of the nation's major federally sponsored research groups in reproductive toxicology. For the next five years, he directed the teratology and developmental toxicology research programs of the National Toxicology Program (NTP), which focused on biochemical and physiological causes of birth defects, pharmacokinetics, postnatal functional evaluations, and mechanistic studies. While at NCTR, Holson also was instrumental in developing the FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and organized and wrote the first FDA training program for GLP inspectors. During his tenure at NCTR, he also served as Assistant Professor of Physiology in the Interdisciplinary Toxicology Training Program at the University of Arkansas School of Medicine in Little Rock, Arkansas. In this capacity, he developed and taught the first graduate-level regulatory toxicology course in the country, served on PhD student committees, and was a member of the admissions committee and policy council. = Science Applications International Corporation = Dr. Holson joined Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in La Jolla, California during March 1980 to establish research and development and chemical testing programs in toxicology. For the next five years, he directed SAIC‚Äôs toxicology division, which included an active reproductive toxicology research emphasis. In 1983, he was elected to SAIC's Executive Science and Technology Council. During his time at SAIC, he served as an adjunct lecturer in toxicology for the Toxicology Training Program at the University of Arizona and the Graduate Program in Public Health at San Diego State University. = Biomedical Research Institute of America = From 1985 through 1986, he served as President of Biomedical Research Institute of America in La Jolla, California and as an independent consultant in toxicology. From 1980-1986, he also served as a member of the Board of Directors and Secretary for the San Diego Biomedical Research Institute. = WIL Research Laboratories = In March 1987, Dr. Holson was appointed Vice President and Director of Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology at WIL Research Laboratories, Inc., in Ashland, Ohio. In August 1988, he was promoted to President and Director of WIL Research. During the next 20 years, he was responsible for all fiduciary and scientific aspects of the company‚Äôs operations. He remained scientifically active by serving as a study director upon special request, selectively reviewing data and reports, advising sponsors regarding toxicologic and product development issues, serving as a consultant to federal agencies, publishing scientific papers, giving presentations to various community and scientific organizations, and lecturing at Ashland University. He also served on Ashland University‚Äôs Science Advisory Board (1990-2008) and Board of Trustees (1993-1998), as well as Pfizer's Advisory Panel for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology and Johnson & Johnson's Advisory Panel for Pediatric- Approved Pharmaceuticals. Under Joe Holson's leadership, WIL Research grew from approximately 30 employees and negative profitability into a dynamic contract research organization employing more than 600 individuals, with an 18% compound annual growth rate and nearly $40 million annual EBITDA. This success was attributed to the internationally recognized scientific prowess of WIL's staff, the company's study director-centric business model (which viewed each study director as an individual business unit with scientific, project management, and marketing responsibilities), and internally developed innovations such as the industry's first protocol-driven toxicology data management software system. Holson emphasized direct scientist-to-scientist interaction as much as possible across the entire scope of each project, which gained WIL Research numerous accolades from its clients. After nearly two decades of sustained organic growth, Holson led WIL Research through a period of private capital-financed expansion, beginning with a management buyout (in partnership with Behrman Capitalhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43362/000110465904029322/a04-11133_1ex99di.htm) and formation of a holding company (WRH) in 2004. The expansion continued with acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe, culminating in the $500 million sale of WRH to American Capital, Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACAS) in 2007. After the sale to ACAS, he served as Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the global entity while continuing to serve as President and Director of WIL Research Laboratories in Ashland, Ohio until his retirement from active management duties in November 2008. He served on the Board of Directors of WRH from its inception in 2004 until February 2009.  Research highlights  Joe Holson's research career has spanned a diverse range of test agents using a variety of experimental animal models and human studies. Building upon the foundational principles of teratology expounded upon by his doctoral advisor, James G. Wilson, his work has emphasized comparative and holistic approaches to problem-solving in the field of developmental and reproductive toxicology. These approaches included extensive collaboration between experimental toxicologists and epidemiologists, advancements in experimental design (e.g., use of replicates and unbalanced study designs) and biostatistics (e.g., use of statistical power calculations), and robust assessments of reliability and animal-human concordance of experimental toxicity findings. Early in Holson's career, while at NCTR, he led studies that assessed the developmental toxicity of FD&C; Red No. 2, an amaranth dye, and the herbicide 2,4,5‚ÄêT (a component of Agent Orange). The FD&C; Red No. 2 study was a multi-laboratory collaborative effort between industry, U.S. FDA, and NCTR, while the 2,4,5-T study was a large-scale multireplicated study in various strains/stocks of mice that included replicated test groups, at least four dose levels per replicate, use of multiple stocks/strains of animals to obtain an estimate of the range in sensitivities due to genotype, complete maternal pathology, and fetal histopathology and teratological evaluation. In a follow-up statistical analysis of these data, it was calculated that 805 litters per dose group would be necessary to detect a 5% increase in embryo resorption, suggesting that no standard regulatory study is adequately capable of evaluating the dose-response threshold at low response rates. Based on these results, Holson recommended that U.S. FDA include a similar approach to standardize the statistical resolving power of tests relative to known interlaboratory and interspecies endpoint variability and variances. Holson was also among the first developmental toxicologists to quantitatively evaluate the \\"litter effect\\" of studies in which fetal endpoints were assessed after the maternal animal was dosed. Although litter-based statistical analyses had been conducted for body weight and survival parameters, Holson insisted that litter-based corrections should also be used for fetal malformations and variations. Based on his early work, Holson was among the first teratology researchers to assert that the various endpoints of developmental toxicity studies (intrauterine growth retardation, malformations [birth defects], functional impairment, and death) in fact constituted a continuum of responses rather than discrete outcomes, which led him to conclude that human manifestations of teratogenicity across exposure levels were most commonly multiple outcomes. Throughout his career Holson argued consistently that developmental toxicity must be viewed holistically, not simply as a group of disparate anatomical, functional, and postnatal defects, before such data can be effectively used to derive a complete estimate of human risks. Holson was among the first to recognize that more emphasis needed to be placed on pharmacokinetic evaluations within developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in order to quantify the internal exposure to xenobiotics. His team at NCTR conducted the first series of studies designed to assess the feasibility of using pharmacokinetics to improve the design, interpretation, and extrapolation of developmental toxicity studies, in an attempt to develop methods for predicting the magnitude of endpoints in teratology and to show how interlitter variability and inter-strain and inter-species differences could be better interpreted and accounted for based on differences in the handling of a compound. Throughout his career he emphasized the use of pharmacokinetic determinations as a necessary component of developmental, reproductive, and nonclinical juvenile toxicity studies. Holson was also the first to apply the principle of comparative ontogeny of development (physiologic age) between organ systems in various species to the interpretation of developmental, reproductive, and pediatric toxicology data. Throughout his career, Holson served as a key advisor to numerous product development programs (INDs, NDAs, TCSA consent orders, FIFRA registrations and international product registrations) and was the principal investigator in more than 600 safety assessment studies. In these studies he emphasized his longstanding principles of holistic evaluation of data, inclusion of pharmacokinetic endpoints where possible, robust and creative experimental designs, determination of the statistical power of the study relative to known variability in endpoints, and cognizance of comparative ontogeny of development. In addition to LSD, FD&C; Red No. 2, and 2,4,5-T, he was instrumental in significant developmental, reproductive, and/or nonclinical juvenile toxicity assessments of mirex, inorganic arsenic, nelfinavir (Viracept, an antiretroviral drug used to treat AIDS), fluoxetine (Prozac), two silicon-based ingredients found in breast implants and numerous personal care products (D4 and D5), methyl iodide, and HBOC-201 (a bovine hemoglobin- based oxygen carrier).  Retirement  After retiring from active duties at WIL Research, Dr. Holson focused on conservation efforts on his 90-acre farm outside Ashland, Ohio. Since 1994, when he began to plant native prairie grasses and several thousand trees, he allowed the bulk of the property to gradually return to a natural state as a conservation habitat supported by Ohio's Conservation Reserve Program, including development of a 10-acre wildflower area designated as a pollinator habitat. He also maintains 45 acres of mature hardwood forest. This overall effort has facilitated Holson's personal study of conservation and animal behavior, including various flora and fauna. Felony Drug & Sex Offender Charges In August 2009, Dr. Holson plead guilty to the \\"possession of cocaine and complicity involving the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance\\", which required him to register as a Tier I sex offender. He later unsuccessfully appealed to withdraw these pleas.

During his minor league career, he played the positions of catcher, first base, second base, third base, left field, and right field. The Cubs added him to their 40-man roster after the season. Contreras was rated 57th on Baseball Prospectus' top 101 prospect list prior to the 2016 season. =Chicago Cubs= 2016 season He was promoted to the Cubs major league team on June 17, 2016, playing catcher. On June 19, he hit a two-run home run on the first pitch of his first major- league at-bat after two pick-off attempts by the pitcher to first base, becoming the 30th player in the modern MLB era to do so. In his fifth game, he started at the first base position, and started in left field in his eighth game, establishing himself as a versatile player on the field. Contreras finished the 2016 regular season with 80 hits in 295 at bats with 12 home runs, 35 RBIs and a .275 batting average. In Game 4 of the 2016 National League Division Series against the San Francisco Giants with the Cubs having a 2-1 series lead, Contreras had a pinch-hit two-run single in the top of the ninth inning, tying the score at 5. Contreras was forced at second by a Jason Heyward bunt but the Cubs scored the go-ahead run later that inning, sending them to the National League Championship Series. The Cubs won the 2016 World Series over the Cleveland Indians, giving the Cubs their first championship in 108 years. Contreras drove in a run with a double in the seventh game. 2017 season On April 2, 2017, Contreras was the Cubs' opening day starting catcher against the St. Louis Cardinals. After hitting 5 home runs in 6 games, he was selected as the National League's Player of the Week on August 8. On August 9, Contreras suffered a moderate hamstring strain while running to first base against the San Francisco Giants. At the time of the injury he was batting .274 with 93 hits in 339 at bats, hit 21 home runs and had 70 RBIs. Willson returned from the injury on September 10 as a pinch hitter. On September 15, 2017, Contreras was ejected and suspended one game for throwing his mask, which bounced and hit umpire Jordan Baker in the shins. In 377 at bats, Contreras finished the season with a .276 batting average, 104 hits, 21 home runs, 5 stolen bases and 74 RBIs. Contreras chose \\"Willy\\" as his nickname for the Players Weekend for the 2017 season; however, Jon Lester and pitching coach Chris Bosio gave him the nickname \\"Killer\\". On October 18, 2017, in Game Four of the NLCS, Contreras hit the longest postseason home run (491 feet) since Statcast started recording such data in 2015. 2018 season Contreras at the 2018 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby Batting .287 with seven home runs and 34 RBIs, Contreras was voted to start in the 2018 All-Star Game, his first All-Star appearance.

He can play at Fly-half or Centre. Dick played for Gala before moving to Melrose. On the back of his performances with Melrose, it was announced on 28 May 2012 that Dick had secured an Elite Development Place with Glasgow Warriors for the upcoming season 2012-13. As part of his EDP contract with Glasgow Warriors he could still play for Melrose. He helped Melrose beat Doncaster Knights in the British and Irish Cup in October 2012. He played for Glasgow Warriors as part of their 7s squad in the Melrose Sevens in May 2013. He also played in the Warriors 7s squad that won the Glasgow City Sevens in May 2013. They beat Glasgow Hawks 26-17 in the final. He was with Glasgow Warriors in the 2012-13 season. He moved from Glasgow Warriors in 2013 to Edinburgh Rugby for the season 2013-14. Again as an EDP, with Edinburgh he was still allowed to play for Melrose. Unfortunately for Dick he was out for two years from rugby before returning with Melrose in August 2015, After coming back from time on the side lines during a match for Melrose away to Stirling County in the premiership, his desire to play had been lost, Sadly the physical and emotional effects from this had taken its toll, Dick retired at the age of just 25. .

He was a member of the West Point class of 1915, \\"the class the stars fell on\\" that also included Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower. Zundel commanded an artillery battalion on the Western Front during World War I, and was artillery officer of the Sixth United States Army in the Southwest Pacific Area during World War II, participating in many of the operations there. In May 1944 he became commander of the 41st Infantry Division Artillery, and was decorated for gallantry in the Battle of Biak and the Battle of Mindanao. After the war he became chief of the Counter Intelligence Corps and commandant of its Corps School. He served in the Korean War as Inspector General, Far East Command, and Inspector General, United Nations Command. Early life Edwin Albert Zundel was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, on 29 March 1893, the only son of Henry McClellan Zundel and his wife Elizabeth n√©e Wineman. He had four sisters: Bertha, Carolyn, Anna and Mary. His early life was spent in Greensburg, where he went to school. He played football and for a time considered becoming a Lutheran minister. Congressman George F. Huff appointed Zundel to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, which he entered on 12 June 1911. The class he joined would become famous as the class the stars fell on. Of the 164 graduates that year, 59, including Zundel, would wear the stars of a general officer, the most of any class in the history of the Academy. Classmates included Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower. At West Point he played on the polo team. World War I Zundel was commissioned as an additional second lieutenant in the 3d Field Artillery on graduation on 12 June 1915. He was ranked 29th in the class. It was the largest graduating class up to that time, and the Army had only 105 slots available for them. His first posting was therefore to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He was transferred to the 4th Field Artillery on 2 November 1915, and then the 6th Field Artillery on 5 January 1916. The 6th Field Artillery operated in support of units on the Mexican Border with the Pancho Villa Expedition. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916, and then captain on 15 May 1917. On 4 September 1917, Zundel went to Leon Springs, Texas, as an instructor at the 2d Officers' Training Camp. He was subsequently posted to Douglas, Arizona, on 30 November 1917, and then to the United States Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, on 4 February 1918. On 19 April 1918, he joined the 11th Field Artillery at Camp Doniphan, Oklahoma, where he was promoted to major on 3 July 1918. Two days later the 11th Field Artillery began moving to France for service on the Western Front. Zundel served as a battalion commander in the 78th Field Artillery at the Artillery Training Center at Camp Valdahon until 12 October 1918, when he joined III Corps Headquarters as the corps counter battery staff officer. On 1 November 1918, he joined the 305th Field Artillery as a battalion commander. Between the wars With World War I over, Zundel returned to the United States, where he served with the Quartermaster Corps at Camp Meade, Maryland, and then in San Antonio, Texas. He reverted to the rank of captain on 6 May 1920, but became a major again on 1 July, when he was sent to Hawaii to command a battalion of the 13th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks. He reverted to the rank of captain again on 4 November 1922. On 7 June 1923, he was appointed an instructor in mathematics at West Point. He was promoted to major again on 5 February 1924. From 1927 to 1928, Zundel was an Advanced Course student at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. He married Eleanor Clay Lewis at the West Point Cadet Chapel on 14 July 1928. They had a daughter, Eleanor, who was born in 1932. From 1928 to 1930, Zundel attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He was a field artillery instructor with the Rhode Island National Guard's 68th Field Artillery Brigade and 103d Field Artillery at Providence, Rhode Island, from 1930 to 1934, and then went to Washington, D.C., where he served with the National Guard Bureau from 1934 to 1938. Some 18 years after he was first promoted to major, he was finally promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 May 1936. World War II After a quick refresher course at Fort Sill, Zundel assumed command of the 2d Battalion, 83d Field Artillery, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In July 1940 he assumed command of the 83d Field Artillery at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he also served as the artillery officer of the 4th Infantry Division. In October 1940 he became commander of the 42d Field Artillery Battalion there. The following year he became the commander of the 1st Antitank Group at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. He was promoted to colonel on 14 October 1941, and in December became the artillery officer of II Corps, which was based in Wilmington, Delaware, and then in Jacksonville, Florida. He became artillery officer of the XI Corps, then based in Chicago, in June 1942. In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the commander of the Sixth United States Army, picked Zundel as his artillery officer. He was soon on his way to Brisbane, Australia. As Sixth Army Artillery Officer participated in a number of operations in the Southwest Pacific Area, including Operation Chronicle, the landings on Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands; Operation Dexterity, the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester; the Admiralty Islands campaign; and Operation Reckless, the landings at Hollandia. For his services with the Sixth Army, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. On 24 May 1944 Zundel assumed command of the 41st Infantry Division Artillery, with the rank of brigadier general. He led this command with distinction in the Battle of Wakde, the Battle of Biak, and the Battle of Mindanao. For Biak, he was awarded oak leaf cluster to his Legion of Merit, and the Silver Star for gallantry in action at Ibdi on 29 May 1944. He was awarded a second oak leaf cluster to his Legion of Merit for the fighting on Mindanao, along with the Bronze Star Medal. He received the Air Medal in July 1945 for flights over enemy territory. These included flights in U.S. Marine Corps Douglas SBD Dauntlesses of VMSB-243. Postwar Grave at Arlington National Cemetery After the war ended, Zundel participated in the occupation of Japan. The 41st Infantry Division was inactivated on 31 December 1945, but he remained at Kure until February 1946, when he returned to the United States, and became artillery officer of the Fourth United States Army, the headquarters of which was located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, where his career had begun. In January 1948, Zundel became chief of the Counter Intelligence Corps and commandant of its Corps School at Fort Holabird, Maryland. His rank of brigadier general became permanent, with seniority backdated to 7 July 1944. In November 1949, Zundel returned to Japan as Inspector General, Far East Command. After the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, he became Inspector General, United Nations Command in Korea. Called upon to investigate the poor performance of the 24th Infantry, he attributed it not to the regiment being predominantly African-American, but to the fact that 62 percent of its men were in categories IV and V on the Army General Classification Test - the lowest scores. Zundel recommended that units of the Far East Command, including those fighting in Korea, be racially integrated by assigning replacements to units regardless of race. Zundel retired from the Army on 31 January 1953, and moved to Sarasota, Florida, where he resided until his death in Manatee Memorial Hospital in Bradenton, Florida, on 13 February 1985. On 19 February 1985, he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery alongside his wife Eleanor Lewis who died on 16 April 1968. He was survived by his daughter, Eleanor Phillips, and two grandchildren.

It is the eighth film in the Torchy Blane film series by Warner Bros., and the last movie starring Glenda Farrell and Barton MacLane as Torchy Blane and Steve McBride. It was released on May 13, 1939. The film is followed by Torchy Blane... Playing with Dynamite (1939). Plot Torchy Blane (Glenda Farrell) writes a series of articles criticizing the mayor John Saunders, accusing him of colluding with local crime boss Dr. Jerry Dolan (John Miljan) and Dolan's illegal activities. Torchy is getting all her information straight from the mayor's office, using a listening device. Torchy's boyfriend, detective Steve McBride (Barton MacLane) is concerned about the articles, believing that they are placing her in danger. Dolan asks his allies to withdraw advertising from Torchy's newspaper and pressure her editor into canceling her articles. Torchy is determined to prove that her articles are correct. She overhears Dolan telling the mayor about his \\"little red book\\" with all of his transactions and illegal payoffs and finds the book after breaking into Dolan's house. Dolan reports the burglary to police and demands the return of his book. Torchy writes more articles exposing Dolan, but her story is rejected by her newspaper editor, fearing more syndicates will pull advertising from the paper. She goes to all other newspapers, who all refused to print the story, then she encounters Hubert Ward (Irving Bacon) the publisher of a small and relatively unknown newspaper. Ward decides to print the story and Blane distributes the publication around the city with the help of Gahagan (Tom Kennedy). After Torchy revealed the mayor's corruption, the resultant publicity forces a recall election with the citizens choosing Hubert Ward as the new candidate running against the corrupt mayor. However, during the election, Ward is murdered by Dolan with a fatal injection. Steve, who is annoyed at Torchy's interference, writes her name as the new candidate as a joke. To his dismay, Torchy decides to run for mayor seriously and is winning voters. Dolan's man kidnaps Torchy and drugs her. Steve threatens Dolan to no avail but found an address where he believes Dolan is keeping Torchy. Steve and Gahagan track down the house and fight Dolan and his men and save Torchy. A half dozen policeman arrived at the house arresting them. Dolan manages to escape in Gahagan's police car but is killed when the car explodes. Torchy wins the election but decides, when presented with a baby to hold for a photograph, that she doesn't want to be the mayor and wants to marry McBride instead.

The body is covered by short and stout spines, and characterized by big, fly-trap like pedicellariae. When alive, the central disc is swollen, forming five radial bumps. It is a rather big species, and can grow up to 30 cm across. This species seems to be a predator of deep sea coral and other cnidarians, and was observed climbing on corals in order to feed.

Moon King's music has been described as dream pop, electronic pop or indie rock. Recently the project's sound has shifted to include disco, synthpop and house music. Born in Toronto, Canada, as a teenager Daniel became involved in the city's DIY music community, playing in numerous bands and organizing events including several all-night concerts at a circus rehearsal warehouse, and on the Toronto Islands. In the early 2010s he became closely affiliated with the flourishing electronic music and party scene in Montreal surrounding cult indie label Arbutus Records, and began frequently performing as a touring musician with Grimes, Sean Nicholas Savage and Doldrums. A cassette of Daniel's first recordings as Moon King caught the ear of Fucked Up guitarist Mike Haliechuk, who released two 12\\" EPs, Obsession I and Obsession II, on his label One Big Silence. Performing with guitarist and vocalist Maddy Wilde, as well as a rotating cast of backup musicians, Moon King toured heavily from 2013-2015, supporting artists including Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Austra, TOPS, Majical Cloudz and Alvvays,http://lastgangentertainment.com/blog/records/2014/moon- king-signs-to-last-gang-records-debut-lp-out-in-2015-announce-world-tour-w- alvvays/ showcasing at SXSW, CMJ and Iceland Airwaves, and receiving favorable press coverage. In 2015 the band played over 100 shows to support the release of Moon King's debut album Secret Life, but at the end of the year Daniel relocated to Detroit, Michigan, putting the brakes on any future touring. A completed second album was shelved, and longtime collaborator Maddy Wilde left the band to focus on other projects. Daniel spent the next year immersing himself in Detroit's dance music and DJ culture, which eventually began to influence his own recordings. Although the tracks were rough & homemade, a collection of new material found its way back to Arbutus Records in Montreal, who offered to release it.

It was first engineered and manufactured in 2014, after crowdfunding via Indiegogo, as a foot-controlled alternative to traditional tabletop, \\"hands-on\\" drum machines (as the Roland TR-909 or the Roger Linn's LinnDrum). The BeatBuddy is housed in the form of a stompbox unit, to give musicians (like guitar, bass and keyboard players, among others) a \\"hands- free\\" operation of the device while they are performing an instrument with their hands. The BeatBuddy is designed to be used in live performances, with the user determining when different sections of the song (such as the verse, chorus, and solo section) will start, and having the flexibility to extend or delay the sections, or pause the beat. Like other stompbox pedals, it can be controlled by foot presses on the pedal; the BeatBuddy recognizes single taps, holding down the pedal, releasing it, and double-pressing. It uses samples of non-quantized drum playing; unlike many other drum machines, which use synthesized drum sounds, the BeatBuddy drumming recorded by a professional drummer in a studio. Since its release in 2014, the BeatBuddy has garnered positive reviews from magazines like Guitar Player, Guitar World and Sound On Sound, and won the Best in Show award at the 2015 NAMM Show. Design and operation Although its design resembles an ordinary guitar effects pedal (like the Boss or DigiTech ones), the BeatBuddy is a drum machine and it does not make any audio effect or processing to the input signals. It has two 1/4\\" input jacks for instruments or audio devices, but the BeatBuddy can also work as a \\"standalone\\" device (that is, without anything plugged in), if required. The input jacks are a convenience to allow performers to simplify their setup; with the \\"pass-through\\" inputs, an electric piano player, say, who is playing a one man band show can plug their piano into the BeatBuddy, then plug the BeatBuddy into a keyboard amplifier (without the pass-through feature, a performer would need a mixer). The BeatBuddy is foot-controlled to start and stop the drum machine, and to make fills (fill-in lines and accents) and transitions between beats while it is on. There are rotary knobs for adjusting volume, tempo and choice of drum set. Content navigation through menus is possible with four directional buttons and a central \\"tap\\" one, next to the LCD screen. The LCD screen has a color display, and it uses different colors to indicate different status settings. Music genres covered by the BeatBuddy include: rock, blues, jazz, pop, Latin, metal, funk, punk, reggae, country, hip-hop, R&B;, techno, world, beatboxing, Brazilian, pop brushes, marching, Motown, oldies, and drum and bass. Drum kit sounds include standard drum kit, rock, metal, brushes, jazz, Latin, hand drum, electronic dance, electronic ethereal, and voice. It also has a headphone output with its volume control in the right side of the enclosure. It has a 5-pin MIDI jack which can work as input or output, allowing the BeatBuddy to be synchronized as \\"master\\" or \\"slave\\" with other electronic instruments or digital audio devices (such a synthesizer, a music sequencer, or a looper pedal) with MIDI support. By using the MIDI sync, the BeatBuddy and the looper pedal can use the same tempo. It also has two 1/4\\" outputs and a 1/8\\" headphone jack, a Mini-B USB port, and an SD Card Slot. The power source is a 9V DC power supply, which is included. An additional \\"dual-footswitch\\" accessory (sold separately) may be plugged into the BeatBuddy to provide control of accent hits, pause/unpause, as well as tap tempo and \\"hands-free\\" content navigation. Some users who get the additional pedal put the main BeatBuddy on a tabletop or on a keyboard to make the scrolling buttons easier to access and the screen easier to see.

The trial was initiated in 1980, and was conducted in fifteen screening centers in six different Canadian provinces. It was the first study designed to determine whether mammography was effective among women between the ages of 40 and 49. Methodology In the CNBSS, nearly 90,000 women were randomly assigned to either undergo mammographic screening annually, or not undergo it, for five years (1980-1985). The women who participated in the study were aged 40‚Äì59, and were divided into two groups: the age 40-49 group and the age 50-59 group. The women aged 40‚Äì49 in the mammography group also received annual breast exams, as did the women aged 50‚Äì59 in both the mammography and control groups. The women aged 40‚Äì49 in the control group received only one breast exam, after which they were told to remain under the care of their family doctor. Results The first paper reporting on results of the study was published in 1992, whereupon it generated considerable debate in the scientific community. In February 2014, the BMJ published more results from the study after following up on the participants for twenty-five years, with the authors concluding that \\"annual mammography in women aged 40-59 does not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of physical examination or usual care when adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is freely available.\\" The study also reported substantial overdiagnosis among women who had been screened, which the authors stated accounted for about 22% of the cancers detected by screening. Reaction H. Gilbert Welch, of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, has described the CNBSS as ‚Äúprobably the most meticulously done randomized trial of screening mammography.\\" In contrast, in response to the 2014 study reporting on the results of the CNBSS after twenty-five years of follow up, the American College of Radiology (ACR) and Society of Breast Imaging issued a statement describing the paper as ‚Äúan incredibly misleading analysis based on the deeply flawed and widely discredited Canadian National Breast Screening Study.‚Äù The ACR's statement also claimed that the investigators who conducted the CNBSS allocated women with \\"large incurable cancers\\" to the mammography group, which led to more women dying in the screened group. Welch responded to this statement by arguing that if it was true, there would have been more deaths among screened women, when in fact there were the same number of deaths among both the screened and unscreened groups. A 2015 review regarding the CNBSS concluded that its findings are \\"not applicable to current practice\\" because the study included a high proportion of women with palpable tumors, which, according to the authors of the review, \\"cannot contribute to an improved mortality reduction.\\" References Category:Clinical trials related to cancer ","title":"Canadian National Breast Screening Study"},{"id":"47703885","title":"List of Indian reservations in New Mexico"},{"id":"47703886","text":"Lake of Ladies or Ladies Lake (French: Lac aux dames) is a 1934 French drama film directed by Marc All√©gret and starring Rosine Der√©an, Simone Simon and Illa Meery.Bergfelder, Harris & Street p.78 The film's sets were designed by the art director Lazare Meerson.

This position did not last long, however, as S√° Carneiro's father withdrew his financial support after only two issues. During the 1920s, he became a reporter for O S√©culo and the Di√°rio de Lisboa, was briefly Director of the Illustra√ß√£o Portugueza and served as an international correspondent for Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. He also contributed prose and poetry to several literary journals. In 1920, he published one of his best known works, a collection of aphorisms and \\"paradoxes\\" called the Teoria da Indiferen√ßa (Theory of Indifference). He also produced a self-described \\"fragmentary novel\\", Leviana (Frivolous) and, in 1921, created N√≥s (We), a Modernist manifesto. Having begun as a member of the Portuguese Republican Party, he evolved into a Sidonista and supporter of authoritarian regimes, reflected in his book of interviews, Viagem √† Volta das Ditaduras (Journey Around the Dictatorships, 1927).

After World War II, the organization's name was changed to the \\"Secretariado Nacional de Informa√ß√£o\\" (SNI). He remained its Director until 1949, when he joined the Portuguese legation in Bern.

He was also involved in creating the Museu de Arte Popular and the \\"Companhia Portuguesa de Bailado Verde-Gaio\\", a dance company that performed from 1940 to 1977. The Pousadas de Portugal were created through his initiatives. In 1954, he transferred to the legation in Rome. Two years later, he died of an infection following minor surgery.

It was created during the Asian American Movement and acted as an umbrella organization to writers, visual artists, dancers and choreographers, and activists. It published Bridge Magazine and sponsored exhibitions and after school programs. Artists such as Tomie Arai, Fay Chiang, Larry Hama, Jessica Hagedorn, Jason Kao Hwang, Nina Kuo, and Chris Iijima were involved. Basement Workshop spawned numerous other organizations, including the Asian American Dance Theater, Asian American Arts Centre, Asian CineVision, Godzilla Asian American Arts Network, and Museum of Chinese in America.  History  Basement Workshop grew out the research of a group of young urban planners at Columbia University on the demographics of Manhattan's Chinatown. They established a space on Catherine Street in Chinatown, and later relocated to a loft on Lafayette Street. In 1972, Basement Workshop published the arts book Yellow Pearl, inspired by the album \\"Grain of Sand.\\" The square format portfolio included poetry, song lyrics, and visual art. Basement Workshop also published Bridge magazine and ran a youth program, gathered resources(at that point very limited) on Asian American history, and offered silkscreening, choreography, photography, and film workshops.

The apple's unusual name, like that of several other cider apples, has been suggested as referring to the drink's effect on the digestive system.Copas, L. A Somerset Pomona, Dovecote Press, 2001, p.21 Characteristics The tree itself is large when fully grown and vigorous, with a spreading habit. The fruit tends to have a flattened shape, greenish yellow skin, and a striped red flush which often has a distinctive bluish tinge.Annual Report of the Long Ashton Research Station, University of Bristol, 1966, p.87 Like many other Devon varieties, it is classed as a \\"sweet\\" type in the standard classification of cider apples, being low in tannin and acid. A very similar variety, \\"Woodbine\\" or \\"Rice's Jersey\\", is sometimes described as synonymous with Slack-ma-Girdle, but the former can be distinguished by the tree's less compact habit: both varieties produce a cider with a distinctive woody aftertaste.Copas, 2001, p.69 Hogg was not impressed with Slack-ma-Girdle's vintage qualities, stating that it had \\"not much merit\\" as a cider apple.Hogg, R.
