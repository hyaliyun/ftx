History John Legoe was born at Trefresa Farm near the village of Rock in the Parish of St Minver, North Cornwall. Rock lies on the eastern shore of the estuary of the River Camel. Opposite, on the western shore lies the small port of Padstow. He went to sea at an early age, working his way up the order (and gaining his Master Mariner's certificate from the Board of Trade in 1856) until he was put in charge of Celestial, a ship of 438 tons, on the China trade route. It was in this service that he first visited Australia, sailing from Foo Choo Foo or Foo Chow (Fuzhou) in April 1858. His next landfall in Australia was in command of the clipper The Murray in July 1861. He brought her three more times, in 1862, 1863 and 1864. He was appointed commodore of the Orient Line company, in charge of the new clipper Yatala which made her first voyage to Adelaide in 1865, arriving 27 October after a journey of 88 days. The following year, Adelaide's two favourite skippers, Captains Bruce and Legoe and their respective clipper ships City of Adelaide and Yatala were due to leave Port Adelaide on the same day, 27 December 1866 and public expectation was that they would make a race of it. Large and partisan crowds were at the docks to see them off; Yatala getting away around 6 am, and City of Adelaide some five hours later, owing to some oversight. At the Cape the difference had been whittled down to three hours The lead see-sawed between the two, but the larger Yatala reached The Downs a day ahead of the City which was subject to another day's delay in berthing. This was David Bruce's last voyage in command of the City; his son John Bruce (who married a daughter of George French Angas) succeeded him. Yatala made five more voyages to Adelaide: 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870 and 1871, all in good time with no real difficulties. Once, according to a report difficult to verify, Legoe ran up the Port River under her own sail and safely berthed after a record voyage from London of 64 days. The 64 days would be \\"pilot to pilot\\" not \\"dock to dock\\", and would refer to the 1867 voyage. The 1871 return voyage of Yatala was not so felicitous, the ship being grounded off Cape Grisnez in heavy weather shortly after midnight on 28 March 1872, after having mistaken the Cape Grisnez light for that of Beachy Head on the other side of the Channel. There were no deaths or injuries, the passengers sheltering at the nearby town of Audresselles. Much of the valuable cargo (mostly wool) was saved, but the ship subsequently broke up and was totally lost. The Board of Enquiry found Capt. Legoe fully responsible but in view of his long and faultless service and high character was given the relatively light sentence of six months suspension of his Certificate. He supervised building of Hesperus at Greenock, Scotland, completed 1873, to replace Yatala. She was chartered by Francis S. Dutton, Agent-General for South Australia, to bring out migrants to Adelaide, leaving Plymouth on 23 February 1874 and arriving 10 May 1874, a voyage of 77 days. The next voyage, leaving England July 1875 had William Gumming at the helm. Legoe took the next, which left June 1876. His last voyage was in charge of the Hesperus, on which brought his own family from Cornwall to settle in South Australia, left 19 July 1877 and arrived in October. Legoe was in 1877 a founding member of the South Australian Stevedoring Company, other members being Capt. William Begg, Joseph Stone, and Charles A. Brown. In August 1882 he was appointed a warden member of the newly formed Marine Board, representing the underwriters, and remained a member until his death. In June 1883 he was the sole dissenter against the condemnation of Capt. Marshall for the Investigator incident, and steadfast in his defence of the ship's master. Captain Hobbs, a fellow warden who had worked under Legoe, remembered him as being always considerate of those working under him, and was greatly respected. Family John Legoe (c. 1824 ‚Äì 24 March 1895) married Grace Lenn Rogers (c. 1832 ‚Äì 21 September 1910). Their family included: *Grace Lenn Legoe ( ‚Äì 20 March 1944) married stockbroker Charles (James Henthorn) Morton Todd ( ‚Äì 21 December 1916) on 15 June 1882.

It is an open-air place of worship, created as an extension of Camp Chocorua, the first summer youth camp in the United States. The open-air chapel was created by the camp's first season of young boys, made entirely of boulders, trees, various island vegetation, and beach sand. The camp Ernest Berkeley Balch was born in 1860, one of fourteen children of Episcopal minister Lewis Penn Witherspoon Balch and his wife. The family lived on an estate in New Hampshire. Rev. Balch had aspirations of establishing a private Episcopal school, and after his 1875 death his widow donated much of the estate to establish the Holderness School. Sources differ on the exact timeline, but either before or after his 1879 enrollment at Dartmouth College, Ernest joined his friends Henry Burke Closson and Charles Merrill Hough on their summer camp-out on Squam Lake. The experience inspired Ernest to start a wilderness camp for young boys, one which would contribute to their spiritual development as well as physical stamina. With help from Hough and other college friends, the camp was constructed on the privately owned Chocorua Island, and began operations the summer of 1881. Apparently, they discovered after the fact that it was not public land. An arrangement was later worked out with the owner for operations to continue. Although it ultimately lost money for its investors, the venture is recognized as the first summer youth camp in America, and considered to be the vanguard for the proliferation of the youth camp culture. The chapel The open-air chapel was built by the boys during the camp's first summer season, clearing the land and using natural elements. From Squam Lake, they retrieved a hunk of granite with the correct shape for a lectern, and placed it beside the \\"erratic granite boulder\\" they had re-purposed for an altar. Both altar and lectern were adorned with ferns and wildflowers on Sunday. The benches and the cross were fashioned from native trees on the island; beach sand was used as flooring. Two services were held each Sunday, providing an afternoon one for visitors and an evening service prior to bedtime for the boys. The camp itself ceased operations after the 1889 season, but the chapel continued to serve visitors to the island. The Chocorua Chapel Association was formed by eight individuals in 1903: Ellen Balch and her husband Oliver Whipple Huntington; Edith Balch and her husband Clifford Gray Twombley, an Episcopal minister; Lena Balch and her husband Joseph Howland Coit; Harold Jefferson Coolidge; and W. Percy Van Ness, who became the chapel organist. The association assumed responsibility for the chapel's operation and continued maintenance, and donations to the chapel are redistributed to non-profit community organizations. Grover Cleveland, whose second term as President of the United States ended in 1897, attended worship services at the chapel during the summer of 1904. Although the camp had fallen into disrepair by that date, the chapel continued to provide worship services for visitors and area residents. Eventually, the Association branched out and ran the chapel as non-denominational. In 1928, the owner of the island donated it to the Association. NRHP certification The chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in Grafton County, New Hampshire on September 20, 2016. Five of the fifteen contributing properties to qualify for the NRHP are on the south end arrival area of the island: the wharf, the sea wall and docks, two crosses, and a shelter for the memory book. Three of the four non-contributing properties are also at the south end: two sheds and a boulder. At the north end where the chapel is located, the only non-contributing property is the organ shed. Ten of the fifteen contributing properties are at the north end: cross and altar, lectern, baptismal font, benches, bell and tower, the organ, a robing hut and a stone wall.

Early life and education Samaniego was born in San Pedro Department, Paraguay, to Juan Alberto Samaniego and his wife, Maria. He entered the Paraguayan Army as a cadet in 1929 and trained as a military engineer. Career Samaniego served during the Chaco War and was later director of Paraguay's Francisco L√≥pez Military College. He was one of Alfredo Stroessner's most loyal supporters and helped Stroessner overthrow the government during the 1954 coup d'etat.

After winning his only race as a juvenile he won the McCairns Trial Stakes on his three-year-old debut and then recorded his biggest win in the Irish 2000 Guineas. He started favourite for the 1980 Epsom Derby but finished seventh and ran poorly on his only subsequent start. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in the United States and Uruguay but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Nikoli was a \\"strong, most attractive\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by the McGrath Trust Co. at the Brownstown Stud. As a yearling he was put up for auction and sold for 52,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of Lord Iveagh and was sent into training with the veteran Paddy Prendergast. He was sired by Great Nephew, a British stallion who won the Prix du Moulin in 1967 before becoming an outstanding sire whose other progeny included Grundy, Mrs Penny, Shergar, Tolmi and Carotene. His dam Aliceva made little impact as a racehorse but produced several other winners including Captain James (Waterford Crystal Mile) and Sutton Place (Coronation Stakes). She was a half-sister to Feemoss, the dam of Levmoss, Le Moss and Sweet Mimosa (Prix de Diane). Racing career =1979: two-year-old season= Nikoli made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Phoenix Park Racecourse in October. He started favourite and won by three quarters of a length from Musical Boy after taking the lead in the closing stages. =1980: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old Nikoli contested the Group Three McCairns Trial Stakes over seven furlongs on soft ground at Phoenix Park. Most of the interest in the race focused on the Vincent O'Brien-trained Monteverdi, the top-rated juvenile of 1979 in Britain and Ireland who was made the 1/3 favourite. Nikoli, however, upset the odds, winning by a length and a half from Monteverdi, who was carrying seven pounds more. The ground was much firmer when Nikoli was stepped up to Group One level for the Irish 2000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh on 17 May and started the 5/1 third favourite behind Monteverdi and Posse. The other ten runners included Final Straw (who had beaten Monteverdi in the Greenham Stakes), Huguenot (Beresford Stakes), Last Fandango (Blue Riband Trial Stakes), Current Charge (Tetrarch Stakes) and Johnny O'Day (Larkspur Stakes). Final Straw, Nikoli, Last Fandango and Posse entered the final furlong almost level, but Nikoli, ridden by Christy Roche stayed on better than his rivals and won by a short head from Last Fandango. Nikoli's win at the Curragh made him a leading contender for The Derby and he received considerable sentimental support as his highly respected trainer was terminally ill and unlikely to saddle another runner in the race. Concerns were expressed however about the colt's ability to handle the course and his nervous temperament. At Epsom he started the 4/1 favourite for the Derby but never looked likely to win, finishing eighth behind Henbit. Paddy Prendergast died on the 20 June and his son Kevin took over as Nikoli's trainer. In the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 28 June, the colt was made the second favourite but became highly agitated before the start and finished unplaced behind Tyrnavos. In the latter part of 1980 the ownership of Nikoli was the subject of a lengthy legal dispute which was eventually settled out of court in November. The colt never ran again and was retired to stud at the end of the year. Assessment In the Irish Free Handicap for the two-year-olds of 1979 Nikoli was assigned a weight of 108 pounds, 25 pounds behind the top- rated Monteverdi. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 96p, the \\"p\\" indicationg that he was likely to make more than normal progress. In their annual Racehorses of 1983 Timeform described him as \\"a well-related colt who will make into a smart 3-y-o over 1m or more\\". In the International Classification for 1980 Nikoli was rated on 85, six pounds behind the top- rated Moorestyle and was the highest-rated Irish three-year-old. Timeform gave him a rating of 125, eleven pounds behind Moorestyle, who was their Horse of the Year. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Nikoli was exported to the United States to become a breeding stallion. He was moved to stand in Uruguay in the late 1980s. The best of his offspring included Air Display who won the Volante Handicap in 1986.

Production The Datsun 14 was the first car that Nissan produced at their new plant in Yokohama. The factory utilised many tools and techniques imported from the United States and enabled the company to assemble both bodies and chassis in the same factory for the first time. The first vehicle rolled off the production line on 12 April 1935. Production numbers A total of 3,800 Datsun 14 were produced between April 1935 and April 1936, of which 53 were exported. The car was similar in styling to the Austin 7, which greatly helped exports, initially to Australia and, in 1936, to New Zealand.

The first festival was held from 16‚Äî24 September 2017. It is a volunteer-run, not- for-profit community event, offering 'a week of screenings, parties, workshops and discussions'. The festival is directed by founder Tingting Shi. There are two other separate and unconnected LGBT film festivals in the city, ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival, and CINEMQ, established in 2015. Background According to Shi, events in Shanghai‚Äôs vibrant queer scene are 'generally tailored to a Western sensibility.' This assertion is backed up by Dr. Hongwei Bao, who has noted that events such as ShanghaiPRIDE have a pervasive 'non- Chinese' perspective. Shanghai Queer Film Festival is run by a mostly local Chinese team, and focuses primarily on Asian film, through initiatives such as an Asian Short Film Competition, and partnerships with regional groups. Festival programmer Yu Jing argues that through such a focus, they, ‚Äúreveal an abundance of queer Asian characters, encourage discussion on queer culture in the East, and represent diversity the diversity of love and freedom.‚Äù The festival identifies itself as queer, rather than simply LGBT, as a way of signposting a more progressive and nuanced discussion for Chinese audiences. Shi states that, \\"...local audiences lack a certain understanding of the real scope of our diversity, including diversity in the community, and some more recent concepts. Given this, what we tried to do when selecting films was to highlight new ideas and pick films that could spark dialogues, instead of just striving for a perfectly balanced representation of different LGBTQ identities.' The week long festival is run by a team of over 20 unpaid volunteer designers, writers, curators, marketers and others. The festival features discussion groups, workshops, talks and lectures from leading academics, as well as interactive activities and parties. Events such as panel discussions and networking sessions enable filmmakers to spread their material more widely and to connect better to audiences. As a not-for-profit, community-based festival, Shanghai Queer Film Festival is free of charge and open to the general public. The audience is encouraged to question filmmakers and explore the issues raised in the films they attend, with the festival describing its aim to provide \\"a week of culture, engagement and celebration\\".  2017  The festival theme was We Are Here. The opening night films were Richard Fung's documentaries on the changing face of queer Asian identity in Canada Orientations and Re:Orientations. Other screenings included Tale of the Lost Boys, Lan Yu, Starting Over and Indian documentary Breaking Free. SHQFF Best Short Film prize was awarded to Kaj Palanca and Jared Joven for Contestant #4.

The recording of the debate was intended to ensure the unbiased documentation, allowing it to become a concrete moment in feminist history.  Summary  The film begins making a statement on the issues of class and accessibility within women's liberation, with hecklers outside the building shouting that Germaine Greer \\"betrays the poor\\".Town Bloody Hall. Mailer, Norman; Germaine Greer; Jacqueline Ceballos; Diana Trilling; Jill Johnston. Directed by Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker, Pennebaker Hegedus Films, Inc. 1979. Inside the theatre, Norman Mailer begins the panel discussion, and introduces his own work \\"The Prisoner of Sex\\" in Harper's Bazaar magazine. He says that the women's liberation movement is against his work which was advertised as \\"the piece that's gonna have women's lib, ah, picketing the newsstands\\" yet believes the women's liberation movement is \\"the most important single intellectual event of the last few years\\". Jacqueline Caballos, the president of the New York Chapter of the National Organization for Women, believes that Norman Mailer represents the establishment, and therefore her participation has allowed her to work within the system. She admits to her privilege as a middle-class woman and mentions the perception of the National Organization for Women as \\"square\\". She then clarifies that the main agenda of the organization is solely women's liberation, and they do not devote time to fighting for the peace movement, civil rights movement, or the changing environment. The organization believes that women's liberation is the center of everything, and only upon that will it be focused. The next speaker featured is Germaine Greer, an Australian feminist writer. She represents women writers in a traditionally male-dominated field, specifically in reference to her juxtaposition between the powerful and privileged Mailer in comparison to herself. She believes men are allowed to be vulnerable to create, but women are not given the same luxury. She believes the feminist revolution will change the way art is distinguished by the shift from inaccessibility and rarity, to the public itself. Jill Johnston introduces lesbian feminism, in which she argues all women are lesbians. She argues the need for all women to accept themselves as lesbians in order to create substantive political change. She reiterates that lesbianism is used as an insult when women are feminists when in reality they are just learning to love themselves in order to be equal to men. At this point in the film, two women come to the stage and begin kissing and rolling on the floor, much to the dismay of Norman Mailer. Eventually, they walk off the stage and do not return. Diana Trilling closes the speeches with her take of sexual liberation. She states that the sexual repression of homosexuals continues onto the sexualities of women, with a cultural belief that there is no such thing as the female orgasm. She diversifies what it means to be a sexually active person, as she believes there is no single definition of sexual desire. Trilling believes Mailer \\"fails to imagine ... the full humanity of women as it would never fail in its imagination of the full humanity of men\\". The town hall includes the debate between the participants, mainly between Trilling and Greer, and Mailer and Greer. Mailer focuses on the role of men, noting that these women fail to address the fact that life is also difficult for men. He also states that there is no one way to approach activism, and that movements need to be taken in a way that addresses norms in order to move against them. Mailer then changes the subject to speak about the academic and historical work of women's oppression to which Greer responds that the work is lengthy and complicated, and will take many years to establish. Mailer questions how women can make assumptions about their oppression without having historical work to back it up. Greer notes that patriarchy has an effect on everyone, including men. Other feminist icons and personalities are featured in the film during the question period, such as Betty Friedan, criticizing Mailer's moderating skills, Susan Sontag, who criticizes Mailer's gendered language, Cynthia Ozick,\\"The Town Hall Affair Recreates a Feminist Firestorm\\" by Alexis Soloski, The New York Times, February 6, 2017 who criticizes Mailer's chauvinism, and Anatole Broyard who asks about post-liberation narratives. Background Leading up to this debate, there were many issues being covered in the media, politics and feminist circles. ;January 12, 1971 The U.S. Supreme Court debated its first abortion case. This covered the potential abolition of abortion laws in thirty nine states. These states only allowed abortion \\"when necessary for the preservation of the mother's health\\". The presiding judge determined that the law was vague and due to this was being challenged in Indiana, New Jersey, and Colorado. Judge Gerhard Gesell determined that the federal courts should return to existing abortion control laws in Minnesota, Missouri, Louisiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Vermont. ;January 24, 1971 New York Radical Feminists host \\"Speak Out on Rape\\", where women discussed and analyzed assumptions made about rape and its victims. ;April 3, 1970 President Richard Nixon ordered limits to military physicians to perform abortions on bases which required them to adhere to laws of the states where they were based. ;April 21, 1971 NOW New York published a report on the sex-bias in public schools.  Participants  = Jill Johnston = \\"Lesbian Feminism\\" consists of understanding womanhood as perpetual lesbianism. In order for women to feel liberated and self-assured, they need to love themselves, thus making them lesbians. Her feminist principles are focused around self-love and the needs for self-determination within the feminist movement. As a leader of the sexual revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, Johnston faced an enormous backlash from conservatives, which created a lasting effect on her ability to advocate for \\"lesbian feminism\\".Fastenberg, Dan. \\"Jill Johnston\\". Time. 176, no.14 (2010), 24. Following this backlash, she rebranded her activism as a period piece and wrote a biography called England's Child: The Carillon and the Casting of Big Bells, which connected her own goals to the role of her father, whom she had never met. = Diana Trilling = Diana Trilling focuses on the intersections between gender and sexuality. Women's sexuality is consistently repressed, and so is that of homosexuals. As such, sexual liberation (of homosexuals as well) is required for women to be liberated from social norms. = Jacqueline Ceballos = Jacqueline Ceballos focuses primarily on second wave feminism, without any intersectional approach. Women's liberation is the source of all inequalities, and therefore looking at the ways these inequalities interact is an afterthought. = Germaine Greer = Germaine Greer attempts to deconstruct gender roles such as womanhood and femininity. Greer believes that women should strive to free womanhood, not to attempt to become equal to men. It has been critiqued however that Germaine Greer does not advocate for women who do not \\"rise to her own notion of womanhood\\".McDonagh, Melanie (December 17, 2001). \\"Germaine Greer. (Smashed Hits)\\". New Statesman. She believes women should have children and tends towards non-interventionism, even when intervention has been asked for by the oppressed. However, she has also been respected a someone who can pitch liberal feminism to traditionally conservative middle classes while still having them agree to it. This because the feminism Greer advocates is not radical enough to create an actual shift in society.McDonagh, Melanie (February 26, 1999). \\"Conservative newspapers, unlike The Guardian seem to love Germain Greer, former scary feminist\\".

It was established as a frontier province, or march, of the Emirate, later Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, facing the Christian lands of the Carolingian Empire's Marca Hispanica, the Asturo-Leonese marches of Castile and Alava, and the nascent autonomous Pyrenean principalities. In 1018, the decline of the central Cordoban state allowed the lords of the Upper March to establish in its place the Taifa of Zaragoza. Formation of the Upper March In the half century after the initial Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula, much of the conquest and settlement was left to the local initiatives of clans and tribes in loose coalition rather than being a centrally coordinated scheme. As a result, the fertile lands of Septimania north of the Pyrenees were occupied, and leld until 759, but any occupation of the uninviting lands of Galicia and Asturias was temporary and superficial.Reilly, pp. 52‚Äì54 Much of the land in the conquered areas had been owned by Christian landowners that resisted the invasion: this was confiscated and granted to the Arab and Berber troops that had participated in the invasion, with the Arabs tending to settle in the south, leaving the more remote and relatively barren areas to the Berbers. However, those Christian nobles and communities that had submitted were granted treaties that allowed them to retain their lands, on the payment of a significant annual tax for as long as they remained Christian. The substantial advantages of conversion to Islam were supposed to have convinced Count Cassius, said to have been a count in the Ebro region in Visigoth times, and the reputed founder of the Banu Qasi (sometimes spelled Banu Casi) clan, to convert in 714. What is certain is that the existence of the Banu Qasi was recorded from 789, in the person of supposed grandson, Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, and that the two most powerful local families in the Upper March in the late 8th and early 9th centuries, the Banu Qasi and the Banu Amrus were both native converts to Islam.Kennedy, p. 39 Further Muslim expansion ended through the combined effects of a Berber Revolt in Iberia that commenced in 740 and, in the Middle East, the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 747 to 750. The latter resulted in the creation of an Abbasid Caliphate that regarded al-Andalus as a rebel province needing to be recovered.Reilly, p.56 The Berber revolt led to the withdrawal of those Berbers who had been allocated land in the Duero valley, leaving few Muslims in the northwest of the peninsula. Alfonso I, the Christian king of neighboring Asturias, which spanned the northern coast of Iberia from Galicia to the Basque territory, raided the former Berber lands and captured the cities of Le√≥n, Astorga and Braga, killing their Muslim garrisons. Taking their populations north, he left the Duero valley a sparsely populated no man's land bordering what would become the Upper March to the west.Reilly, p.75 Meanwhile, in the north and east, the Frankish kingdom had extended their power into Aquitaine and, under Pepin the Strong had moved into Septimania in the 750s, capturing Narbonne in 759,Reilly, p. 77 thus confining al-Andalus south of the Pyrenees. There was also a civil war fought in al- Andalus between the families deriving from northern and southern Arabia, leading in 747 to the ascendance of the Yemeni faction following the battle of Secunda (Sequnda, near C√≥rdoba) and the installation at Zaragoza of a Yemeni, al-Sumayl ibn Hatim al-Kilabi, as governor over the northern Arab settlers of the Ebro valley. Two of their leaders, Amir al-Abdari and Hubab al-Zuhri, rebelled and besieged Zaragoza in 754. This rebellion was put down the next year by the army of Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, the governor of al- Andalus, and when a group of soldiers already suspected of being rebel sympathizers blocked him from executing the rebels, Yusuf sent them on a suicide mission against the Basques of Pamplona. These moves left southern Iberia exposed and enabled the fugitive Umayyad prince, Abd al-Rahman I, to cross from North Africa and gain a foothold, eventually leading to his conquest of al-Andalus and establishment of an independent Emirate of C√≥rdoba.Manzano Moreno, pp. 185-187 The strength of Abd al-Rahman's Umayyad Emirate lay in the Guadalquivir valley and to its south and east south and, rather than trying to conquer Christian lands or make their rulers accept Umayyad primacy, he and his successors concentrated on keeping the outlying areas of the Emirate under their control by setting-up three marches or thugur, (singular thagr). In the west was the Lower March (a·πØ-·πÆa·∏°r al-Adna) based at M√©rida, a Middle March (a·πØ-·πÆa·∏°r al-Awsa·π≠) ruled from Toledo and later Medinaceli, while in the east the Upper March had Zaragoza as its seat.Caba√±ero Subiza, p. 75 Each march was responsible for defending its area against Christian attack and supporting any major expeditions the Emirate's principal armies might make against the Christian territories. The Upper March consisted of several coras (territorial subdivisions, from the Arabic kura): Barbitaniya, stretching from the north of the present province of Huesca, with its capital in Barbastro,Caba√±ero Subiza, pp. 82 and also including Bolta√±a, Alqu√©zar, Naval, Salinas de Hoz, Olvena, and near the boundary of Muslim control, Graus, called Puertaspan (Puerto de Hispania, 'Gateway to al- Andalus');Caba√±ero Subiza, pp. 79-81 Huesca (Washka), based in Huesca and including the fort of Bolea; Lleida, which included Mequinenza and Fraga; Zaragoza, both politically and economically the principal cora of the Upper March, centered on that city but also including Zuera, Ricla, Muel, Belchite, Alca√±iz and Calanda; Calatayud, including its eponymous city as well as Maluenda and Daroca; Tudela, which included the cities of Tarazona and Borja and extended to the current La Rioja; and the smallest, Barusa, organized along the Rio Petri, with its capital in Molina de Arag√≥n, and bordering Santaveria, in the Middle March. The northernmost of these coras, Barbitaniya and Huesca, formed a subdivision of the Upper March called the Distant or Farthest March (a·πØ-·πÆa·∏°r al-‚ÄòAq·π£ƒÅ). The Upper March was ruled by a Lord of the March (SƒÅhib a·πØ-·πÆa·∏°r), named by the emir or caliph, who acted as civil governor (amil, wali) or military commander (qa'id), sometimes both. They in turn depended on the district governors, who were responsible for overseeing taxation, maintaining fortresses, defending their people, and accompanying the C√≥rdoba emir or caliph on campaigns against the Christian states of the north.Caba√±ero Subiza, pp. 76 Failed Carolingian expansion The nobility of the Upper March remained fractious. In 774, Husayn of Zaragoza rebelled against Umayyad C√≥rdoba, proclaiming for the Abbasids, and the Emir sent an army to subjugate the march. Then in 778, Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al Arabi of Barcelona sent envoys to Charlemagne, offering his fealty along with that of Abu Taur of Huesca and Husayn of Zaragoza in exchange for his support in their rebellion against C√≥rdoba. The Frankish monarch marched south and took Barcelona, but when he arrived at Zaragoza he found the marcher lords to have had a change of heart, and the city was closed to him. After an unsuccessful siege, Charlemagne withdrew through the Pyrenees, where his rear guard was ambushed at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. This marked the end of significant Frankish attempts to expand into Iberia, and in 795 Charlemagne would establish the Marca Hispanica in the eastern Pyrenees to serve as a buffer between his realm and the Upper March, while the two realms continued to compete for influence in the western Pyrenees, among the Basques. At the end of the century, two governors of Huesca would again reach out to the Franks, the Muwallad Basque rebel Bahlul Ibn Marzuq in 798, and Azan in 799,S√©nac (2020), p. 29 while in the latter year at Pamplona, Muhammad ibn Musa, apparently of Muwallad Banu Qasi family of Huesca, was assassinated in what usually is interpreted as a move by a pro-Frankish faction.Ca√±ada Juste, p. However, in 816 a Christian army including Franks and Asturian allies and led by Velasco the Gascon was defeated by Emirate armies in 816. This defeat would lead to the ascendancy, originally as clients of C√≥rdoba, of a native Basque dynasty allied by blood to the Muwallad lords of the Upper March as rulers of the nascent state of Pamplona. Muwallad rivalry, ascendance and decline =8th and 9th centuries= In 781, the emir succeeded in forcing the submission of Husayn in Zaragoza, who had murdered Sulayman in 780, but in 785 the latter's son, Mutrah, rebelled and took Huesca and Zaragoza, before he in turn was murdered by his servants, the kinsmen Amrus ibn Yusuf and Shabrit ibn Rashid, in 791/2. The Emirate brought the loyalty of Amrus by granting him Toledo, but in 798 another Zaragoza rebel, Bahlul Ibn Marzuq, took Huesca from the Banu Salama, and this led to the return of Amrus from Toledo into the Upper March. Amrus expelled Bahlul and fortified Tudela. Another rebellion in Zaragoza, this time led by Furtun ibn Musa of the Banu Qasi, was likewise crushed by Amrus in 802, and he was then given control of Zaragoza and the Upper March. The Upper March in the 9th century, based on Zaragoza, had other urban settlements at Tudela, Huesca, Tortosa and Calatayud. Al-Hakim I used the local Muwallad families, native Iberian that had converted to Islam, as governors. The decade-long governorship of Amrus bin Yusuf, from whom would descend the Banu Amrus clan, kept the Banu Qasi in check, though they retained their semi-autonomous status despite Amrus's occupation of Tudela, and their alliance and intermarriages with the kingdom of Pamplona also provided them with Basque soldiers.Kennedy, p.56 The capture and execution of Amrus, coupled with the ascendance of their Christian kinsmen in Pamplona, led to the ascendance of the Banu Qasi, and in 842, their leader Musa ibn Musa defied the Umayyads and rebelled against C√≥rdoba with the assistance of his half-brother, √ç√±igo Arista of Pamplona. Despite the Umayyad capture of Zaragoza in 844 and a son of the Emir Abd-al Rahman II being appointed as governor until 852, Musa retained his autonomy in his ancestral lands.Kennedy, p.57 After reconciliation with the Emirate and further episodes of rebellion followed by punitive Umayyad expeditions directed by Abd el-Rahman II, in 852 the new emir, Muhammad, named Musa as WƒÅli of Zaragoza and governor of the Upper March He was sometimes called 'the Third King of Hispania', alongside the Emir of C√≥rdoba and the King of Asturias, as he controlled Zaragoza, Tudela, Calatayud, Huesca and Toledo, forming a semi-independent state. However, his power in the Upper March came was ended when he and his Basque allies suffered a crushing defeat against the combined armies of Asturias and Pamplona in 859 or 860 at the Battle of Monte Laturce. After fleeing the battle, in which he lost the bulk of his army, Musa was deprived by the emir of all his titles.Kennedy, pp.57-8 He died following an expedition against his son-in- law, Azraq ibn Mantel, at Guadalajara in August 862, during which he was wounded and left unable to ride. He died a month later at Tudela.Ca√±ada Juste, p.39 There followed a decade-long eclipse of the Banu Qasi.Flood, p.31 After Musa was deprived of governorship of the Upper March, at least three of his four sons were sent to Cordoba as hostages, although one of them, Fortun ibn Musa, quickly pledged obedience to the Emir, and later distinguished himself in the Muslim forces of the Upper March campaigning against the Christians. Musa's the eldest son Lubb ibn Musa, had apparently been appointed by the Emir Muhammad I as governor of Tudela in 859 and by becoming in 860 the ally of king Ordo√±o I of Asturias, he retained control of Tudela and, by 862 had either secured the release or rescue of his two brothers, who returned to the Upper March. When the Emir Muhammad undertook a campaign in 865‚Äì6 against the forces of √Ålava and the county of Castile, Fortun accompanied the Emir, but Lubb is believed to have remained loyal to Ordo√±o. However, after Ordo√±o's death in 966, Lubb was reconciled with the Emir. Lubb was based in the town of Arnedo, having lost control of Huesca.Ca√±ada Juste, p.41 Huesca was governed in 870 by Musa ibn Galind, probably a grandson of I√±igo Arista of Pamplona via his son Galindo who had abandoned Pamplona for C√≥rdoba, and hence akin to the Banu Qasi who had formerly held it.S√°nchez Albornoz, p. 266, n. 8Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa, \\"Galindo I√±iguez\\" He was killed that year by Amrus ibn Umar of the Banu Amrus, who then formed a rebellious alliance against the Emir with I√±igo's eldest son and successor in Pamplona, Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez. However, in 871, the Emir's general in the Upper March defeated the rebels and captured Zakarayya ibn Amrus, uncle of Amrus ibn Umar, and executed him and his sons at the gates of Zaragoza.Ca√±ada Juste, pp.42-3 While the forces of the Emirate were dealing with the rebellion of Amrus, in December 871 and January 872 the four sons of Musa ibn Musa, with the support of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez, quickly recovered power in Huesca, Tudela and Zaragoza with little resistance, followed by Monzon and Lleida.Ca√±ada Juste, p.43 The initial strategy of Muhammad I was to lead an army into the Upper March in the spring of 873. He decided not to besiege or assault the well-fortified Zaragoza, but was able to capture Huesca. Mutarrif ibn Musa of the Banu Qasi, who had governed Huesca from December 871, and his sons were taken to Cordoba and crucified in September 873, and the Emir installed Amrus ibn Umar in his place at Huesca.Ca√±ada Juste, pp.45-7 Muhammad also installed the Arab Banu Tujib family in Calatayud as a check on the Banu Qasi, then withdrew.Ca√±ada Juste, pp.44, 48 Despite the presence of these opponents, the Banu Qasi retained most of the cities of the Upper March and, with Lubb ibn Musa as head of the family, were largely autonomous. Lubb's death in 875 following that in 874 of his brother Fortun, who held Tudela, weakened the family. Ismail ibn Musa, who had formed a marriage alliance with the Banu Jalaf of Barbitanyaas was the only remaining son of Musa but had to contend with his nephew Muhammad ibn Lubb for control of the family and its lands.Ca√±ada Juste, pp.48-50 An Umayyad army under al-Mundir the heir presumptive of Muhammad I was sent north in 874, to attack Zaragoza first, then to Tudela and the various strongholds of the Banu Qasi and finally to ravage the lands of Pamplona, cutting down trees and uprooting crops. The expedition achieved little, as all the main cities and strongholds of the Upper March that the Banu Qasi held before remained in their hands.Ca√±ada Juste, pp.51-4 A subsequent expedition in 882 involving a failed sieges of Zaragoza and Lleida did result, as had the 874 expedition, in the widespread destruction of crops and created disharmony within the Banu Qasi clan, leaving Muhammad ibn Lubb isolated. However and attempt by Ismail ibn Musa and the sons of Fortun ibn Musa to defeat Muhammad in battle led to their defeat, capture and forced their surrender of Tudela and several castlesCa√±ada Juste, pp.56-8 A further Umayyad expedition in 882 particularly directed against Zaragoza was unsuccessful, but a further attack starting in 884 finally broke Muhammad ibn Lubb's resistance The cumulative pressure of these repeated attacks forced Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi to sell Zaragoza in 885. And when in 886 the city was seized from the Emir's own governor by the Banu Tujib the Emir acquiesced, elevating this family as major regional rivals to the Muwallad families. The Banu Qasi again rebelled, and the Emir captured and crucified several members of the family, and in 887 we find Masud ibn Amrus of the Banu Amrus controlling Huesca when he was murdered and supplanted by his distant kinsman Muhammad al-Tawil of the Banu Shabrit.S√©nac (2010), p. 30 In 890 al-Tawil defeated another Banu Qasi rebellion led by Isma'il ibn Musa, uncle of Muhammad ibn Lubb. Though al-Tawil claimed the lands of the defeated Isma'il, the Emir would not risk such an increase in his power, and instead granted them to Muhammad ibn Lubb, who had remained loyal during his uncle's rebellion. Muhammad ibn Lubb tried to reverse these family losses by carrying out a lengthy but unsuccessful siege of Zaragoza, held by the a Banu Tujib governor, and even when Muhammad was killed outside the city's walls in 898,Ca√±ada Juste, p. 74 the siege continued under his son Lubb ibn Muhammad, who became wali of Tudela and Lleida and lord of the family lands in the Upper Ebro.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 70, 74-5Catlos, p. 78 When the siege was finally broken, the Banu Tujib they seized Ejea from the Banu Qasi.Ca√±ada Juste, p. 77 Nonetheless, Lubb experienced a period of success, twice defeating al-Tawil's armies, capturing the latter and requiring an exorbitant ransom, and in 897 he defeated and killed his Christian neighbor, Wilfred the Hairy of Barcelona.Reilly, p.83 =10th century= In the early 10th century, the dynamics of the Upper March were fundamentally altered by changes in the leadership of the states to the north and south. In 905, the C√≥rdoba client Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona was supplanted by the anti-Muslim Sancho I, while in 911, Abd al-Rahman III became Emir of C√≥rdoba and began a policy of tightening central control over his fractious regional lords. When in 907 Lubb attacked Pamplona, he was ambushed and killed by its new king.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 74-5 With Lubb's death, the Banu Qasi ceased to hold the governorship of Lleida, and the Banu al-Tawil seized Barbastro, Alqu√©zar and Monz√≥n. One of Lubb's sons, Abd Allah, was murdered by his uncle Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, who became wali of Huesca and in 911 allied himself with family rival Muhammad al-Tawil. They passed through the lands of al-Tawil's Christian brother-in-law Galindo Azn√°rez II of Aragon to again attack Sancho's Pamplona realm, only to be crushed by the new Christian monarch,Ca√±ada Juste, p. 79 who in turn attacked Tudela in 915, capturing and later murdering Abd Allah.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 81‚Äì83 His succession was contested between his brother Mutarrif and son Muhammad, with the latter killing his uncle the next year to take the leadership of the family, while his cousin Muhammad ibn Lubb, a son of Lubb ibn Muhammad, established himself in the eastern Upper March, rataking Monz√≥n from the sons of Muhammad al-Tawil after the latter died in 913 during an attack on Barcelona.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 83‚Äì84 and also regained Lleida when in 922 its residents turned against their lord, Amrus ibn al-Tawil.Ca√±ada Juste, p. 89 In 918, Sancho I of Pamplona captured Calahorra, previously held by the Banu Qasi for almost a century, and he besieged, and the next year captured and burnt Monz√≥n, which the Banu Qasi never regained.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 85‚Äì86 Abd al- Rahman III in 924 led an army north and removed Muhammad ibn Abd Allah from control of Huesca, sending him to Cordoba.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 88‚Äì89 With pressure on the families of the Upper March from the monarchs of Cordoba to the south, Pamplona to the north and Le√≥n to their west, and weakened by internal family struggles, the sole remaining Banu Qasi lord, Muhammad ibn Lubb, retained only Barbastro and some small towns nearby. One-by-one these expelled him in favour of the Banu al-Tawil, and by 928 Muhammad only held the small town of Ayera. He was assassinated in 929, bringing an end to the Banu Qasi presence on the Upper March.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 89‚Äì90 With the decline removal of the Banu Qasi, the sons of Muhammad al-Tawil jockeyed for control over several of the coras of the Upper March,Ca√±ada Juste, p. 83 but amidst internecine struggles, rebellions and their own failure to maintain popular support, they were progressively marginalized. Abd al-Malik ibn Muhammad al- Tawil had succeeded his father at Huesca and installed his brother Amrus at Monz√≥n, though the latter soon lost it to the Banu Qasi.de la Granja, pp. 521-522 Abd al-Malik's hold on Huesca was challenged by a series of rebellions by Banu Shabrit cousins, whom he killed, only to himself be killed and supplanted by his brother Amrus in 918.de la Granja, p. 522 However, the Huesca citizenry rejected Amrus in favor of his brother Fortun ibn Muhammad al-Tawil. Amrus fled to Barbastro and Alqu√©zar, and was later offered Lleida by its residents,de la Granja, pp. 522-523 only for them to turn the city over to Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi in 922.Ca√±ada Juste, pp. 89 He was captured by the Banu Tujib in 932, submitted to Abd al-Rahman III, and was killed participating in the Caliph's 934/5 campaign against Zaragoza and its rebel Banu Tujib lords.de la Granja, pp. 523-525 Fortun ibn Muhammad al-Tawil had submitted to Abd al-Rahman at the same time as Amrus, but in 933 he was expelled from Huesca after forming a pact with rebel Muhammad ibn Hasim al- Tujibi and replaced by his brother Yahya ibn Muhammad al-Tawil, and though Fortun went to C√≥rdoba and abased himself before the Caliph, begging to be restored, Abd al-Rahman instead sent an outsider, Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Ilyas of Valencia, and the sons of Fortun and Yahya left the Upper March for C√≥rdoba. However, after Ahmed struggled to retain control against the rebel Banu Tujib, Abd al-Rahman restored Fortun to Huesca in 936/7 against the will of the city's residents.de la Granja, pp. 525-528 When Fortun accompanied the Caliph on a campaign against Le√≥n, he turned control of Huesca over to his brother Musa, who in 940 was formally named as wali of Huesca and Barbastro, though the latter was given to his brother Yahya in 942, to be followed by another brother, Lubb ibn Muhammad in 951, and Lubb's son Yahya in 955.de la Granja, pp. 529-531 In 957/8, the Caliph experimented with power sharing, making Yahya ibn Lubb and Abd al-Malik ibn Musa, who had succeeded his father in Huesca in 954, joint rulers of both Huesca and Barbastro, but he again segregated their control of the two coras in 959.de la Granja, pp. 529, 531 By this time the Banu al-Tawil had long since lost their ability to mount a credible challenge for the control of the Upper March against the new dominant family, the Banu Tujib, and the last of the Banu al-Tawil is seen fighting in a tournament in C√≥rdoba in 974.S√©nac (2000), p. 529, 531 Ascendance of the Banu Tujib The influence of the Umayyad Emirs in all the marches had waned after the death of Abd al-Rahman II, but in 890 the Emir Abd Allah appointed his friend, Abd al-Rahman al-Tujibi, of the Arab Banu Tujib family that had governed Catalayud and Daroca since 872, to be governor of Zaragoza and to have control of the Upper MarchKennedy, pp. 80‚Äì1 They in turn rebelled against Abd ar-Rahman III, and were briefly forced or coerced into alliance with Ramiro II of Le√≥n. C√≥rdoba brought them back into submission, and the Banu Tujib head, Abu Yahya, was captured in the defeat of Caliph's army at the Battle of Simancas in 939. He was released in 941 and restored in Zaragoza by 942, to serve as Cordoba's proxy in campaigns against Ramiro's allies in Pamplona. The Banu Tujib allied themselves in 983 with Almanzor, de facto ruler of C√≥rdoba, but were again deprived and their head killed in 989 when they conspired with his son. However, their power in the region made them irreplaceable and they were again restored. They reached the pinnacle of their power and brought the Upper March to an end in 1018, when after the formal overthrow of the Caliphs of C√≥rdoba, Al-Mundhir ibn Yahya al-Tujibi declared independence, converting what remained of the Upper March into the Taifa of Zaragoza. They would control the taifa for just 21 years before a coup within the family led to their expulsion by the Banu Hud of Lleida, and that family in turn ruled the Zaragoza taifa until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1110. The region was permanently wrested from Muslim control by Alfonso I of Aragon in 1118. The Banu Tujib, who had been granted Calatayud in 872 and Zaragoza in 886, now become the uncontested lords of the Upper March. They in turn rebelled against Abd ar-Rahman III, and were briefly forced or coerced into alliance with Ramiro II of Le√≥n. C√≥rdoba brought them back into submission, and the Banu Tujib head, Abu Yahya, was captured in the defeat of Caliph's army at the Battle of Simancas in 939. He was released in 941 and restored in Zaragoza by 942, to serve as Cordoba's proxy in campaigns against Ramiro's allies in Pamplona. References Cited sources * J.

Overview After completing Visible Man in the late 1970s Gilder began writing \\"The Pursuit of Poverty.\\" In early 1981 Basic Books published the result as Wealth and Poverty. The book was an analysis of the roots of economic growth. Reviewing it within a month of the inauguration of the Reagan administration the New York Times reviewer called it \\"A Guide to Capitalism\\" and wrote that it offered \\"a creed for capitalism worthy of intelligent people.\\" The book was a New York Times bestsellerAdult New York Times Best Seller List for April 12, 1981 and eventually sold over a million copies. In Wealth and Poverty, Gilder extended the sociological and anthropological analysis of his early books in which he had advocated for the socialization of men into service to women through work and marriage. He wove those sociological themes into the economic policy prescriptions of supply- side economics. The breakup of the nuclear family and demand-side economics led to poverty. Family and supply-side policies led to wealth. In reviewing the problems of the immediate past (the inflation, recession, and urban problems of the 1970s) and proposing his supply-side solutions, Gilder did argued not only the practical but also the moral superiority of supply-side capitalism over the alternatives. \\"Capitalism begins with giving,\\" he asserted, but New Deal liberalism created moral hazard. It was work, family, and faith that created wealth out of poverty: \\"It is this supply-side moral vision that underlies all the economic arguments of Wealth and Poverty.\\" In 1994, Gilder asserted that America has no poverty problem, the real problem is the \\"moral decay\\" of the \\"so-called poor,\\" and their real need is \\"Christian teaching from the churches.\\" He called the poor in America \\"the so-called poor,\\" who have been \\"ruined by the overflow of American prosperity,\\" and he asserted that they have more purchasing power than the middle class in Japan in the 1990s: Wealth and Poverty advanced a practical and moral case for supply-side economics and capitalism during the early months of the Reagan administration.

He principally produced light entertainment shows for the BBC's national radio stations, including comedies, quizzes and panel games. He died of natural causes in 1979, aged 29. Radio In a prolific career, as one of three staff producers in the radio comedy department of the BBC at New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, Manchester (alongside comedy veterans James Casey and Mike Craig), he produced a number of well-remembered long running radio shows for the BBC: including Late Night Extra (presented on different occasions by Keith Fordyce, comedian Barry Cryer, John Dunn, and Brian Matthew), Frank Muir Goes Into (starring Frank Muir and Alfred Marks), the topical satire Week Ending (which looked at the funny side of the past week's news, starring David Jason, Bill Wallis and Chris Emmett), and Beat the Record (a phone-in quiz show presented by Don Davis). He also produced the final series of the long running sketch comedy I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again (starring John Cleese, Graeme Garden, David Hatch, Jo Kendall and Bill Oddie), the 1973-74 Series of the panel game Just a Minute presented by Nicholas Parsons, the phone-in quiz Free Spin presented by Alan 'Fluff' Freeman, and Series 3 & 4 of the comedy sketch show Hello Cheeky (starring Barry Cryer, John Junkin and Tim Brooke-Taylor). He devised and produced the long running quiz about comedy, Funny You Should Ask, chaired by the comedy actor Peter Jones. He also produced various Northern comedies, including Chronicles of the Soppy Family and the sitcoms Malcolm, The Spamfritter Man, and Thank You Mrs Fothergill (this last starring Sheila Hancock, Pat Coombs and Avis Bunnage). In addition to his other responsibilities he was a talent spotter, perpetually on the lookout for promising new writers who could be commissioned to write for the shows he produced. One of his successes was in giving Rob Grant and Doug Naylor their first commission to write for radio. Whilst working on a new radio series in 1979, The American Way of Laughs (a guided tour of comedy in the United States), he died unexpectedly of a heart attack aged 29. Comedy writer Ron McDonnell was appointed to take over as producer, pro tem, on those shows already in production; the new project was eventually produced in 1980 by Peter Everett.

It is dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament (). The Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938 and is part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. History The Parish of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo (Freguesia do Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento da Rua do Passo) was established 1718 by the fifth archbishop of Salvador, Sebasti√£o Monteiro da Vide (1643-1722). A royal warrant was issued by Portugal in 1736 to fund the construction of the main chapel, and work began on a new chancel in the following year. Its name is a reference to one of the Stations of the Cross. The annual procession commemorating Christ Carrying the Cross left from the Church and Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to the S√© Cathedral, now demolished. Location The Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo sits on a hill above a long, broad staircase between two streets, Rua do Passo and Ladeira do Carmo. The church is now surrounded by numerous sobrados, or city homes of the Portuguese colonial period. Structure The Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo has a monumental fa√ßade, with two tall towers crowned by pyramids and a center with a large frontispiece, emphasize the verticality and monumentality of the church. The church has an underground with an ossuary, a ground floor with a main chapel and sacristy, and an upper floor with tribune and choir. =Staircase= The staircase that leads to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament is a separate monument and does not belong to the church itself. It was built at a 50 degree angle from street level at Ladeira do Carmo up to Rua do Passo. The staircase represents a \\"path of penitence\\". =Exterior= The fa√ßade of the church is covered of brick and stone masonry. =Interior= The floor plan of Church of the Blessed Sacrament is typical of eighteenth century Bahian church architecture. It features lateral corridors superposed by tribunes and sacristy. The sacristy provides access to the ossuary in the lower level. The interior of the church is in the Neoclassical style, common in Brazil in the 18th century. Paintings on the ceiling of the nave are attributed to Ant√≥nio Dias Ant√≥nio Pinto. Renovation Significant renovation and expansion of the church was conducted between 1820 and 1890. Repairs were made to the south tower and a cornice; running verandas were constructed along the nave. Renovations to the nave included the restoration of a fallen panel, remodeling of the retable of the high altar, the construction of additional altars, and the installation of azulejos. The church again fell into significant disrepair in the 20th century. It was closed and remains under repair by the federal government. Protected status The Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. It is listed in the Book of Historical Works process no. 122-T, inscription no. 127; and the Book of Fine Arts, Inscription fls 23. Both directives are dated June 17, 1938. In film & television O Pagador de Promessas, a 1962 drama film by Anselmo Duarte, was filmed on the staircase of the church. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival.

Unlike Candida infections of the mouth and throat (oral candidiasis) or vagina (Candidal vulvovaginitis), invasive candidiasis is a serious, progressive, and potentially fatal infection that can affect the blood (fungemia), heart, brain, eyes, bones, and other parts of the body.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of invasive candidiasis can be confused with other medical conditions, however, the most common symptoms are fever and chills that do not improve with antibiotic treatment. Other symptoms develop as the infection spreads, depending on which parts of the body are involved. = Presentation = Invasive candidiasis can manifest as serious diseases including as fungemia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, and central nervous system infections.  Cause  Invasive candidiasis is caused by 15 of the more than 150 known species of Candida. These species, all confirmed by isolation from patients, are: C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae, C. dubliniensis, C. pelliculosa, C. kefyr, C. lipolytica, C. famata, C. inconspicua, C. rugosa, and C. norvegensis. Over the last 20‚Äì30 years, C. albicans has been responsible for 95% of infections, with, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei causing the majority of the remaining cases. Recently, C. auris, a species first reported in 2009, has been found to cause invasive candidiasis. C. auris has attracted attention because it can be resistant to the antifungal medications used to treat candidiasis. =Resistance = Resistance to antifungal treatment can arise from species with intrinsic resistance that experience selection pressure or spontaneous induction of resistance in isolates from normally susceptible species. For Candida, the most common is the former, as seen by the emergence of resistant C. glabrata following the introduction of fluconazole and of C. parapsilosis where there was increased use of echinocandins. Insufficient dosing of azoles has also led to the emergence of resistance. Observed rates of echinocandin resistance for C. glabrata are between 2 and 12%. Acquired echinocandin resistance has also been reported for C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. kefyr, C. lusitaniae, and C. dubliniensis. = Emergent species = Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast that can cause invasive candidiasis and is associated with high mortality. It was first described in 2009. Since then, C. auris infections, specifically fungemia, have been reported from South Korea, India, South Africa, Kuwait, Colombia, Venezuela, Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The strains isolated in each region are genetically distinct, indicating that this species is emerging in different locations. The reason for this pattern is unknown.  Risk factors  Patients with the following conditions, treatments or situations are at increased risk for invasive candidiasis. * Critical illness * Long-term intensive care unit stay * Abdominal surgery (aggravated by anastomotic leakage or repeat laparotomies) * Immunosuppressive diseases * Acute necrotizing pancreatitis * Malignant hematologic disease * Solid-organ transplantation * Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation * Solid-organ tumors * Neonates (especially low birth weight and preterm infants) * Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment * Central venous catheter * Internal prosthetic device * Total parenteral nutrition * Hemodialysis * Glucocorticoid use * Chemotherapy * Noninvasive Candida colonization (particularly if multifocal) = Transmission = Invasive candidiasis is a nosocomial infection with the majority of cases associated with hospital stays.  Diagnosis  Because many Candida species are part of the human microbiota, their presence in the mouth, the vagina, sputum, urine, stool, or skin is not definitive evidence for invasive candidiasis. Positive culture of Candida species from normally sterile sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pericardium, pericardial fluid, or biopsied tissue, is definitive evidence of invasive candidiasis. Diagnosis by culturing allows subsequent susceptibility testing of causative species. Sensitivity of blood culture is far from ideal, with a sensitivity reported to be between 21 and 71%. Additionally, whereas blood culture can establish a diagnosis during fungemia, the blood may test negative for deep- seated infections because candida may have been successfully cleared from the blood. Diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is supported by histopathologic evidence (for example, yeast cells or hyphae) observed in specimens of affected tissues. Additionally, elevated serum Œ≤-glucan can demonstrate invasive candidiasis while a negative test suggests a low likelihood of systemic infection. The emergence of multidrug-resistant C. auris as a cause of invasive candidiasis has necessitated additional testing in some settings. C. auris-caused invasive candidiasis is associated with high mortality. Many C. auris isolates have been found to be resistant to one or more of the three major antifungal classes (azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes) with some resistant to all three classes ‚Äì severely limiting treatment options. Biochemical-based tests currently used in many laboratories to identify fungi, including API 20C AUX and VITEK-2, cannot differentiate C. auris from related species (for example, C. auris can be identified as C. haemulonii). Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using a diagnostic method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry or a molecular method based on sequencing the D1-D2 region of the 28s rDNA to identify C. auris in settings where it may be present.  Prevention  Preventive antifungal treatment is supported by studies, but only for specific high-risk groups in intensive care units with conditions that put them at high risk for the disease. For example, one group would be patients recovering from abdominal surgery that may have gastrointestinal perforations or anastomotic leakage. Antifungal prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of fungemia by approximately 50%, but has not been shown to improve survival. A major challenge limiting the number of patients receiving prophylaxis to only those that can potentially benefit, thereby avoiding the creation of selective pressure that can lead to the emergence of resistance.  Treatment  Antifungals are used for treatment with the specific type and dose depending on the patient's age, immune status, and specifics of the infection. For most adults, the initial treatment is an echinocandin class antifungal (caspofungin, micafungin, or anidulafungin) given intravenously. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungals may also be used. Treatment normally continues for two weeks after resolution of signs and symptoms and Candida yeasts can no longer can be cultured from blood samples. Some forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period. Retrospective observational studies suggest that prompt presumptive antifungal therapy (based on symptoms or biomarkers) is effective and can reduce mortality.  Epidemiology  Invasive candidiasis is estimated to affect more than 250,000 people and cause more than 50,000 deaths worldwide every year. The CDC estimates that approximately 46,000 cases of healthcare-associated invasive candidiasis occur each year in the US. The estimated mortality attributable to fungemia is 19-40%. However, because the majority of people who develop invasive candidiasis are already sick, it can be difficult to determine if the cause of death is directly attributable to the fungal infection. Fungemia is one of the most common bloodstream infections in the United States. In general, observed incidence rates have been stable or trending higher but declining rates have been achieved with improvements in hygiene and disease management. Deep-seated infections in bones, muscles, joints, eyes, or central nervous system can arise from a bloodstream infection or direct inoculation of Candida may occur, for example, during intestinal surgery. The distribution of Candida species causing invasive candidiasis has changed over the past decades. C. albicans had been the dominant pathogen but now accounts for just half of the isolates. Increasing dominance of C. glabrata in northern Europe, the United States, and Canada has been observed while C. parapsilosis has become more prominent in southern Europe, Asia, and South America. Regional species distribution guides treatment recommendations since the species exhibit different susceptibilities to azole and echinocandin classes of antifungals. The virulence of Candida species differs considerably, with C. parapsilosis and C. krusei being less virulent than C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata. This variation is reflected in mortality rates.  References   Further reading  * (Review). * (Review).

Established in 1993 in Cologne, Germany, the company has been headquartered in Berlin since the year 2000. The mc Group is Germany's largest communication agency and the third-largest German advertising agency. It is one of the key players in the industry, currently ranking 13th worldwide, 2nd in Europe and 1st in the GCC/Middle East. The mc Group pursues an integrated communication approach, offering a comprehensive service portfolio in a variety of fields. The group of companies includes over 80 agencies on all continents. The mc Group is the only agency worldwide to be present in all 28 member states of the European Union. Clients come from the worlds of business (e.g. Generali, Lidl), media (e.g. RTL, CNN), politics (e.g. the European Union, the ASEAN, many national governments including Germany, Brazil, France or China) and sports clubs/associations (e.g. football, Formula 1, tennis, golf and the Olympic Games).  History  = Beginnings in sports and business = In 1993, Harald Zulauf established Media Consulta in Cologne after previously working as a journalist and a PR consultant. \\"Media Consulta Deutschland GmbH\\" was listed in the Commercial Register on September 17 of the same year. As sports became an increasingly vital sector for the advertising industry, sports marketing developed into a key area of focus for Media Consulta. Example of this include the communication management of major tennis tournaments, including the ATP World Tour, Davis Cup and Fed Cup as well as projects for Formula One. The company also placed electrical appliance manufacturer Braun in the global spotlight during the 1998 FIFA World Cup. = Campaigns for politics = By the end of the 1990s, Media Consulta had established itself as one of Germany's leading communication service providers, measured in terms of revenue. In 1998, the German Bundestag became Media Consulta's first political client. In 1999, Media Consulta signed a million-Euro campaign from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry and the United Nations to enhance the country's image in Germany. Political communication increasingly became the focus of the agency, along with public relations for large international companies and top industry associations. Following the move of the German Bundestag from Bonn to Berlin, Media Consulta established a base in Germany's capital. It set up its office in a historically-preserved former shoe factory at K√∂llnischer Park in Berlin's first and most central \\"Mitte\\" district, whilst at the same time continuing to expand its Cologne location. = Internationalization = After the turn of the millennium, \\"Media Consulta\\" became the \\"mc Group\\", expanded into other member states of the European Union and subsequently received dedicated budgets from the European Commission. For example, mc Group launched the \\"Feel Free to Say No\\" anti-smoking campaign for the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety. In the years to follow, the group built a network of specialized agencies, including traditional advertising, film and television production, launching its first offices outside of the EU, in New York City and Moscow in 2005. Additional offices followed in Brazil, China and India. Reflecting the group's international focus, \\"Media Consulta International Holding AG\\" was established in 2006, which is as a holding company for the corporate group. In its home market Germany and Europe, the mc Group also enlisted additional key clients, e.g. the German Office of the Federal President and the Lidl discount supermarket chain in Germany and Spain. = Market leadership = By 2008, mc Group ranked among the leading service providers in the area of public relations on an international scale. For several years, the company was the second largest communication agency in Germany, after Ketchum Pleon. In 2011, mc Group overtook the competition for the first time and has successfully defended its market leadership to this day. On a European and global scale, mc Group became one of the key players in communication and advertising industry. The largest campaigns of recent years include communication for the \\"Deutschlandjahr 2013/2014\\" in Brazil, along with the international \\"Make it in Germany\\" campaign launched by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Labor. The mc Group was also involved in a project for the Berlin Brandenburg Airport.  Structure  = Legal and management = The corporate holding of the mc Group is \\"Media Consulta International Holding AG\\", involving a joint- stock company under German law. The purpose of the company, according to its statutes, is \\"international communication work for industry, media, politics and sports\\", along with all related business activities. The company is capitalized at some two million Euros. Whilst not all companies in the mc Group are included in the annual financial statements of the holding company, there is a VAT group with the holding.

He is commemorated in the Orthodox Church. He lived between the 9th and the 10th century. His feast day is on 28 July.\\"Venerable Paul the Founder of the Xeropotamou Monastery On Mt Athos\\", Orthodox Church in America  Life  The Monk Paul of Xeropotamou, born Procopius, allegedly was the son of a Byzantine Emperor which some sources name as Michael I Rangabe. Having received a brilliant education, Procopius was one of the most learned people of his time. His works on the Presentation of Mary, the canon of the Forty Martyrs, the canon of the Holy Cross and other works earned him well-deserved fame. But scholarship and an honourable position in the world did not entice Procopius. There are scholars who describe St. Paul as a eunuch. This is supported by the historical account that described how Michael I and his family were allowed to live in monasteries after his sons were castrated once he abdicated in favor of Leon V the Armenian. =Xeropotamou Monastery= Leaving everything worldly, replacing his rich clothes with beggar's rags, he went to Mount Athos, the Holy Mountain. In the place called Xeropotamou (, dry river), he built himself a cell in the ruins of a monastery once founded by the empress Pulcheria in honour of the Forty Martyrs. Procopius was tonsured monk by a hermit named Cosmas and he took the name Paul. Out of humility, the monk did not reveal his erudition to anyone. Through his strict life, Paul quickly became famous throughout the Holy Mountain. He became known as Paul of Xeropotamou, and the monastery where he worked is still called Xeropotamou to this day. When the Emperor Romanos, a relative of St. Paul, took the throne, he urged the saint to come to Constantinople through the Protos of the Holy Mountain and arranged a magnificent meeting for him. The humble Paul, not betraying his monastic duty, appeared among the courtly splendour and magnificence with a cross and in his tattered rason. Saint Paul reaffirmed that his glory was chosen by God by laying his hands on the Emperor Romanos who had been seriously ill, and miraculously healing him. But the allures of court life, promised by the grateful emperor, did not deceive the saint, and he returned to the Holy Mountain, having asked the emperor only one favour - to restore the Xeropotamou monastery. Upon the restoration of the monastery, at the consecration of its cathedral, a portion of the True Cross was set on the holy altar, a gift from the Emperor Romanos to St. Paul. =Agiou Pavlou monastery= Soon the Xeropotamou monastery was filled with a multitude of monks who wanted to come under the obedience of the holy ascetic, but the monk Paul, having entrusted the direction of the monastery to one of the fathers, retired to a remote hermitage. His strict silence was again broken by the disciples who did not want to leave their elder. Around 980, the Monk asked the emperor for a new monastery. This was the foundation of Saint George‚Äôs monastery named after Saint George, later renamed after the saint himself as St. Paul's monastery.\\"The Holy Monastery of Agiou Pavlou (St Paul)\\", Pemptousia, November 5, 2011 The first rector of the new monastery was the venerable Paul himself, who also brought particles of the True Cross to this new monastery. The saint who had been informed in advance of his death, called to himself the fathers of Xeropotamou and the new St. George's monastery and gave them their last instruction. On the day of his death, St. Paul put on his mantle, read the prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great, which he constantly said: \\"My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my protection is the Holy Spirit: O Holy Trinity, glory to Thee,\\" and communed of the Holy Mysteries of Christ. St. Paul was the leading figure of the group of hermits at Mount Athos and he mobilized these ascetics to counter organized monasticism. Particularly, he was the primary opponent of Athanasius and his monastic proposals, accusing him of bringing worldly ways at Athos while also highlighting his exploitation of the hermits. St. Paul had instructed that his body should be buried on the peninsula of Longos opposite the Holy Mountain. However, by the will of God, the waves pushed the ship all the way to the shores of Constantinople, where the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople reverently accepted the body of the saint and solemnly laid him in the Hagia Sophia. After the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders, the relics of St. Paul were transferred to Venice.

At the time, the database, called \\"A Multimedia Dictionary of Yoruba Names\\" only had about 1000 names curated on a compact disk, with meaning and pronunciation. In January, 2015, over $5000 was raised via a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaignIndiegogo Funding Page to support a larger effort to document all the names of Yoruba people in Nigeria and all over the world. As at January 2018, there are 6019 names in the dictionary. Aims and description The Yoruba Names Project is set up to help document the Yoruba language first through all the names borne by its people, and later through an online dictionary. It is part of a larger effort to help document the African cultural experience on the internet by making them easy to write and access via information technology. The project also aims to bring together a community of interested linguists and other culture enthusiasts to help facilitate the use of the these languages on the internet through the creation of relevant tools and applications. The first effort at YorubaName.com is a crowdsourced database for Yoruba names everywhere (in Nigeria and elsewhere on the globe) where individuals and users are able to submit their name on the website or use the current database to search for meanings of other specific names.

Cheever (September 7, 1852 ‚Äì May 2, 1900) was an American businessman and inventor. Associated with Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, he improved their inventions. He patented 100 of these improvements, most related to the telephone. Cheever formed the Telephone Company of New York and constructed the first telephone line in New York City. He was disabled early in his life and was an invalid.  Early life  Cheever was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 7, 1852. His parents moved to New York when he was around five years old. His father was J. H. Cheever.  Mid life  Cheever was paralyzed from his waist down at an early age. As an adult he weighed only and had to be carried around by an assistant. In spite of his handicap he became a successful businessman and entrepreneur. He was a successful inventor of many items run by electricity and was able to turn them into business enterprises. He patented electric rock drills, electrical improvements to elevators, telephone appliances and electric fire engines. Of his 100 patents most were telephone improvements. Cheever was also intrigued with Edison's phonograph. He helped form the North American Phonograph Company and organized firms throughout the United States to promote Edison's advanced commercial version of it. Cheever became acquainted with Bell when his invention of the telephone was in its infancy and considered nothing but a novelty item. He was intrigued with it. Cheever went about figuring out how Bell's invention could be useful and beneficial. He constructed the first telephone line in New York City and was its owner. That connection showed potential of greater uses for the telephone. Cheever then experimented with a line from his office in the Tribune Building with one to the American Institute Fair to demonstrate commercial usage. He showed the quality of the sound traveling on telephone lines to be good by demonstrating the playing of the band at the Fair reproduced at his office.

Regular passenger and goods traffic commenced in autumn 1899. Initially, there were 2 depots, 14 stations, 15 locomotives, 58 passenger carriages of various types, 6 postal carriages as well as 112 covered and 154 open goods waggons. In 1903 approximately 65,000 tons of goods and 40,632 passengers were transported. Panevƒó≈æys became a regional centre during Lithuania's independence (1920-1938), and thus a lot of raw materials such as coal, oil, sand, salt and fertilizer were transported as well as agricultural produce such as flax, bacon, sugar, grain, flour and timber.Auk≈°taitijos siaurasis gele≈æinkelis: History.

The railway was operated by the governmental Lithuanian railway Lietuvos Gele≈æinkeliai after World War II. Traffic declined in the second half of the 20th century.

The narrow gauge railway was added to the list of immovable cultural objects of the Republic of Lithuania in 1996 and was given the status of cultural heritage object. Subsequently, tourist train services began. The goods traffic was phased-out in 1999. A new department for Narrow Gauge Railways was created on 1 November 1999 within the governmental railways office Lietuvos Gele≈æinkeliai. Even so, the passenger traffic ceased temporarily in 2001. With effect from 2006 tourist trains were run with –¢–£2 diesel locomotives and these were well received with increasing passenger numbers.  Cultural heritage  The railway stations along the narrow gauge railway track are important historic and cultural structures and are important regarding the urban and architectural development of the region.

Kakhaber, as the first Gurieli, was identified by the Georgian historian Dimitri Bakradze based on a now-lost icon inscription from 1352, which credited him, along with his wife Anna, with building the Likhauri Church in Guria. Thus, at that time, Guria appears to have been a fief of the secundogeniture of the Dadiani. Kakhaber is also mentioned as eristavi of the Svans, whence the Vardanisdze, forefathers of the Dadiani-Gurieli dynasts, stemmed. Kakhaber can be the unnamed Vardanisdze of Prince Vakhushti's chronicle, who was deprived of his Svan lands by King Bagrat V of Georgia and recompensed with Guria after the Svans had attacked and burned down the royal city of Kutaisi in 1361. It is also possible that Kakhaber is the \\"archon\\" of Guria, whom the contemporaneous Trapezuntine chronicler Michael Panaretos witnessed, on 6 August 1372, offering a proskynesis to his royal suzerain during the meeting of Alexios III of Trebizond with Bagrat V of Georgia at the Black Sea town of Batumi.

His family were from Bantva, Gujarat, where they owned a tea venture and several properties. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, they left behind their businesses and migrated to Pakistan. He enjoys cricket and is a noted philanthropist, serving as a trustee of organisations such as Fatimid Foundation and Memon Health and Education Foundation, and as director of the Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy and Karachi Education Initiative. Business career In 1970, at the young age of 17, Habib began his career as a stockbroker at the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), hired by his elder brother who bought a trading license. His monthly salary was 60 rupees. He spent his days in the trading hall analysing shares and statements for investors, which he credits as having contributed to his knowledge of stocks. In 1992, Habib was voted president of the KSE and he computerised the stock trading system. He was elected president of the KSE five more times. His reforms accelerated trade and he expanded his business. In 2000, he founded Pakistan's second asset management company which currently manages over $430 million (Rs. 49 billion). With Pakistan's state-owned companies undergoing a process of privatisation at that time, Habib bought stakes in fertiliser, cement and steel production, as well as banking. Since 2004, his business has invested over $2 billion into these various sectors. In 2008, regulatory curbs on stock trading as a result of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 resulted in Habib's stock clients defaulting, as the KSE 100 Index fell by 48% within two months.

It is in the Amazon biome. The ecoregion is relatively intact, largely protected by conservation units or indigenous territories, and less threatened by global warming than flatter and more deforested regions. Location The Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests ecoregion is in the south of Venezuela and the north of the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Roraima. It surrounds sections of the Guayanan Highlands moist forests, which in turn surround areas of tepui. It includes or adjoins patches of Rio Negro campinarana. To the north the ecoregion adjoins the Llanos, and to the east it adjoins the Guianan moist forests and the Guianan savanna. To the southeast it adjoins the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests, and to the south and southwest it adjoins the Negro-Branco moist forests. Ecology The Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Temperatures are relatively steady throughout the year, slightly cooler in July‚ÄìSeptember and slightly warmer in April‚ÄìMay. Yearly average temperatures range from a minimum of to a maximum of , with a mean of . Average annual rainfall is about . Monthly rainfall varies from in January to in July. =Flora= As of 2005 the Brazilian portion of the ecoregion preserved 73.4% of its original vegetation. The tree Albizia glabripetala, a riverside species high, is found in the ecoregion. The liana Machaerium madeirense, found at elevations between , grows in the forests. =Fauna= Endangered mammals include black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), Fernandez's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina fernandezi) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is invasive. Status As of 2012 the ecoregion had not been heavily exploited by humans, and various approaches to conservation were being followed. As of 2009 , or 78.1%, was protected to some extent. A 2014 WWF report stated that protected areas covered 26% and indigenous territories covered 47%, for a total of 73%.

It was recognized by UNESCO as a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2013, and is the country's only geopark. Location The volcanic park is located in Manisa Province in western Turkey, covering an area of nearly mainly in Kula district, and stretches in the north into parts of Salihli district. The elevation of the area rises from in Salihli to in Kula. History The volcanic field was first described by the Ancient Greek geographer Strabo (64 or 63 BC ‚Äì c. 24 AD) in the encyclopedia Geographica, calling it Katakekaumene. The American Journal of Science, Volume 38 (Kline Geology Laboratory, Yale University., 1840 ) p207. The name means \\"burnt land\\" or \\"burnt country\\", and refers to the pitch-black color of the lava in the dormant volcanic field Kula. The volcanic field attracted many travelers and researchers, including G. Kappel (1830), W.J. Hamilton and H.E. Strickland (1841), C. Texier, Bresh and A. von Premerstein (1891), H.S. Washington (1900) and A. Philippson (1914). Geopark In November 2011, an application was made to the European Geoparks Network and UNESCO. Kula Geopark became Turkey's first geopark candidate of European Geoparks Network and UNESCO in March 2013. In September 2013, it was accepted as the country's first and only geopark by the European and the UNESCO-assisted Global Geoparks Network. In June 2013, the geopark was opened to tourism after construction of facilities including walkways and a visitor center. The more than long trails equipped with information panels connect the most interesting geosites in the geopark. The visitor center is an information center for tourists and a natural history museum for education in geology. Geology The geological structure of the geopark is of a complex nature and is caused by the active tectonics of the Aegean region. It is one of the geologically youngest volcanic fields in Turkey. Three phases of eruption took place in the volcanism of the Quaternary period, some 1.1 million, 300 thousand and 15 thousand years ago. =Cones and craters= A scoria cone in Kula Geopark There are 80 scoria cones and five maars in the geopark. The height of the small-sized scoria cones does not exceed . =Lava caves and lava tubes= Lava tubes or caves were formed by lava flow along its way. Lava tubes are formed when an active low-viscosity lava flow solidifies and forms a hard crust roof above the still-flowing lava stream. While some lava caves are easily accessible, others can be entered only with specialized caving equipment. =Basalt columns= Characteristic basalt columns, called \\"Burgaz volcanics\\" (tower volcanics) are formed in the first stage of lava flow. When thick lava flow cools rapidly, contraction forces build up. While shrinking in the vertical direction does not form fractures, a network of fractures formed by horizontal shrinkage develop basalt columns. Basalt columns in the villages Sarnƒ±√ß and √áakƒ±rca are higher than . =Hoodoos= Hoodoos in Kula Geopark There are hoodoos situated on the ƒ∞zmir-Ankara state highway D300/E96 near Yurtba≈üƒ± village. They are formed when relatively soft rock is topped by harder stone; the softer rock is washed away by atmospheric factors, leaving a capping of the harder material which is more resistant to erosion. The formation process is ongoing, and while some hoodoos fall down, new ones are being formed. =Prehistoric footprints= In 1954, during road construction works near the √áakallar Volcanic Cone, more than 200 fossilized footprints were unearthed. Only a few of these footprints remain on the scene. It is considered that the footprints belong to three people walking on a slope. The age analyses indicate that the footprints are 10,000‚Äì12,000 years old corresponding to the Mesolithic Anatolia. These traces, which bear witness to one of the oldest interactions of human and active volcanoes in Anatolia are very important for scientific and educational reasons.

He was the first ruler of Guria styled as Gurieli, after whom the Dukes and then, Princes of Guria formed one continuous dynasty down to the Russian annexation of 1829. Mamia was a younger son of Liparit I Dadiani (died 1470), eristavi of Odishi (Mingrelia), and brother to Liparit's successor Shamadavle Dadiani. He is first mentioned in a charter of King George VIII of Georgia dated to 1460. Mamia was in possession of Guria, which had been a fief of the secundogeniture of the Dadiani since around 1352. By the 1450s, Georgia was embroiled in a series of internecine conflicts which ultimately led to the division of the Kingdom of Georgia. The civil war subsided, but only briefly, by 1460, when the Italian envoy Ludovico da Bologna attempted an intercession between the Georgian dynasts to enable their participation in the proposed crusade of Pope Pius II against the Ottoman menace. Among the Eastern Christian princes ready to take up arms, the contemporary Western European documents mention Mamia as a marquis of Guria: \\"Mania, marchio Goriae\\". Mamia may have been the Georgian ruler who defeated the Burgundians at Batumi and imprisoned their leader, Geoffroy de Thoisy, in 1445. Thoisy was only released through the good services of the Trapezuntine emperor John IV Megas Komnenos. The Gurieli, whose lordship lay between the Trapezuntine theme of Lazia and Mingrelia, had close ties with the Komnenoi. David Komnenos sent his wife, Helena, to Mamia for safety just before the Ottoman military advanced to Trebizond in 1461. The chronicle by Laonikos Chalkokondyles suggests that Mamia may have been related by marriage in some otherwise unrecorded way to the Trapezuntine Komnenoi. According to the historian Cyril Toumanoff, this means that Mamia was married to a daughter of David of Trebizond.

Bateman (n√©e Powell, born 1979) is a British feminist economist and academic, specialising in economic history. She is a fellow in economics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. She is Director of Studies for the Economics Tripos at Gonville and Caius College. Brought up in Lees, Oldham, Victoria Bateman attended Saddleworth School, Uppermill. She then studied for A-levels at Oldham Sixth Form College where she was President of the Student Union. She read economics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and went on to receive masters and doctoral degrees from the University of Oxford. Her research focuses on economic history, including the role of markets in economic development, and the role of women's rights and freedoms in stimulating economic growth. She is well known for her public protests against Brexit and in favour of women's rights, occasionally appearing naked.  Early life  Bateman grew up with two younger sisters in Lees, Oldham. Her father worked in the sheet metal industry, installing ductwork; her mother worked for the same company in the payroll department. When both parents lost their jobs, her father started a new business of his own, which foundered when clients were unable to pay. Her mother worked several jobs, and the family struggled to pay its debts. Bateman's parents divorced when she was 14 years old, and their economic straits worsened. Her sisters dropped out of school, and one became pregnant as a teenager. Bateman attributes her interest in economics to witnessing first-hand the effects of the boom-bust cycle and economic disparity. With the encouragement of her father and a history teacher, she studied economics at Cambridge as an undergraduate, followed by master's degrees in economics and economic history and a doctoral degree in economics at Oxford.  Research  Bateman's academic research focuses on economic history. Her 2019 book The Sex Factor: How Women Made the West Rich argues that women's rights and freedoms were a key factor enabling the industrial and economic development of the West, by boosting wages, skills, saving and entrepreneurial spirit, and helping to produce a democratic and capable state. Her earlier work focused on the role of markets in economic development in Europe. Her paper The evolution of markets in early modern Europe, 1350‚Äì1800: a study of wheat prices uses data on European wheat prices to study trends in market development from the early medieval period to the industrial revolution, demonstrating that markets were as well-integrated across Europe in the early 16th century as they were in the late 19th century. Her book Markets and growth in early modern Europe builds on this research, examining several aspects of the relationship between market integration and economic development. Feminism and protest Bateman identifies as a feminist, and writes: \\"I believe passionately in freedom for women, and whilst many battles have been won in the past century, there is still a long way for society to move until women enjoy the levels of freedom that they should be able to. I am not afraid to use my body as well as my brain to deliver important messages.\\" In 2014, Bateman commissioned and posed nude for a life-size portrait by Anthony Connolly, which subsequently appeared in the Mall Galleries. Bateman said that the purpose of the painting was to ask questions about the sexualisation of women in modern society. In June 2018, Bateman attended the Gonville and Caius College end of term supervisor dinner wearing a see through body suit, with the words \\"my body my choice\\" written on her body. Bateman is an advocate of the recognition by economists of the economic value of the sex trade and the right of women to earn their living by prostitution. In July 2018, Bateman posted a video on Twitter in which she appeared naked and discussed inequality in economics.  Brexit and protest  Bateman is a frequent critic of Brexit, arguing that \\"Brexit leaves Britain naked\\", and that leaving the EU would hurt low-income families, damage British scientific research, would reduce trade and investment, and would place freedom for the nation state ahead of freedom for the individual. In 2016, Bateman attended a Cambridge University Faculty of Economics meeting naked, as a protest against Brexit. She had the words \\"Brexit leaves Britain naked\\" written across her torso. On 14 January 2019, Bateman delivered an hour-long lecture against Brexit at the Cambridge Junction while naked, then asked the audience to sign her body as a petition. She was subsequently invited to appear on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, in which she also stripped naked. This led to a naked appearance on Good Morning Britain, although her body was pixelated before broadcast.  Media  Bateman has written regular economics commentary for Unherd, Bloomberg View and CapX, has contributed articles to The Guardian, Times Higher Education, The Conversation and The Telegraph and has appeared on a number of BBC Radio 4 programmes.  Personal life  Bateman is married to James Bateman, who works for an asset management company. They met at Cambridge University. Books * *Bateman, Victoria (2016).

It was established by Ralph Fremlin in 1861, who eschewed the pub trade and focused on bottled beer, on religious grounds. The beer was known for the distinctive elephant logo on the bottles. The brewery expanded to become the largest in Kent, before going into decline after being purchased by Whitbread in 1967. History =Expansion= The original brewery was founded on Earl Street, Maidstone, around 1790. It was bought by Ralph Fremlin in 1861, who rebuilt the premises, and expanded the production plant along the street, taking over a pub further down which was demolished. As well as being in charge of production, Fremlin managed all engineering and accounts. He did not approve of public houses and sold the ten premises associated with the brewery at that point. Instead, he produced bottled beer for the home trade, believing it could be consumed in moderation more easily, delivering bottles door-to-door via horse and cart. The beer was a success, and Fremlin's expanded to produce lager and \\"National Temperance Ale\\", along with establishing a London branch on Buckingham Palace Road by 1894. Fremlin's was the first British brewery to mass-produce beer in bottles and jars, which became a key factor in their growth. A devout Christian, Fremlin ran bible classes for the brewery's employees, funded local churches, and was chairman of the local school board. He did not supply beer to pubs as he felt the typical Victorian beerhouse was ethically wrong. The company logo was an elephant standing on top of the family's coat of arms, which appeared on bottles and glasses. It was used because of the Fremlin's association with the East India Company. Fremlin's Faversham brewery, now a Tesco Following Ralph Fremlin's death in 1910, the brewery was briefly run by his brother Richard until his death five years later. After World War I, it was necessary to revisit company policy, so a private limited company, Fremlin Bros Ltd was formed in 1920. The company reverted to the pub trade, buying up smaller breweries around Kent, and the Harris Browne Brewery in Barnet and Adams Brewery in Halstead, Essex. Fremlin's had become Kent's largest brewery by the mid-20th century, having acquired around 800 pubs and other licensed premises. In 1949, the company bought out George Beer & Rigden in Faversham, along with its production plant. It closed in 1954, with all brewing taking place in Maidstone, but reopened in 1961 to meet demand. In 1960, Fremlin's bought Frederick Leney & Sons of Wateringbury, taking over their brewery and 189 pubs. =Decline= In 1967, Fremlin's were bought out by Whitbread, who closed the Maidstone premises to brewing on 15 September 1972. It remained in use as a depot in the 1970s, before closing entirely. In 1978, much of the brewery's infrastructure connecting it to the River Medway was demolished in order to construct St Peter's Bridge and the A229 diversion around Maidstone town centre. The remainder of the Earl Street brewery was demolished in 1980. The Earl Street site is now part of Fremlin Walk, a shopping centre. The Faversham plant remained open for some years afterwards, producing Whitbread Trophy beer. It closed in 1990. A Tesco store now occupies the site. The Wateringbury site closed down in 1981, but later reopened as a distribution centre for Whitbread. Hodfellow and the origin of Gremlins Carol Rose, in her book Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins: An Encyclopedia, attributes the origin of the Gremlin of English folklore (malicious creatures said to be responsible for sabotaging aircraft) to a combination of the name of Grimm's Fairy Tales and the folklore surrounding Fremlin's beer; a favourite beverage of local Royal Air Force mechanics and pilots. Beginning as early as 1865, Fremlin‚Äôs Brewery company tradition included the fabled existence of an unseen, ambivalent house spirit named Robin Hodfellow or H√∂dfellow; the name being a probable conflation of the woodland sprite Robin Goodfellow and the popular legend of the kobold H√∂dekin as recorded by folklorist Thomas Keightley. Hodfellow was said to be a biersal, a type of koboldAnother candidate for classification would be the clurichaun of Irish folklore; (a sprite stemming from Germanic mythology and surviving into modern times in German folklore) that inhabits breweries and beer cellars. Hodfellow was said to ride a miniature elephant (or sometimes was himself a miniature elephant) and kept the brewery machinery in working order when he was paid his due (in beer) and alternatively wrought havoc in the machinery works when not remunerated appropriately. Brewery workers and even publicans were said to leave small jars or dishes of beer out to appease Hodfellow, a tradition that survived at least into the late 20th century in some Maidstone and Canterbury pubs.Homer, Johnny. Brewing in Kent. Gloucestershire, Amberlley Publishing, 2016 . Author Roald Dahl is credited with getting the gremlins known outside the Royal Air Force.Donald, Graeme. Sticklers, Sideburns & Bikinis: The Military Origins of Everyday Words and Phrases. Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing, 2008. . He would have been familiar with the brewery and the myth, having lived in Kent with his family for ten years from the age of 13 before writing his first children's novel, The Gremlins, in which \\"Gremlins\\" were tiny men who lived on RAF fighters and regularly caused damage that could not otherwise be explained.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the division entered combat during the fall of that year, fighting in operations attempting to break the Siege of Leningrad. The division fought in the same area until the relief of Leningrad in February 1944, when it began advancing into the Baltic states. The division served in the Baltic states until October, when it transferred south to Poland, where it fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive and Silesian Offensives in early 1945. The division was disbanded soon after the end of the war in the summer of 1945.  History  The 285th began forming on 2 July 1941 at Kostroma, part of the Moscow Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 1013th, 1015th, and 1017th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 835th Artillery Regiment. While still forming in early September, the 285th was assigned to the 54th Army, also forming to the east of Leningrad. The division was transferred to the 4th Army for its first combat in the Tikhvin Defensive and Tikhvin Offensive operations between October and December. By the beginning of 1942 the 285th had been transferred back to the 54th Army, which became part of the Volkhov Front, holding positions on the Volkhov River to the east and southeast of Leningrad. In February 1944, the front was disbanded after the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive ended the Siege of Leningrad, and the 54th Army became part of the Leningrad Front.

One of the first ballerinas to study in the Tallinn Ballet School, she helped establish the art of ballet in the country. She was honored with numerous awards throughout her career and is remembered for establishing the careers of many Estonian ballet dancers. Early life Helmi Puur was born on 20 December 1933 in Tallinn, Estonia. Her father was a factory worker and the family of three children lived in difficult circumstances, in a basement apartment on Koplis street. She enrolled in the children's ballet studio at the Estonia Theatre in 1944 and then in 1946 when the Tallinn Ballet School was founded, became one of the first class of students. She completed her training with two years of study under the tutelage of Elena Shiripina (ru) at the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet, graduating in 1953. Career Arriving back in Estonia, Puur debuted with Vladimir Bourmeister's staging of Swan Lake and gained acclaim with people coming from all over the country to see the event. She began working as the soloist at the Estonia Theatre and for two years was the principal dancer until a bout of tuberculosis forced her to withdraw. In 1957, she was awarded the title Honored Artist of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and the following year returned as the principal of the Estonian Theater. In 1960, illness again drove her from the stage and Puur spent four years recovering from tuberculosis to return as the prima ballerina once again from 1964 to 1966. Her 1965 performance of Juliet in Romeo and Juliet moved the audience to a standing ovation and the orchestra to stop playing when Puur appeared on the stage. In 1966, Puur retired from dancing, after a serious back injury, and became a dance master, teaching students like Kaie K√µrb, who studied with Puur in 1980. In 1968, she married the writer . In 1976, she was awarded the title of People's Artist of the Estonian SSR; in 1993 she received the Special Prize of the Estonian Theater Workers' Union; in 1999 she was recognized for her lifetime achievements in the field of dance with the Philip Morris Award; and in 2001 was granted the Order of the White Star, third class. Puur's most noted roles were as Odette-Odile in Swan Lake in her 1953 debut, as the flower waltz soloist in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker(1953) and as Beatrice in Mikhail Chulaki's Imaginary fiance (1954). Noted roles included Esmeralda in the opera of the same name, the title role in the ballet Giselle, Sylphide in Chopiniana, Maria in The Fountain of Bakhchisarai, as well as others. She was known for her lyricism, poetic rhythm and romantic presentation and noted for her role to establish ballet as an art form in Estonia. In 2010, she was one of the featured artists in a play, Luikede j√§rve, staged by choreographer Dmitri Hartsenko. The production featured Puur and Kaie K√µrb, both dancers of previous eras with young dancers just beginning their careers. Though she was aging, Puur insisted on trying out for the part and worked hard in rehearsals for the performance. The memorable performance was well received. Death and legacy Puur died on 6 July 2014 and was buried in Forest Cemetery on 12 July 2014 after services held at the St. John's Church in Tallinn.

Around the Square is the Central House of Officers, the residence of the President of Belarus, and the Janka Kupa≈Ça National Academic Theater. On the square there are the main metro stations in Minsk: Kastryƒçnickaja and Kupa≈Ça≈≠skaja.  History  In September 1952, a monument to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was installed on the square with a height of 10 metres (33 ft). In 1957, between the main square and central park were government stands, from which the party and state leadership of the BSSR reviewed military parades and welcomed the demonstrations on International Workers' Day, Victory Day, and October Revolution Day. Therefore, the square acquired the status of the city's main square. On 3 November 1961, Stalin's monument was demolished, and in 1966 the area was replaced by the opening of a museum built in honor of the Great Patriotic War. In 1984, the area was renamed to October Square and construction of the Palace began on it, which dragged on for 17 years, resulting in Lenin Square having regained the status as the official central square of the city. Activities on the square After independence, the area was often the venue for concerts and festivals, as well as socio-political action, in which the area is decorated with the appropriate decorations. Since 2000, the centre of the square has hosted the highest artificial Christmas tree in the country (height , diameter ) around which the skating-rink and above the area carried out a festive illumination. In 2002, the Minsk Independence Day Parade was held on the square for the first time, being the first parade that took place on October Square since 1984. In March 2017, the centennial of the Belarusian Militsiya was celebrated with a parade of the personnel of the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs on October Square. The tradition of holding military ceremonies on the square after presidential inaugurations began in 2001. On Freedom Day in 2006, the AMAP stormed an opposition tent at October Square without provocation, violently ending the peaceful Jeans Revolution against President Alexander Lukashenko. Hundreds of thousands of people were beaten and detained on the square, including opposition presidential candidate Alaksandr Kazulin.TIME, 25 March 2006: Belarus: 'They Knocked My Husband Down and Dragged Him Away'  Buildings  *Palace of the Republic - The central building on October Square.

The election used the 11 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system, a form of proportional representation, with 34 councillors elected. Following the 2012 election, the Scottish National Party formed a coalition with the support of the Independents and the Liberal Democrats. The Borders Party also supported this administration. This replaced the previous Conservative-Lib Dem-Independent coalition which existed from 2007-2012. The council was the first to reveal its administration after the election, with the Conservative group forming a coalition with independents to rule the council.

Wasielewski is known for his research on light-driven charge transfer and transport in molecules and materials, photosynthesis, nano scale materials for solar energy conversion, spin dynamics of multi-spin molecules, molecular materials for optoelectronics and spintronics, and time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Education and early life  Wasielewski was born on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, and spent his formative years in close proximity to both the University of Chicago and Chicago's steel making industry. He studied chemistry at University of Chicago under the direction of Leon Stock (B.S. 1971, Ph.D. 1975). His graduate research revealed how the electron-nuclear hyperfine splittings of hydrogen, carbon-13, and fluorine atoms depend on the structure of the paramagnetic molecules. After the completion of his Ph.D., Wasielewski studied antiaromaticity under the direction of Ronald Breslow at Columbia University.  The Wasielewski Group  Wasielewski joined Northwestern University in 1994. During his time at Northwestern, Wasielewski has collaborated extensively with his colleagues Mark Ratner, Tobin Marks, Fred Lewis, Fraser Stoddart, and others to study molecular charge transfer and photophysics.

Born and raised in Tr·∫°ng Tr√¨nh street in Haiphong, Dung H√† was a high-ranking member of the Vietnamese black society at the port city, and during her peak during the 90s, she and NƒÉm Cam were considered as the two great powers of the Vietnamese underworld. On October 2, 2000, Dung H√† was assassinated under orders from NƒÉm Cam, who had previously been in a feud with Dung H√† in Saigon. This event eventually led to the destruction of NƒÉm Cam and his gang by the authorities, as Cam was later sentenced to death for ordering her murder.  Early life  Dung H√† was born and raised in H·∫£i Ph√≤ng on Tr·∫°ng Tr√¨nh street as the youngest daughter of her family. The street on which she lived on was near the edge of the bustling Iron Market (Ch·ª£ S·∫Øt), which at the time was one of the busiest sectors in the port city of H·∫£i Ph√≤ng, with many businesses lined up selling wares such as shrimp paste and dried fish. The street was also near both the local bus station and the ferry terminal, giving young Dung H√† exposure to the complicacy of society, such as seeing crimes like theft and witnessing gangsters wandering the streets from an early age. Dung herself was said to have been free-spirited and wild in her youth, and from early on she dropped out of school and quickly became a female gangster near the Tam B·∫°c bus station. Following the footsteps of a number of brothers and sisters, Dung H√† took on the job of pickpocketing and robberies to make a living. In the middle of 1986, while robbing a pedestrian walking on the street in the Iron Market, Dung H√† was caught and arrested, where she then later spent 12 months in prison for the crime. She was 21 years old at the time. This did not change her behavior though, and when she was released from prison, she became increasingly involved in the criminal underworld. = Gang Life and Romantic Hardships = Dung H√† was acquainted with and loved H√πng ‚Äúthe warbler‚Äù, who was a reputable gang boss in the areas around the bus station and cargo gathering areas alongside the Tam B·∫°c bus station. The love story between Dung H√† and H√πng gradually became famous over time, especially amongst those living in the underworld. However, when the money began to pour into the bag, H√πng \\"warbler\\" began to fall. It was not until H√πng Warbler utterly obliterated the business at the Tam B·∫°c bus station that Dung H√† finally decided to leave his side. At age 26, Dung H√† became familiar with and fell in love with another man named H√πng C·ªëm. H√πng C·ªëm however was also a famous gangster in the Haiphong area from between 1985-1990, where it was said that no one could defeat him in the area. Along with her lover H√πng C·ªëm, Dung H√† started opening up casinos in the area, as the two went on a mass crime spree in the area. After H√πng C·ªëm was arrested, sentenced to death and transferred to a solitary cell for death row inmates at the H·∫£i Ph√≤ng detention center, Dung H√† went to the outside of the prison and hatched a bold escape plan against the Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫ detention center; using a grenade to intimidate the supervisors within the prison walls, Dung brought alongside a dozen of her followers to block the road and make way for H√πng C·ªëm to escape to the sea, where a train was waiting to take him to HongKong. The grenades however failed to explode and the plan failed miserably. H√πng C·ªëm was later executed by firing squad after the escape attempt. Despite the failure, Dung H√†‚Äôs action and devotion to her lover gained her many admirers, and the name ‚ÄúDung H√†‚Äù became more and more notorious within the port city. = Affair with a Woman = With the death of her former lover H√πng C·ªëm, Dung H√† fell in love with a girl who was among her disciples. The people of H·∫£i Ph√≤ng at the time soon became used to seeing pictures of Dung H√† with her hair cut short like a man, along with her dressed in men‚Äôs clothing, riding a Ringbell motorcycle on the street. However, Dung H√†‚Äôs affair with this girl was abruptly interrupted in 1995 when Dung H√† was arrested and sentenced to 7 years in prison. After serving 3 years of the sentence, Dung H√† was finally released. She was now free, but now her criminal business was no longer as favorable as before because of increased police scrutiny. With her business over, Dung H√† decided to take her business to the south into Saigon. In the late nineties of the last century, Dung H√† of the north and NƒÉm Cam of the south were considered as the two great powers of the Vietnamese black society or underworld.  Feud with NƒÉm Cam  Knowing of H·∫£i ‚ÄúB√°nh‚Äù, a mobster from the north who migrated to the south to joined forces with NƒÉm Cam‚Äôs and became incredibly wealthy in the process, Dung H√† decided to do the same. NƒÉm Cam had hoped to get Dung H√† to serve as his emissary in expanding his illicit casino business, but Dung H√† had other intentions, trying to forge her own gang in Saigon. Dung H√† started to cause disruptions to NƒÉm Cam‚Äôs business by ordering her members to disrupt the Monaco dance business of NƒÉm Cam; the two groups then clashed with one another at a casino near the Hang bridge (C·∫ßu Hang) and other casinos belonging to Cam. On the night of September 9, 2000, Dung H√† continued to cause trouble, this time at the Phi Thuy·ªÅn dance floor organized by H·∫£i B√°nh by holding a fake birthday party and then having her members throw shrimp sauce, human feces and snakes onto the dance floor. NƒÉm Cam was furious in response, calling Dung H√† a thorn in his eye as he then ordered H·∫£i B√°nh to go find Dung H√†.  Death of Dung H√†  On the night of October 1, 2000, two assassins were directed by a phone call from H·∫£i B√°nh to go find Dung H√†. When the assassins found the female gang boss playing in front of the karaoke at 17 B√πi Th·ªã Xu√¢n in the first district, one of the assassins went up to Dung H√†, pulled out a 9mm revolver and shot her at point-blank range in the head, killing her. Dung H√†‚Äôs death however would later lead to the downfall of H·∫£i B√°nh and NƒÉm Cam‚Äôs gang, which was later destroyed by the authorities in a series of persecutions that resulted in NƒÉm Cam and several members involved receiving the death penalty for the murder of Dung H√†. Dung H√†‚Äôs body was later taken back up to the north where members of the H·∫£i Ph√≤ng criminal underworld delivered her funeral service from Tr·∫°ng Tr√¨nh street (where Dung once lived) to the Opera House.  Legacy  Many people in Vietnam, especially in Haiphong considered the night that Dung H√† was shot as a ‚Äúhistorical night‚Äù. Even until now, people in the port city still think that the gang boss‚Äôs funeral was unique both in terms of the monumental level and the number of participants. Dung H√†‚Äôs funeral in a way reminded the people of the mafia godfather‚Äôs funeral in the world. Many monks and teachers were invited to the funeral to pray for Dung H√†, whose coffin was decorated with flowers. Along the road to the funeral at Dung H√†‚Äôs house, the younger brothers of her gang stood in two columns, all dressed in black uniform. The disciples of Dung H√† and the many mourners who came were dressed in black vests, with white roses on the chest, eyes wearing dark glasses, and were riding in a black car during the funeral procession.

Spafford‚Äôs previous drummer, Nick Tkachyk, returned to the band at this point. The group self-releases their music, many of which are soundboard recordings of their live shows. Style Spafford's sound is the product of the different songwriters and singers in the band. The band uses an improvisational style to transition between the songs in their sets of live music, selecting diverse covers. Spafford tours across the U.S., and each of their shows features a different setlist and approach to each song they play. Through their tours, archives, and live video recordings, the band has a fan base of \\"Spaffnerds\\" who travel to see the band and maintain an online community surrounding its shows. The band provide live streams and access to recordings of their shows on their website.  History  Brian Moss and Jordan Fairless are the founding members of Spafford. They both played open mic nights at Coyote Joe's in Prescott, Arizona, in 2008. At the time, Moss played guitar and Fairless was the percussionist.

Hill began attending Virginia State College for Negroes, now Virginia State University (VSU), in 1925, gaining her bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1929. Career After gaining her degree, Hill began teaching in 1930 at VSU's Laboratory High School. In 1932 she taught chemistry part-time at the Hampton Institute, becoming a full-time faculty member in 1937. From 1938 to 1942, she taught at VSU. Hill also undertook graduate study at the University of Pennsylvania in the summers, awarded the first master's degree in chemistry to an African- American woman in 1941. She taught at Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina, for one year before she was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry at Tennessee A & I State College, a historically black college now known as Tennessee State University. She was a professor of chemistry at Tennessee A & I State College from 1944‚Äì1962, and was the acting head of the chemistry department from 1951‚Äì1962. In 1962, her husband Carl McClellan Hill, who had been the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Tennessee A & I, accepted the position as president of Kentucky State College (now Kentucky State University) in Frankfort, Kentucky. Mary Hill followed her husband to Kentucky State and was appointed a professor of chemistry. Mary and Carl worked together as a team, with Mary specializing as an analytical chemist. The Hills used Grignard reagents to develop chemical syntheses of ketenes, which was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Air Force. Mary Hill developed the analytical methods for the work, and specialized using monomeric ketenes. She utilized spectroscopic methods, including ultraviolet spectophotometry in her studies and worked to develop analytical methods to track the progress of chemical reactions. Her methods were used to determine the solubility of different components in non-aqueous solutions, which enabled synthetic chemists in their group to identify, isolate, and quantify products. Applicable processes included the polymerization of ketenes, which is used in the synthesis of plastics. Mary Hill instituted student chapters of the American Chemical Society at some of the historically black colleges and universities where she taught. It is estimated that at least 20 of her students went on to become chemistry professors, and she won awards for her teaching. She was also a member of the Tennessee Academy of Science, the National Institute of Science, Alpha Kappa Alpha National Honor Society, and Beta Kappa Chi. Publications Hill was a co-author on more than 40 papers, but was never listed as the senior author. Mary Elliot Hill collaborated in the writing of two textbooks. The first, General College Chemistry (1944), was written in conjunction with her husband Carl Hill and with Myron B. Towns. The laboratory manual Experiments in Organic Chemistry (1954) was made into four editions. Personal life Hill was married to Carl McClellan Hill, but the exact date of their marriage is unknown. One source says that they were married two years after she was introduced to him by a classmate at age 16 while another indicates that they married during her sophomore year at Virginia State College, suggesting that their marriage occurred somewhere between 1925 and 1927. With her husband, she had three children. In a 1963 newspaper interview, hobbies mentioned were reading, studying German and Russian, and enjoying flower arranging and watching football. The Hills were active members of their Presbyterian Churches in Nashville, Tennessee, and Frankfort Kentucky. The Hills had just returned from a trip to England when Mary died from \\"a heart condition\\" she had \\"for some time\\", in King's Daughters Hospital in Frankfort, Kentucky on February 12, 1969.

It has a single dull green leaf with purple blotches near the base, and a single greenish cream to cream flower with pink to reddish markings. It was only known from a single population which has been bulldozed and replaced with a pine plantation so that it is now probably extinct. Description Caladenia cadyi is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows in small groups. It has a single dull green leaf with purple blotches near the base. The leaf is long, wide and is densely covered with hairs up to long. A single flower wide is borne on a wiry, hairy, reddish flowering stem tall. The flower is greenish cream to cream with pink to reddish stripes and blotches. The dorsal sepal is oblong to elliptic, long, wide and tapers to a thick glandular tip long. The lateral sepals are with similar to the dorsal sepal but wider. The petals are narrow lance-shaped, long and wide. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg- shaped, long and wide with erect lateral lobes. The labellum curves forward and there are five to nine pairs of linear teeth long on its sides. The mid- line of the labellum has many crowded calli near its base and four or six rows near its centre, the longest of which are long. Flowering occurs in September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia cadyi was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones, who gave it the name Arachnorchis cadyi and published the description in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected near Nowra on the road to Tomerong. In 2010, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia cadyi. The specific epithet (cadyi) honours Leo Cady who collected the type specimen. Distribution and habitat This spider orchid was only known from the type location where it grew in shrubby forest. It was last seen in 1960, after which the site was bulldozed and planted with Pinus radiata. Although similar habitat to the type location is found nearby, the orchid has not been seen since 1960 despite extensive searching.

This was financed by the highly renowned London merchant John Watts.Andrews p 164-65 The English ships intercepted and dispersed Spanish convoys capturing, sinking, and grounding many ships off the Spanish colonies of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Jamaica. Despite losing an arm, Newport was victorious and captured a good haul of booty.Bicheno p 316 A breakaway expedition from this discovered that the Roanoke colony was completely deserted and which gave the name The Lost Colony.Milton pp 261-65 Background By the end of 1589 the immediate threat of a Spanish invasion of England had been abated. Attempts were now made by privateering expeditions or joint stock companies to raid the Spanish Main. In the Spring of 1590 a privateering expedition had been raised and financed in London by merchant John Watts. Watts gathered a naval force with a mixture of armed merchants ships and naval vessels loaned by the English crown.Aronson p. 105 The force composed of the 22-gun, 160-ton flagship Hopewell (alias Harry and John) under Captain Abraham Cocke; the 160-ton Little John of Christopher Newport, and the 35-ton pinnace John Evangelist of William Lane (brother of Ralph Lane). Their objective was to raid the Spanish West Indies and to coup the rewards of the expedition, but also on the return voyage to help the Roanoke colonists. With them was John White, an artist and friend of Sir Walter Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expeditions to Roanoke. Raleigh had helped put together the fleet along with the aid of White himself who was desperate to go back to Roanoke and help the colonists. As a result, two ships, the Hopewell and the Moonlight were intended as a break off expedition to set sail for Roanoke.Milton pp 257-58 Expedition On 20 March the English set sail from Plymouth and crossed the Atlantic without hindrance and reached the island of Dominica by 10 May. They replenished for victuals and two days later the Hopewell and John Evangelist had steered Northwest towards Puerto Rico, whilst leaving Little John temporarily off Dominica to intercept arriving Spanish vessels. All three later rendezvoused at Saona Island.Milton pp 259-60 =Santo Domingo= On 29 May off the south coast of Hispaniola, Abraham Cocke's formation of three ships were joined by Edward Spicer's 80-ton Moonlight (alias Mary Terlanye) and the 30-ton pinnace Conclude of Joseph Harris in the morning. Cocke's reunited trio of vessels then blockaded the southern coast of Santo Domingo for two weeks, capturing the 60-ton Spanish merchantman Trinidad and two smaller island frigates on 17 and 24 June respectively. After these captures the English broke off the blockade and moved further West towards the Tiburon peninsula of Hispaniola. =Tiburon to Colony of Santiago= On 12 July whilst off the Tiburon, fourteen Spanish sail approached out of the east. These ships were five days out of Santo Domingo and were bound toward the Spanish plate fleet assembly point at Havana escorted by Captain Vicente Gonz√°lez's galleon. The English ships took up position to pursue and were just in time as Newport's Little John and John Evangelist came up to join them. Location of Tiburon Peninsula, Hispaniola (present day Haiti) Cocke gave an immediate signal to attack; the Spanish who saw the English approach decided to scatter, and the armed ships attempted to form a defensive position to allow the lighter armed vessels to escape. Suddenly on seeing Newport's ships come from behind Cocke's vessels, Gonzalez decided to retreat. Most of the Spanish convoy decided to scatter south west and they were pursued until nightfall by the six privateers, who took a single prize, a pinnace. The following morning, Hopewell, Moonlight, and Conclude then discovered the 350-ton, nine-gun Spanish vice flagship galleon Buen Jes√∫s of Captain Manuel Fern√°ndez Correa and Master Leonardo Doria anchored nearby. Cocke then attacked surprising the Spanish; with the Buen Jes√∫s unable to get away in the process of hauling its anchor a long range exchange of fire commenced in which six Spanish were killed and four wounded. The English then closed amidships firing as they came alongside but as they attempted to board the vessel they were repelled. Undeterred the English made a more determined attack and secured it despite a stout, four- hour resistance, most of which consisted of hand-to-hand fighting. As well as the ship being captured, sixty eight Spaniards were captured with another twenty killed or wounded while English losses were around fifteen.Hakluyt Society, pp 592-603 Whilst the fight for Buen Jesus was going on Little John and John Evangelist chased Gonz√°lez's main body which was headed South West toward the Colony of Santiago (present-day Jamaica) and all the while exchanged broadsides with the Spanish flagship.Marley (2005) p 150 As soon as the Spanish arrived off Caguaya bay the English ships immediately drove at two of them.Southey p 210 With intense fire the English were able to force the two ships aground before the six or seven Spanish vessels that survived reached Santiago de la Vega. English boat parties then immediately attacked the grounded ships; the Spanish that did defend them were easily driven off. An attempt to refloat both beached vessels then began as they used ropes and a helpful southerly wind. The English managed to get one of the ships off the beach but the attempt was not successful with the other ship - already badly damaged it then sank. The English then re-embarked their ships and together with the new prize sailed Northwest toward Cape Corrientes. On 14 July Cocke gave the Buen Jesus to Newport for protection since her cargo was immense and needed to be transported back to England with haste. The cannons and firearms from the ship were stripped off before Newport's victorious privateers withdrew from the Jamaican coastline and headed East towards Cuba. =Cayo Jutias= Cayo Jutias as seen today At sunset on 18 July, Newport's Little John and John Evangelist sighted three Spanish merchantmen off Cayo Jutias (west of Havana and north of Los √ìrganos). They proved to be stragglers from Commodore Rodrigo de Rada's convoy from Veracruz, which had entered the Cuban capital five days earlier. The English attacked in the darkness and opened fire compelling one ship to reverse course. The following morning the English closed in on the remaining pair: the 150-ton Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario captained by Miguel de Acosta and a 60-ton pinnace Nuestra Se√±ora de la Victoria under Juan de Borda. The Spaniards had lashed both vessels together, and a long-range artillery exchange commenced which the English got the better of, severely damaging Victoria. The English then closed amidships with the Victoria and managed to board her and ferocious hand-to-hand combat soon followed. Newport killed the Spanish captain in the melee that followed but soon after his right arm was struck off by another Spaniard trying to protect his captain. However Newport was saved by a sergeant-of-arms who killed his would be assailant. The Spanish were soon driven from the vessel and the English suffered five killed and sixteen wounded (including Newport) while the Spanish losses were higher. The English then discovered Victoria to be so badly holed that it sank within fifteen minutes, taking much of the silver within. The next target, the Spanish vessel Rosario, was swiftly boarded not long after. Another viscous fight took place but again the English soon forced the Spanish from the vessel having suffered two killed and eight injured. The Rosario too was badly damaged and sinking; the English had no choice and drove the vessel ashore the western end of Cayo Jutias. Soon after Newport despite being in pain and shock still sent orders and released the Spanish prisoners and sent them ashore. The English then pillaged the vessel but found only a small haul of valuables after which was then broken up and burnt. Newport with only half his arm ordered a return to England. Newport sailed back to England leaving Cocke in charge, so the Hopewell and the Moonlight with John White sailed to Roanoke with their half of the mission complete.Nichols pp 29-33 Expedition to Roanoke The discovery of the word \\"Croatoan\\" carved onto a stockade board Meanwhile, the other half of the expedition sought to land at the English colony of Roanoke. White's eventual landing at the Outer Banks was further imperilled by poor weather and the landing was hazardous and was beset by bad conditions and adverse currents. On August 18, 1590 he finally reached Roanoke Island, but he found his colony had been long deserted. The few clues about the colonists whereabouts included the letters \\"CRO\\" carved into a tree, and the word \\"CROATOAN\\" carved on a post of the fort. Croatoan was the name of a nearby island (likely modern-day Hatteras Island) and a local tribe of Native Americans. The colonists had agreed that a message would be carved into a tree if they had moved and would include an image of a Maltese Cross if the decision was made by force. With no sign of the colonists and the weather becoming worse White returned to Plymouth on October 24, 1590.Milton pp 266-68 Aftermath Newport returned home to a hero's welcome by early September and counted the large spoils of which was a profitable expedition. The biggest and most profitable was the 300-ton Buen Jesus which sailed into Plymouth in September - the prize had been from Seville, and was typical of Spanish trade at the time. On board: 200 boxes of sugar, at least 5,000 hides, 2,000 hundredweight of ginger, 400 hundredweight of guacayan wood, twelve hogsheads of Chile pepper, twenty hundredweight of sarsaparilla, twenty hundredweight of cane, and over 4,000 ducats in pearls, gold, and silver. The English expedition and the defeat of the convoys proved frustrating to the Spanish. Their commander Rodrigo de Rada wrote afterwards: Addicted to the prize hunting, Newport set out again, despite the loss of his arm - he owed his life to the ship's surgeon. The following year as captain of the Margaret he combined Barbary trade with Watt's most successfully financed expeditions; the Blockade of Western Cuba. Between 1592 and 1595, when captaining the Golden Dragon, Newport kept to the West Indies again. In 1592 he was given command of a flotilla of privateers and he pioneered attacks on the towns of the Spanish Caribbean. On his return he helped to capture the Madre de Deus off the Azores and was chosen to sail her to England, making him a very rich man. Legacy Newport would be shown erroneously with an arm (played by Christopher Plummer) in Terence Malick's film of the Jamestown settlement \\"New World\\" and his statue at Christopher Newport University of which is named after him.

It is now the oldest preserved church in the city as Fr√∂ttmaning has been a part of Munich since 1931. Holy Cross Church with Allianz Arena History The history of the church begins before 815, when the village of Fr√∂ttmaning was first mentioned officially (ad Freddamaringun; in loco Freddimaringa). A deed of donation in connection with the church from the year 815 is the oldest document in the Bavarian State Archive. The Fr√∂ttmaning noble Situli at that time had offered a wooden church, together with the farmland, to the Freising bishopric, which was consecrated by Bishop Hitto of Freising. Today's late Romanesque building with its thick walls was built for the most part at the beginning of the 13th century. The Church of the Holy Cross is one of the churches with steeple above the choir which was typical for the Bishopric of Freising at that time. The Romanesque spire with round arch windows and frieze is eighteen meters high, the church itself is fifteen meters long and nearly seven meters wide. The battlement with its embrasures is still visible in the inner wall. Particularly rare and unique in Germany are the Romanesque frescoes painted directly on the red bricks of the interior with lime paint, which were discovered only in 1981 during renovations and then partly exposed. The painted circles around a tree of life symbolize the sun. One of the wall paintings is the oldest representation of Christ in Bavaria. The rest of the church is predominantly from the baroque period. The ceiling fresco painted by pupils of the Asam brothers around 1740, it shows the worship of the Holy Cross. Sunken village ‚ÄûSunken village‚Äú With the construction of the nearby Allianz Arena, an international competition for an artwork was initiated which was won by Timm Ulrichs. He created a copy of the church as building structure as the Fr√∂ttmaning mountain of rubble had been included in the competition area. The focus is on the disappearance of the former village of Fr√∂ttmaning. Approximately 150 meters south of the Holy Cross Church, in 2006, an untraceable look-alike of the Romanesque church was created in original size from painted precast concrete parts. The surreal-melancholic work of art \\"sunken village\\" at the foot of the Fr√∂ttmaning mountain of rubble is a kind of a loss display, the disappearing in this place.

Location The amphitheatre is located in the ancient suburb of Neapolis, in what is now an archaeological park, near the Greek theatre and the Altar of Hieron. The amphitheatre is on a different orientation to these other structures and probably follows the lines of an urban plan developed in the late classical period, which is reflected by the street discovered near the Sanctuary of Demeter in the suburb of Achradina. The main road from Achradina to Neapolis led up to the amphitheatre through an Augustan period , whose foundations are still in situ. Between the arch and the amphitheatre, there was a monumental fountain, fed by a large cistern which has not yet been identified. A separate cistern provided water to the amphitheatre itself - it is preserved under the nearby church of San Nicola. Description The rectangular pit in the centre of the arena, view from the northeast View of the amphitheatre from the south The amphitheatre is largely excavated out of the living rock and in the north east it takes advantage of the slope of the same rocky outcrop which the Greek theatre is built into. Almost nothing of the superstructure, which was built from masonry, survives. The structure has monumental dimensions, measuring around 140 metres in length and 119 metres in width.Sicilia, Touring Club D'Italia (1989) pag. 593 There were two entrances and a complicated system of steps which led from the upper levels to the exterior. At the centre of the arena there was a rectangular pit, which was originally covered. An underground passage ran from this pit to the entrance at the southern end of the amphitheatre. This pit and passage were necessary for machinary used during the shows. The seating in the cavea is separated from the arena itself by a high platform, under which was a vaulted corridor through which gladiators entered the arena. Above this were the front seats, which were reserved for high ranking individuals. The inscriptions carved on the blocks of the railing were edited by Gentili and seem to have been intended to indicate the different seating areas.Anfiteatro RomanoG. V. Gentili, \\"Studi e ricerche su l'anfiteatro di Siracusa,\\" Palladio, Rivista di storia dell'architettura, n.s., 23, 1973, pp. 3-80. Higher up, there are another two covered walkways running around the entire arena under the seating, while a third walkway ran around the top of the monument and may have had a colonnaded portico running around the top of it. From these circular walkways, a series of radial passages allowed access to the various sectors of the cavea. Four limestone fragments of a monumental inscription still survive from the amphitheatre, which most likely stood above the main entrance at the south end of the arena, according to Gentili.P.

He is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and director of the Future Interfaces Group within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. He has previously conducted research at AT&T; Labs, Microsoft Research, IBM Research and Disney Research. He is also the CTO and co-founder of Qeexo, a machine learning and interaction technology startup. Harrison has authored more than 80 peer-reviewed papers and his work appears in more than 40 books. For his contributions in human-computer interaction, Harrison was named a top 35 innovator under 35 by MIT Technology Review (2012), a top 30 scientist under 30 by Forbes (2012), one of six innovators to watch by Smithsonian (2013), and a top Young Scientist by the World Economic Forum (2014). Over the course of his career, Harrison has been awarded fellowships by the Packard Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Google, Qualcomm and Microsoft Research. He currently holds the A. Nico Habermann Chair in Computer Science. More recently, NYU, Harrison's undergraduate alma mater named him as their 2014 Distinguished Young Alumnus, and the lab also won a Fast Company Innovation by Design Award for their work on EM-Sense. Biography Harrison was born in 1984 in London, United Kingdom, but emigrated with his family to New York City in the United States at a young age. Harrison actively participated in the ACM programming competitions and engaged in a variety crafts. He also displayed an interest in Slinging and was contacted for this hobby by BBC for an ancient weapons documentary. Consequently, Harrison created and launched slinging.org on March 20, 2003 as an online forum for sling enthusiasts, as is currently the largest website on the subject, with over 200,000 forum posts. Harrison obtained his citizenship in the United States on May 13, 2002. Harrison obtained both a B.A. (2002-2005) and M.S. (2006) in Computer Science from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. His Master's thesis was advised by Dr. Dennis Shasha, with whom he worked on a relational file system built around the concept of temporal context. New York University honored Harrison as its 2014 Distinguished Young Alumnus. During his master's studies, Harrison worked at IBM Research - Almaden on an early personal assistant application called Enki under Mark Dean, then the director of the lab. After completing his master's degree, Harrison worked at AT&T; Labs, developing among the first asynchronous social video platforms, dubbed CollaboraTV, with features now common in modern systems. Encouraged by colleagues, Harrison joined the Ph.D. program in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University in 2007, completing his dissertation on \\"The Human Body as an Interactive Computing Platform\\" in 2013 under the supervision of Dr. Scott Hudson. From 2009 to 2012, Harrison was the Editor-in-Chief of ACM's Crossroads magazine, which he relaunched as XRDS, the flagship magazine for the over 30,000 student members of the ACM. Harrison has spun-out several technologies from CMU and cofounded the machine learning startup Qeexo in 2012, which provides specialized machine-learning engines for mobile and embedded platforms, with a focus on interactive technologies. In 2019, the company won a CES Innovation Award for their EarSense solution, which was used in the bezel-less Oppo Find X, replacing the need for a physical proximity sensor with a virtual machine- learning-powered solution. In total, the company software is used on more than 100 million devices as of 2017. In 2013, Harrison became faculty at Carnegie Mellon University, founding the Future Interfaces Group within the Human- Computer Interaction Institute. Research Harrison broadly investigates novel sensing and interface technologies, especially those \\"that empower people to interact with small devices in big ways\\". He is best known for his research into ubiquitous and wearable computing, where computation escapes the confines of today's small, rectangular screens, and spills interactivity out onto everyday surfaces, such as walls, countertops and furniture. This research thread dates back to 2008, starting with Scratch Input appropriating walls and tables as ad hoc input surfaces. Insights from this work, especially the vibroacoustic propagation of touch inputs, led to Skinput being developed while Harrison was interning at Microsoft Research. Skinput was the first on- body system to demonstrate touch input and coordinated projected graphics without the need to instrument the hands. This research was followed shortly after by OmniTouch, also at Microsoft Research. More recently, Harrison has been conducting research at the Future Interfaces Group in the Human Computer Interaction department of CMU. In 2016, Harrison presented 3 topics at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) through Future Interfaces Group. These topics were: using a high speed mode of a smartwatch's accelerometer to acquire and interpret acoustic samples at 4000 samples per second, using electrical impedance sensing to create a real-time hand gesture sensor, and using infrared sensors on a smartwatch to recognize and utilize hand gestures made on the skin directly around the smartwatch. In 2017, Robert Xiao, an HCII PhD student, along with Harrison and Scott Hudson, his advisors, created Desktopography, an interactive multi-touch interface that is projected onto a desktop surface. Inspired by the Xerox PARC DigitalDesk, one of the first digitally augmented desks of its time, Desktopography explores the possibilities of virtual-physical interactions and deals with how to best create a user-friendly interface which has to navigate around various, constantly moved objects, as commonly found on one's desktop surface. Other activities Harrison co-developed and co-wrote Crash Course Computer Science, a PBS Digital Studios-funded educational series hosted on YouTube. This project was initiated following a discussion between Harrison and John Green at the World Economic Forum in 2016, where both were guest speakers. Along with Robert Xiao and Scott Hudson, colleagues at CMU, he developed Lumitrack, a motion tracking technology which is currently used in video game controllers and in the film industry. Harrison was also one of the Program Committee Chairs for the 2017 ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST). Chris is also an amateur digital artist and sculptor. His artworks have appeared in over 40 books and more than a dozen international galleries. Notable among these appearances were showings at the Triennale di Milano in Milan, Italy (2014), and the Biennale Internationale Design in Saint-√âtienne, France (2010).

The camps were located in southwest China, in the Gele Mountains of Chongqing. In 1947, the camps were reopened by the Kuomintang to hold captured communist politicians of the Republic of China. After the Republic of China started its advance on the Empire of Japan and threatened the liberation of the camps, General Dai Li of the Kuomintang authorized the camps to serve as the execution sites of the communist politicians in 1949. The camps were never officially closed after the liberation of their prisoners. Instead, they were later developed into museums that further honored their victims, who were considered martyrs of communism. Background = Sino-American Cooperation Organization (SACO) = The China and United States signed a SACO treaty which created the Sino- American Cooperation Organization (SACO) during World War II. The treaty established an intelligence-gathering entity that was mutual in China, especially among countries that were opposed to Japan. SACO was in a joint operation in China with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the Intelligence Agency of America and the CIA. Until this came into effect, it served as a joint training program between the United States of America and China. Dai Li was the chief of operation of this organization, head of the Bureau of Investigations and Statistics and Head of the Secret Police for Chiang Kai-shek. General Dai was a fierce anti-communist. He was also in charge of command for the Loyal Patriotic Army (LPA), a large Japanese military force that had occupied China's interior region. Milton E. Miles was the commander of American forces, as well as a Navy Captain. Mary Miles became a Vice Admiral later; she was the commander of Naval Group China (NGC). This was the intelligence unit of the American Navy in China during the period of war. SACO began setting up camps in 1943. These camps were later referred to as units during the establishment of the Naval Group China. These were units for training guerrillas of China in small arms, sabotage, demolition, radio handling, and combat techniques, aerology, and ship and aircraft recognition. Most of the American instructors or many of the American instructors had law enforcement backgrounds before the war. To a degree, some of the recruits provided by China were not healthy but their willingness and their ability of learning surprised instructors. A total of about 2,500 marines and sailors trained and operated with guerrilla forces of China, often behind enemy lines. Of all missions during war period that was set up by the Americans in China, the policy of Total Immersion was only applied by SACO with the Chinese. The route from China to Burma was operated by the or the Navy Paddy Navy, or the \\"Hell Gang\\". The mission of this group was to advise, train, and scout areas to land for General Claire Chennault's 14th AF and USN fleet and forecast the weather. They were also mandated to rescue downed American flyers and intercept Japanese radio traffic. The main objective of the mission during the final year of the Second World War was developing and preparing China's coast for allied occupation and penetration. The Fujian Province or commonly known as the Foochow was a potential area for staging as well as a potential area for a springboard for the future invasion of Japan. The trained guerrillas with the help of SACO and Naval Group China had in total destroyed 84 locomotives, at least 200 bridges and 141 ships and river craft. These activities resulted in deaths of Japanese military personnel that totaled to about 71,000; guerillas alone killed an approximate of 30,000. This means that every weapon that guerillas were supplied with by the SACO killed 2.5 Japanese. During the war this kill ratio could not be matched by any American military branch. The estimate of Japanese deaths for CAPT Miles deputy was a less generous 23,000. In 1946, SACO was officially dissolved after the war ended and the Naval Group of China had departed. However, some loyal guerrillas that were SACO-trained who were part of KMT carried on with aggression against the CCP; this happened when there was a civil war between 1946 and 1949. The Communists took over and after many years, SACO was linked with revolution atrocities and imperial foreign aggression; the US was suspected to have been involved. The incidents of torture and massacre were memorialized by the Chinese government during which US involvement was mentioned. Baigongguan Of the two concentration camps, Baigongguan served as the KMT's base of operations. It was designed to hold a hundred prisoners; despite prisoners being killed on a regular basis, the camp was chronically overcrowded. On November 28, 1949, orders were sent to execute all prisoners in ground level cells. Three people escaped the executions: Lo Guangbin, Yang Yiyan, and Lui Debin. Their experiences were later documented in a book. Zhazidong Prior to serving as a concentration camp, Zhazidong was used as a coal mine. Converted to a prison, Zhazidong held over three hundred prisoners; sixteen barracks for men and two barracks for women. Zhazidong had rooms for guides and officers who were mandated to execute different assignments assigned to them. The camp had torture chambers for prisoners. Communist politicians were tortured there. There was an interrogation room which held instruments of torture. During the November executions, prisoners were misled into thinking that they were being transported out of the prison. When the cell doors were opened, the occupants were shot by guards with machine guns. Surviving prisoners were then shot in the head. Around 15 prisoners managed to escape through a section of wall to cross a courtyard.link Jiang Zhuyun was among the few to escape the prison. She was portrayed in the opera Sister Jiang. The November 28, 1949 incident saw most communists slaughtered. However, there were those who managed to escape these killings, about 15 of the prisoners. Dai Li's control  General Dai Li was the commander in charge of the camps. Dai used internal problems within the KMT to justify his actions to the public.link With the help of the United States Dai Li was able to gain knowledge on interrogation tactics from the FBI. He then incorporated these tactics into the camps with the aid of supplies the United States had left after the end of World War II in 1945. Dai also acquired two thousand agents. Depictions in art and literature Luo Guangbin, Lui Debin, and Yang Yiyan, survivors of Baigongguan, wrote a novel based on their experiences, which went on to become popular among the Chinese. Published in 1961, the Red Crag discussed party consolidation, party rectification, higher education, and fighting capacity.

Published in 2005, Minaret follows the journey of Najwa, a young woman forced to flee her home in Sudan in the face of the Second Sudanese Civil War. After her father's execution, she and her family are forced to flee to London and leave behind the life of affluence and comfort that she once knew. As she loses everything, she manages to find herself again through her faith.  Characters  * Najwa, the protagonist of the novel. When she is first introduced she is 19 and a student at the University of Khartoum. Although she was enrolled in university, Najwa's aspirations never seemed to expand beyond getting married and having a family. Her family's affluence allows her a level of separation from the turmoil of her country, meaning that the military coup, that leads to the trial and execution of her father, catches her by surprise. Though she is a Muslim she is not very active in her faith. Things seem to fall apart for Najwa once in London with her brother's addiction and her mother's illness that leads to her eventual death. With her mother dead and brother in prison, Najwa has to adjust to her new life. She falls very easily into the comforting familiarity of Anwar. Through this, she meets women from her local mosque who reach out to her and support and encourage her renewed interest and dedication to Islam. * Omar, Najwa's twin brother. It is hinted early in the novel that Omar is getting involved with some drugs while in Khartoum; however, it does not become a problem until they move to London. Omar becomes a drug addict, going so far as to steal from his mother and sister for drug money. However, while getting arrested for selling drugs he stabs and nearly kills a police officer, leading towards a 15-year prison sentence. Najwa visits him in prison often, trying to bring him some of the comfort and security that her new dedication to her faith has brought her, but Omar continuously rejects it. * Anwar. Najwa first meets Anwar at university, where she very quickly starts to fall in love with him. Anwar is a radical communist who writes for the student newspaper and gives speeches on campus. It is because one of these speeches where Anwar verbally attacks Najwa's father, that the relationship between Anwar and Najwa ends. Najwa and Anwar find each other again in London after the death of Najwa's mother and a relationship begins to unfurl between them again. However, the relationship between Najwa and Anwar is very clearly unhealthy and emotionally abusive, where Anwar consistently puts Najwa down and looks down on her and her faith. Still Najwa stays with him and even spent money on buying him a computer and even giving him money for his PhD program. He goes so far as to say that he would never want to have children with Najwa because he does not want his children to share the same genes as Najwa's father. It is not until Najwa embraces Islam that she is able to leave him. * Lamya, Najwa's employer. She hires Najwa to look after her daughter Mai and take care of the housework. Lamya is not a very religious woman, unlike her younger brother Tamer. * Tamer, Lamya's younger brother. A 19-year-old university student who bonds with Najwa over their shared dedication to their faith. He is studying business, although he would rather be studying Islamic history. Najwa and Tamer fall in love, but things fall apart when Lamya catches Najwa and Tamer kissing. Although Tamer insists on them getting married, Najwa refuses him. * Doctora Zeinab, the mother of Lamya and Tamer. In the end it is Doctora Zeinab that pays Najwa to stay away from Tamer.  Plot  The novel of minaret is about broken into six sections that follow a non-linear narrative. The events of Najwa's past run parallel with the events of her life in the present day with the alternating sections = Part One: Khartoum, 1984‚Äì5 = The reader is introduced to Najwa and her family. Najwa lives a very privileged life, with her mother coming from a wealthy family and her father working as a high- ranking government official. She and her brother are both students at the University of Khartoum, which is where she first meets Anwar. When the coup occurs and their father is taken, Najwa and her family flee to London to await the news of his trial. Their father is found guilty and executed. = Part Two: London, 2003 = In this section the story jumps forward to the present day of the story on Najwa's first day of working for Lamya. It has been 18 years since Najwa had come to London and she is now a devout Muslim. The story walks through Najwa's routine of work, going to the Mosque, and visiting Omar. She is getting more comfortable in her job and she also properly meets Tamer and begins to get to know him. = Part Three: London, 1989‚Äì90 = Just after the death of her mother, Najwa is adjusting her new life alone and new freedoms of London. She begins working for her aunt, doing housework, and gets a letter from Anwar and agrees to meet with him. They talk and catch up and he persuades Najwa to help him with his articles for the newspaper he writes for and their relationship starts to build up again despite their constant disagreements. Najwa eventually loses her virginity to Anwar, something she feels immensely guilty over and further separates her from her faith. = Part Four: 2003‚Äì4 = Najwa and Tamer are getting closer thanks to their shared dedication to Islam. Their relationship is starting to shift towards a more romantic direction, and even though she faces criticism from her friend and her own internal reluctance about it, she doesn't stop the progression of their relationship. Things come to a head when Najwa has to work at a party that Lamya is throwing. Najwa gets emotional when she sees a dancer there mocking the hijab and her faith and so she seeks out Tamer for comfort. Tamer kisses her and Lamya finds them like this, prompting her to slap Najwa. = Part Five: 1991 = Najwa and Anwar's relationship continues its decline and Najwa finally reaches out to get more involved in Islam. She reaches out to a woman from the mosque to help her become a more devoted Muslim. She starts going to Mosque and finds solace and comfort in Islam and the teachings of the Qur'an. She ends her relationship with Anwar and starts wearing the hijab. = Part Six: 2004 = Najwa is now unemployed and trying to figure out her relationship with Tamer and where she wants to go from here. Tamer wants to move forward with the plan to get married, but Najwa doesn't want to hold him back or stunt his future. Doctora Zeinab comes to Najwa and offers her money to stay away from Tamer and Najwa accepts. Tamer is promised that he can study whatever he wants in university as long as he returns home and agrees to break things off with Najwa. They both agree to the terms and Najwa plans on using the money she got to go on Hajj.  Themes  = Class = In the beginning of the novel Najwa is living the life of an aristocrat. Her privileged life causes a disconnect between her and the political strife of her country. She doesn't think or care about politics because she doesn't have to. She doesn't focus on her studies because she doesn't plan on working, she just wants to get married and have children. Her lifestyle has to change drastically once she moves to London. A great deal of her father's money was confiscated by the new government in Khartoum, and the wealth she does have is lost very quickly to her brother's addiction, her mother's illness, and paying for Anwar's schooling. Najwa has to now work as a maid, but despite the fact that she has lost her money and cannot longer afford the lifestyle she used to have, she doesn't view herself as a member of the middle class and refers to herself as \\"upper class without money\\". = Religion = Islam plays a major role within the story. Its more than just a story of conversion, Najwa finds freedom and security when she fully embraces her faith. The mosque becomes a source of community for Najwa and a way for her to connect to her previous life in Khartoum. Her faith in Islam empowers her to stand up for herself and leave the toxic relationship she had with Anwar and the hijab becomes a symbol of strength and agency for her.

Daguio was a Filipino writer and poet during pre-war Philippines. He published two books in his lifetime, and three more posthumously. He was a Republic Cultural Heritage awardee for his works.  Early life and education Amador Daguio was born on January 8, 1912 in Laoag, Ilocos Norte. His family moved to Lubuagan, Mountain Province, where his father was an officer in the Philippine Constabulary. He graduated with honors in 1924 at the Lubuagan Elementary School as valedictorian. Daguio was already writing poems in elementary school, according to his own account. He wrote a farewell verse on a chalkboard at least once for a departing teacher when he was in grade 6. For his high school studies, he moved to Pasig to attend Rizal High School while residing with his uncle at Fort William McKinley. Daguio was too poor to afford his college tuition and did not enroll in the first semester of 1928. He also failed to qualify for a scholarship. He worked as a houseboy, waiter, and caddy at Fort McKinley to earn his tuition and later enrolled at the University of the Philippines on the second semester. He experienced financial difficulties in his studies until an uncle from Honolulu, Hawaii funded his tuition on his third year of study. Before his uncle's arrival, Daguio has worked as a printer's devil in his college as well as a writer for the Philippine Collegian. He was mentored in writing by Tom Inglis Moore, an Australian professor. In 1932, he graduated from UP as one of the top ten honor graduates. After World War II, he went to Stanford University to study his masterals in English which he obtained at 1952. And in 1954 he obtained his Law degree from Romualdez Law College in Leyte. Career When Daguio was a third year high school student his poem \\"She Came to Me\\" got published in the July 11, 1926 edition of The Sunday Tribune. After he graduated from UP, he returned to Lubuagan to teach at his former alma mater. He then taught at Zamboange Normal School in 1938 where he met his wife Estela. During the Second World War, he was part of the resistance and wrote poems. These poems were later published as his book Bataan Harvest. He was the chief editor for the Philippine House of Representatives, as well as several other government offices.

In 1870 Lord Lambton, who owned the land at the time, accepted an application to search for coal and it was founded in the following year.

Rhodesian CBW use took place toward the end of Rhodesia's protracted struggle against a growing African nationalist insurgency in the late 1970s. The genesis of the Rhodesian CBW effort emerged as a result of a deteriorating security situation that developed following Mozambique's independence from Portuguese colonial rule. In April 1980, the former colony became the independent country of Zimbabwe. Origins The project was the brainchild of Professor Robert Symington, who headed the clinical program at the University of Rhodesia's medical school (Godfrey Huggins School of Medicine). He reportedly Jim Parker, \\"Assignment Selous Scouts: The Inside Story of a Rhodesian Special Branch Officer\\". Johannesburg, South Africa: Galago Press, 2006 put forward the idea to the Minister of Defence P. K. van der Byl, who advocated it to Prime Minister Ian Smith. The Prime Minister in consultation with his War CabinetGlenn Cross, \\"Dirty War: Rhodesia and Chemical Biological Warfare, 1975‚Äì1980,\\" Solihull, UK: Helion & Company, 2017‚Äîdelegated responsibility to the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), and implementation was assigned to the Special Branch liaison component in the Selous Scouts. Although they were aware of the CBW program's existence, the full extent to which the Rhodesian political and military leadership was involved is unclear due to the lack of documented material or living witnesses. Given Defence Minister P. K. van der Byl's key role in the CBW initiative, Rhodesia's CBW efforts almost certainly began before van der Byl was removed from his defence portfolio on 9 September 1976. Symington's proposal for a chemical and biological weapons programme then probably dates from mid-to-late 1975 to early-to-mid 1976, but the exact date for the beginning of the CBW effort is unclear. Once authorized, Rhodesian CBW experiments at the Selous Scout \\"fort\\" in Bindura date from sometime in 1976, and operations almost certainly began by late 1976. By this time, Symington had recruited a number of volunteers from the University of Rhodesia to work on the project. According to members of the Rhodesian CBW team, they began to poison clothing in April 1977 and contaminate food, beverages, and medicines in May/June 1977. They also stated that the project did not end until late 1979. CIO chief Ken Flower was certainly aware of the CBW activities,Ken Flower, \\"Serving Secretly: An Intelligence Chief on the Record\\". London: John Murray Ltd., 1987 having received biweekly reports from his officer in charge of the program Michael \\"Mac\\" McGuinness. British South Africa Police (BSAP) commissioners, first Sherren and later Allum, all were briefed on the CBW efforts, and at least Sherren took steps to ensure that the program remained concealed. In 1977, McGuinness briefed the Combined Operations (COMOPS) commanded by Lt. General Peter Walls about the CBW effort. CBW program Participants in the Rhodesian CBW program confirmed that a small-scale, rudimentary program existed, although many details probably will never be fully disclosed. The facilities used in the CBW program almost certainly consisted of a Special Branch-funded laboratory at Professor Robert Symington's Borrowdale residence,Peter Stiff, \\"See You in November\\". Johannesburg, South Africa: Galago Publishing, 1985. and facilities at the Selous Scout \\"fort\\" outside Bindura were used. Similarly, facilities in the Selous Scout \\"fort\\" outside Mount Darwin were involved in the CBW programme.Jeremy Brickhill, \\"Zimbabwe's Poisoned Legacy: Secret War in Southern Africa,\\" Covert Action Quarterly 43 (Winter 1992‚Äì93) Starting from sometime in 1978, some of the more sensitive CBW-related activities‚Äîincluding experimentation on humans‚Äîalmost certainly took place at the Mount Darwin site, which was more remotely located than Bindura.Henrik Ellert, \\"The Rhodesian Front War: Counter-Insurgency and Guerilla War in Rhodesia, 1962‚Äì1980\\".

Among the biological agents, the Rhodesians selected for use included Vibrio cholerae (causative agent of cholera) and possibly Bacillus anthracis (causative agent of anthrax). They also looked at using Rickettsia prowazekii (causative agent of epidemic typhus), and Salmonella typhi (causative agent of typhoid fever), and toxins‚Äîsuch as ricin and botulinum toxin. Purpose Although little specific information remains available about the Rhodesian CBW effort, what is indisputable is that its primary purpose was to kill guerrillas whether they were recruits transiting to camps in Mozambique or guerrillas operating inside Rhodesia. The CBW effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts. First, the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside Rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men, recovered from hidden caches, or stolen from rural stores.Ed Bird. Special Branch War: Slaughter in the Rhodesian Bush Southern Ndebele land, 1976‚Äì1980. Solihull, UK: Helion & Company, Ltd. 2014. A second-order effect was to disrupt the relations between village supporters and the guerrillas.JoAnn McGregor. \\"Containing Violence: Poisoning and Guerrilla/Civilian Relations in the Memories of Zimbabwe's Liberation War.\\" in K. Lacy Rogers, S. Leysesdorff and G. Dawson (eds.) Trauma and Life Stories: An International Perspective. (London: Routledge, 1999)pp. 131‚Äì159 Secondly, the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into Rhodesia, forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces. Finally, the Rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their safe havens by poisoning food, beverages, and medicines. Dissemination The Special Branch also stocked contaminated goods in rural general stores in the frozen areas knowing that guerrilla groups likely would raid these stores. During Rhodesian external operations, Rhodesian forces often would add contaminated food and medical supplies to those discovered in those guerrilla camps overrun by Rhodesian troops. Similarly, guerrilla caches in the bush were replaced with contaminated supplies.John Cronin, \\"The Bleed\\", Amazon Digital Services (2014) Effectiveness Some Rhodesian officers believed that the use of CBW could have been decisive, given its effectiveness at times during the war. At times in the conflict, the Rhodesian CBW effort resulted in more insurgent deaths than did conventional Rhodesian military units. The CBW program resulted in at least 809 recorded deaths, but the true count almost certainly was well over 1,000. In the end, CBW use in Rhodesia unlikely had any meaningful impact on the conflict's termination.

Filipino Americans are more likely to suffer from mental illness than other Asian Americans due to a variety of social and economic factors. Filipino-Americans utilize mental health services less than some Asian-American groups.  Mental illness  = Suicide = According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, young Filipino women are more likely to have suicide ideation than most minorities. However, there are lower rates of committing suicide among Filipinos than Caucasians or some Asian groups. Lower rates of suicide in Filipino-Americans are attributed to the influence of Catholicism in Filipino culture and the availability of social support from extended family. = Depression = 13.6% of Filipino-Americans are diagnosed with depression. Filipino-Americans have higher rates of depression compared to other Asian-Americans (with the exception being other Southeast Asian and some South Asian American ethnic groups), Caucasians, and the majority of the American population. Filipino-Americans are estimated to have twice the depression rate as Chinese-Americans. U.S. born Filipino- Americans have greater depression rates than Filipino-American immigrants, which may be because of a stronger ethnic identity in immigrants compared to US-born Filipinos. Mothers in Filipino-American families have higher rates of acute depression than mothers of other Asian-American backgrounds. According to the findings of a study by Napholz and Wenbin, Filipina-American working women who have an equal commitment to work and relationships report having have less depression, higher self-esteem, higher life satisfaction, and lesser levels of role conflict than women who are committed to either work or relationships. In a study in Cebu, Philippines, it found that the multigenerational living arrangements of Midlife Filipina women in relation to their family, affects their mental health. For example, living in a larger household reported a higher score of depressive symptoms in mid-life Filipina women, due to stress brought on by caregiving duties and loss of privacy and control. Co-residency of adult females with their older parents, affect their mental health based on the power dynamics and their role in the family. For example, the mental and physical health of a younger adult female in the family may suffer if she is at the bottom of the hierarchy, compared to that of an older adult female in the family who may have more power and respect in the family. Having life transitions, such as losing a spouse, resulted in increasing depressive symptoms; and intergenerational co-residency, for example, transitioning from having grandchildren to no longer living with grandchildren, resulted in decreasing depressive symptoms. Filipina-American and Asian American and Pacific Islander immigrants are less likely, than any other minority group, to seek mental health care and treatment because of stigma attributed to shaming the family, self-reliance, and being reserved. Support groups and religious networks are agencies that Filipina immigrants use to alleviate the stress of adapting in another country. Providing psychoeducation and having culturally competent mental health providers are what would be helpful in the context of mental health treatment, as well as more studies and research on Filipina‚Äôs role commitment and interventions, are necessary.  Causes  = Colonialism and genetics = The after-effects of colonialism (American colonization of the Philippines from 1898 to 1946) still influence some Filipino-American immigrants. One large effect of American colonialism on Filipino-Americans' mental health is colonial mentality. Compared to Asian Pacific Islanders, Filipinos are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and are currently the number one ethnic group in the U.S. with the disorder. Studies show that Asian Americans have more serious disorders and have more prolonged stays at mental institutions than Caucasians. Filipinos also have genetic mutations that put them at high risk of bipolar disorder. = Immigration = Immigration is associated with mental illness in Filipinos. Filipino immigrants take part in fewer mental health services than other Americans. Filipino Americans were once immigrants. Filipinos are one of the largest groups of Asian-American immigrants. About 1.66 million Filipinos are immigrants. Some Filipino immigrants do not apply for programs such as Medicaid because they are worried that it would reduce their chances of becoming citizens. FIlipino immigrants can also face racial discrimination, which is associated with depression and increased substance use. Asian American immigrants are diagnosed with depression for various factors, such as not understanding English or inability to take health exams. The Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (FACES) examined situations that may cause mental illness in Filipino immigrants. Employment worries increase stress, which can cause mental illness. Males who do not know English well enough are more prone to mental illness than English speakers. Female immigrants were more likely to have long-term disorders. Males are more susceptible to disorders that lead them to depend on alcohol and drugs. = Hiya = Hiya, a Tagalog word defined as \\"a sense of shame, loss of face, or embarrassment,\\" plays a role in Filipino-Americans' use of mental health services. Hiya plays a negative role in Filipinos' ability to seek help from mental health professionals. The fear of bringing shame to oneself and the family can prevent Filipinos from seeking professional mental health aid. Hiya can also cause Filipinos to seek anonymous, online mental health help instead of in-person professional help.  Models of Filipino-American identity and experience  Several models have been constructed to characterize the Filipino-American experience. These theories include the Identity Development Model, colonial mentality and the Model Minority Myth. = Identity development model = Filipino Americans experience racial and ethnic identity development in a different way, than other Asian American groups. The Philippines was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, and came to partially identify itself with Spain. However, Filipino Americans also identify with Asian and/or Pacific Islanders, leaving Filipino Americans with the possibility of multiple (or compound) racial and ethnic identities. The identity development model contains six stages that Filipino Americans may experience as they develop their identity. These stages include: ethnic awareness, assimilation to American culture, awareness of socio-political differences, Panethnic Asian American consciousness, ethnocentric realization and introspection or acceptance. Ethnic awareness develops when an individual becomes aware of the culture associated with their ethnicity. This includes language, social activities, food, music and traditions. Typically this stage arrives during childhood. During the assimilation stage, the individual notices the differences between her ethnic culture and other cultures and assimilates with one or more such cultures. Typically this is some flavor of American culture. American values and traits are typically presented as preferable or even superior. For example, skin-whitening and bleaching products are promoted as a way to become more attractive. During the \\"Awareness of Social/Political Differences\\" stage, Filipino Americans become actively aware of traits that separate them from other cultures, often sensitized by racial and cultural injustices. Differences can be interpreted positively (e.g., by coming to appreciate Filipino culture) or negatively (via experiencing racism). The \\"Panethnic Asian-American Consciousness\\" stage occurs when individuals begin to associate with individuals of other Asian American groups and learn that such groups have much in common with them. The \\"Ethnocentric Identity and Introspection\\" stage is the rejection of a broader Asian American identity and in favor or a specific Filipino identity. The final Introspection stage is the acceptance of their other identities (e.g., as an Asian) without rejecting their Filipino heritage. = Colonial mentality = Colonial mentality is a form of internalized oppression in which an individual feels inferior because his heritage includes the experience of colonization. This mentality makes individuals feel the need to associate more towards American and/or Spanish values and traditions rather than their own, perceiving their colonizer to be superior. Filipinos hold varying degrees of colonial mentality. However, at least 50% of Filipino-Americans hold some form of colonial mentality. Cultural identity crisis may also reinforce colonial mentality through Filipino-Americans experiencing confusion on what encompasses authentic Filipino identity and culture. This leads many Filipino-Americans to believe there is no truly authentic Filipino culture and that FIlipinos are consequently inferior to Whiteness. Colonial mentality has been shown to impact the psychological well-being of Filipino Americans. Those strongly affected are more likely to have low self-esteem and could develop symptoms of depression more often than others. Colonial mentality impacts self-esteem and weakens ethnic identity, which can negatively impact mental health. The four levels of impact on an individual: self-denigration, lack of appreciation of Filipino culture, discrimination against less-cultured individuals, and tolerance and acceptance of oppression by non-Filipinos. = Model minority = Model minority is a stereotypical assumption that members of a particular ethnic group excel in areas of behavior and education. Stereotypes that apply specifically to Filipino Americans include: low divorce rate, propensity to speak English better than other Asian Americans and lower poverty rate among Asian Americans. Stereotypes of Filipino Americans include academic success among women. Model minority stereotypes pressure Filipino Americans to live up to their image. Students have been seen to question whether or not they are actually Asian if they are unable to match the stereotype. This affects the self-esteem of individuals.

In cross-sectional analyses, aerobic exercisers have lower basal total and free testosterone compared to the sedentary. Anaerobic exercisers also have lower testosterone compared to the sedentary but a slight increase in basal testosterone with resistance training over time. There is some correlation between testosterone and physical activity in the middle aged and elderly. Acutely, testosterone briefly increases when comparing aerobic, anaerobic and mixed forms of exercise. A study assessed men who were resistance trained, endurance trained, or sedentary in which they either rested, ran or did a resistance session. Androgens increased in response to exercise, particularly resistance, while cortisol only increased with resistance. DHEA increased with resistance exercise and remained elevated during recovery in resistance-trained subjects. After initial post-exercise increase, there was decline in free and total testosterone during resistance recovery, particularly in resistance-trained subjects. Endurance-trained subjects showed less change in hormone levels in response to exercise than resistance-trained subjects. Another study found relative short term effects of aerobic, anaerobic and combined anaerobic-aerobic exercise protocols on hormone levels did not change. The study noted increases in testosterone and cortisol immediately after exercise, which in 2 hours returned to baseline levels. Aerobic In trained long term aerobic exercisers, basal levels are unchanged, or decreased. Acutely, endurance based aerobic efforts cause testosterone to rise. A year long, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program increased DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40‚Äì75, but had no effect on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen. In acute assessment of hormone levels in soccer players before, during and after a game, DHT and testosterone increased during the match, but returned to baseline after 45 minutes rest. Aerobic exercise in Japanese rats done on a rodent treadmill doubled local concentrations of DHT in calf muscles as assessed by protein assay. After intense aerobic effort, high endurance athletes were also found to have lower free testosterone the next day. In prolonged endurance exercise, such as a marathon, levels ultimately decrease. Similarly, DHT drops, while adrenal androgen and cortisol will increase with the stress response. Anaerobic Effects of anaerobic exercise also vary with length of time. It is unknown if anaerobic training changes individual hormone profiles, or if conditioned athletes in studies self-selected because of physiologic predisposition to athletic conditioning. There is variation of response to anaerobic stress depending on exercise intensity, age, gender, length of time studied, and time at which serum indices were drawn. Most studies report that testosterone increases or is unchanged acutely, though some even report it to decrease. Anaerobic exercisers have testosterone levels below sedentary controls in cross sectional analysis. Over months to years, levels are stable to slightly increased. The ratio of testosterone to cortisol can both increase and decrease during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing young and old subjects showed acute increases in GH and testosterone for both, although the latter increased less in older men. Testosterone rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise. Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free testosterone. When comparing men and women in the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change. Other studies have also shown with age there is a downtrend of testosterone and attenuated growth hormone response. Young men have shown no acute change in testosterone with resistance training, with increase in cortisol and growth hormone depending on intensity. One study in young men showed testosterone acutely stable, with increase in GH and IGF-1. Similarly, a study showed testosterone did not increase in young men, women, and pubescent boys unaccustomed to weight training when corrected for plasma volume. Extreme intensity of strength training may trigger the stress response, resulting in lower testosterone levels, an effect accentuated by energy deprivation. A separate study comparing different ages, however, found no difference in acute testosterone and cortisol levels between groups, but attenuated growth hormone response in the elderly. Acutely, other studies have shown testosterone to increase. In a small group of anaerobically trained athletes, stressful training acutely even decreased serum testosterone and its ratio to cortisol and SHBG, with an increase in LH. With subsequent decompensation, testosterone was stable, but cortisol and SHBG decreased. Another case control showed with intense training followed by rest, testosterone dropped and LH increased initially. Interval and quality of exercise also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, appear to be the greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the number of sets in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance. When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals. There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite equalization of total work load (defined as load x sets x repetitions). There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs. Androgenic response was also noted in protocols using upper and lower limbs separately to a lesser degree. A number of studies have looked at effects of anaerobic exercise over months to years, showing it to be constant or slightly increased. A small case-control of anaerobic training in young untrained males over six weeks found decline in free testosterone of 17 percent. With men in their 60s, resistive training over 16 weeks did not affect baseline anabolic hormone levels, although GH increased acutely with exercise. A study over 21 weeks in male strength athletes showed basal hormone levels to be constant, despite strength increase. A follow up study looked at a larger group of weight trainers over 24 weeks, with 12-week decompensation. Training caused no change in total testosterone, but there were decreases in free testosterone, progesterone, androstendione, DHEA, cortisol, transcortin, and in the cortisol:CBG ratio, suggesting androgen turnover increased with training intensity, without change in total testosterone. A study looking at young men and resistance training over 48 weeks found increases in baseline serum testosterone from 20 ¬± 5 to 25 ¬± 5 nmol/l, and an increase in testosterone:SHBG ratio, LH and FSH. Combined training One study showed GH increase with anaerobic effort to be blunted in those who performed aerobic training for 60 minutes prior to strength training. Testosterone levels remained high only at the end of the training session with aerobic training followed by strength training, a phenomenon not seen with weight training done before aerobics. In an 11-week soccer training program focusing on combined vertical jumps, short sprints, and submaximal endurance running, total testosterone increased, but SHBG rose in parallel, maintaining a constant free androgen index.

Vorayuth was charged with speeding, fleeing the scene of an accident, and reckless driving causing death, but has never been arrested. The statute of limitations on the speeding charge expired in September 2013, and on the fleeing the scene of an accident charge in September 2017. All charges against him were dropped in July 2020. The case is widely seen as an example of how the affluent in Thai society are able to escape the criminal justice system. 2012 hit-and-run Wichian, a Thai police senior sergeant-major, was riding a motorcycle when he was hit by a speeding Ferrari which dragged his body along the road for over 100 metres before it fled the scene. The Ferrari was later found to have been driven by Vorayuth, a grandson of billionaire Red Bull co-founder Chaleo Yoovidhya. Vorayuth was found to have a concoction of illegal drugs and alcohol in his system, one of which was cocaine. Vorayuth's lawyer later claimed that Vorayuth's high blood alcohol levels were due to his drinking at home, due to stress following the accident and that he had left the scene to inform his family of what had happened. Although the police reportedly have no official record of this, Voryauth asserted that the cocaine was found in his system due to medicine administered during dental work. Vorayuth initially claimed that Suwet Hom-ubol, Vorayuth's aide and chauffeur, had been behind the wheel during the incident, but later admitted to driving the car himself. Suwet would later be charged with making false statements to the police. An investigating police officer, Police Lieutenant Colonel Pannaphol Nammueng, allegedly urged Suwet to pretend to be the Ferrari driver in the fatal hit- and-run. The case has caused continuing outrage in Thailand. Subsequent events Despite assurances by then-Police Commissioner Comronwit Toopgrajank that the case would be taken seriously, as of April 2017 Vorayuth had yet to be indicted, as his lawyers had repeatedly postponed summons by the Attorney- General, claiming illness, overseas business and unfair treatment, and the statute of limitations expired for several charges. In April 2017, Vorayuth failed for the eighth time to appear in court to answer the charges against him, citing work commitments. On 28 April 2017 the criminal court approved an arrest warrant for Vorayuth, however he had already fled to Singapore, where he abandoned his private jet. Interpol confirmed that Vorayuth left Singapore on 27 April. Thai police requested that his Thai passport be cancelled and this was done in early-May 2017. On 28 August 2017 Interpol, at the request of the Thai police, issued a Red Notice for the arrest of Vorayuth. On 24 July 2020, Thai police confirmed that all charges against Vorayuth had been dropped on instructions from the Thai Attorney General, but indicated that case could be reopened if new evidence was discovered. The Attorney General did not elaborate or provide any explanation for dropping the case. Deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen denied that the Yoovidhya family's wealth had played any part in the decision to drop the charges. News of this development led to significant public outcry and criticism from Thai academics, and a movement to boycott Red Bull products, including trending Twitter hashtags like #BossYoovidhya. On 27 July 2020, Thai police announced that Police General Jakthip Chaijinda had launched an internal investigation into irregularities with this case. Klunprasert's surviving brother expressed his dismay at the outcome, indicating frustration with the sense of impunity in Thailand's criminal justice system for wealthy and well-connected Thais.

His brother is Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. In Mexico, he was formally charged in 2015 for drug trafficking and being in possession of military-exclusive firearms. On 3 December 2015, Oseguera Cervantes was arrested while driving in Tlajomulco, Jalisco. He was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Sonora. The following year, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned him under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for providing financial and material assistance to the CJNG. A judge later released him from prison after determining that there were violations in his due process. Early life and career Antonio Oseguera Cervantes was born on 10 August 1958, in Aguililla, Michoac√°n, Mexico. He uses another formal name, Joel Mora Garibay, and often goes by his alias \\"Tony Montana\\". He reportedly has five brothers: Nemesio, Juan, Miguel, Mar√≠n, and Abraham. His criminal background dates back to the 1990s. In 1996, Oseguera Cervantes was arrested for heroin charges in the U.S. and deported to Mexico, where he renewed his drug trafficking activities. Several of his siblings were also accused of heroin distribution or other crimes in the U.S. that decade. In 2001, Oseguera Cervantes was released from a prison in Mississippi after being convicted for property damage. His brother Nemesio (alias \\"El Mencho\\") is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. Under his sibling, Oseguera Cervantes was responsible for supervising the buying and selling of firearms for the CJNG. He was also responsible for managing money laundering schemes and passing on information of law enforcement activities to the CJNG. According to Mexican security forces, he mostly coordinated the CJNG operations while based in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. On 27 October 2016, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned nine Mexican nationals, including Oseguera Cervantes, under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the \\"Kingpin Act\\") for their alleged involvement in money laundering and/or international drug trafficking. They were accused of providing financial and material assistance to his brother Nemesio and his in-law Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia (alias \\"El Cuini\\"), the two leaders of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. As a result of this sanction, Oseguera Cervantes' assets in the U.S. were frozen and U.S. citizens were prohibited from carrying out transactions with him; the other individuals sanctioned were Julio Alberto Castillo Rodr√≠guez; Gonz√°lez Valencia clan members Arnulfo, √âdgar Ed√©n, Marisa Ivette, Noemi, and Elvis; businessman Fabi√°n Felipe Vera L√≥pez and attorney Mar√≠a Teresa Quintana Navarro. Arrest On 3 December 2015, Oseguera Cervantes was driving in Tlajomulco, Jalisco, when he noticed the presence of the Federal Police and the Mexican Army. As he tried to avoid passing through them at a checkpoint near his home, the officers ordered him to stop. The police had followed his tracks for six months and knew that he was trying to live under a low profile to avoid the detection of law enforcement. Oseguera Cervantes was driving a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta, was not accompanied by a bodyguard, and claimed to be a clothing merchant. He identified himself using an ID with his other alias, Joel Mora Garibay. The police arrested him and seized his vehicle, two assault rifles, a handgun, and a package with an undisclosed amount of narcotics. The Federal Police chief confirmed his arrest the following day in a press conference. He stated that Oseguera Cervantes was a high-ranking leader of the CJNG and that his arrest was a major blow to the group's financial circle. Imprisonment and release On 4 December, he was transferred to Mexico City and sent to the SEIDO installations, Mexico's anti- organized crime investigatory agency, for his legal declaration. On 7 December, he was sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Hermosillo, Sonora. The Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) confirmed that he was charged with drug trafficking and possession of military-exclusive firearms. A federal court in Jalisco confirmed the charges on 15 December after it concluded that the PGR provided sufficient evidences against him. The court also specified that Oseguera Cervantes was found in possession of methamphetamine (1000.1 grams) with intent to distribute. On 18 December, Oseguera Cervantes' defense issued a writ of amparo to an appeal court in Mexico City and requested them to remove his charges. The court investigated the injuries he had after he was arrested, and analyzed whether he was tortured to confess or if they were a result of him resisting arrest. The court struck the injunction after it considered that the charges against him were serious in nature and that the arrest was lawful. On 15 July 2016, an appeal court in Jalisco granted Oseguera Cervantes a writ of amparo after it discovered that he was formally charged with drug trafficking and possession of military-exclusive weapons without a required signature by a judge in one of the documents used in the case. The unsigned court document contained information about fingerprint evidence that linked Oseguera Cervantes to the weapons and drugs seized at the moment of his arrest. It also included information of the defense's vehicle and his mental and behavioral exams conducted by criminal investigators. The appeal court stated that the lack of signature affected Oseguera Cervantes' legal representation and thus constituted a violation in the legal process. This pushed back the case against Oseguera Cervantes to its initial stages. He was later released from prison after a judge considered that there were violations in his due process.

They are to be distinguished from the Paaruntyi, who spoke a similar language but whom they called the spitting people. Name Parrintyi, according to one theory, meant forest dwellers in the local languages, but another view suggests it may have originated from the toponym for a creek known as the Paroo, reflecting prior tribal links. Tindale glosses this attribution by suggesting that the term may derive from a creek name, called the Paroo, reflecting prior tribal links. An exonym, mamba (devils) was once used by the Darling River aborigines, who were terrified of the Parrintyi. Country Aboriginal Tribes of Riverina. Norman Tindale estimated Parrintyi lands as encompassing roughly of tribal territory. Their land consisted of large stretches of mallee, mulga, swamp and sand land running parallel to, and east of, the Darling River. Tindale set their southern boundaries from Moira to within of Euston, and their eastern extension in the vicinity of Ivanhoe. To their west, he added, they took in Manara Range Albermarle, Carowra, Kilfera, Manfred and Willandra Lakes. Running clockwise from the north, their neighbours were the Naualko, followed by the Ngiyambaa to their east, the Yitayita on their southeastern flank, while the southern Paakantyi inhabited the land to their west. Social organization The Parrintyi were organized into clans (hordes) of which the following eight are known: * Lagerung * Murro * Milparo * Boanjilla * Pularli * Nielyi-gulli * Kurlkgulli * Karndukul. Traditional Culture Their water often was obtained from the roots of water mallee (Eucalyptus) trees and Hakea, hence their camping places were widely dispersed and often were casual. Some of the neighbours had more disparaging names for them. The Barindji, living in dry country, extracted water from hakea and mallee. In periods of drought, they would resort, in large mobs, to riverine areas in other tribal lands, engendering fear among, and conflict with, the riverine tribal groups. Their burial practices are similar to the very ancient burials at nearby Mungo Lake indicating a long time in the area.

She the eldest daughter of King Binnya U and elder half-sister of King Razadarit. Her first marriage to King Kue Na of Lan Na from 1365 to 1371 ended in a divorce. Her second marriage to Smim Maru, a wealthy son of a court official, was marred by an alleged long-running affair between Maru and her aunt Princess Maha Dewi. Early life The princess was the only child of Queen Hnin An Daung and King Binnya U. Born in Martaban (Mottama), then capital of the Mon-speaking kingdom, she was the king's eldest child. She had three other much younger half-siblings: Binnya Nwe, Tala Mi Daw and Baw Ngan- Mohn.Pan Hla 2005: 47 Queen of Lan Na Thiri's cloistered upbringing changed forever in 1363/64. That year, a coup pushed her father out of Martaban. The royal family moved to the dynasty's ancestral home Donwun, about 100 km north of Martaban. Her stay at Donwun was short. Her father sent her to Chiang Mai to wed King Kue Na of Lan Na.Pan Hla 2005: 62 It was a marriage of state designed to achieve an alliance between the kingdoms but she had a terrible time. Soon after, she began reporting back to her family that she did not enjoy her life in Chiang Mai, and begged her family to get her back. Her calls initially went unheeded. Binnya U was fighting for his survival. He was driven out of Donwun in 1369/70. By 1371, he was forced to accept to a truce with the rebel forces in which he agreed to pay the rebels in exchange for the rebels' nominal allegiance to him.Pan Hla 2005: 63 Soon after she returned to her homeland but to Binnya U's new capital Pegu (Bago). Pegu years At Pegu, the princess, still only in her early twenties, soon found a suitor in Smim Maru. Though not of royal lineage, Maru was a wealthy son of a court minister, and offered 5 viss (8.16 kg) of gold in dowry. The king had fond memories of Maru's father, who had died in action in his service, and gave his permission. A 7-day lavish wedding between Maru and the princess followed.Pan Hla 2005: 65 Her second marriage did not turn out right either. According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon, Maru was just trying to get close to power. By the mid 1370s, the power increasingly belonged to the king's elder sister Maha Dewi. The king's health had been deteriorating, and he had begun giving day- to-day duties to his sister, one person he trusted. The chronicle reports that Maru began an affair with the much older Maha Dewi about three years into the marriage.Pan Hla 2005: 67 Powerful court factions opposed to Maha Dewi made sure that the affair became public.Pan Hla 2005: 67‚Äì68 At any rate, Thiri remained married to Maru till the end. In 1383, her 15-year-old half-brother Binnya Nwe raised a small rebellion out of Dagon with help from opposing factions of the court. Maru tried to put down the rebellion but was driven back in November 1383.Pan Hla 2005: 154 After Binnya U's death on 2 January 1384, Maru tried to rally the court to back him. When it became clear that the court would back Nwe instead, Maru and Thiri tried to flee to Martaban.Pan Hla 2005: 157‚Äì158 But they did not get far and were arrested. On 5 January 1384, on the day of the coronation, the couple were tied to a pole at the royal elephant stables for all to see. The Razadarit Ayedawbon states that Maha Dewi collapsed when she saw Maru and Thiri tied to the pole.Pan Hla 2005: 160 Nwe before starting the coronation ordered Maru executed. Thiri apparently escaped the execution. The chronicle does not say that the new king, about to take the title Razadarit, ordered the execution of his half-sister Thiri.

As of 2016, she has served as Director of Undergraduate Studies in African American Studies and has been a Faculty Associate in Northwestern's Institute for Policy Research since 2004. She has formerly served as chair of the Northwestern University Department of Sociology.  Early life  Mary Pattillo was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to parents who grew up in Louisiana during segregation; Louisiana State University paid for her father to attend medical school out of state rather than enroll a black student. By contrast, in high school, post-Civil Rights Movement, Pattillo was part of a busing program to desegregate Milwaukee-area schools, a sign of the movement's significant gains; yet Pattillo also noticed continuing housing discrimination and protests against police brutality that called into question the success of the movement, a topic that became central to her scholarship. Pattillo attended Columbia University as an undergraduate, majoring in urban studies and sociology, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1991. Pattillo then earned a Master of Arts in 1994 and Ph.D. from University of Chicago in sociology in 1997.  Career  = Research = Pattillo is an ethnographer whose research focuses on the Black middle class, the intersections of race and public policy, and urban communities, particularly in Chicago. Some of her other research interests include race and ethnicity in the United States and Latin America, class stratification, school choice, criminal justice, qualitative methodologies, and African American studies. Pattillo's experiences growing up in a middle-class Black family were formative to her research and teaching. Living in a Black community in Milwaukee and moving from a segregated elementary school to being bused into a wealthy white suburban high school generated Pattillo's interest in sociology and provided her with some of the research questions she continues to answer in her studies. As Milwaukee and her current residence of Chicago are located in close proximity to each other in the Midwest, both have large, diverse, and vibrant African American communities, and both are hypersegregated, Pattillo often draws parallels between the two in writings and interviews. = Teaching = Pattillo's undergraduate and graduate African American Studies and Sociology courses include Introduction to Sociology, Cities in Society, Field Methods, Urban Ethnography, The Obama Effect, Social Meaning of Race, Housing, Community and Public Policy, Introduction to Black Social and Political Life, Researching Black Communities, Urban Poverty, and Race, Politics, Society, and Culture. = Civic engagement = Pattillo is a founding board member and current Board Vice-Chair at Urban Prep Academies, a charter high school network for boys in Chicago that educates a predominantly Black student body. She also serves as a Board Member of The Chicago Community Trust's African American Legacy Initiative and is on the Advisory Committee of the National Public Housing Museum.
