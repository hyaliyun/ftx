McCormick was a sailor in the United States Coast Guard who was recognized for his courage. McCormick was born in Portland, Oregon, and served much of his 26 year Coast Guard career in Oregon. After his 1947 retirement he made his home in Garibaldi, Oregon, where he lived another 39 years. Coast Guard career The skill and daring McCormick showed while rescuing a fellow crewmember, when in command of the USCGC Triumph, earned him the admiration of his peers. McCormick enlisted in 1921, and spent most of his career as a non- commissioned petty officer. Late in his career he was promoted to the ranks of commissioned officers, and retired as a Lieutenant, in 1947. In 1938 McCormick was the coxswain in charge of the motor lifeboat USCGC Triumph, at Point Adams Station, at the mouth of the Columbia River. Large rivers, like the Columbia, have dangerous sandbars, where the fast-flowing fresh-water, full of silt, slows where it meets ocean water. In bad weather waves break on the sandbar, representing a serious navigational danger. On March 26, 1938 McCormick took the Triumph to assist a tug trying to tow logs across the bar. One of McCormick's crew fell overboard, and McCormick, exercising great skill, was able to lead his remaining crew in a rescue that won the admiration of his peers. The rescue earned McCormick the Congressional Gold Lifesaving Medal. During World War 2 McCormick commanded Point Adams Station. In 1947 he commanded Coast Guard Station Garibaldi. Legacy McCormick received the Coast Guard Gold Lifesaving medal. In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all 58 cutters in the Sentinel class should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism. In 2014 the Coast Guard announced that the 21st cutter would be named the USCGC John F. McCormick. She was built in Lockport, Louisiana, at the Bollinger shipyards, and delivered to the Coast Guard on December 13, 2017. She was commissioned in Ketchikan, Alaska, the first cutter of her class to transit the Panama Canal, and the first to be commissioned on the west coast.

He was known primarily for cityscapes with figures and genre scenes.  Biography  He was from a family of modest means but, thanks to the generosity of an architect he met at a construction site where he was employed, he was able to gain admission to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts in Paris. His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1833 and he would continue to have showings there until 1879. A major commission came his way in 1852, when the Minister of Finance, Achille Fould, engaged him to create a painting on the subject of Dr. Ambroise Par√© performing a ligature, to replace a dilapidated fresco painted by in 1778, along with the two frescoes that framed it, in the Grand Amphith√©√¢tre of the Facult√© de m√©decine de Paris. The two adjoining frescoes were replaced with tableaux of Lanfranc and Pierre-Joseph Desault. These and the remaining frescoes by Gibelin were destroyed by a fire in 1889. The publicity engendered by this project led to several other public works, notably at St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, the Church of Saint-Merri and the Church of Saint-Sulpice. Later, he worked at the Cathedral of St Philippe in Algiers (now the Ketchaoua Mosque), La Rochelle Cathedral and Angoul√™me Cathedral..Lettre manuscrite achet√©e par les Archives D√©partementales des Ardennes, consultable sous la cote 1 J 1053, Online He had a major showing at the Exposition Universelle (1867).

It's the fifth installment in the Power Instinct series, and the second fighting game created by Noise Factory after Rage of the Dragons. The game was first released on Neo Geo arcade system on March 20, 2003, and it was one of the last games to be released on the system. The title is a compound of \\"matrimony\\" and \\"melee\\". Matrimelee ignores gameplay elements introduced in its predecessor, Groove on Fight, and goes back to 1-on-1 match structure. A few of the game elements from Rage of the Dragons were integrated to this game, such as the special meter that slowly fills up when an attack connects with an opponent and the four guest stars. In 2006, the game was released on PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan, under the new title . This port treats itself a sequel, taking place after the events from Matrimelee, with more changes in gameplay and the addition of new characters while removing the Rage of the Dragons cast.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Clara Hananokouji and Oume Goketsuji. Matrimelee discards all the characters introduced in Groove of Fight and brings back the roster from Power Instinct 2 (except Angela, Oshima, Sahad and Kinta, the latter of whom was replaced by his alter- ego, Pochi), plus 4 totally new characters and one new boss (Princess Sissy). It features four unlockable guest characters from Rage of the Dragons: Jimmy, Elias, Lynn, and Jones. In the game's story, the King of Certain Country wants to find a worthy successor for the throne and the ideal husband for his little daughter (or a beautiful and strong woman for his older son) So he holds a fighting tournament where the prize is the hand of the princess and the throne succession. The game inherits the Stress meter system from Power Instinct 2, but with further changes. The Stress meter now could be filled up to three levels. Super moves included are a Stress Shot (one bar), an Ippatsu Ougi (two bars) and a powerful, hidden super attack called a Kinjite (three bars). However, only a few of the characters have Kinjite moves. Finally, transformations are no longer possible.  Release  Matrimelee was ported to PlayStation 2 in May 25, 2006, under the title . It was released exclusively in Japan. It features enhanced graphics and sound, the return of two of the older characters (Angela Belti and Kinta Kokuin), a new boss (Bobby Strong, a comedic re-interpretation of Nigerian-Japanese personality Bobby Ologun, who provided his voice for the game), and the return of the transformation feature. Gameplay was also improved in some areas, and super attacks were made easier to execute. The game has the same backgrounds and all the characters from Matrimelee (except the four secret characters from Rage of the Dragons), while the game's story takes place after the events from the previous game, making it a sort of sequel or update. The game tells the story of the king from the previous game, who holds a \\"Bonnou Kaihou\\" (\\"Liberation of Lusts\\") tournament to cheer up his daughter Princess Sissy. This time the prize is anything that the winner could wish for (except the throne succession). This version also features an online mode and a 'Lust Cards System' that consists of buying cards with special effects. Some allow the player to change certain characteristics of the characters, others are used to view special music video clips, and others to call strange characters to help the player in battle.

In 2018, he was sentenced to 123 years imprisonment. He was dubbed \\"The Tinaco Killer\\".  Background  Luis Oscar Jim√©nez was born in Durango City, within a dysfunctional family in which his father mistreated his mother. Growing up, he developed a deep contempt for women. According to unofficial sources, he has been the victim of sexual abuse in his childhood. Jim√©nez also served in the Mexican Army, and by the time of his arrest he already had a criminal record for minor crimes in Tamaulipas.  Crimes  = Murder of Mar√≠a Atino Garc√≠a = On October 30, 2010, in Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potos√≠, the body of 29-year-old Mar√≠a Atino Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez, from Aquism√≥n, was found inside an empty tinaco on the roof of a furniture store, apparently strangled to the point where her cervical vertebrae had been broken. At that time, Luis Oscar was arrested and proposed as a suspect in her murder. He was on vacation with a woman named Gloria Mart√≠nez, who allegedly was his wife, and they were staying at the Hotel San Cosm√©. Gloria claimed that on the night of October 29, Jim√©nez had met Mar√≠a Atino and arranged to have sex in exchange for money; he later confessed to sleeping with, but not killing her. According to the statements of the hotel receptionist, the victim had left the hotel that night. Luis Oscar ended up being released. = Serial murders = The rest of the murders attributed to Jim√©nez began in 2013, in Nuevo Le√≥n. His modus operandi consisted of gaining the victim's trust, after which he would take them to hotels where they would have sex. When they wanted to leave, Luis Oscar would become enraged and assaulted them, first hitting the women to incapacitate and subsequently strangle them. His last known victim was a 46-year-old woman named Rosa Griselda Alvarado Flores, a resident of Apodaca. Alvarado's body was found handcuffed in downtown Monterrey, on May 6, 2016, with bruises on the face. According to Jim√©nez's statements, she had charged him with 200 pesos for sex and were together for about an hour. When she decided that she wanted to leave, they began arguing and he began beating Alvarado until she was unconscious, strangling her to death afterwards. Once dead, he tied her hands and feet.

This concept was first described in 2008 at the DEF CON hacking convention by Robert Graham and David Maynor as part of a talk entitled, ‚ÄúBringing Sexy Back: Breaking in with Style‚Äù, that included various penetration testing methods. In their implementation, an iPhone box was modified to include a larger battery, which powered a jailbroken iPhone. A first-generation iPhone was chosen for this attack based on the reported run-time of 5 days when coupled with an external battery, whereas newer 3G iPhones of the era would reportedly run for 1¬Ω days. A Social engineering (security) pretext was described that would trick the recipient into believing they had won an iPhone, in order to explain the shipment. The advancement of low-power electronics, thanks in part to Maker culture, has greatly increased the effectiveness of this methodology as a credible method of attacking networks. In 2019, IBM X-Force Red coined the name ‚ÄúWarshipping‚Äù and described an attack platform that included several low- cost components that could be combined, shipped to targets, and controlled remotely for 2-3 weeks. A solar component was also described to allow the devices to run indefinitely. Aspects of a modern warshipping attack include the following: * Devices that are hidden from the recipient, potentially inside objects or inside the packaging material or box structure itself. * Command and Control (C2) capability via a dependable communication medium. Most commonly this is provided via cellular modems. * A power management strategy that allows the device to operate for weeks. Solar panels may be utilized to lengthen the run-time of the device. * One or more devices used for the operational attack. These can include radios that are built for protocols such as Bluetooth, Wireless LAN, Near Field Communication (NFC), and software-defined radio (SDR) devices for capturing multiple types of protocols. Microphones, cameras, and other capture devices could be included as well. * Global Positioning System (GPS) technology for reporting on the location of the device, allowing the activation of certain capabilities upon delivery to its target. * Passive triangulation to get around GPS signal issues The increasing use of large, online retailers contributes to the relevancy of this attack. In 2019, the United States Postal Service reports that they deliver 484.8 million mailpieces per day. The name is by analogy with wardriving and wardialling.

Taxonomy  A species described by Adam Yates, published in 2015, emerging from a study of the left dentary of a thylacinid obtained at the Curramulka fossil site in South Australia. The holotype had been examined by Neville Pledge, who remarked on the possibility of a new species in 1992. The specific epithet combines the name of the region it was discovered, the Yorke Peninsula, and the Latin ellus, a diminutive suffix that denotes a species that was smaller than Thylacinus cynocephalus.  Description  holotype, three views of the incomplete left dentary A comparatively small species of Thylacinus that is known to have existed during the late Miocene epoch. The author of the species suggests that evidence supports the species existing during that later Pliocene. The holotype of the species, the dentary, retains the three pemolars, two of four molars, the canine, and alveoli of the incisor and missing second molar. The specimen was broken at the third molar, so presents no evidence of the fourth. An estimated weight for two known specimens, calculated with regression functions applied to dasyuromorphian data, is noted as 17.8 and 15.9 kilograms. The average body mass of T. cynocephalus was greater than this estimate, around 30 kg, and the species was much smaller than range of estimated weights, 38.7 to 57.3 kg, for Thylacinus potens and Thylacinus megiriani.

Biography  Paul Knochel was born in Strasbourg. He studied chemistry at the IUT (Institut Universitaire de Technologie) in Strasbourg, then at the ENSCS (√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Chimie de Strasbourg). From 1979 to 1982, he completed his thesis entitled \\"Nitroallyl-halogenide und -ester als effiziente Verkn√ºpfungsreagenzien\\" at ETH (Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule) Zurich (Switzerland) in Prof. Dieter Seebach's group. He then spent 4 years at the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) at the Pierre et Marie Curie University in Paris in the group of Prof. Jean-Fran√ßois Normant. During this period, he studied carbozincation reactions using allylic reagents and prepared bimetallic compounds bearing two different metals (Lithium, Magnesium or Zinc) on the same carbon atom. He then joined Prof. Martin F. Semmelhack's laboratory for a post-doctoral fellowship during which he worked on the use of indoles-chromium complexes in organic synthesis. In 1987, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (MI, USA) where he developed the first methods for the preparation of polyfunctional organometallic zinc species. In 1991, he was promoted to Professor at the same University before moving to Marburg (Germany) in 1992, where he was offered a position as Professor of Organic Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry at the Philips-Universit√§t University. He continued his work on the chemistry of polyfunctional organozinciques and their use in asymmetric synthesis. In 1999, he was offered a position as Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t - LMU) which he still holds in 2019.

It was the worst military crisis in Chile in decades and contemporaries even considered the possibility of a civil war among the Spanish.Barros Arana 2000, p. 365. The uprising marks the beginning of a ten‚Äìyear period of warfare between the Spanish and Mapuches.Molina 1809, p. 294. Background =Parliament of Boroa= Mapuches would have been unhappy with the terms of the Parliament of Boroa signed on January 24, 1651.Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 83. Almost everything agreed then was in favour of the Spanish, including prohibition for the Mapuche to wear weapons unless the Spanish ask them to do so. Peace was first compromised only two months later by a new episode in the Spanish‚ÄìCunco conflict. Jesuit fathers Diego de Rosales and Juan de Moscoso wrote to Governor of Chile Antonio de Acu√±a Cabrera that renewing warfare on the Cuncos would evaporate gains obtained at Boroa.Barros Arana 2000, p. 341.Barros Arana 2000, p. 342. While the Spanish sent initially some minor punitive expeditions against the Cunco through this conflict the Spanish found that tribes that had pledged to come to their aid in war declined to join Spanish forces. =Spanish‚ÄìCunco conflict = Cuncos, a peripheral southern Mapuche group, had a long history of conflict with the Spanish.Alcam√°n 1997, p. 30. Cuncos had previously forced the Spanish to abandon the city of Osorno on October 1602. Cuncos were not present at the Parliament of Boroa. In March 1651 a Spanish ship was about to arrive to the newly re-established Spanish exclave of Valdivia when storms pushed the ship south into Cunco lands where it wrecked. The ship carried important supplies and salaries from the Real Situado.Barros Arana 2000, p. 340. Two punitive expeditions were assembled to advance on Cunco lands, one from Valdivia in the north and one from Carelmapu in the south. Governor of Valdivia Diego Gonz√°lez Montero advanced south with his forces but soon found but soon encountered natives were indifferent and even misled him with false rumours. His troops ran out of supplies and had to return to Valdivia. Captain Ignacio Carrera Yturgoyen who advanced north from Carelmapu reached the site of the old city of Osorno. There he was approached by Huilliches who handed over three suspects who were killed. After this, the expedition of Carrera Iturgoyen returned south. The loot was never recovered despite the Spanish searching for the wreck. Over-all the Spanish military was dissatisfied with the results.Barros Arana 2000, p. 343. =Spanish slave hunting= Albeit there was a general ban of slavery of indigenous people by Spanish Crown the 1598‚Äì1604 Mapuche uprising that ended with the Destruction of the Seven Cities made the Spanish in 1608 declare slavery legal for those Mapuches caught in war.Valenzuela M√°rquez 2009, p. 231‚Äì233 Mapuches \\"rebels\\" were considered Christian apostates and could, therefore, be enslaved according to the church teachings of the day.Foerster 1993, p. 21. In reality, these legal changes only formalized Mapuche slavery that was already occurring at the time, with captured Mapuches being treated as property in the way that they were bought and sold among the Spanish. Legalisation made Spanish slave raiding increasingly common in the Arauco War. The uprising took place in a context of increasing Spanish hostilities on behalf of maestre de campo Juan de Salazar who used the Army of Arauco to capture Mapuches and sell them into slavery.Barros Arana 2000, p. 346. In 1654 a large slave-hunting expedition ended in a complete disaster at the Battle of R√≠o Bueno.Barros Arana 2000, p. 347.Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 79. This setback did not stop the Spanish who under the leadership of Salazar organized a new expedition the summer of 1655.Barros Arana 2000, p. 348. Salazar himself is said to have profited greatly from Mapuche slave trade and being brother-in-law of governor Antonio de Acu√±a Cabrera allowed him to exert influence in favour of his military campaigns. As the slave raiding expedition of 1655 was being prepared indios amigos begun to express unease. Governor Acu√±a Cabrera was told by his wife Juana de Salazar this was all about rumours spread by some soldiers envyous of her brother.Barros Arana 2000, p. 349. Juan Ignacio Molina mentions toqui Clentaru as the main leader of the Mapuches forces. Uprising =1655= Salazar begun his campaign on February 6 starting from the frontier fortress of Nacimiento. In all the expeditionary army was made up of 400‚Äì700 Spanish soldiers and larger number of indian auxiliaries, numbering in total 2000 men. Other estimates put the total at 2400 men.Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 80. As in the year before the expedition did was not aimed at the Mapuche next to frontier but towards the so-called Cuncos who lived in F√ºtawillimapu south of Bueno River. In the morning February 14 Mapuches all over southern Chile ‚Äîfrom Osorno to Maule River‚Äî launched attacks against Spanish estancias, forts and individuals. Mapuche slaves rose against their masters, men were killed while women and children were held hostages. Livestock was stolen and houses set afire. Spanish forts were besieged. Over-all the Spanish reported over 400 estancias between B√≠o B√≠o and Maule rivers being destroyed. Amidst the chaos some Mapuche insurgents ran into the city of Concepci√≥n penetrating as deep as two city blocks from the Plaza de Armas.Barros Arana 2000, p. 353. Mapuches succeeded in isolating the city from the rest of the Spanish possessions but did not besieged it. Arauco and Chill√°n were besieged. This last city was eventually evacuated by the Spanish. The audiencia in Santiago criticized the evacuation as an act of cowardice and prohibited Chill√°n's refugees to flee north beyond Maule River.Barros Arana 2000, p. 360. That was meant so the Chill√°n refugees would return to repopulate the lands they fled.Barros Arana 2000, p. 361. The fact that a smallpox epidemic broke out among the refugees was also a reason to limit their movement. Evacuation of Buena Esperanza and Nacimiento Acu√±a Cabrera ordered the evacuation of Buena Esperanza, this move was later criticized as Buena Esperanza was in good conditions to be defended.Barros Arana 2000, p. 350. Jos√© de Salazar, brother of Juan, was in charge of the garrison of Nacimiento decided to evacuate the fortress in order to avoid a lengthy siege. As the evacuation was done in boats and rafts drifting downstream B√≠o B√≠o River with the goal of coming to Buena Esperanza. Soon however they learned that Buena Esperanza had been evacuated. Plans were made instead to fortify themselves at San Rosendo, an abandoned fort. As the Spanish rafts and boats were being followed by about 4,000 hostile Mapuches on both sides of the river, they ran aground near Santa Juana. All the 240 Spanish were subsequently killed. The expedition return to Concepci√≥n Juan de Salazar whose forces made up the bulk of the Army of Arauco learned about this when arriving near Mariquina, far south from the main events of the uprising. Instead of returning north by land he proceeded south to Valdivia where he embarked with 360 and sat sail to Concepci√≥n.Barros Arana 2000, p. 359. This was possible as there were two ships in the harbour that had arrived with payments of Real Situado to the garrison that was constructing the Valdivian Fort System there. Remaining forces, 340 Spanish and 1700 Indian auxiliaries, were left reinforcing Spanish positions around Valdivia. Soon however the indian auxiliaries deserted and returned to their homes by land. The reinforcements of Valdivia were however enough to repel attacks by the \\"cuncos\\".Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 81. The arrival by sea of Juan de Salazar's army remnants to Concepci√≥n allowed Fern√°ndez de Rebolledo to send 200 men by sea to evacuate Arauco. This done De Rebolledo went on to defeat Mapuches near Concepci√≥n. Reinforcements from Peru Learning about the situation of Chile the newly appointed Viceroy of Peru Luis Enr√≠quez de Guzm√°n sent a ship with provisions, armament and munitions to Chile.Barros Arana 2000, p. 362. =1656= More ships from Peru arrived around new year, bringing more provisions, armament and munitions as well as 376 soldiers. Ahead of this reinforcement was the new governor Pedro Porter Casanate who assumed office on January 1, 1656. Porter managed to have the Spanish from Santiago send troops to guard the area around Itata River. This allowed him to use the army at Concepci√≥n to defeat local Mapuches at Battle of Conuco on January 20, 1656. On February 1656 Porter sent an army of 700 foot soldiers and some cavalry to Boroa where a Spanish garrison had been besieged for ten months. The expedition easily repelled Mapuche attacks and rescued the Spanish at Boroa. In 1656 the Mapuches of Santa Mar√≠a Island captured a ship and five Spanish crew that had anchored there. Alejo's raids As peace was returning to the devastated lands between B√≠o B√≠o and Maule rivers Alejo begun his raids the winter of 1656. Alejo had previously served the Spanish as a soldier but resented not being allowed to advance trought the ranks because of him being a mestizo. Ahead of about 1000 warriors Alejo wiped out a Spanish column of 200 men aimed to reinforce the fort of Conuco.Pinochet et al. 1997, p. 82. A few men were spared for prisoner exchange and human sacrifice to the pillan. Alejo's military successes were limited by his tendency to make rowdy celebrations after each victory, wasting valuable time.Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 84. The Pehuenches, a peripheral indigenous group, crossed the Andes at the headwaters of Maule River taking prisoners and stealing livestock. It is thought that this attack may have been coordinated by Alejo. Over-all the campaigns of Alejo took a toll of 400 Spanish killed or made prisoners. Conflict among the Spanish leadership On February 20 a cabildo in Concepci√≥n declared Acu√±a Cabrera deposed as governor. However Acu√±a Cabrera went into hiding. Jesuits who hid him then persuaded Acu√±a Cabrera to issue a written resignation.

The Ben Lettery An Oige youth hostel is on the southern slopes of Benlettery, off the N59 road to Clifden. Naming According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, the townland of Lettery (, meaning \\"wet hillsides\\") is on the south slope of Benlettery. Tempan notes an alternative name of Bindowglass or \\"Bendouglas\\" (, meaning \\"peak of the black stream\\") was recorded as early as 1684 by Irish historian Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Flaithbheartaigh. √ì Flaithbheartaigh chronicled about a pool of water on the summit which turns the hair white of anyone who washes in it. Geography Benlettery is the southernmost peak of the Twelve Bens and lies at its western edge. Benlettery is connected to the range by a high northerly ridge to the peak of Bengower ; this ridge forms a fork which also connects neighboring Benglenisky to Bengower. Benlettery is one of the six Bens that form a horseshoe around the valley of the Glencoaghan River (also known as the Glencoaghan Horseshoe). Unlike most of the other main Bens, Benlettery is below 600-metres in elevation, however, its relative positioning at the southern end of the range, and its \\"pyramidal\\" summit (when viewed from the south), means that is often featured as a scenic backdrop to the Ballynahinch Castle and the Ballynahinch Lake. Ben Lettery Connemara Youth Hostel On the southern slopes of Benlettery is the 40-bed \\"Ben Lettery Connemara Youth Hostel\\" (Benlettery spelt as two words), owned and operated by An Oige, the Irish YHA; it was ranked by Outside.ie as one of the ten best An Oige youth hostels in Ireland. Hill walking As with Derryclare , on the east side of the Glencoaghan Horseshoe, Benlettery's accessibility makes is a popular peak as a standalone 5-kilometre 2-3 hour climb (starting and ending at the Ben Lettery An Oige youth hostel); however, the high ridge Benlettery shares with the peaks of Bengower and Benglenisky, means that it is also climbed as part a 7-kilometre 3-4 hour horseshoe loop-walk with these peaks. Benlettery is part of the 16‚Äìkilometre 8‚Äì9 hour Glencoaghan Horseshoe, considered one of Ireland's best hill-walks; and of the even longer Owenglin Horseshoe, a 20‚Äìkilometre 10‚Äì12 hour route around the Owenglin River taking in over twelve summits.

It was formed as the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment in 1938 and served in the Transcaucasian Military District, participating in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. Sent to Crimea to fight in the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, it suffered heavy losses.  Prewar  The 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment was formed on 1 April 1938 at Baku in the Transcaucasian Military District from the 120th Separate Fighter Aviation Squadron. The latter was formed between 10 July and 19 August 1932 in Baku as the 14th Fighter Aviation Squadron, and redesignated the 120th Separate Fighter Aviation Squadron in March 1933. The regiment was equipped with Polikarpov I-16 and I-15bis fighters, and formed part of the 60th Aviation Brigade of the Air Forces (VVS) of the Transcaucasian Military District. Major Ibrahim Dzusov, later promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the regiment from 25 April 1939. It was re- equipped with more modern Yakovlev Yak-1 fighters in May 1941, and after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, in June, the regiment was reorganized to a structure that included three aviation squadrons and a total of 32 combat aircraft from its prewar structure of four squadrons with 63 combat aircraft as combat losses reduced the size of fighter regiments.  World War II  With the VVS of the district, the 45th IAP participated in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran from 25 August and remained as part of the Soviet occupation forces in northern Iran until 22 October. Returning from Iran later that month, it became part of the 8th Fighter Aviation Corps (IAK) of the Air Defense Forces. The regiment was transferred to the front on 9 January 1942 and on the next day entered combat over Crimea as part of the 72nd Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) of the VVS Crimean Front. Lieutenant Vasily Sharenko was credited with the regiment's first known victory on 29 January when he claimed a Heinkel He 111 bomber in an air battle over Bagerovo. With the 72nd IAD, the regiment flew 1,087 sorties with the loss of 27 aircraft and 6 pilots. Following the destruction of the Crimean Front, the regiment was transferred to the 236th IAD of the VVS North Caucasian Front on 12 May, with which it flew 109 sorties without loss. As a result of its losses in Crimea, the regiment received nine pilots and twelve Yak-1s from the 237th IAP, and left the front for rebuilding. From 10 June, the regiment was operationally controlled by the commander of the Sevastopol Defense Region of the VVS Black Sea Fleet during the Siege of Sevastopol. During the siege, the regiment flew 168 sorties, losing eight aircraft and two pilots. During the month, the regiment was reorganized to include two squadrons with a total of twenty aircraft. As Sevastopol fell, the regiment was returned to the 236th IAD on 28 June, now part of the 5th Air Army of the North Caucasian Front, with which it flew sixty sorties without loss. The regiment was transferred to the 230th Assault Aviation Division of the 4th Air Army of the Southern Front on 11 July and to the 216th IAD of the same air army (now part of the Northern Group of Forces of the Transcaucasian Front) on 26 July. The regiment flew 274 sorties and lost three aircraft with the 230th, while it flew 756 sorties with the loss of eleven aircraft and four pilots with the 216th IAD. The regiment was pulled out of combat and sent to the 25th Reserve IAP at Adzhikabul on 20 September for rebuilding. It was reorganized there in December to include three squadrons with a total of 32 combat aircraft, and retrained on the American Lend-Lease P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters until 20 February. Two squadrons received the Airacobra and the remaining squadron the Kittyhawk. The 45th reentered combat on 26 February as part of the 216th Mixed Aviation Division (the former 216th IAD), still part of the 4th Air Army of the North Caucasian Front. It operationally used the Kittyhawks during March and April and in August handed them over to PVO units. Dzusov was promoted to command the 216th Division on 17 May and replaced by Major Borey Sayfutdinov. For its \\"exemplary performance of combat missions and demonstrated courage and heroism\\", the regiment became the 100th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (GIAP), an elite Guards unit, on 17 June. At the same time, the 216th became the 9th Guards IAD (GIAD), which the regiment served with for the rest of the war. With the North Caucasian Front, the regiment flew 1,010 sorties with the loss of sixteen aircraft and twelve pilots. Airacobra of the type flown by the regiment during the later years of World War II With the 9th GIAD, the regiment transferred to the 8th Air Army on 1 August and flew combat missions with it as part of the Southern Front (the 4th Ukrainian Front from 20 October). With the division, the 100th GIAP was operationally subordinated to the 17th Air Army of the Southwestern Front between 15 and 21 August and relocated to the 17th Air Army area of operations. Sayfutdinov was replaced by Major Sergey Lukyanov on 2 October; Lukyanov commanded the regiment for the rest of the war, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made a Hero of the Soviet Union. With the Southern and 4th Ukrainian Fronts, the regiment flew 2,153 sorties with the loss of 21 aircraft and eleven pilots. The regiment and its division were withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) on 11 January 1944 to receive replacement personnel and aircraft. While in reserve, the regiment was reorganized to include three squadrons with a total of forty combat aircraft. The 100th GIAP and its division returned to the front on 7 May, part of the 5th Air Army of the 2nd Ukrainian Front although operationally subordinated to the 7th IAK of the RVGK. With the 2nd Ukrainian Front, the 100th GIAP flew 476 sorties with the loss of nine aircraft and seven pilots. The regiment and its division were transferred as part of the 7th IAK to the 8th Air Army, now part of the 1st Ukrainian Front, on 8 July. With the corps and its division, the regiment was shifted to the 2nd Air Army of the front on 31 July, and on 27 October the corps became the 6th Guards IAK of the RVGK. For its contribution to the capture of Czƒôstochowa, Przedb√≥rz, and Radom during the Sandomierz‚ÄìSilesian Offensive, the regiment was awarded the name of Chenstokhov (the Russian name of Czƒôstochowa) as an honorific on 19 February 1945. With the 1st Ukrainian Front, the 100th GIAP flew 2,130 sorties with the loss of nine aircraft and three pilots. Ending the war with the 9th GIAD on 11 May, the regiment received the Order of Alexander Nevsky on 26 May for its \\"exemplary performance of combat missions and demonstrated courage and heroism\\" in the breakthrough on the Neisse and the capture of Cottbus, L√ºbben, Zossen, Beelitz, Luckenwalde, Treuenbrietzen, Zahna, Marienfelde, Trebbin, Rangsdorf, Dietersdorf, and Keltow. On 4 June it was further decorated with the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class, for its actions in the elimination of the Halbe pocket. The regiment flew 2,454 sorties in 1942, 3,158 in 1943, 1,300 in 1944, and 1,311 in 1945. It reported the destruction of a hundred aircraft in 1942, 211 in 1943, 95 in 1944, and 41 in 1945. The regiment lost 49 aircraft on operations in 1942, 37 in 1943, sixteen in 1944, and two in 1945. In addition, eighteen aircraft were lost for non-operational reasons. Of the lost aircraft, fifty were Yak-1s, two were Kittyhawks, and seventy were Airacobras. Of 61 pilots lost during the war to all causes, most were in 1942 and 1943.  Postwar  Between May and June 1945, the regiment was based at Riesa-Canitz airfield with the division. The regiment relocated with the 6th GIAK to Austria on 7 June, joining the 2nd Air Army as part of the Central Group of Forces; it was based at Absdorf-Eisenstadt airfield. While in Austria, the regiment was re-equipped with the P-63 Kingcobra in 1946. The 100th GIAP was renumbered as the 789th, its division as the 237th GIAD, and the 2nd Air Army as the 59th Air Army on 10 January 1949 when the Soviet Air Force renumbered its units. At the time, it was based at Trausdorf. It was retrained on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighter between March and December 1951. With the division, it was relocated from Austria to Kaliningrad Oblast, where it became part of Soviet Naval Aviation in October 1952. The division was assigned to the VVS of the 4th Fleet on 25 April 1953, and in 1956 joined the VVS of the reunified Baltic Fleet. The 789th GIAP was relocated with its division to Murmansk Oblast in March 1958, where it became part of the VVS of the Northern Fleet. It was disbanded in mid-1960 during reductions of fighter units.

No other portrait of Marlowe is known to exist. The portrait is of a man, 21 years old, and expensively dressed. He wears a doublet, possibly velvet, with rows of golden buttons. The pattern on the doublet is made by cuts in the cloth, showing the lining under. The man's stated age and the date on the painting match Marlowe's time at the college, but the evidence is inconclusive, and it could be another student. The latin motto in the upper left corner reads \\"Quod me nutrit me destruit\\", in English \\"That which nourishes me destroys me\\". The portrait has become firmly associated with Marlowe, and is often used to depict him. It hangs in the dining hall at Corpus Christi College.

Charles IV created the Bohemian Crown lands on the foundation of the original Czech lands ruled by the P≈ôemyslid dynasty until 1306, together with the incorporated provinces in 1348. By linking the territories, the interconnection of crown lands thus no more belonged to a king or a dynasty but to the Bohemian monarchy itself, symbolically personalized by the Crown of Saint Wenceslas.  History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1348‚Äì1526)  = Luxembourgs = The Luxembourg dynasty reached its high point, when Charles was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1355. By his Imperial authority he decreed that the united Bohemian lands should endure regardless of dynastic developments, even if the Luxembourgs should die out. In 1367 he purchased Lower Lusatia from his stepson Margrave Otto V of Brandenburg and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Beside their home County of Luxembourg itself, the dynasty held further non-contiguous Imperial fiefs in the Low Countries, such as: the Duchy of Brabant and Duchy of Limburg, acquired through marriage by Charles' younger half-brother Wenceslaus of Luxembourg in 1355; as well as the Margraviate of Brandenburg purchased in 1373. As both the King of Bohemia and the Margrave of Brandenburg had been designated Prince-electors in the Golden Bull of 1356, the Luxembourgs held two votes in the electoral college, securing the succession of Charles's son Wenceslaus in 1376. With King Wenceslaus, the decline of the Luxembourg dynasty began. He himself was deposed as King of the Romans in 1400. The Duchies of Brabant, Limburg (in 1406), and even Luxembourg itself (in 1411) were ceded to the French House of Valois-Burgundy; while the Margraviate of Brandenburg passed to the House of Hohenzollern (in 1415). =During Hussite Wars= Nevertheless, the joint rule of the Bohemian Lands outlived the Hussite Wars and the extinction of the Luxembourg male line upon the death of Emperor Sigismund in 1437. =From the Jagiellons to the Habsburgs= Vladislas II of the Jagiellon dynasty, son of the Polish king Casimir IV, was designated King of Bohemia in 1471, while the crown lands of Moravia, Silesia, and the Lusatias were occupied by rivaling King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. In 1479 both kings signed the Treaty of Olomouc, whereby the unity of the Bohemian crown lands was officially retained unchanged and the monarchs appointed each other as sole heir. Upon the death of King Matthias in 1490, Vladislas ruled the Bohemian crown lands and the Kingdom of Hungary in personal union. When Vladislas' only son Louis was killed at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526 ending the Jagiellon dynasty rule in Bohemia, a convention of Bohemian nobles elected his brother-in-law, the Habsburg archduke Ferdinand I of Austria, as the new king of the Bohemian crown lands. Together with the Archduchy of Austria \\"hereditary lands\\" and the Hungarian kingdom, they formed the Habsburg Monarchy. During the reign of King Ferdinand I from 1526, the lands of the Bohemian Crown became a constituent part of the Habsburg Monarchy, which in the following centuries grew out of the Holy Roman Empire into a separate European power.

Distancing itself from pre-WWII fascist ideas such as anti-intellectualism, anti-parliamentarianism and traditional French nationalism, Europe-Action promoted a pan-European nationalism based on the \\"Occident\\"‚Äîor the \\"white peoples\\"‚Äî and a social Darwinism escorted by racialism, labeled \\"biological realism\\". These theories, along with the meta-political strategy of Venner, influenced young Europe-Action journalist Alain de Benoist and are deemed conducive to the creation of GRECE and the Nouvelle Droite in 1968.  History  = Background: 1958‚Äì1962 = In his 1962 manifesto titled Pour une critique positive (\\"For a positive critique\\") that he wrote while in prison, former Jeune Nation member Dominique Venner abandoned the myth of the coup de force, convinced that a political revolution would not be able to happen before a cultural one. The latter could be achieved via the public promotion of nationalist ideas until they achieve popular support. For Venner, intellectual persuasion and violence both had their place; but his movement had to favor ideas over action. He also aimed at removing \\"old ideas\\" from pre-WWII nationalism and fascism, such as anti-parliamentarianism, anti- intellectualism, or a form of patriotism reduced to the boundaries of the nation-state. The text was deemed influential in nationalist circles, Fran√ßois Duprat describing For a positive critique as their equivalent of What is to be Done?, a political pamphlet written by Lenin 16 years before the Bolshevik Revolution. They held an ambiguous view of Nazism, Europe-Action stating via Maurice Bard√®che that \\"next to genial intuitions, Hitler made mistakes\\", which \\"are largely due to a lack of established doctrinal foundations\\".Nazism: \\"A German popular movement that was called to power in 1933 under the leadership of its leader Adolf Hitler. In five years of peace, he deployed tremendous energy and transformed Germany into an innovative country in social, legal and economic terms (...). He achieved German unity and mobilized the people in a powerful lyrical exaltation. National Socialism has been described as a youth dictatorship. Alongside brilliant intuitions, their mistakes resulted in their loss: hypertrophy of the notion of the leader; romantic (non-scientific) racism only intended to reinforce a narrow, vengeful, aggressive nationalism; reactionary European politics that not only led to their defeat, but also to the general hostility of the European peoples. These errors are largely due to a lack of established doctrinal foundations\\" (Maurice Bard√®che. \\"National- socialisme\\". In \\"Dictionnaire du militant\\", Europe-Action n¬∞5, May 1963, p. 65) They were also influenced by the \\"Manifesto of the Class of '60\\", published three years before the founding of Europe-Action, in which the pro- colonial founders of the Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN) committed themselves to \\"action of profound consequence\\", as opposed to the \\"sterile activism\\" of street violence alone previously promoted by Jeune Nation in the 1950s. While still deeply committed to the cause of French Algeria, the members of Europe-Action chose to take into account the new world emerging from decolonization and the consolidation of the French Fifth Republic. They consequently tried to theorize a radical right ideology based on materials other than Vichy nostalgia and Catholic traditionalism. = Political activism: 1963‚Äì1966 = Europe-Action was launched in January 1963 by Dominique Venner as a nationalist movement escorted by a magazine of the same name, in which Alain de Benoist and Fran√ßois d'Orcival soon became journalists. Jacques Ploncard d'Assac initially wrote for the magazine but soon denounced his anti-Christian stance and left in August 1963.Europe- Action, n. 8, Aug 1963 ‚Äî \\"French nationalists, even agnostics like Maurras, have always recognized the Christian character of the French ethnic group. There is therefore an incompatibility between atheistic materialism and the very object of French nationalism.\\" The editing company of the magazine, Soci√©t√© de Presse et d'√âdition Saint-Just, was founded in November 1962 by Venner, Suzanne Gingembre, the spouse of former OAS treasurer Maurice Gingembre, and Jacques de Larocque-Latour, a racist caricaturist. Pierre Bousquet, a former Waffen-SS, later joined the company. In 1964, De Benoist became the editor-in-chief of the weekly publication Europe-Action hebdomadaire. Along with the Federation of Nationalist Students, Europe-Action supported the far-right candidacy of Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour in the 1965 presidential election through the \\"T.V. Committees\\". After a dispute between the leader of Occident, Pierre Sidos, and the campaign director Jean-Marie Le Pen, Europe-Action volunteers replaced Occident as a support group in the Comit√© Jeunes (\\"Youth Committee\\") of Tixier-Vignancour. Venner's movement used its militant base to organize demonstrations against Algerian immigration. From June 1965 to 1966, Jean Mabire was redactor-in-chief of Europe-Action. After the electoral demise of Tixier-Vignancour, head members of Europe-Action founded in 1966 the European Rally for Liberty (REL), along with by young nationalists from the Federation of Nationalist Students. Europe-Action hebdomadaire became the organ for the European Rally for Liberty during the campaign, and was replaced by a short-lived magazine named L'Observateur Europ√©en. The REL was only able to run 27 candidates during the 1967 legislative election and failed at 2.58% of the votes. This electoral debacle is cited as conducive to the foundation of the ethno-nationalist think tank GRECE and the development of Nouvelle Droite meta-politics. The magazine released its last issue in November 1966 following the bankruptcy of its publishing house. Europe-Action ended definitively in the summer 1967 after a failed attempt to relaunch the publication. It had an estimated circulation of 7,500 to 10,000. The symbol of Europe-Action was a hoplite helmet.  Views  The movement developed two main thesis: a \\"biological realism\\" composed of racialism and social Darwinism; and a pan-European nationalism built on a common Western civilization seen as the link between the peoples of the \\"white race\\". Those ideas were to be promoted through a meta-political strategy until the achievement of cultural dominance. = Biological realism = \\"Biological realism\\", a concept coined by French neo-fascist activist Ren√© Binet in 1950, promoted the establishment of individual and racial inequalities upon pseudo- scientific observations. Binet argued that \\"interbreeding capitalism\\" (\\"capitalisme m√©tisseur\\") aimed at creating a \\"uniform inhumanity\\" (\\"barbarie uniforme\\"); and that only \\"a true socialism\\" could \\"achieve race liberation\\" through the \\"absolute segregation at both global and national level.\\"Ren√© Binet, Th√©orie du Racisme, s.e., Paris, 1950, pp. 16-35 Europe-Action also drew influence from the so-called \\"message of Uppsala\\", a text likely wrote in 1958 by French neo-fascists related to the New European Order, and deemed influential on European far-right movements that followed as it carried out subtle semantic shifts between \\"differentialism\\" and \\"inequality\\". The ideas of Binet and \\"Uppsala\\", characterized by a worldwide \\"biological-cultural deal\\" where each group would remain sovereign in its own region, foreshadowed both the racialism of Europe-Action and the ethno-pluralism of GRECE. Following the Algerian independence in 1962, Europe-Action was among the first to oppose Algerian immigration (labeled \\"invasion\\"). The group defended a racial rather than geographical nationalism, proclaiming race to be \\"the new homeland, the homeland of the flesh which should be defended with an animal- like ferocity.\\" Opposed to ethnic mix, they called for remigration, arguing that \\"race mixing [was] nothing more than a slow genocide\\".Gilles Fournier, \\"La guerre de demain est d√©j√† d√©clench√©e\\", Europe-Action, n¬∫ 16, April 1964, p. 21 Calling for an end to development aid towards former colonies, they feared a future France \\"occupied by twenty million Maghrebi Arabs and twenty million Negro-Africans\\". Europe-Action promoted the project of creating a genetically improved social elite along with, \\"without futile sentimentality\\", the elimination of \\"biological waste\\",Europe-Action, Jul-Aug 1964, p. 20 \\"not through massacres but through eugenic processes\\". They proposed to \\"eliminate biological foam\\" by \\"returning the mediocre elements of this class to their ranks and retain the valid elite\\" only, in order \\"not to allow the biological growth of waste\\".Europe-Action, Jul-Aug 1964, p. 20. = Euro-nationalism = Their conception of Europe was not limited to the continent, and described as a \\"heart whose blood beats in Johannesburg and in Quebec City, in Sydney and Budapest, aboard white caravels and spaceships, on every sea and in every desert in the world.\\"Europe-Action, Jul-Aug 1964, p. 3. Europe-Action issue of June 1964 indeed grouped the US, France and South Africa together, as mere \\"provinces of this large motherland that is the white race.\\"Taguieff, Pierre- Andr√©. \\"La Nouvelle droite √† l‚Äô≈ìil nu\\" (1), Droit et libert√©, December 1979. The \\"Dictionary of the militant\\", published in Europe-Action in May 1963, defined the Occident as the \\"community of the white peoples\\", the people itself being defined as a \\"biological unity confirmed by history\\".\\"Dictionnaire du militant\\", Europe-Action, n¬∞ 5, May 1963, pp. 73-74 The following definition of nationalism is thus given: \\"doctrine that expresses in political terms the philosophy and the vital necessities of the white people\\".\\"Dictionnaire du militant\\", Europe-Action, n¬∞ 5, May 1963, p. 26 According to political scientist St√©phane Fran√ßois, this world view was influenced by the V√∂lkisch idea of an organic entity gathering those of the same blood, the same culture and same destiny. Rejecting both the Europe of the nation-states advocated by the Gaullists and the United States of Europe endorsed by the Christian democrats, Europe-Action supported a racialist Europe based on its ethnic groups. This project would have united white peoples of Europe in a powerful imperial entity, completed by an alliance with white-minority-ruled states like Rhodesia or South Africa. = Meta-politics = Initially conceived as a think thank founded on a magazine, Europe-Action gradually evolved towards a political movement. Seeking to oppose the anti- intellectualism that had been a major hindrance to the right in the battle of ideas‚Äînotably against the Marxist set of concepts‚ÄîVenner aimed at establishing a new radical right doctrine to be spread in wider society and bring about a nationalist cultural revolution. He progressively accepted the democratic institutions and the emergence of a post-fascist society, arguing that Europe- Action had to show the bureaucracy they were capable of running a state to win their support. Describing Europe-Action members as \\"militants of a white nation\\", Venner concluded that nationalists should infiltrate organizations, \\"however small, including unions, local newspapers, even youth hostels\\" in order to disseminate their ideas.Europe-Action, May 1963, pp. 50‚Äì1  Legacy  Political scientist St√©phane Fran√ßois describes Europe-Action as \\"the main structure in France that bridged WWII activists and the young post-war generations\\". Jean-Yves Camus further adds that the \\"transition from French nationalism to the promotion of European identity, theorized by Europe-Action in the mid-1960s, disrupted the references of the French far-right by producing a gap that has not been repaired to date, separating integral sovereignists, for whom no level of sovereignty is legitimate except the Nation-State [...] from the identitarians, for whom the Nation-State is an intermediate framework between being rooted in a region (in the sense of the German \\"Heimat\\") and belonging to the civilized framework of Europe.\\" Europe- action theories indeed formed the ideological foundations of the think tank GRECE in 1968, and the magazine-movement has been described as the \\"embryonic form\\" of the Nouvelle Droite. The latter however distanced themselves from Europe-Action's anti-communism and pro-colonial stance, in order to develop a critic a liberal capitalism and adopt a Third-Worldist point of view. Many founding members of the ethno-nationalist think tank were indeed formerly involved in the magazine. GRECE and the Nouvelle Droite inherited a number of themes from Europe-Action, among them \\"the anti-Christian stance, a marked elitism, the racial notion of a united Europe, the seeds of a change from biological to cultural definitions of \\"difference\\", and the sophisticated inversion of terms like racism and anti-racism\\". Another group led by Pierre Bousquet, Jean Castrillo, and Pierre Pauty established the magazine Militant in 1967. They were later among the founders of the Front National in 1972, and at the origin of the French Nationalist Party in 1983.

He currently serves as a Governor of Zamboanga del Norte. Early life and career Uy was born on December 28, 1952 in Mapang, Rizal, Zamboanga del Norte. His parents, Isaias Ang Uy and Francisca Yu Uy are businesspeople who would pave the way in Dipolog's local business scene. He took up his elementary education at Dipolog Community School (formerly Dipolog Chinese School), then he took up his secondary studies at Chiang Kai Shek College in Manila. He took up a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Adamson University. Before entering politics, he worked with his father in managing their family businesses, which include a hotel and pension house, a fast food restaurant, a hardware store, and sale of copra. Political career For an unspecified period prior to his election as city mayor, Uy served as Officer in Charge-Barangay Captain of Barangay Central, an urban barangay of the city. =Mayor of Dipolog= Uy started his political career when he was elected and sworn as City Mayor of Dipolog from 1998 to 2007. As he is term-limited and barred from running for a fourth term, Uy ran for Governor of Zamboanga del Norte in 2007, but was defeated by Governor Rolando E. Yebes. Uy briefly retired from politics. =Governor of Zamboanga del Norte= In 2013, Uy made his return to politics after he was elected and sworn in as Governor of Zamboanga del Norte in 2013 and 2016. In 2019, another candidate for governor was running under the name \\"Roberto Escobido Uy\\", which is similar to Uy's name. The Commission on Elections declared the candidacy of \\"Roberto Escobido Uy\\" as nuisance, making the incumbent governor the legitimate candidate to participate. Uy won the 2019 election, securing a third and final term in office. Controversies =Suspension= Sometime after being reelected in the 2016 local election, Uy was suspended by the Office of the Ombudsman for three (3) months for simple misconduct. The Ombudsman found Uy guilty of simple misconduct for the termination of 6 Provincial Government employees, hired under the administration of former Governor Rolando Yebes, since assuming office in 2013. =Illegal drug connections= In a privilege speech made in the House of Representatives on September 21, 2016, Rep. Seth Frederick \\"Bullet\\" Jalosjos of Zamboanga del Norte's 1st District linked Uy and the police to the drug trade in the province. Uy, who at the time was facing suspension for simple misconduct by the Ombudsman, denied the claims made, and challenged Jalosjos to a debate which led to a congressional hearing right after. Personal life He is married to Evelyn Tang Uy who also served as mayor of Dipolog (2007-2016), and had 7 children together, including Roberto Jr. who was mayor of Municipality of Polanco (2013-2016), and Darel Dexter who is mayor of Dipolog (2016-Present). He was a businessman working with his father's business prior to joining politics. His business portfolio includes hotel and sale of copra.

He was a wealthy partner in the Imhoff trading company. In his youth, Imhoff stayed in his family's trading offices in Lyon and Antwerp to learn wholesale and long-distance trade. In 1540-42 he traveled to France and then to 1544 Spain. In 1545 he married Anna Harsd√∂rffer (1528-1601), daughter of Wolff Harsd√∂rffer and Ehrentraud Welser. Even after that he regularly made trips to Lyon and Zaragoza as a partner of the trading company. Since Willibald Pirckheimer died without male descendants in 1530, his library and a large part of his art possession passed to Willibald Imhoff. The art collection was successively expanded by Imhoff as the Imhoff art cabinet and included among other works by his grandfather's close friend Albrecht D√ºrer (including his Portrait of Johann Kleberger) works by Holbein, Cranach, Titian and Paris Bordone. He bought a large number of ancient and contemporary statues and busts made of marble or clay, a rich copperplate collection, numerous drawings by famous masters, faience, Venetian glasses, and expanded the Pirckheimer library. After the death of Andreas D√ºrer (Albrecht's brother) Imhoff was able to acquire numerous works by Albrecht D√ºrer. Imhoff also collected coins and he cataloged the coin collection of Duke Albert V of Bavaria.

History =2000s= The authoritative report Language Trends has been published annually since 2002 by the British Council.Language Trends =2010s= Since 2014 the National Curriculum for England has required that Key Stage 2 from 7-11 must learn a language, and for Key Stage 3 from 11-14 this must be a modern language. Academies, Free schools and independent schools do not have to follow the National Curriculum. New 'de-coupled' A-levels were introduced in 2016, with the first exams in 2018. There would be no more AS-level resit exams; due to this there has been a decline in language A-level entries in state and independent schools. In 2018, new modern language GCSEs were introduced in England and Wales. In January 2019, the National Centre for Excellence for Languages Pedagogy (NCELP) was established at the University of York, to coordinate modern language education in England, with nine school hubs across England; of the nine schools, two are grammar schools and two are faith schools. In 2017, a survey by the CBI found that employers most need people with skills and fluency in French, German and Spanish. From 2010 to 2018, French GCSE entries dropped by 29% and German GCSE entries dropped by 37%. But Spanish GCSE entries from 2010 to 2018 rose considerably. Numbers of modern language GCSE entries have been steadily dropping.Telegraph July 2019 From 2011 to 2018, French A-level entries have dropped from around 12,000 to just under 8,000. According to Joint Council for Qualifications, language GCSE entries have halved since 2005. There was a slight increase in French GCSE entries in 2018 and 2019; entries for Spanish are on course to overtake entries for French by 2030. Nations =England= In selective schools in England, around 75% take modern languages GCSEs; for comprehensive schools, the take-up at sixteen is around 30%. =Northern Ireland= Northern Ireland has an exclusively-selective education system; modern languages are broadly well-taught at selective schools.

About 70% of primary schools deliver languages in- house, often with a HLTA, a type of teaching assistant who is not QTS standard. Some primary schools work with local secondary schools or sixth form colleges for language training for primary teachers. Around 10% of primary schools have overseas visits, and about 10% participate in eTwinning or the Comenius programme (itself part of the Socrates programme) whereby the scheme involves teacher exchanges abroad. Another project is MEITS - Multilingualism: Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies. =England= Since the National Curriculum requirement in 2014, French is offered at around 75% of primary schools, with Spanish at about 25% and German at about 5%, with about 45 minutes per week of language learning per school. Many primary schools rely on the KS2 schedule for languages. KS2 schedule Secondary level Many language teachers are female; in some secondary schools all language teachers are female, supplying limited role models for some teenage males.Language Trends 2020 =England= The EBacc was introduced in 2011, which had a language requirement: only around 38% of state secondary schools in England complete the Ebacc. For the EBacc, the uptake of languages is the only (stipulated) subject requirement that has a gender divide of uptake, as at state secondary schools it is not legally compulsory to study a modern language after the age of 14 (KS3), although many grammar schools do make it compulsory. Languages at GCSE are much more popular at single sex secondary schools than for co-educational state secondary schools; many grammar schools are also single sex schools. There is no gender difference at KS3 for independent schools, as many independent schools have compulsory MFL teaching up to the age of 16. In 2018, fewer than one half of sixteen year olds took a modern language at GCSE. Sixth-form level Excluding Scotland, modern languages are taught at A -level, with French being most popular (around 8,000) followed by German (around 3,000).SCILT University level Teaching of modern languages at university is well-represented by universities such as those in the Russell Group, but in other universities, such teaching is not represented.

History  Companyia d'Aig√ºes de Sabadell was founded in 1949. In September 1989, a group of shareholders launched a petition requesting the resignation of Jos√© Casas, President of Cassa, and Jordi Buxeda, the company's secretary. In 1999, its revenue grew by 18%. In 2000, Aig√ºes de Sabadell extended its services to 10 new Spanish municipalities. In 2005, the company financed the exhibition Som Aigua. La nova cultura de l'aigua presented at the Maritime Museum of Barcelona. In 2010, the Grupo Agbar, which already owned 11,3% of Cassa, led an OPA on the Companyia d'Aig√ºes de Sabadell, but the board replied that Sabadell's shareholders will not accept to sell. One of the board members Manuel Bustos, is also the mayor of Sabadell. In July 2013, the Grupo Agbar completed the acquisition of 78% of Aig√ºes de Sabadell for 24 million euros. In July 2013, the company announced the launch of a SMS alert system to warn its clients of any interruption of service.

Based in part on her own personal journals, the book tells the story of a young Inuk woman growing up in the Canadian Arctic in the 1970s. The book has been described as a blend of fiction, memoir, poetry and Inuit folklore. Characterized by its publisher as magic realism, it has also been characterized as an example of Daniel Heath Justice's critical concept of \\"wonderworks\\", or literature by Indigenous writers that defies conventional Western notions of literary genre. The book won the Indigenous Voices Award for English Prose in 2019. It was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2018 Scotiabank Giller Prize, and was shortlisted for the 2019 Amazon.ca First Novel Award. Background Split Tooth was written by Tanya Tagaq based on journal entries, poems and short stories that she had written over the previous 20 years. Tagaq was raised in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, and attended high school in Yellowknife before finding success in Toronto performing Inuit throat singing. At 43 years old in 2018 when Split Tooth, Tagaq's first and only book was published, she had already released four studio albums and appointed to be a Member of the Order of Canada. Summary Through a series of alternating short prose, poems and illustrations, the Inuk narrator recollects aspects of growing up in a small Nunavut town in the 1970s. The unnamed adolescent girl protagonist lives in the tundra landscape, spends time with friends, copes with sexual abuse, witnesses domestic violence, experiences Inuit culture and religion, and gives birth. Style and themes The book is divided by unnumbered chapters with poems and illustrations in between pieces of short prose. The prose is written with a poetic quality and moves the narratives along. The poems include one written in Inuinnaqtun, a dialect of an Inuit language. The illustrations are all full-page, black-and- white drawings by Chicanx artist Jaime Hernandez. The book integrates some of the author's real life background and experiences, fiction and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit. For example, the story of Sedna is related as a counterpoint to the 1970s Panarctic Oils seismic testing. The publisher categorizes the genre as magical realism, as the author noted Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez as being an influence, though it also fits within the genre of Bildungsroman. The book has been cited as an example of the genre \\"wonderwork\\" as described by literary academic Daniel Heath Justice, being Indigenous literature that defies conventional Western notions of literary genre. Among the themes is that of interconnectedness: \\"life and death, tenderness and violence, everyday existence and the spectacular spirituality inherent in nature are one and the same\\". The setting cycles through alternating the \\"24-hour day and perpetual night\\" of the high arctic. Like her last album Retribution the theme of rape is also prevalent throughout the work: \\"the rape of women, of children, of traditional lands, the shame brought on Indigenous people by these assaults, by the residential school system...lost languages, grinding poverty, generational trauma.\\" Publication and reception Split Tooth was published by Penguin Books imprint Viking Press and released on September 25, 2018. An excerpt was published in The Walrus and it charted for several weeks on The Globe and Mail's Canadian fiction bestseller list. It was awarded an Indigenous Voices Award, longlisted for the 2018 Giller Prize, the 2019 Sunburst Award and nominated for the Amazon.ca First Novel Award while the author was shortlisted for the Kobo Emerging Writer Prize and the book designer Jennifer Griffiths was given to the Alcuin Society Award for Excellence in Book Design in Canada. At the same time, an audiobook version voiced by Tagaq was released and nominated for an Audie Award and a version translated into French by Sophie Voillot was published by Alto, titled Croc Fendu, and longlisted for the Prix des libraires du Qu√©bec. The review in the Quill & Quire stated \\"Like a smirking teenager, Split Tooth blithely gives typical literary expectations the finger, daring us to see and experience narrative as chaotic, emotional, and deeply instinctive. And it succeeds.\\" The review in the Winnipeg Free Press concluded that the book's \\"triumph\\" is describing a real life that \\"overflows with the supernatural, the unexplained, the unknown\\". In La Presse, the reviewer wrote \\"Tanya, she likes the right words, the precise, the poetic.\\" Another reviewer stated \\"This is definitely a work to admire for how the author has told the story and what it has to offer, rather than one to enjoy.\\" Quill & Quire editor, Sue Carter, writing in the Toronto Star, noted that Split Tooth, along with Cherie Dimaline's The Marrow Thieves also released in 2018, shows that there is now \\"a broad demand for Indigenous-authored books.\\" References Category:2018 Canadian novels Category:Books by writers from peoples indigenous to the Americas Category:Canadian bildungsromans Category:Canadian magic realism novels Category:Inuit literature Category:2018 debut novels ","title":"Split Tooth"},{"id":"61469774","title":"Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Men's Intercontinental qualification squads"},{"id":"61469780","text":"Teter-Klyuch () is a rural locality (a village) in Podlubovsky Selsoviet, Karaidelsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The three divisional winners, seeded first through third, and a fourth team‚Äîdetermined by the AL Wild Card Game‚Äîplayed in two series. These matchups were: * (1) Houston Astros (West Division champions) vs. (5) Tampa Bay Rays (Wild Card Game winner) * (2) New York Yankees (East Division champions) vs. (3) Minnesota Twins (Central Division champions) The higher seeded team of each series hosted Games 1, 2, and (if necessary) 5, while the lower seeded team hosted Game 3 and (if necessary) 4. For the third straight year, Major League Baseball sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series. This ALDS was sponsored by Doosan and officially known as the 2019 American League Division Series presented by Doosan. The Yankees and Astros won their series to advance to the American League Championship Series. Background Seeds one through three were determined by regular season winning percentages among division- winning teams. Those seeds were locked in as of the completion of games of September 27. The final seed was the winner of the American League Wild Card Game. The top seed, the Houston Astros (winner of the American League West), had home advantage against the fifth-seeded Tampa Bay Rays, who defeated the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card Game. In the regular season, Tampa Bay won the season series against Houston 4‚Äì3, with three of their four wins coming at home to open the season. The second seed, the New York Yankees (winner of the American League East), had home advantage against the third seed, the Minnesota Twins (winner of the American League Central). The Yankees won four of six games against the Twins in the regular season. In a three-game series in Minneapolis in July, the teams combined for 57 total runs and 20 home runs. The Yankees and Astros both appeared in the ALDS the prior season, while the Twins made their first ALDS appearance since 2010, and the Rays made their first ALDS appearance since 2013. Overall, this was the Yankees' 21st ALDS appearance, the Twins' seventh, the Rays' fifth, and the fourth for the Astros (who had seven NLDS appearances during their time in the National League). Matchups =Houston Astros vs. Tampa Bay Rays= =New York Yankees vs. Minnesota Twins= Houston vs. Tampa Bay This was the first time that the Astros and Rays met in the postseason. =Game 1= Jos√© Altuve hit the only home run of Game 1 Justin Verlander and Tyler Glasnow traded scoreless frames for the first four innings before Jos√© Altuve broke the tie with a two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth inning. It was Altuve's fifth home run in an ALDS Game 1 in the last three seasons. He hit three in Game 1 of the 2017 ALDS and one in Game 1 of the 2018 ALDS. Two more runs would score in the inning on a dropped pop-up error on Rays' second baseman Brandon Lowe. Verlander would keep the Rays bats silent for the next two innings, striking out the side in the top of the seventh to put the finishing touches on seven innings of one-hit baseball with eight strikeouts. The Astros would tack on two more runs in the bottom of the seventh on back-to-back doubles by Yordan √Ålvarez and Yuli Gurriel. Ryan Pressly would relieve Verlander in the eighth but would surrender two runs on consecutive hits by Eric Sogard and Austin Meadows before Will Harris got Ji-man Choi to ground out to end the inning. Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth inning to seal the Game 1 win for Houston. =Game 2= Gerrit Cole struck out 15 batters in Game 2. Gerrit Cole and Blake Snell, like Justin Verlander and Tyler Glasnow in Game 1, traded scoreless innings for the first three innings before Alex Bregman broke the tie with a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth inning. Cole kept the Rays bats silent for 7 innings and struck out 15 batters, the most in a postseason game since Roger Clemens in the 2000 ALCS. Meanwhile, the Astros tacked on another run in the seventh inning on a bloop single from Mart√≠n Maldonado and then scored their final run on a Carlos Correa single. Roberto Osuna relieved Gerrit Cole with two outs in the eighth and retired Yandy D√≠az. Osuna started the ninth inning and ran into trouble immediately. He gave up back to back singles to Austin Meadows and Tommy Pham to start the inning and walked Ji-man Choi to load the bases. Osuna got Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a to ground into a forceout that scored Meadows from third. He then walked Brandon Lowe to load the bases again and was subsequently relieved by Will Harris with one out in the ninth inning. Harris then retired Travis d'Arnaud and Kevin Kiermaier to end the game and seal the Game 2 victory for Houston. =Game 3= Kevin Kiermaier hit a three-run home run in Game 3 Zack Greinke was given the ball to try and help the Astros sweep the Rays. Charlie Morton was his mound opponent. The Astros got to work early on Morton, with Jos√© Altuve hitting a solo homer to get the Astros on the board. Greinke retired the Rays in order to begin his outing, but in the second inning, it went sour for Greinke. He retired Ji-man Choi to start the second, allowed a single to Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a, got Brandon Lowe to ground out, hit Travis d'Arnaud with a pitch and Kevin Kiermaier hit a three-run home run that gave the Rays their first lead in the series. Morton settled into his outing after the first, throwing five innings of one-run baseball. Meanwhile, the Rays kept scoring runs, adding a run in the third inning with a Choi home run, and they broke the game in the 4th inning, getting a home run from Lowe, an Austin Meadows two-run double and a Tommy Pham single to put the Rays up 8‚Äì1 and chased Greinke from the game. The Astros would chip away at the deficit with a Yuli Gurriel two-run single that made it 8‚Äì3. That would end the scoring for the Astros. Meanwhile, the Rays added to their lead, with a Willy Adames solo home run and a d'Arnaud sacrifice fly to capped the scoring for the Rays. Colin Poche retired the Astros in order and allowed the Rays to play a Game 4. =Game 4= Game 2 starter Blake Snell earned a save in Game 4. The Rays struck first against Justin Verlander who was pitching on three days rest. Tommy Pham hit a home run with Travis d'Arnaud and Joey Wendle adding RBI base hits all in the first inning. Willy Adames added another solo shot off Verlander, ending his night in the fourth. Robinson Chirinos spoiled the Rays' shutout with a home run of his own. With the tying run at the plate in the top of the ninth and one out, Blake Snell struck out Yordan Alvarez and induced a ground ball out from Yuli Gurriel to force the decisive Game 5. =Game 5= Michael Brantley was 2-for-3, including a home run, in Game 5. With the series tied at two games apiece, this was the second ALDS Game 5 for both teams; Tampa Bay lost their prior Game 5 appearance in 2010, and Houston lost their Game 5 appearance in 2015. Houston had only one NLDS Game 5 appearance when they competed in the National League, a win in 2004. The Astros struck early on an RBI single by Altuve, a two-run double by Bregman, and an RBI single by Yuli Gurriel in the span of five batters. Eric Sogard would lead off the next inning with a solo home run and would be the final time the Rays had an extra base hit in the game. Cole would pitch eight innings while striking out ten. It was his 11th consecutive game with 10+ strikeouts including the regular season. Michael Brantley and Jose Altuve went back-to-back in the bottom of the 8th inning to bring the lead to 6‚Äì1. Altuve's home run was the 11th in his postseason career, the most by any second baseman in baseball history. Roberto Osuna came on to close out the game in the ninth, striking out Ji-man Choi swinging to end the series. The 6‚Äì1 win sent Houston on to the ALCS to face the New York Yankees. The Astros became the first team since the 2011‚Äì13 Detroit Tigers to appear in the ALCS in three consecutive seasons. Combined with his Game 2 start, Cole struck out 25 hitters during the series, setting a new Major League Division Series record. =Composite line score= 2019 ALDS (3‚Äì2): Houston Astros defeated Tampa Bay Rays. New York vs. Minnesota This was the sixth postseason match-up between Minnesota and New York. The previous five meetings were the 2003 ALDS, 2004 ALDS, 2009 ALDS, 2010 ALDS, and the 2017 AL Wild Card Game‚Äîwith the Yankees winning each of those prior meetings. This was just the second time the ALDS featured a match-up of two 100-win teams, following the Boston Red Sox and Yankees meeting during the 2018 ALDS. =Game 1= Game 1 winning pitcher Tommy Kahnle With their loss to the Yankees in Game 1, the Twins took sole possession of the record for the longest postseason losing streak in MLB history, at 14 games. =Game 2= Didi Gregorius hit a grand slam in Game 2. Randy Dobnak, making his postseason debut, allowed an opening double to DJ LeMahieu and a walk to Aaron Judge. He got Brett Gardner to fly out but gave up a single to Edwin Encarnaci√≥n to give the Yankees a 1‚Äì0 lead. Things would go very wrong for the Twins in the bottom of the third, as Dobnak allowed a single to Judge, a walk to Gardner, a single to Encarnacion to load the bases and was relieved by Tyler Duffey. Giancarlo Stanton hit a sacrifice fly to give the Yankees a 2‚Äì0 lead. Duffey then gave a single to Gleyber Torres to make it 3‚Äì0 Yankees. Duffey proceeded to hit Gary S√°nchez with a pitch to load the bases again and then gave up a grand slam to Didi Gregorius to blow the game open. Masahiro Tanaka went five innings and gave up one run. Jonathan Lo√°isiga gave up the second Twins run and struck out Miguel San√≥ to end the game and send the Yankees to Minneapolis with a 2‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 3= Aroldis Chapman earned a save in Game 3, as the Yankees advanced. Gleyber Torres opened the scoring with a solo home run to left in the second, followed by a Brett Gardner single in the next frame which drove in Gio Urshela. Didi Gregorius continued to haunt the Twins with another RBI single, making the score 3‚Äì0 in the seventh. Eddie Rosario homered off Zach Britton to pull the Twins within two, but the Yankees added two insurance runs in the ninth on a Cameron Maybin homer and Gregorius scoring Torres on another hit. Luis Severino labored through four scoreless innings, getting out of a bases loaded no out jam in the second, before giving way to the bullpen. Aroldis Chapman, who entered in the eighth, got the save. Chapman was aided by Gregorius leaping to catch a Jorge Polanco line drive for the second out of the ninth before Nelson Cruz struck out looking to end the series and send the Yankees to their 17th ALCS. The loss gave Minnesota its 16th straight postseason defeat, 13 of those in games against the Yankees; and their 28th straight year without winning the title. =Composite line score= 2019 ALDS (3‚Äì0): New York Yankees defeated Minnesota Twins.

The village's population is less than 900. The village is crossed by the Finnish regional road 132 (Mt 132) that runs between the Loppi church village and Klaukkala. The center of the village was formerly known as Talvio. At that time, the center was about one kilometer from the present center of the village towards Helsinki, around Soltinmutka. With the Hyvink√§√§‚ÄìKarkkila railway built in 1912, the center of the village moved to its current location.

The name Talvio was removed from the addresses and the whole area was renamed L√§yli√§inen. The village lived its golden age in the 1950s, absorbing the railroad. There were over 1,500 inhabitants and there were two banks, four shops, a dairy, a furniture and leather factory, a movie theater and a guesthouse. But with the dismantling of the railway and the construction of Finnish national road 3 between Helsinki and H√§meenlinna was completed in the 1960s, the population of the L√§yli√§inen began to decline and services shrink. Over the years, L√§yli√§inen has gained a reputation as a \\"sleeping suburb along the way\\". On the bypass along Klaukkala, the southernmost village of Nurmij√§rvi, the municipality of Loppi has set high expectations for a new boom in the village's population. Today, L√§yli√§inen has two grocery stores (Sale and K-Market), a hardware and agricultural store, two bars (Bar BarooniBAR PAROONI ‚Äì ETUSIVU and KetunkoloRavintola Ketunkolo) which also serves lunch and barbecue, a post office, one florist's shop, a craft shop, a primary school, a nursery and Neste's gas station with a Rolls hamburger restaurant, a hairdressing salon, a physical grooming service and a taxi. Upper school, high school, pharmacy, health center and Alko are approximately 12 kilometers away in the church village of Loppi. In early 2018, the pharmacy's remote service point will also operate at another grocery store. You can order prescription drugs at a remote point and buy, for example, first aid kits. There is also a forest processing unit of the Forest Research Institute. Until 2000, it was the seat of the Forest Processing Foundation and a breeding establishment. The site has a special breeding park for domestic species of wood.

In map projections, an interruption is any place where the globe has been split. All map projections are interrupted at at least one point. Typical world maps are interrupted along an entire meridian. In that typical case, the interruption forms an east/west boundary, even though the globe has no boundaries.https://www.mapthematics.com/Downloads/Gores.pdf The design of globe gores Most map projection can be interrupted beyond what is required by the projection mathematics. The reason for doing so is to improve distortion within the map by sacrificing proximity‚Äîthat is, by separating places on the globe that ought to be adjacent. Effectively, this means that the resulting map is actually an amalgam of several partial map projections of smaller regions. Because the regions are smaller, they cover less of the globe, are closer to flat, and therefore accrue less inevitable distortion. These extra interruptions do not create a new projection. Rather, the result is an \\"arrangement\\" of an existing projection. Goode homolosine projection of the world using interruptions to reduce distortion of the continents. In casual parlance, interrupted projection usually means a projection that has been interrupted beyond mathematical necessity. In this casual sense, the usual east/west interruption of a pseudocylindric map is ignored as an interruption to focus on the elective interruptions. An archetypical example is the Goode homolosine projection. In 1916, John Paul Goode experimented by interrupting the Mollweide projection. Satisfied with the interruption scheme, he then devised a new projection as a composite of the Mollweide and the sinusoidal projection and applied the same interruption scheme to the new projection, which he dubbed \\"homolosine\\". Globe gores, yielding small enough sections to paste onto a globe without splitting the paper or warping it too much. Because pseudocylindric projections map parallels as straight lines, and meridians to have constant spacing, they are easy to interrupt. This is normally done to optimize either for continental areas or for oceanic areas, as explored by Goode. Conformal version (1929) of Cahill's butterfly. Many interruption schemes that are much more elaborate have been developed. Since antiquity, for example, globe gores have been developed in order to paste map sections onto model globes. These are regular interruption either along the equator, or in polar form as \\"rosettes\\".

Biography  The son of an engineering officer, Mikhail Ashenbrenner studied with the First Moscow Cadet Corps, and was discharged in 1860, with the rank of lieutenant. As an officer, he and a group of comrades studied the natural sciences, and studied Feuerbach, Darwin, and Spencer. In 1864, he was deported to Turkestan for refusing to take part in suppressing the Polish Uprising against Russian rule. He lived in a remote part of Bessarabia until the outbreak of the Russo- Turkish War in 1877, and then in Kherson province. From 1880, all his energy was devoted to organising revolutionary groups in the military. His work was assisted by the respect that officers had for him. In 1882, the central military circle in St Petersburg urged local circles to get actively involved in Narodnaya Volya. Ashenbrenner was delegated to go round the military circles across Russia, enlist correspondents for a military-revolutionary journal and recruit delegates for a congress of local groups, but while he was doing so, the military wing of Narodnaya Volya was eliminated by mass arrests, after being betrayed by the police informer, Sergey Degayev. Ashenbrenner was arrested in March 1883, and was a defendant at the Trial of the 14, alongside Vera Figner and others, in September 1884. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He spent 20 years in the Schlisselburg fortress, until his release on 20 September 1904. He then lived under police supervision in Smolensk. After the Bolshevik Revolution, he was allocated a place in Ilych Home for Revolutionary Veterans. His memoirs were published in the journal Byloe in 1906, and reissued as a separate publication with the title The Military Organisation of People's Will in 1942.

The union was founded in December 1861 as the London United Societies of Cordwainers, bringing together fifteen small unions of London shoemakers and bootmakers. It proved highly successful, and within two years it had 4,300 members in 84 branches across the city. Some of these branches were highly radical, with the West End Ladies' Shoemakers, led by George Odger, and the West End Boot Closers, led by Charles Murray, both affiliating to the First International. In March 1863, the union renamed itself as the Amalgamated Society of Cordwainers, adopting the name used by a defunct union from 1845. In 1868, members of the men's city branch went on strike, aiming to achieve a 10% pay increase. At its peak, the strike involved 2,000 workers, but it was unsuccessful, and with the branch in arrears, it was struck off. It worked with the West End and Marylebone branches, which had previously left, to campaign against the Cordwainers, but it rejoined early in the 1870s. With many of its London branches gone, the union managed to establish itself across the UK, and by the start of 1874, it had 8,306 members, with only 990 in London. In 1873, the union renamed itself as the Amalgamated Society of Boot and Shoe Makers, hoping to recruit the lower-paid rivetters and finishers, many of whom worked in factories. This saw some success, but most riveters and finishers felt that the society did not represent their interests, and split away in February 1874, forming the National Union of Boot and Shoe Rivetters and Finishers. The union lost a significant proportion of its membership to its new rival, but it survived, focusing once more on workers hand-making shoes and boots, although it had a few machine workers as members, especially in Leicester. It soon reached a non-compete agreement with its rival, and in 1878 the two unions launched a joint recruitment campaign. By 1892, the union's membership had rebounded to 5,376 members. This gradually fell, dropping to only 1,448 by 1910. In the 1920s, the union renamed itself as the Amalgamated Society of Boot and Shoe Makers and Repairers, and it maintained its membership under the long-term leadership of secretary Peter Brennan and president William Joseph Jarrett.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.426-427 In 1955, it merged into the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, by which time it had only 861 members remaining.

In 2018, she was elected the breakout female player in the Brasileir√£o by the Brazilian Football Confederation, having scored 14 goals in 35 games for Ponte Preta. Early life  Kerolin was raised by her mother and was estranged from her father. The family lived in Bauru, then moved to Campinas, where they lodged on a farm as they could not afford to pay rent. When she was 12 years old Kerolin was hospitalised with osteomyelitis and cellulitis in her leg and advised to stop playing contact sport.  Club career  Kerolin was among several promising young footballers to emerge from the youth system of Valinhos Futebol Clube, a women's team run by the local authority's sports and leisure department and coached by Ana L√∫cia Gon√ßalves. Valinhos agreed a collaboration with Guarani FC in January 2016, to enter the 2016 Campeonato Paulista de Futebol Feminino as Guarani/Valinhos. When Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica Ponte Preta decided to form a women's section in 2017, they took over the Valinhos club, with 17-year-old Kerolin among the squad they inherited. She was voted the best player of the 2017 Campeonato Paulista after scoring 10 goals in 21 games for semi-finalists Ponte Preta. She was then sent on loan to Corinthians/Audax for their successful 2017 Copa Libertadores Femenina campaign in October 2017. She scored in a penalty shootout win over Colo-Colo following a 0‚Äì0 draw in the final at Estadio Arsenio Erico, Asunci√≥n. In 2018 she scored 14 goals in 35 games for Ponte Preta and was named Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino \\"Revela√ß√£o\\" () at the end of season awards. It was reported that Kerolin's consistently good performances for Ponte Preta and the youth national teams made her a transfer target for other Brazilian clubs, as well as for professional clubs in France and China. The combined Corinthians/Audax team which Kerolin had helped to win the 2017 Copa Libertadores split when Corinthians withdrew from that partnership and set up their own women's team. This left Audax with a slot at the 2018 Copa Libertadores Femenina but with no team. A deal was made for Valinhos (who had been playing as Ponte Preta in domestic competitions) to represent Audax at the Copa Libertadores. Kerolin scored in a 4‚Äì0 win over Pe√±arol, but Audax were eliminated at the group stage. Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras urgently required a women's team in December 2018, as they faced being banned from the lucrative men's Copa Libertadores under CONMEBOL rules which required all participants to run women's teams. A partnership agreement saw Palmeiras agree to fund the salaries of the Valinhos players and staff, who would use the Palmeiras name but continue to play and train in Valinhos. In January 2019 Kerolin agreed the transfer to Palmeiras, signing a one-year contract and joining up again with her previous coach Ana L√∫cia Gon√ßalves. The following month it was announced that Kerolin had failed a doping test taken after playing for Audax in a match at the 2018 Copa Libertadores Femenina. Kerolin's sample revealed traces of GW1516. She remained provisionally suspended by CONMEBOL in July 2019, when Palmeiras's coach Gon√ßalves was sacked on suspicion of involvement in doping cases affecting the clubs she had worked at and inappropriately acting as a sports agent for the players in her charge. International career Kerolin was one of four Guarani/Valinhos players to be called up by the Brazil women's national under-17 football team for the 2016 South American U-17 Women's Championship. She remained in the squad for the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Jordan. In 2018, Kerolin scored two goals over three games she played representing the Brazil women's national under-20 football team at the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in France. The senior Brazil women's national football team head coach Vad√£o called Kerolin up for the first time in September 2018, for a friendly match against England at Meadow Lane, Nottingham. She earned her first cap in the match, appearing as a 56th-minute substitute for Debinha in Brazil's 1‚Äì0 defeat. After breaking into the senior national team, she was praised by veteran teammate Formiga: \\"Kerolin has a huge future. She's got so much talent and she doesn't have fear. If she keeps her feet on the ground, she can go as far as she wants. It's up to her.\\" Kerolin was not eligible to play at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup because she was provisionally suspended from football and still awaiting the final judgement from CONMEBOL in respect of her failed doping tests.

The three divisional winners, seeded first through third, and a fourth team‚Äîdetermined by the NL Wild Card Game‚Äîplayed in two series. These matchups were: * (1) Los Angeles Dodgers (West Division champions) vs. (4) Washington Nationals (Wild Card Game winner) * (2) Atlanta Braves (East Division champions) vs. (3) St. Louis Cardinals (Central Division champions) The higher-seeded team of each series hosted Games 1, 2 and 5, with the lower-seeded team hosting Games 3 and 4. For the third straight year, Major League Baseball sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series. This NLDS was sponsored by Utz and officially known as the 2019 National League Division Series presented by Utz Snacks. The Cardinals and Nationals won their respective series to advance to the Championship Series. This was the first time that both NLDS winners overcame a 2‚Äì1 series deficit in the same year. Background The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the National League West title on September 10, and secured the top- seed in the NLDS via their league-leading winning percentage. They had home field advantage against the Washington Nationals, who defeated the Milwaukee Brewers on October 1 in the Wild Card Game. Los Angeles was 4‚Äì3 during the regular season against Washington. The Atlanta Braves clinched the National League East on September 20, and secured the second-seed in the NLDS via their winning percentage. They had home field advantage against the third-seeded St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals clinched the National League Central on September 29, the final day of the regular season. The Braves were 4‚Äì2 during the regular season against the Cardinals. This was the league-leading 15th NLDS appearance for Atlanta, and 14th for both Los Angeles and St. Louis. This was the Nationals' fifth division series appearance in team history, and the sixth in franchise history (once as the Montreal Expos). Matchups =Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Washington Nationals= =Atlanta Braves vs. St. Louis Cardinals= Los Angeles vs. Washington This was the third postseason meeting between the Dodgers and the Nationals franchise. The most recent meeting was in the 2016 National League Division Series, with Los Angeles winning in five. The other took place in the 1981 National League Championship Series, in which the Dodgers won the National League pennant over the then- Montreal Expos in five games. =Game 1= Game 1 winning pitcher Walker Buehler Walker Buehler started game 1 for the Dodgers and Patrick Corbin for the Nationals. In the bottom of the first, Corbin walked four batters, including a bases loaded walk to Max Muncy to give the Dodgers the early lead. The Dodgers got another run in the fifth inning when Cody Bellinger scored on a fielding error by Howie Kendrick. Buehler allowed only one hit in six scoreless innings, while striking out eight and walking three. Corbin allowed only one earned run on three hits and five walks while striking out nine in six innings. Muncy drove in two more runs with a bases loaded single off Fernando Rodney in the seventh and Gavin Lux hit a pinch-hit homer off Hunter Strickland in the eighth. Joc Pederson also homered off Strickland to extend the lead, as the Dodgers held the Nationals to two hits in the 6‚Äì0 win. At 21 years and 314 days, Gavin Lux was the youngest player all-time to hit a pinch- hit home run in the playoffs. He was also the youngest Dodger to hit a home run in a playoff game, with that previous record belonging to Cody Bellinger, who homered at the age of 22 years and 88 days during the 2017 NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks. =Game 2= Daniel Hudson earned a save in Game 2 The starting pitchers for game 2 were Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals. The Nationals got on the board first when Howie Kendrick drove in Trea Turner with a single in the first. They got two more in the second on RBI hits by Adam Eaton and Anthony Rendon. Kershaw pitched six innings, allowing the three runs on six hits, two hit batters, and one walk with four strikeouts. The Dodgers finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Justin Turner in the sixth inning. Strasburg struck out 10 in six innings while only allowing one run on three hits. Max Muncy homered off Sean Doolittle in the seventh to cut the lead to one. The Nationals got the run back the next inning, when pinch-hitter Asdr√∫bal Cabrera singled to right off Dustin May to drive in a run from third. The Dodgers loaded the bases off Daniel Hudson in the ninth but failed to score and the Nationals evened up the series at one all with the 4‚Äì2 win. Hudson earned his second save this postseason. =Game 3= Justin Turner had a three-run home run in Game 3. Game 3 featured a matchup between An√≠bal S√°nchez of the Nationals and Hyun-jin Ryu of the Dodgers. Juan Soto hit a two-run homer off Ryu in the first inning to give the Nationals the early lead. Muncy homered in the fifth off S√°nchez to cut the lead in half. S√°nchez pitched five innings, allowing the one run on four hits and two walks, with a season high nine strikeouts. Ryu allowed the two runs on four hits and two walks with three strikeouts. The Nationals used game 1 starter Patrick Corbin in relief in the sixth and Russell Martin drove in two runs with a double to give the Dodgers their first lead of the game. Kik√© Hern√°ndez drove in two more later that inning with a pinch-hit double and Justin Turner followed that with a three-run home run off of Wander Suero. Joe Kelly loaded the bases the next inning and then threw a wild pitch that scored Anthony Rendon. A sacrifice fly by Asdr√∫bal Cabrera gave the Nationals another run. Martin hit a two-run homer off Hunter Strickland in the ninth to give the Dodgers ten runs in the game. They went on to win the game 10‚Äì4. =Game 4= Game 4 winning pitcher Max Scherzer Max Scherzer started for the Nationals in Game 4 opposite Rich Hill for the Dodgers. Justin Turner hit a solo homer off Scherzer in the first inning to start the scoring. In the third inning, Hill loaded the bases on two walks and a single before Anthony Rendon hit a sacrifice fly to tie the score. He walked another batter to load the bases again but Kenta Maeda replaced Hill and got a groundout to end the inning. Hill wound up pitching 2 innings, with one run allowed on two hits and four walks. Trea Turner led off the fifth inning with a single off Julio Ur√≠as, advanced on a bunt and then scored the go-ahead run on a single by Rendon. Ryan Zimmerman hit a three-run home run off Pedro B√°ez later that inning. Rendon drove in another run with a sacrifice fly in the sixth off of Ross Stripling. Scherzer escaped a bases loaded jam in the seventh to pitch seven innings on 109 pitches, allowing only the one run on four hits and three walks with seven strikeouts. The Nationals secured a 6‚Äì1 victory, evening up the series and sending it to a winner-take-all fifth game. =Game 5= grand slam by Howie Kendrick provided the Nationals' winning runs. Los Angeles and Washington previously met in one NLDS Game 5, with the Dodgers winning in 2016. Los Angeles was 2‚Äì1 in prior NLDS Game 5 appearances, while Washington was 1‚Äì3 (their one win was in 1981, as the Montreal Expos). This game featured a matchup of Game 1 winner Walker Buehler and Game 2 winner Stephen Strasburg. The Dodgers jumped on Strasburg in the bottom of the first with a double by Joc Pederson followed by a two-run home run from Max Muncy, his third of the series. Kik√© Hern√°ndez hit a homer in the second to extend the lead to three. The Nationals got on the scoreboard in the sixth inning when Juan Soto singled to score Anthony Rendon. Strasburg pitched six innings, with three runs on six hits and one walk and seven strikeouts while Buehler pitched 6 innings, allowing one run on four hits, three walks and a hit batsman while striking out seven. Back-to-back home runs in the eighth by Rendon and Juan Soto off Clayton Kershaw tied the game. With a scoreless ninth inning, the game went to extra innings, the first NLDS Game 5 to do so since 2011. Howie Kendrick hit a grand slam off of Joe Kelly in the top of the tenth inning to give the Nationals a 7‚Äì3 lead. Sean Doolittle set down the Dodgers in order in the bottom of the tenth, getting Justin Turner to fly out to Michael Taylor for the third out; the Dodgers called for a video review, but the call was upheld and it ended the series. The Nationals advanced to the NLCS, while the Dodgers' two-year reign as NL champions was over and their 31st straight year without a title. This was the third straight year and fourth time in the last five years the Dodgers were eliminated from the postseason at home, and was also the first time the Dodgers were eliminated from the NLDS since 2015. As a result of the NLDS Game 5 loss, the Dodgers became the first team to win 105+ games in a season to not advance to the LCS since the Division Series was introduced. =Composite line score= 2019 NLDS (3‚Äì2): Washington Nationals beat Los Angeles Dodgers. Atlanta vs. St. Louis This was the fifth postseason meeting between the Braves and Cardinals. The previous four match- ups were the 1982 National League Championship Series, the 1996 National League Championship Series, the 2000 National League Division Series and 2012 National League Wild Card Game. The Cardinals were 3‚Äì1 in those previous meetings. Carlos Mart√≠nez =Game 1= The Cardinals tabbed Miles Mikolas, who led the National League in losses, to start Game 1. He was opposed by left-hander Dallas Keuchel. The Braves quickly got to work against Mikolas, with Ronald Acu√±a Jr. and Ozzie Albies both drawing walks and Freddie Freeman singling to load the bases. Josh Donaldson then hit a ground ball to second baseman Kolten Wong. It looked like an easy double play, but Wong could not field the ball cleanly, allowing Acu√±a to score. Dallas Keuchel kept the Cardinals bats quiet until the fifth inning when Harrison Bader singled to lead off the inning, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and stole third base. Dexter Fowler hit a ground ball out that scored Bader from third base to tie the game 1‚Äì1. Tommy Edman would then double and move Fowler to third and Keuchel was relieved by Darren O'Day, who got Paul Goldschmidt to line out to shortstop Dansby Swanson. The Braves would retake the lead on a Donaldson hit by pitch, a Nick Markakis double, and Tyler Webb intentionally walked Adam Duvall, who was pinch hitting for Matt Joyce. One out later, Swanson singled in two runs on a ground ball to shortstop Paul DeJong that was deflected by Edman's glove. Chris Martin came out the bullpen, but did not throw a pitch as he left with an oblique injury, and was replaced by Luke Jackson. Jackson allowed a solo home run to Goldschmidt to cut the lead to one. Matt Carpenter tied the game up with a bloop single that scored DeJong. The Cardinals would break the tie in the ninth with four runs off Braves closer Mark Melancon, with Ozuna doubling home Fowler and Edman and Wong doubling home Goldschmidt and Ozuna which made it 7‚Äì3. The Braves rallied off of closer Carlos Mart√≠nez with Ronald Acu√±a hitting a two-run home run and Freeman hitting a monstrous shot to dead center field. Mart√≠nez would end the rally though, getting Donaldson to ground out and striking out Markakis to seal the Game 1 victory for St. Louis. =Game 2= Mark Melancon earned a save in Game 2 Jack Flaherty, who was the Cardinals ace for the second half, got the ball for Game 2, and was opposed by right-hander Mike Foltynewicz. Like Game 1, the Braves got to work quickly against Flaherty, with an Albies infield hit, a wild pitch and an RBI single from Donaldson. Foltynewicz would shut down the Cardinals bats, holding them to three hits over seven innings of work. Duvall provided insurance with a two-run home run off Flaherty in the seventh. Melancon, who was the Game 1 loser, came in the game in the ninth for the save and allowed two one-out singles to Goldschmidt and Ozuna. Melancon would work out of trouble though, striking out Yadier Molina and Wong to end the game and send the series to St. Louis tied at one game each. =Game 3= Adam Duvall had two ninth-inning RBIs in Game 3. Game 3 featured a pitching matchup of Adam Wainwright for the Cardinals and Mike Soroka for the visiting Braves. St. Louis took an early 1‚Äì0 lead, as Marcell Ozuna had a second-inning double then scored following a ground out and sacrifice fly. Soroka went seven innings, allowing just one run and two hits, while striking out seven. Wainwright went innings, allowing no runs on four hits, and striking out eight. There was no further scoring until the top of the ninth, when St. Louis brought in closer Carlos Mart√≠nez. Following a double, two strikeouts, and an intentional walk, Dansby Swanson doubled, scoring one run and placing runners on second and third. Adam Duvall then hit an 0‚Äì2 pitch for a single, driving in two runs. A walk and a line out ended the rally with Atlanta ahead, 3‚Äì1. Braves closer Mark Melancon allowed one hit in the bottom of the ninth but otherwise shut down the Cardinals to earn his second save of the series, as Atlanta took a 2‚Äì1 series lead. This was Atlanta's first playoff win after trailing in the ninth inning or later since Game 6 of the 1999 NLCS against the Mets. =Game 4= Yadier Molina tied Game 4 with an eighth-inning RBI single and later hit a walk-off sacrifice fly. Dakota Hudson got the ball for St. Louis to try to send the series back to Atlanta for a Game 5. His mound opponent was Game 1 starter Dallas Keuchel, who held the Cardinals to one run over in Game 1. The Cardinals got to Keuchel early this time, hitting back to back home runs by Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna. The Braves chipped away at the deficit when Ozzie Albies hit a sacrifice fly to get the Braves on the board. Ozuna homered again in the fourth inning to get the run back for the Cardinals. However, in the fifth inning, Hudson ran into trouble as Dansby Swanson doubled with one out and Adam Duvall reached on a fielding error by Matt Carpenter. One out later, Albies hit a two-run home run to put the Braves ahead 4‚Äì3 and chased starter Dakota Hudson from the game. The Cardinals would rally to tie the game in the eighth when Goldschmidt doubled with one out and scored on a Yadier Molina single that just got by the leaping Freddie Freeman. The Cardinals would win it in the bottom of the tenth, when Kolten Wong doubled to lead off the inning, Goldschmidt was intentionally walked, Ozuna grounded into a forceplay and Molina, who tied it in the eighth inning, walked it off with a sacrifice fly that scored Wong and sent the Cardinals back to Atlanta for a Game 5. =Game 5= Jack Flaherty held Atlanta to one run on four hits in six innings, earning the win in Game 5. This was the first NLDS Game 5 between Atlanta and St. Louis. Atlanta entered the game 0‚Äì3 in prior NLDS Game 5 appearances, while St. Louis was 3‚Äì1. Atlanta starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz lasted only of an inning, leaving after allowing three hits and three walks (one intentional); he was charged with seven runs (six earned). The Cardinals' ten runs in the first inning set a Major League Baseball record for first-inning runs in a postseason game, and tied the Major League Baseball record for the most runs in any inning in a postseason game. St. Louis added a run in the second and two in the third, while a Josh Donaldson home run got Atlanta on the board in the fourth. Jack Flaherty went six innings; striking out eight to earn the win. With no further scoring, the Cardinals advanced to the NLCS via a 13‚Äì1 final score, as G√©nesis Cabrera struck out Dansby Swanson swinging to end the series. It was the Braves' 24th straight year without a title. =Composite line score= 2019 NLDS (3‚Äì2): St. Louis Cardinals beat Atlanta Braves.

Not long after leaving, Johns suggested to Sharpless, whose erratic and combative behavior had led Green to ask that they leave, that she was not sober enough to drive; in response Sharpless pulled over and told Johns to get out, which she did. Sharpless has not been seen since then. An early theory, that she might have accidentally driven her car into the nearby Schuylkill River, was discarded when searches of the river were fruitless. An apparent break in the case came two weeks later when an automatic license plate reader recorded her 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix's plates among parked vehicles in Camden, New Jersey, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. There had been other reported sightings of Sharpless in Camden, but police there were unable to locate the vehicle or find any information about where it had been found. In 2013, the writer of an anonymous letter sent to Eileen Law, a private investigator handling the case, claimed that he had been hired to take the Pontiac to a shop in the Boston area in exchange for $5,000 in cash and the Grand Prix's license plates after Sharpless was killed during a confrontation with a Camden police officer. The writer did not personally know of any details about what had happened to Sharpless but included in his letter the number of her cell phone, missing along with her, and the last five digits of the car's vehicle identification number, information that had not been made public. Both were correct. Police dismissed the letter as a hoax despite the details, but Law, whose theory is that Sharpless is alive and being held captive by human traffickers, believes it was genuine and continues to investigate. In 2011, the Investigation Discovery channel's series Disappeared devoted an episode to the case.  Background  Toni Sharpless, a native of the Philadelphia suburb of Downingtown, Pennsylvania, was born in 1979. Her father died in an accident when she was six; her mother Donna soon after remarried Peter Knebel, who raised Toni and her sister Candy as his own daughters. In her late teens Toni had a daughter of her own. Sharpless's childhood and young adulthood were marked by her struggles with bipolar disorder, a condition only diagnosed in her adulthood. She and her family kept that information to themselves, and even after learning she was bipolar the difficulties caused by the disorder persisted as doctors tried different combinations of different medications to control it. Her condition had also led to problems with drug and alcohol abuse. In 2008 she was arrested and convicted of driving while intoxicated; she spent the month of April 2009 in rehab. After that she found a drug combination that seemed to work and that was contraindicated for alcohol consumption; she did not always take them, however. On weekends during the 2000s, Sharpless worked as a nursing assistant at a local rehabilitation center, living with her daughter and parents in West Brandywine Township. The money she earned from that job went to pay her tuition at Brandywine School of Nursing. After earning her degree in 2007, Sharpless took a job in the infectious disease ward at Lancaster General Hospital.  Disappearance  On the evening of August 22, 2009, a Saturday, Sharpless left her home around 9:30 p.m. for a night on the town in Center City (downtown Philadelphia) with her friend Crystal Johns. After she left, Peter Knebel expressed his reservations about the outing to his wife. Sharpless and Johns had only recently renewed their friendship after becoming estranged from each other a decade earlier; Knebel believed that the evening trip to the city had been Johns' idea and that his stepdaughter, who typically devoted her free time to her own daughter and rarely went to nightclubs or bars, or into Philadelphia at all, only went because Johns had persuaded her to. But they also recognized that Sharpless had been working hard for a long time and had not had an evening out in a while. The two women left in Sharpless's car, a black 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix sedan. After stopping at Johns' house in West Fallowfield township, they went to Ice, a club in King of Prussia, then to Center City's G Lounge nightclub. From there they went to a party at the home of Willie Green, a professional basketball player with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, in Penn Valley, a neighborhood in Lower Merion Township, one of the city's affluent Main Line suburbs. Accounts differ as to whether Johns, who was reportedly friends with Green's brother, had been invited there before she and Sharpless left for the evening or whether Green met the two at G Lounge and invited them back to his house. Johns and Sharpless left Center City for the party shortly after 3 a.m. on August 23. Unable to sleep that night, Sharpless's daughter had texted her within the previous hour; Sharpless responded at 2:57 a.m with a text of her own, telling her daughter to get to sleep and that she would be home soon. Her phone has not been used since; it was turned off around 4 a.m. At Green's, Sharpless and Johns began drinking along with other guests at what has been characterized as more of a small gathering than a party. The group was playing the board game Taboo, during which Sharpless reportedly made a remark to Johns that Green took as including an ethnic slur, although it was not intended that way. Green made it known that he was offended, and Sharpless, who already felt that other guests were ridiculing her, became angry and erratic. Around 5 a.m., she reportedly dumped a bottle of champagne on the kitchen floor and began kicking things. Green went to Johns, who had retreated to the house's swimming pool, and told her that it was time for her and Sharpless to go home. As the pair gathered their possessions and left the house, Johns, aware that she had had less to drink, attempted to take the car keys, but Sharpless immediately took them back. She was still angry and crying, accusing Johns of also making fun of her. A man called out from the house, jokingly warning them to be careful not to hit any other cars. Once they were back in Sharpless's Pontiac, Johns, who later told police that neither of them were sober enough to legally drive, asked Sharpless whether she should really be driving in her condition given her previous drunken-driving conviction; she had also, at that point, been awake for 36 hours straight. Her response was to stop immediately and tell Johns to \\"get the fuck out of my car\\", which Johns did, and then Sharpless drove off. No one is known to have seen her since then.  Investigation  Johns expected at first that her friend would soon calm down, reconsider her action, and return for her. When that did not happen within a few minutes, she called Sharpless; the call went to voicemail. Johns was still too embarrassed by the circumstances of their departure from Green's house to walk the back there and seek help, so after waiting a little longer she called her nephew for a ride home. Later that morning, Johns called Candy Sharpless to complain that Toni had abandoned her and said she would come around later to return some items Toni had left at her house. Candy told her that Toni had not returned, whereupon Johns called the police. Candy later filed a missing persons report. Sharpless's friends and family made and distributed flyers, while the Lower Merion Township police put out bulletins for her car. Speculation at first focused on the possibility that the intoxicated, sleep- deprived Sharpless had driven down a boat ramp by mistake and ended up in the nearby Schuylkill River. A Texas firm hired to search the river using side- scan sonar found 12 vehicles, nine of which had been reported stolen and three that were untraceable since the vehicle identification numbers (VINs) had been removed. None were the Grand Prix. In September, two weeks after Sharpless disappeared, an automated license plate reader in Camden, New Jersey, just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, recorded a hit on Sharpless's car's license plate number. The Camden police did not notify Lower Merion until a few days afterward, and efforts to locate the vehicle in Camden or nearby were unsuccessful. In late October, police records show they worked their last lead, although the case remains open. =Eileen Law= In October, Donna Knebel retained Eileen Law, a private investigator with an agency in Kennett Square, to find her daughter. A segment on CNN's Nancy Grace captured Law's attention. She took the case for a symbolic fee of $1 in order to make it legal; the dollar bill Knebel gave her remains on her desk and photographs of Sharpless are on her office wall. Law set up a website and hotline number. Many tips were phoned into her office; callers reported sighting Sharpless and/or her vehicle all over the Philadelphia area, from Lancaster, where Sharpless worked, to Kennett Square. Another woman, who worked a night shift doing security in Conshohocken, said that as she returned home one night at 1 a.m. she saw an apparently abandoned black sedan in Camden beneath an overpass after crossing the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. She notified the police there, but they had no record of the call. Due to that tip and others, Law came to believe that Sharpless's disappearance had some connection to Camden. Donna Knebel told LNP that her daughter, who had a poor sense of direction even under ideal conditions, may have headed for the nearby Schuylkill Expressway, part of Interstate 76, to return home after evicting Johns. However, the nearest exit to where she was, Hollow Road, only allows eastbound entry, not westbound, which Sharpless would have wanted in order to return home. Going eastbound on I-76 would have taken Sharpless toward Philadelphia and Camden. Law notes that the Grand Prix was very low on gas when Sharpless and Johns had left for the evening, with less than a quarter of the tank full, and Sharpless could likely have run out of gas soon after she left. Without her ATM card, she might have also been short of money to refuel and thus would have had to rely on whomever she encountered to help her. Law soon came to believe that Sharpless was still alive, perhaps forced into prostitution against her will. From the different places where her tips placed Sharpless, Law conjectured that she was being moved around. In 2010, when the producers of the Investigation Discovery channel's series Disappeared went to the Philadelphia area, Law found that their interest was piqued because Sharpless's car remained missing along with her, so Law took them to some of the neighborhoods her tips had led her to; the episode aired in 2011. Law's efforts to find Sharpless have taken her as far from Philadelphia as New Jersey's Pine Barrens. 2012 anonymous letter In December 2012, Law received a letter, handwritten on a yellow legal-size paper, purportedly from a \\"Tony Sharpless\\", postmarked November 29 of that year in Trenton, New Jersey. The writer said that they had tried to give their information to the Philadelphia police but had been told the case was not in their jurisdiction; an officer there had taken them aside and given them Law's address. The writer claimed they had been contacted by a friend near the end of September 2009 and offered $5,000 in cash to take the Grand Prix, then in Brooklawn, New Jersey, near Camden, to a shop in Boston. If they completed that trip, the writer said, they were told they could also have the vehicle's license plates. Additionally, they were asked if they knew anyone in their late 20s who wanted to \\"paper-trip\\"‚Äîwhich Law says refers to an attempt to create a new identity and would be a term used only by police or criminals‚Äîand was offered a Social Security card to give to such a person. Since the writer had needed the money, they had taken the job and delivered the car to Boston the next day. When they delivered it, they not only took the license plates but also cleared out the glove compartment and implied that they had found Sharpless's cell phone. They also wrote down the car's vehicle identification number (VIN). Upon their return to Camden, the friend gave them more information about the car and why they had had to take it to a chop shop out of state. It was not stolen, they said, but missing. A friend of the friend was a Camden police officer and he \\"got into a fight with a girl; she died and he needed to get the car out of Jersey\\". The writer did not, they stressed, have firsthand knowledge that this was Sharpless or what exactly had happened. The reason the writer had waited so long to write was that they had put the plates and Social Security card into a box in their garage and forgotten about it, until their daughter had recently rediscovered it while playing. They had gone back to New Jersey to help some friends affected by Hurricane Sandy and decided to write the letter. As proof of the account, the letter included not only the license plate number of the Grand Prix, but also the last five digits of its VIN and Sharpless's cell phone number, represented as her Social Security number. The plate number had been widely disseminated during the initial media coverage of the disappearance, so by itself it would not prove the writer knew anything, but the latter two numbers had not been made public and were also correct. While Law was skeptical of some aspects of the story, and at the time said she was not sure if it was authentic, in 2017 she told Chadds Ford Live that an email she received in 2013 corroborated some aspects of it and that she now regarded the account as plausible. West Brandywine police chief Walter Werner, whose department continues to work with both the Lower Merion police and the New Jersey State Police to investigate Sharpless's disappearance, noted that the Grand Prix's VIN is included in reports on the case that would be widely available to anyone in law enforcement. Around the same time, police also received two potentially promising tips by phone that turned out to be hoaxes. The first, from someone claiming to be an officer of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service who had found both the car and a woman matching Sharpless's description on the property of the agency's Toronto offices, was from a false address and phone number; the Toronto Police also did not have the woman in custody as the caller claimed. The second was purportedly from a deputy sheriff in South Dakota who claimed he had recovered the Grand Prix; officers at the department in question said no one by the name he gave worked there. Both calls, according to Werner, were made by the same person. After turning the letter over to the West Brandywine police, Law disclosed it to the media in early 2013. The Lower Merion and Camden police departments both said they had not been made aware of it before reporters called to ask them about it. Police chief Werner said the letter would be examined by forensic specialists to see what evidence could be developed from it. In 2016, Law said she did not know what, if anything, police had done with the letter. Theories Sharpless's family and friends have been suspicious of Johns since the disappearance. They note that she pleaded guilty to harassment charges in 2005 and question her story. \\"Toni would never, never, leave another woman on a dark street in Philadelphia\\", said one of her friends. \\"And what woman in her right mind would get out of the car there and wait an hour?\\" Donna Knebel is not even sure that the last text from her daughter's phone was actually written by her; she also questions why Green's house was not searched. Peter Knebel and Gigi Hayes, a nursing school friend of Sharpless, have both publicly speculated that Johns' account might be a cover story for an incident that occurred at the party. \\"[Toni] didn't burn her bridges with her parents\\", Hayes said. \\"There was no reason why she couldn't come home\\", The Knebels have, on the advice of police, not tried to contact Johns; they say she has not contacted them either. The Lower Merion police have cleared Johns of any involvement. Phone records confirm both her attempt to call Sharpless around the time the two parted company and, later, her call to her nephew. Johns also passed a lie detector test, the police said. Green, too, has been cleared; police described him as \\"more than willing to cooperate\\". He has never spoken publicly about the case. All the other guests at his house that morning have also been ruled out as having any involvement. Law, too, believes Johns' account. Sharpless's friend has been \\"burned at the stake\\", she says, but in addition to the polygraph she passed, the detective cites her own interview. She came by Johns uninvited, and instead of asking her to leave, Johns took her questions, some of them designed to catch deceptive behavior, for three hours. \\"[S]he was unbelievably distraught and I don't believe she had anything to do with it\\", Law says. , Knebel believes her daughter to be dead. Law, however, continues to investigate her theory that Sharpless was taken by human traffickers, who would have taken her cell phone and credit cards as soon as they could. In 2011 she told a reporter from Philadelphia that a woman she described as \\"a dancer in a Midwestern city\\" contacted her, claiming to have met Sharpless; her descriptions of the woman's body piercings and stretch marks were confirmed by Donna Knebel. Five years later, Law noted that there are many cases where abducted people have been found after many years. She ascribed some of the difficulty in solving the case to having four separate law enforcement agencies in two states working some aspect of it. \\"I wish we could just get everyone in the same room to share information\\", she said. \\"Maybe someone would come up with something that no one had considered before\\".

She began swimming at the age of two and started to suffer from seizures at that age after a child kicked her head. Morrison broke two school swimming time records as a freshman at Collins Hill High School, and was third in the 100-yard freestyle competition at the Georgia state Class AAA championship in early 2005. She fell ill afterwards, and a large benign tumor was found in her left temporal lobe, of which 30 percent was removed by surgeons in two consecutive operations. However, ill health continued to affect Morrision, and a third surgery to remove an aggressive returning tumor resulted in the paralysis of the right side of her body and a speech impediment. Nevertheless, she established two national records in the S5 category, and qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics at the US Paralympic Swimming Trials in April 2008, where she did not medal. After her death, an annual award and foundation were established in her honor. Biography Marin Morrison was born on June 19, 1990 in Great Falls, Montana, to sportscaster Matt Morrison and personal trainer Nancy Morrison. She was primarily given the name Marin because her father was raised in Marin County, California, and is derived from the Latin \\"of the sea\\". Morrison was the oldest of three siblings; she had a younger sister, Camlyn, and a younger brother, Michael. She spent portions of her childhood in Lansing, Michigan and later Jacksonville, Florida. She began swimming at the age of two, entered her first league when she was six years old, and participated in her first meet soon after. Morrison began suffering from seizures at the age of two due to a child kicking her head, and she took medication to help counter its symptoms. She was first educated at St Joseph's Catholic School, and was subsequently diagnosed with a learning disability, leading her to spend hours at a time on a section of text to understand its meaning. By the time Morrison reached fifth grade, the family moved to Atlanta, after her father acquired employment as an anchor for Fox Sports Net. She trained with the SwimAtlanta team under coach Chris Davis, and excelled in the 100-yard freestyle and backstroke disciplines. When Morrison was a freshman at Collins Hill High School, she broke the 100-yard freestyle and backstroke school records in 2005, and was 1¬Ω seconds slower than the times required to progress to the 2004 United States Olympic Trials. She was one of the favorites to win the Georgia state Class AAAAA championship in the 100-yard freestyle, finishing third in that discipline and 12th in the 100-yard backstroke. During the state meet, Morrison reported having double vision and dizziness. She nevertheless helped the SwimAtlanta team win four relays at the Short Course Championships in Savannah, Georgia, though her times were slower than she expected, and her condition deteriorated. Morrison visited an optometrist, who told her parents to take her to an emergency room and seek a neurologist. She was later taken to visit a pediatrician, and then to the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston Hospital, where an MRI scan revealed a large benign tumor in her left temporal lobe, which controls movement and speech. 30 percent of the tumor was removed by surgeons in consecutive surgeries in March 2005, and Morrison recovered enough to return to swimming 12 days later. She and three friends of hers set new records for the 200-meter medley relay and the 200-meter free relay at a mid-2005 meet in Gwinnett County. Morrison again had double vision in July 2005. A second MRI scan revealed a return of the tumor, and that it was growing aggressively on her brain's left temporal lobe as a rare cancer called anaplastic astrocytoma ganglioglioma. Her surgery on August 15 saw surgeons remove the tumor though the operation was complicated by a large blood clot that caused paralysis to the right side of her body. Morrison also was afflicted by expressive aphasia with apraxia of speech, and lost all sight in her right eye. Morrison underwent radiation treatments to eliminate remnants of her cancer, and the family moved to Seattle in November 2005, joining the Bellevue Swim Club. The family also saw a team of pedantic oncologists at the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, and were told that Morrison had four to sixth months to live. She was put on a strict macrobiotic diet to prevent the release of energy while digesting food, and was enrolled in a homebound academic program at nearby Eastlake High School, by a special education teacher from Lake Washington School District. The family was encouraged by a rehabilitation nurse at the Children's Hospital to enter Morrison into a meet in Michigan in late 2006. She was classified S5, and established two national records, which she was told were enough to attain qualification to the 2008 Summer Paralympics. Morrison reached the 2008 US Paralympic Swimming Trials in Minneapolis, qualifying for the women's S5 50 meters backstroke competition. She was allowed to select two additional events to compete in, opting for the women's 50 metres freestyle and the women's S5 100 metres freestyle disciplines. Afterward, Morrison's health deteriorated and she required a fourth brain surgery on May 2 to stem intracranial bleeding. She spent the next six weeks at the Children's Hospital, and required the full-time use of a wheelchair and wore an eye-patch over her left eye to retain her equilibrium. Morrison was too unwell to travel with the United States delegation to Beijing, so her family raised capital from local community funding for her travel to the Paralympic Games. She expected to win a medal. On 7 September, Morrison took part in the women's 100 metre freestyle S5 competition, finishing sixth and last in the second heat with a time of 3 minutes and 10.30 seconds, and was eliminated from the event since she was slowest overall. The following day, she was disqualified from the women's 50 metre backstroke S5 competition for unspecified reasons, and finished last overall in the women's 50 metre freestyle S5 race with a time of 1 minute and 35.60 seconds. After the Games, Morrison's condition further deteriorated, causing her to sleep heavily, though she attended a reception for the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams hosted by President George W. Bush and the First Lady Laura Bush at the White House in October 2008. She was featured in a NBC Sports documentary about nine American para-athletes training and preparing for the Beijing Paralympics on November 9, 2008. Morrison died on the morning of January 2, 2009 in Sammamish, Washington. On the evening of January 7, a memorial service was held for Morrison at the Timberlake Christian Fellowship in Redmond, Washington, and attended by more than one hundred people. A funeral service that was broadcast on the Internet took place three days later at the Green Hills Memorial Park in Palo Verde, California. Legacy In August 2008, Morrison received recognition for her achievements by Dave Reichert, a member of the United States House of Representatives from Washington's 8th congressional district. After her death, the Morrison family began the annual Marin Morrison Award, and established a scholarship foundation in her name. Pacific North West Swimming founded the Marin Morrison Memorial Meet in 2009 to allow disabled persons to compete in competitive swimming competitions. A documentary film called Touch the Wall ‚Äî The Marin Morrison Story was released in 2013. References.

Gameplay Eliza is a visual novel. The player takes the role of Evelyn, a young woman who was initially successful in the high- tech industry of Seattle before burning out, and was mostly disconnected from life for about three years. In the present, she serves as the human proxy for Eliza, a virtual counselling program named after the real-life ELIZA, one of the earliest attempts at artificial intelligence in the 1960s. Evelyn reads off what the program produces to tell the clients. Evelyn is required to stay on script produced by Eliza, but this creates difficult choices for her in how she talks to the clients and to others including old friends. Later, Evelyn is given the opportunity to read \\"off-script\\", creating scenarios that may affect herself directly. The player has the ability to choose how Evelyn behaves in some cases, affecting how the story progresses. After finishing the game, the player can go back to previous chapters and make different decisions to see how this affects the various endings. Like most of Zachtronics' recent games, the game also includes a variation of a solitaire game with kabufuda cards should the player need to take their mind off the game. Development Unlike most of Zachtronics' other games, where founder Zach Barth has led development, Eliza production was led by Matthew Seiji Burns (Matt Burns), who had joined Zachtronics as writer and music composer. Prior to joining Zachtronics, Burns had worked at Treyarch and 343 Industries, and had gone through a \\"crunch culture\\" there that he felt himself burning out, and thus joined with the smaller Zachtronics. With the studio between titles, Burns had been inspired to develop a game about burnout to reflect his own experiences. He recalled a demo for SimSensai and MultiSense, a DARPA project at the University of Southern California that was a virtual therapist to be used for soldiers returning from overseas to see if they have symptoms of PTSD, the program asking the soldiers questions though a computer-generated avatar and monitoring their facial and body responses. He found the demo \\"unsettling\\" as it \\"was just so strange to see this computer analyzing someone with such a human problem\\" and thought how that could apply to a larger scale. Burns was also inspired by other wellness mobile apps such as BetterHelp that had similar virtual counselling. Many of these apps were based on the simplicity of ELIZA, one of the first natural language processing demonstrations developed in the 1960s to simulate a virtual therapist; Eliza was named in honor of this program. Burns also considered how many of these virtual wellness apps collected users' private data to use for seemingly unknown purposes or sharing with other companies without users' knowledge, drawing this into the story within Eliza. Burns was initially planning on developing the game himself, but after talking on his ideas with Barth, was convinced to let to be developed as a Zachtronics title. While vastly different in gameplay from Zachtronics' usual style of games, Barth considered the story that Burns has come up with to be on theme with other Zachtronics games. As both Barth and Burns have lived in the Seattle area for years, they opted to use Seattle as the setting for the game. Burns felt that Seattle was a high-technology driven city, both by Microsoft and Amazon.com, but has gone through several boom-and-bust cycles that would lead to burnout exhibited in the game. Eliza was announced in early August 2019, and released on August 12, 2019 on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. A version for the Nintendo Switch followed suit on October 10, 2019. Reception Eliza received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. =Accolades= The game was nominated for \\"Best Storytelling\\" at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards, and for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Excellence in Narrative at the Independent Games Festival Awards.

OkayAfrica called it \\"Cultural Colonialism\\" and in a viral tweet, she bemoaned the use of African designs by the brand \\"but using only one African model on her runway\\". Despite the huge backlash, McCartney failed to apologize and issued a statement to Fashionista that gave credit to textile brand, Vlisco in the Netherlands rather than indigenous African women. ‚ÄúThe prints were about celebrating a unique textile craftsmanship, its culture and highlighting its heritage.

Early life Semeyko was born on 25 March 1923 to a working-class Ukrainian family in Sloviansk. He completed nine grades of school and graduated from an aeroclub before entering the military in August 1940. There he trained in aviation, and in February 1943 he graduated from the Voroshilovgrad Military Aviation School of pilots, which was based in Kazakhstan away from the front of the war. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1943. In combat Upon arriving at the warfront in March 1943 as a pilot in the 505th Attack Aviation Regiment on the Southern Front, he began flying combat sorties on the Il-2. Later that same month the unit was honored with the guards designation and renamed to the 75th Guards Attack Aviation Regiment. During a mission in November he was badly injured during a flight after being attacked by two Bf 109s, but despite getting blood in his eyes he went on the target before returning. Despite having arrived in the regiment as a just an enlisted pilot, he quickly rose through the ranks, becoming promoted to captain in January 1945 in addition to moving up the chain of command to flight commander, deputy squadron commander, squadron commander, and eventually regimental navigator. On the day after he was declared a Hero of the Soviet Union for the first time, he was killed in action during a mission after being shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the ground. His colleagues, including Anatoly Nedbaylo, avenged him by targeting the anti-aircraft gun that shot him down, heavily opening fire on it.

From 2011 to 2015, she was the rector of the S√°mi University of Applied Sciences in Kautokeino, Norway. Early life and education Jelena Sergeyevna Semyjashkina was born in Loparskaya, Soviet Union in 1967, the same rural locality she grew up in on the Kola Peninsula, in the Kildin Saami area. However, her family background is from the Skolt Sami area near the border between Russia and Finland, and her father must have spoken Skolt Sami. Her parents were researchers of the Northern Lights at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, Kola Science Centre under the Russian Academy of Sciences, and therefore, Porsanger was influenced at an early age to develop an academic career. In the Soviet Union, the ideal of equality was so strong that cultural background was destroyed, and teaching in Sami had been banned since the 1930s. However, during the 1970s, there was growing interest in Sami, and when a Sami-Russian dictionary was developed, Porsanger learned Sami on her own. She also learned Finnish from her grandmother and later went to Helsinki to study, where she also learned Northern Sami. Career In 1998, Porsanger began working as an associate professor at the Center for Sami Studies at the University of Troms√∏. In 2000, she was promoted to researcher and lecturer, and in 2005, as a senior researcher. Her research on oral and written sources of the Eastern Sami indigenous religion from the 16th to the 20th centuries led to her doctoral dissertation, \\"Bassejoga ƒç√°hci\\": G√°ldut nuortas√°miid eamioskkoldaga birra √°lgo√°lbmotmetodologiijaid olis (Indigenous Methodology), which she defended at the University of Troms√∏ in January 2006. It was the first public defense to have taken place in a Sami language in Norway. Porsanger has said that the inspiration for the assignment came from being frustrated at how little has been written about the Eastern Sami culture and religion, and that what was written was \\"unjustly generalized\\". Porsanger's research interests include the decolonization of research, the design of indigenous methodology, research ethics, Sami research history, and the history and spiritual culture of the Eastern Sami. She was subsequently employed at the S√°mi University of Applied Sciences in Kautokeino, where, since 2010, she has led a research project for the development of methodology, documentation, preservation, protection and storage of √Örbediehtu (traditional Sami knowledge).

The film marks the directorial debut of ace music director Salil Chowdhury who also gave its music. It was a commercial failure at the box office. Plot Sonu (Abhi Bhattacharya), a patient suffering from a rare heart condition falls in love with Heena (Meena Kumari), a young nurse who treats him at the hospital. Soon after they get married, Sonu asks Heena to relocate to a small town where he has rented a house and promises to join her in few days. On reaching the house, Heena meets Sonu's brother Lalu (Mehmood Ali), and his paternal uncle Yasin (Balraj Sahni). Days turn into weeks but Sonu never returns. However in due course Heena develops an understanding with both Lalu and Yasin. Soon, Heena comes across a letter in which Sonu tells her to marry someone else as he may not live long enough. She also realises that the two men are actually convicts hiding in her house. When Yasin reads the letter, he brings Sonu to the house but somehow Sonu escapes and informs the police. In the climax of the film, Yasin and Lalu manage to take Heena, whose condition has by now worsened, to the hospital. By the time they reach hospital, Yasin is shot dead by the police and the others unite with Sonu. Background On 5 March 1964, during the mahurat of this film, Meena Kumari was allegedly hit by Baqar Ali, Kamal Amrohi's assistant for allowing Gulzar to enter her make-up room. When Meena Kumari asked Kamal Amrohi to intervene and come to the studio, he refused and asked her to come back. Enraged, Meena Kumari left Kamal Amrohi's house and never returned.

After joining the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office in 1898, he traveled to German East Africa at the end of the year, where he served as a district judge. In 1899 he had to travel back to Germany due to illness. After a brief return to the judiciary, he was transferred at his own request back to the Colonial Department on 22 December 1899, and was appointed as a district judge to German Samoa in 1901, and eventually appointed the Imperial Chief Judge in 1910. He received the title of Geheimrat in 1911. He became the acting Governor of German Samoa on 19 December 1911, succeeding Wilhelm Solf, the first Governor of the colony.

The son of the railway builder William Henry Sayen, he was born at St. Davids, Pennsylvania in January 1883. He was educated at Haverford School, before going up to Princeton University. Sayen was interested in cricket at a young age, an interest which he carried into his adult life. A member of the Merion Cricket Club, his fast bowling gained notoriety when he was the first American selected to represent the Gentlemen of England, making his debut in first-class cricket for the team against Cambridge University at Eastbourne in June 1908. He joined the touring Philadelphian cricket team the following month, making six first-class appearances against English county opponents. For the Philadelphians, he scored 113 runs on the tour, at an average of 10.27 and a high score of 29. With the ball, he took 9 wickets at a bowling average of 28.77, with best figures of 4 for 44. His bowling was described as the sensation of the English sporting world. While in England, Sayen met Edith May Coyners, the sister of the Bermudian politician Reginald Conyers, with the couple marrying in 1910. Following the tour, he played no further first-class cricket. He settled in Princeton, becoming the president and treasurer of the Mercer Rubber Co. He served during the First World War, though not with the United States Army, instead serving with the 9th Army Corps and the 34th Corps of the French Army. For his service in the war, Sayen was decorated with the French commemorative medal and the Croix de Guerre, including a citation from General P√©tain. Following the war, he became active in local affairs in Princeton, serving on the Princeton Borough Council. In his role he was instrumental in the paving of Nassau Street. He was also the founder and first president of the Princeton Chamber of Commerce. He retired from the Mercer Rubber Co. in 1956 and in his retirement he wrote A Yankee Looks at Cricket, a book on the history of cricket in America. Following the death of his first wife, with whom he had two children, he married Emily C. Lyman around 1956. He died at Princeton following a three year long illness in January 1965, one week after his 82nd birthday.

It is one of very few places where illustrations of the most recent episode of American Samoa volcanism can be seen.https://dokumen.tips/documents/national-natural-landmarks-us-national- park-service.html (Page 6) The crater is situated immediately inland from Larsen Bay, which contains two smaller coves: Fagalua and Fogama'a. Fogama'a Cove is an idyllic and isolated beach on the inner margin of Larsen's Bay. There are extensive seabird breeding grounds in Larsen's Bay. Fogama'a Crater National Natural Landmark is located next to Fagatele Bay and also includes Steps Point,http://www.npshistory.com/publications/npsa/feasibility-study.pdf (Page 65) which is the farthest southern point of U.S. territory. History A large cave in the lava formation at Larsen's Bay. The nearby village of Vaitogi was previously located in the Fogama'a Crater, where the villagers had rich soil for farming and plenty of game for hunting. However, families began leaving the area at the end of the 19th century due to ease in connecting with other villages. The present-day location of the village was much closer to other villages when traveling on foot. Vaitogians often visit Fogama'a to enjoy the beach and bay.Fai‚Äôivae, Alex Godinet (2018).

She is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church.  Education  Theoharis received her BA in Urban Studies from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. In 2004 she received her Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary (New York City), and her Master of Philosophy in 2009 and PhD as the Henry Berg Scholar in New Testament and Christian Origins in 2014 from the same institution. The title of her dissertation was \\"Will 'The Poor Be With You Always?': Towards a Methodological Approach of Reading the Bible with the Poor\\".  Anti-poverty activism  In 1994, Theoharis moved from her hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to attend the University of Pennsylvania. While there she became involved in Empty the Shelters, a student organization dedicated to ending homelessness related to the National Union of the Homeless, and the Kensington Welfare Rights Union. In 1995, as part of KWRU, she participated in the takeover of St. Edwards church in Philadelphia by dozens of homeless families, after it was closed by the Catholic diocese. In 2003, along with other leaders from KWRU and the related Poor Peoples Economic Human Rights Campaign, she established the Poverty Initiative at Union Theological Seminary and the \\"Poverty Scholars Program\\" to build a network of grassroots organizations united around ending poverty. The Poverty Initiative launched the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice, with Theoharis as one of its two Co-Directors (along with Larry Cox), in 2013. In 2017, Theoharis' first book, Always With Us? What Jesus Really Said About the Poor was published. The book combines reflections on her experiences as an organizer and educator in Philadelphia and with the Poverty Initiative with Biblical scholarship and theology to argue that Jesus' words in Matthew 26:11‚Äî\\"The poor you will always have with you\\"‚Äîare part of the Bible's call to end poverty. Later that year the book was made recommended reading for all Presbyterian Churches through the denomination's \\"One Church, One Book\\" initiative. Also in 2017, Theoharis became a national Co-Chair, with Rev. Dr. William Barber II, of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. During 2017 and the first half of 2018, she traveled to various parts of the country to advance the local organizing of the campaign, including Detroit, MI; Harlan County, KY; Selma, AL; and Charleston, WV. During the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival's \\"40 Days of Action\\" in May‚ÄìJune 2018, she was arrested while leading a prayer on the steps of the Supreme Court as part of the campaign's protests in Washington, D.C. The next day a statement prepared by her was read out in a hearing with members of the Congress and Senate. In November 2018, Theoharis and Rev. Dr. William Barber II gave an official TED talk titled \\"A Call for a Moral Revival\\". In December 2018, Revive Us Again: Vision and Action in Moral Organizing, a book she co-authored with Rev. Dr. William Barber II and Rev. Dr. Rick Lowery, was published. In 2019, as a co-chair of the campaign, she participated in \\"National Emergency Truth and Poverty Tours\\" organized in various states, meant to highlight the problems facing diverse poor communities in the United States, and the solutions being proposed by the campaign and local organizations. She was the co-chair of the campaign's \\"Poor People's Moral Action Congress,\\" held from June 17-19th, 2019 at Trinity Washington University in Washington, D.C. At the event, she co-moderated a town hall with candidates for the 2020 Democratic Primary and testified before the House Budget Committee, along with other leaders from the campaign.

Shortly after he received his doctorate, a promising academic career was interrupted in 1934 when he joined the (by this time illegal) Communist Party and briefly became a resistance activist. In 1935 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison, but ten years later in April 1945, as the Hitler regime collapsed, he was one of a number of long-term inmates from the Siegburg jail at who organised their own \\"self-release\\", with the help of two pistols that he had been able to purchase, already loaded, on the prison black market. After the war, according to more than one source he became one of very few historians from the German Democratic Republic who built a reputation for serious historical scholarship beyond the confines of the East German academic establishment. Biography =Provenance and an itinerant childhood= Walter Karl Hugo Markov was born into a Protestant family in Graz, an industrial and administrative city along the mainline between Vienna and Trieste, in the heart of what was still at that time the Austro-Hungarian empire. The family was Austrian, albeit with ancestral origins in several different parts of the empire. Franz Mulec (1881‚Äì1974), his father, was a sales representative working for the Deutsches Kalisyndikat (potash fertiliser producer). Franz Mulac came from a Slovenian farming family that had been present in Lower Styria since at least as far back as the eighteenth century. Walter's mother, born Minna Auguste Isabella Schellbach (1889-), is described in sources as a languages teacher. She came from Vienna and was the daughter of a businessman who worked in the printing sector. As a result of her family background she would always regard herself as a true \\"German German\\" (\\"Reichsdeutsche\\"). One year after Walter's birth the family moved on to Laibach (as Ljubljana was known at that time) in connection with Franz Mulec's work, where they remained till 1915. For the rest of the war they returned to Graz where Markov attended a \\"protestant private school\\". In 1919 they went back to Laibach. Over the next few years he attended school successively in Laibach, Kranj and Belgrade. In 1925, while still at school in Laibach, he involved himself in politics, campaigning with a group of friends for the \\"Liberal Social Democrats\\" (SDS). By 1927, when he passed his school final exams (Abitur), he was fluent in several different languages and attending school in Su≈°ak (Rijeka). =University= Later that year he enrolled at the University of Leipzig to study History. He received financial support from the Austrian branch of the evangelical Gustav Adolf Association and therefore added Theology to his studies, taking care to ensure that, as far as his sponsors were concerned, his principal focus was not on History but on Theology. Markov's autobiography dwells at length on his student years, which were happy and rewarding. He writes of a cycling tour undertaken in the Rhineland during the 1928 summer vacation: the tour was not without disappointments. He complains about the heavy traffic on the roads beside the river, which was unusually heavy due to the Olympic Games being held in Amsterdam: just outside Bonn he was involved in a collision with a motorcyclist: he did not like the very acidic wine people drank in that little city: in Cologne the cathedral was simply too large for a decent photograph: D√ºsseldorf was worth checking out: but Duisburg and the large heavily industrialised region behind the port was the \\"ugliest piece of all Germany\\". After his Rhineland cycling tour Markov began to find life in Leipzig unattractive: \\"So unlike the Rhine ... off to the liberal German Rhineland!\\". Less than a year after that cycle tour, in March 1929 he took the train to Cologne. His sponsors at the Gustav Adolf Association had accepted that his talents and preferences led him towards History rather than Theology, and recommended Cologne University (or, failing that, Bonn) even though in Catholic Cologne an evangelical Theology faculty did not even exist. Following his transfer to Cologne he was assigned lodgings at a parsonage in Roggendorf, more than 50 km (nearly an hour by train) from the city centre. He was to combine his university studies with work as a home tutor. Roggendorf was on the edge of Zone A (the demilitarised zone), while Cologne was still in Zone B, occupied by French forces since the end of war. However, for the history student there were no difficulties encountered in crossing between the two zones. Nevertheless, the distance was too great for daily university attendance, and he missed many lectures. A particular influence during his time at Cologne was the left-wing economic historian Bruno Kuske who did not shy away from a positive assessment of Soviet economic performance since the October revolution. He was also impressed by Johannes Ziekursch, a specialist on the history of Silesia, who delighted Markov with his trenchantly critical evaluation of the iconic Prussian king, Frederick the Great. Markov's was able to indulge his enthusiasm for travel with several lengthy cycle trips into the Belgian countryside. However, at the end of 1930 the Roggendorf parson died and his widow gave up on her duties as a landlady. Markov's immediate reaction to the loss of his lodgings was to return to Leipzig, but he subsequently transferred to Berlin University. Berlin was the fulcrum of the polarised politics and gridlocked parliamentary process that would lead, two years later, to the cancellation of democracy in Germany. It is not clear that in Berlin he was particularly diligent in attending lectures. As a student of political history Markov nevertheless enjoyed a ringside seat for the accelerating collapse of what Adolf Hitler had scornfully derided at a party rally in 1929 as the \\"Republic of Weimar\\". Markov also managed several more trips, including visits home to his parents in Austria. His own political sympathies lay not with the National Socialists, nor with the shrinking band of political moderates, but with the Communists. For the summer term of 1933 he moved on yet again, this time to the University of Hamburg, intending to study for a doctorate with Richard G. Salomon, an expert on eastern European medieval history. Unfortunately the Hitler government had taken power in January. They lost no time in translating the ugly antisemitic rhetoric of their opposition campaigning into a pillar of government strategy. Salomon was Jewish which made his professorial position untenable. (He would be formally removed from his academic post in March 1934.) Markov's plans needed to be rethought. It was Salomon who recommended that Markov should now move to the University of Bonn and complete his doctoral work under the supervision of the \\"brilliant\\" (\\"in allen Farben ... schillernden\\") historian Fritz Kern, who had long since moved beyond the confines of his earlier speciality as a medievalist. Markov now took the train (with his bicycle) to Bonn in October 1933, spending his first night there in a youth hostel. He was filled with confidence that Kern was \\"the director of the only Institute for Universal History in Germany\\", he had found his doctoral supervisor of choice. Admiration was evidently mutual. On 3 January 1934 Fritz Kern invited Markov to dinner. Over a glass of wine, the famous historian urged his latest prot√©g√© to produce a dissertation and obtain his doctorate without further delay. He suggested the longstanding Serbian prime minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá as a suitable subject. Just four weeks later, on 1 February 1934, Walter Markov submitted his dissertation entitled \\"Serbien zwischen √ñsterreich und Russland, 1897-1908\\". The doctorate, awarded on 28 February 1928, was accompanied by a Summa cum Laude commendation. Kern himself arranged for the dissertation to be published the next year. =Resistance= It was also in 1934 that Walter Markov, now employed as a research assistant at the University of Bonn joined the Communist Party. In the aftermath of the Reichstag Fire the government had made the party illegal in March of the previous year. Thanks to his experiences at Hamburg, Markov by now had a pronounced political agenda, and was telling friends that he regretted not having joined the party earlier, while he was still studying in Hamburg. An important friend, in political terms, was Hannes Schmidt who had transferred from Hamburg to Bonn the term before Markov made that move. Schmidt already had contacts with the illegal Communist Party while he was still in Hamburg. The two had met in Fritz Kern's lectures. In the dangerous atmosphere of the times they initially dealt with one another cautiously, but once satisfied that they really were both on the same side they formed the nucleus of what became a five-man party resistance cell. They were joined by G√ºnter Meschke, a former mathematics student who had arrived in Bonn in April 1934 hoping to be able to obtain a doctorate in history. Markov and Meschke had got to know one another when they had lived in the same student hostel in Berlin-Weissensee during 1931/32. The fourth member of the group was Arthur Toynbee (1910-1975), eldest son to the celebrated English philosopher-historian. whom Markov would later describe as a \\"highly gifted, good looking, but melancholy Englander who thought that communism was a 'great idea',\\" but one which could not be pushed through in England. The fifth man was a theology graduate called Hans Schadow. In the new Germany Schadow was doomed to be something of an outsider and therefore a government opponent: his family came from Niedamowo (near Danzig), and he had been unable to demonstrate to the authorities that all four of his grandparents came from good German stock. He had therefore never been issued with an Aryan certificate (\\"Ariernachweis\\"). (Markov nevertheless suspected that Schadow's communist commitment might be less than whole-hearted.) In May 1934 these five men set up a \\"University Communist Party Group\\" (\\"Gruppe Universit√§t der KPD\\"), commandeering for their purposes a presumably little-used room in a tower assigned to the university's Institute of Celtic Studies (\\"Keltologische Institut\\"). They agreed to a monthly subscription of two marks each, in order to build up a \\"fighting fund\\". Markov, who had a university post, managed to have their meetings in the room in the tower listed as a Russian course, and the university, therefore, provided a five hundred mark payment to cover the summer term. It was both a strength and a weakness of the cellular structure of communist resistance groups that the Markov group had no contact at all with the persecuted communist party officers of the Bonn subdistrict (\\"Unterbezirk Bonn\\"), nor with the banned Communist student group (\\"Kostufra\\"). An idea attributed to Arthur Toynbee was that they could at least take steps to enlighten English-language tourists visiting the country about the true nature of the National Socialist regime. Appropriate leaflets were drafted. One source for the texts was leaflets that the ever travel- hungry Markov had picked up in Luxembourg in March 1934, when he had taken a bus to the Grand Duchy in connection with a \\"World Cup Qualifying Match\\" involving the Germany national football team. They gathered more material when Markov, Meschke, Toynbee and Schadow took a cycling trip to the Saarland which had been under French military occupation since 1919 and was therefore, for most purposes, beyond the reach of the German security services. In Saarbr√ºcken they were able to speak with exiled members of the party leadership, but they were not (at this stage) provided with the contact addresses that they had been hoping for. While they were in the Saarland Markov took the precaution of opening a bank account with a French bank which he thought might be of use in the future. Back in Bonn, the group discussed further moves. There was discussion of a possible assassination in front of the Alexander Koenig Museum in connection with an expected visit to the city by Hermann G√∂ring, which might be used to attract further recruits to the cause. Eventually, they managed to establish a link with the underground Communist Party. This came about through Hannes Schmidt who by now was engaged to a woman classified by the authorities as a half-Jew. As a drummer and jazz fan, Schmidt had acquired some \\"street credibility\\" in local \\"Bohemian\\" circles. Schmidt was able to make contact with a pharmacist called Charlie Fromme (1908-1958) and a bookshop owner called Karl Limbach (1911‚Äì1972) in October 1934, which turned out to be the long-awaited contact with the party leadership for the local subregion (\\"Unterbezirksleitung\\"). It turned out that by this time Walter Markov was also under surveillance by the security services. Markov's doctorate in February 1934 had been followed by a graduation ceremony in July 1934 at which discussion had turned to Wilhelm Pieck, already a leading figure in the hierarchy of the German Communist Party. Someone present had thought it worthwhile to report details of the conversation, in which Markov had participated, to the authorities. Nevertheless, Markov was not arrested during 1934 and the group remained unmolested by the authorities, suggesting that at this stage they still were not minded to take the Markov group very seriously. During the winter term of 1934/35 contacts between Markov's group and the underground subregional party team grew closer. Markov, whose middle names were \\"Karl\\" and \\"Hugo\\" took to using the initials \\"CH\\" to sign his articles in the resistance newspaper \\"Sozialistische Republik\\" for which he had himself chosen the title and which for the time being was filled almost exclusively with his own contributions. By now his home was under surveillance and mail was being intercepted. This was done so openly that Markov later speculated that it was not the government directed Gestapo who were responsible, but good local Catholics from the Bonn city police department trying to warn him of the danger in which he was placing himself. Sources indicate that in the end the Markov group were betrayed by people believed to be fellow communists who were involved in carrying illicit party mail. Hans Schadow was arrested on the evening of 8 February 1935: Markov the next day. =Arrest= Markov's arrest took place in the office of the Theologian-Orientalist and department director Paul Kahle (who himself would escapee to England in 1939). Markov at this stage still held a Yugoslav passport, and might easily have been able to escape, but that was not how matters turned out. He was taken initially to the police station in Bonn's City Hall Square, and then successively to prisons in Bonn, Essen and Berlin. Charged with high treason, it was in Berlin that on 4 May 1936 he faced trial with his group in the special People's Court. Meschke was sentenced to a six-month jail term and Schadow to twelve months. Possibly because he was identified as the leader of the group, Markov was sentenced to twelve years. Anthony's famous father, Arnold Toynbee, made the journey to Berlin in order to intercede personally with a government minister, Hanns Kerrl. In the case of Walter Markov, however, any impact resulting from Toynbee's intervention was outweighed by Markov's attitude in court: he showed no contrition and held resolutely to his principles. =Prison= Markov spent the rest of the Hitler years in the prison at Siegburg (near Cologne). Most of the sentence ‚Äì according to one source eight years of it ‚Äì was spent in solitary confinement. He later described the work he was given as \\"tiresome, but not difficult\\" (\\"l√§stig [aber] nicht schwer\\"): plucking hemp, sorting tinfoil ([possibly for flak production, knitting army socks with a machine or embroidering raffia bags. He remained loyal to Stalin and rejected privileges (such as a razor). He refused to submit voluntarily to medical or dental care. He welcomed the chance to network with other prisoners, and not just the communists. One of his friends on the inside was Michael Jovy. After the war they went their separate ways, and when Markov next met Jovy, in 1980 at an international historians' congress in Rumania, Jovy was serving as the West German ambassador to Bucharest. During 1944 the long stretches of solitary confinement came to an end, and Markov found himself sharing two or three- person cells. Interventions by his mother and from his old university supervisor and mentor, Fritz Kern brought some improvement in his conditions including, in 1944, a transfer from the \\"tailoring hall\\" ‚Äì where the lice on soldiers' clothing sent in for repair constituted a constant health threat ‚Äì to the prison library. He was also given an off-site assignment to work at a section of Bonn University (approximately ten kilometers / six miles away) that had been destroyed by aerial bombing, to rescue (part of) Fritz Kern's library from the rubble. Fritz Kern was by now turning out to be a valuable friend in time of trouble. Some months later he handed over 2,000 Marks with which Markov would be able to purchase two loaded pistols on the black market that was operating inside the prison. In the face of many setbacks, including a serious Typhus outbreak, the transfer of fellow inmates on whose support he had been counting, the retaliatory shooting dead of three fellow inmates from Luxembourg following an attack and intense overcrowding, Markov championed the idea of an armed uprising among the inmates against the prison staff. As matters turned out, it was only a matter of a few days before American troops appeared on the outskirts of Siegburg that Walter Markov and some companions succeeded in overpowering the prison guards and managers. When the Americans arrived they installed Markov and a selected team of political prisoners to run the prison in place of the overpowered former guards. The priority, for the Americans, was to keep the inmates inside the prison, because they were fearful that once released the infected inmates would unleash an indiscriminate Typhus epidemic on the civilian population and occupying forces alike in Bonn and the surrounding area. In the event Markov's career as a prison governor proved brief, however, since the other inmates rejected the idea of being managed by a self-proclaimed communist and took steps to \\"disempower\\" him. =After the war: British occupation zone= In the end Markov, too, contracted Typhus. He was taken into various hospitals and facilities outside Siegburg, but in June 1945 was able to return to Bonn, the city where he had been building his academic career more than ten years ago before he was arrested.He found a centrally located room which he was able to rent as a sub-tenant. He was unable to return to a permanent post at the university, however. The university rector was now Heinrich Konen who was unwilling to back an application from an avowed antifascist who was even now devoting his energies to rebuilding the (no longer illegal) Communist Party. Markov became, in addition, an active backer of the Soviet-inspired (and, it would become increasingly apparent, Soviet influenced) Free German Youth organisation, as well as of the \\"Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss\\" (General Students' Committee) and the \\"Kulturbund\\" (\\"Cultural Association\\") which was also widely assumed to be taking direction from fraternal comrades over in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946 Walter Markov joined the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which had been created through a contentious political merger between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. The idea was to prevent any future resurgence of right wing populism by creating in Germany a single united party of the political left. In the event, whatever plans may originally have existed for the political merger to be implemented across the four occupation zones, it was never implemented outside the Soviet occupation zone. In the three western zones the SED was viewed with suspicion, as a thinly disguised tool of Soviet expansionist aspirations. Although Markov may still, in 1946, have been undecided about his future career trajectory, he will have been aware that his SED membership closed off many career options in the universities sector of the three occupation zones that would be joined together and relaunched, in 1949, as the German Federal Republic (West Germany). =After the war: Soviet occupation zone= With the question of where to build his future still unresolved, Markov considered moving back to Slovenia ‚Äì by now part of Yugoslavia ‚Äì or Graz (still in Autria) in order to be near his parents and wider family. He rejected the idea partly because he believed his family had been insufficiently resolute in opposing the National Socialists during the German occupation. He did, during 1946, make several trips to Berlin. During one of these, he attended an historians' conference at the Hotel Adlon in the eastern half of the city (and therefore in the Soviet zone). At the conference he was able to make himself noticed by giving a reply to the speech of welcome given by Anton Ackermann, a leading member of the team engaged since 1945 in implementing a well planned nation-building exercise under the supervision of the military administration and the leadership of Walter Ulbricht. Shortly after the conference Markov received two job offers: one came from the University of Greifswald in the extreme northeast of the Soviet zone and the other came from the University of Leipzig in Saxony. He chose Leipzig, he later explained, because the university rector that year was the distinguished philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. It was still 1946 when he relocated from the Rhineland to Leipzig on the banks of the Plei√üe. As a Marxist historian he had seen no future for himself in the western part of Germany. There are also indications that he was troubled by political developments in the western zones. Many years later he said that his decision might have been different if he had been able to foresee, in 1946, the 1968 developments in the West German universities. =Irene= It was in Leipzig that Walter Markov teamed up with Irene B√∂nninger. Originally from M√∂nchengladbach, she is the sister of one of Markov's comrades from his time in Bonn. She had moved to Leipzig to study. One source identifies her as a librarian. The two of them married in 1947. That was followed by the births of the couple's five children between 1948 and 1957. =Professor in the Soviet occupation zone= In his new role as a Leipzig university professor, Markov retained elements of his old \\"critical spirit\\". During 1947/48 he joined up with a teacher from Fulda called Martin Hellweg to represent the Communist Party and the SED in the deliberations of the Imshausen Society, a coming together of approximately forty intellectuals from the four occupation zones. The goal was to chart a future for Germany. There was talk of \\"a third way\\" and of a \\"synthesis between east and west\\". There was an underlying assumption that military occupation would not last forever, and that when it came to an end there should be a realistic set of plans in place for a strong Germany, united in a spirit of rejection against any possible revival of National Socialism. There is no indication that Markov's participation was mandated or endorsed by the political authorities in the Soviet occupation zone: they already had their own plans.Schwiedrzik, Wolfgang Matthias: Tr√§ume der ersten Stunde. Die Gesellschaft Imshausen. Berlin 1991, p. 29 Also in 1947 Markov received his habilitation (higher academic qualification), not from the University of Leipzig but from the University of Halle, 50 km / 30 miles to the north-west, where he briefly took a teaching professorship from April till November 1947. The topic of his dissertation was the \\"basics of Balkan diplomacy\\" and the various relationships and interdependencies between the Balkan states. Many years later, in 1999, the dissertation was published as a book by the university press. In 1949 he returned to Leipzig, now with a full professorship and a teaching chair in modern history (\\"Allgemeine Geschichte der Neuzeit\\"). He now lived and worked at Leipzig till his retirement in 1974. He served between 1949 and 1968 as director of the (semi-autonomous) Institute for Cultural and Universal History (\\"Institut f√ºr Kultur- und Universalgeschichte\\") which since its establishment by Karl Lamprecht in 1909 had established a rich tradition of scholarly achievement. From 1951 he was also director of the Institute for General History (\\"Institut f√ºr Allgemeine Geschichte\\"); and between 1951 and 1958 he served as Director of the Institute for the History of the Soviet Peoples (\\"...f√ºr die Geschichte der V√∂lker der UdSSR \\") - later renamed as the Institute for the History of the European Popular Democracies (\\"...f√ºr die Geschichte der europ√§ischen Volksdemokratien\\"). =Career swerve= A career-threatening development came in 1951, at which point Markov had still done little to modify his reputation as an \\"unorthodox\\" thinker. An increasingly nervous party leadership suddenly accused him of \\"Titoism\\" and \\"Objectivism\\" in January 1951. This may have arisen at least in part out of a reading of his 1949 habilitation dissertation on the complexities of nineteenth and twentieth-century rivalries in the Balkans. Markov was now excluded from the party. (Irene Markov retained her membership.) At the same time, he was stripped of his official (and prestigious) status as a Victim of Nazi Persecution (\\"Verfolgter des Naziregimes\\"). He was permitted to maintain his academic career. Nevertheless, his field of study abruptly changed from the nineteenth and twentieth century Political and Diplomatic History of the Balkans to an intensive study of the Fourth Estate in pre-revolutionary and revolutionary France. From research undertaken at the Stasi Records Agency it becomes apparent that for approximately two years Walter Markov was active as one of approximately 100,000 Stasi informants in East Germany. In February 1959 a Stasi officer called Rauch, visiting him in his apartment, obtained a verbal commitment (\\"Verpflichtungsgespr√§ch\\") from Markov that he should provide reports on people he came across in the course of his work. Slightly unusually, there seems never to have been a signed written declaration of commitment. Rauch reports that Markov was constantly nervous of damaging his personal relationships with friends and academic colleagues in other universities: Rauch was understanding. There are references in the files that Rauch created to a \\"gentlemen's agreement\\". Rauch, who became Markov's Stasi handler, was chiefly interested in his \\"international\\" contacts, meaning members of the academic community in West Germany and the \\"capitalist abroad\\". (In practice, outside West Germany espionage on behalf of Warsaw Pact governments was usually undertaken by the KGB, whose reports went directly to Moscow.) There can be no guarantee that surviving files at the Stasi Records Agency present a complete picture of Markov's work for the Stasi. Rauch appears to have been one of Markov's former students who hoped to gain promotion within the service by making use of his re-established contacts with his former professor. Their meetings were generally brief (but presumably long enough for an exchange of reports and instructions), and took place roughly once every two months, either in Markov's apartment or at the university. The relationship seems to have fizzled out during 1961. Nevertheless, Markov's academic career ran relatively smoothly during the 1960s and 1970s and his international reputation grew. This, and the fact that during the 1960s he began to receive the \\"usual national honours\\" (starting, in 1961, with the National Prize), indicate that one way and another the period of his work for the Stasi coincided with a certain level of informal rehabilitation, following his dramatic fall from grace back in 1951. There is no record of his having been officially readmitted to the SED before 1989, however. =Jacobins and enrag√©s= Two particular focuses of Markov's researches on the French Revolution involved the contributions of the Jacobins and of the so-called Sans-culottes. In the process, he established the basis for a left-wing radical interpretation. As he chronicled the demands of the Jacobins, Markov was among those who recognized clear adumbrations of another revolution, the Proletarian revolution choreographed by Marx. Moving beyond mainstream traditions of Marxist historiography he placed new emphasis on the small but influential group of working-class radicals known as the Enrag√©s. \\"Die Freiheiten des Priesters Roux\\", his 1967 biographical study of the executed radical priest Jacques Roux, turned out to be the first in a four-volume biographical study which provided a characteristically careful and detailed study of a man hitherto more usually consigned to a couple of paragraphs. For Walter Markov, Roux represented \\"a consistent plebian egalitarianism\\". The work gained for Markov a reputation in East and West Germany, and further afield, as a scholar prepared to shun \\"top-down\\" history in favour of history told \\"from the bottom upwards\\". An additional side-effect of his switch from Balkan to French history was the extent to which he was able to network internationally, notably with hist friends, the hugely influential French left-wing historian, Albert Soboul. In contrast to most East German citizens, he appears to have enjoyed unrestricted international travel privileges, at least from the early 1960s. =Internationalist= A further sign that official attitudes had changed since 1951 was Walter Markov's admission, in 1961, to full membership of the (East) German Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He was also a co-founder and became president of the Deutsche Afrika Gesellschaft (\\"German-African Society\\"), of which he held the presidency between 1961 and 1969. During 1962 and 1963, Markov spent time at Nsukka in Nigeria as the first Director of the History Department at the new university. In 1963 he briefly held a guest professorship in Sri Lanka, but throughout and beyond the 1960s, even though he was the recipient of a number of academic awards and prizes from foreign universities, most of his research and teaching still took place in Leipzig. During 1970/71 he taught at the University of Santiago in Chile (which under the Allende presidency became an important ally of the German Democratic Republic). By this time, partly as a result of his overseas visits and contacts, he was acquiring an academic interest in the recent history of liberation struggles and decolonistation in what people in Germany at this time were beginning to refer to as the \\"third world\\". In 1968 he became the first director of the Department for African and Near-Eastern Studies which he had set up at the University of Leipzig. His research interests also broadened out to embrace \\"world history in the revolutionary context\\" (\\"Weltgeschichte im Revolutionsquadrat\\") which was the title of a book he published in 1979. =Final years= Walter Markov retired from his university posts in 1974. His later years were encumbered by poor health, but he continued to publish regular articles in the academic press and to observe the progress German Democratic Republic from his Marxist perspective. In his retirement he could never have been classified as a signed-up critic of the r√©gime; but nor were his contributions entirely bereft of criticism. His interest in comparative revolutionary research was carried on by his former student Manfred Kossok. Two serious heart attacks in 1983/84 reduced his productivity. He continued to work on his memoires and agreed to a few interviews about aspects of his earlier life. After the changes which paved the way for democracy and reunification, at the end of 1989, he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which was a newly relaunched and rebranded incarnation of the old East German ruling SED party, now struggling - ultimately with considerable success - to adapt itself for a democratic future. Walter Markow died on 3 July at :de:M√ºhlenbeck (M√ºhlenbecker Land)Summt am See, a small lakeside settlement just outside Berlin. Awards and honours (selection) Publications (selection) Walter Markov's published legacy includes approximately 800 papers and articles, published in journals such as Die Weltb√ºhne, Sinn und Form and the Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaft. There are also around 30 monographs.

It may be seen as a subgenre of techno-thriller. The genre heavily relies on elements of science fiction or fantasy. The major motive are the sinister consequences of modern science/technology, used either by evil actors towards their evil goals, or by benevolent actors who lose control and things go horribly wrong. This subgenre notably belongs to Western civilization and Japan and does not exist in China, India, Egypt, etc.Tony Magistrale, Abject Terrors: Surveying the Modern and Postmodern Horror Film, 2005 p. 82 First techno-horror films were produced in big numbers in 1950s, most of them being of low quality and undeserving of critical review, with some exceptions, such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) or Forbidden Planet (1956). A yet another form of techno-horror is inclusion of technology into otherwise classical narratives. An example is the evolution J-horror genre: classical \\"scares\\", such as ghosts, spirits, curses, etc., propagate via hi-tech media: computer networks, cell phones, etc. Here, modern technology is not a threat per se, but rather a new conduit for various dark forces.Sonny Bunch, \\"Techno-Horror in Hollywood.

She was formerly the president of Din√© College from 2000 to 2003.  Education  Manuelito-Kerkvliet was born on May 14, 1954, in Laramie, Wyoming. Her Navajo family is from Tohatchi and Naschitti, New Mexico. She has three sisters and a brother. Her parents moved to Wyoming as part of the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 to work for the Union Pacific Railroad. Manuelito-Kerkvliet was born into the Towering House clan, born for the Salt clan while her maternal and paternal grandfathers were in the Mud and Weaver clans respectively. She is the great-great granddaughter of Navajo Chief Manuelito. She experienced racism and a \\"redneck mentality\\" growing up in a predominately white community in the 1960s. She completed a B.A. in social work in 1976 and a M.S. in counselor education in 1988 from the University of Wyoming. She earned a Ph.D. in educational policy and management from the University of Oregon in 2005.

Talsorian Games in 1995 for the near-future dystopian role-playing game Cyberpunk. Contents Eurosource Plus, a 144-page book designed by Jose Ramos, Florian Merx and Steve Gill, explains Europe and its culture in the Cyberpunk universe, where Europe is a single bloc run by large corporations. The book is divided into eight sections: # Fortress Europe (how to enter Europe, legally or illegally; border police) # Who Runs Europe? (The Euro Council, government structure; Interpol; various commissions) # The Major Powers # The South # New Central Europe # The Margins # Class and Eurostyle (social classes, cyberpunk style, everyday life, income, transportation, laws) # The Roles in Europe (how various Cyberpunk classes can be used in Europe) Reception In the March 1996 edition of Arcane (Issue 4), Andy Butcher was unimpressed, giving it a poor rating of only 5 out of 10 and saying, \\"Eurosource Plus is packed with information and detail, but in a form that's a real effort to trawl through. If you can force yourself, you will find nearly all the stuff you need to effectively play adventures in Europe or characters that were brought up there. The Euros may represent the pinnacle of style in Cyberpunk, but this book represents a low point in the style of the game.\\" In the November 1996 issue of Dragon (Issue 235), Rick Swan called it \\"A good, not great, supplement for the Cyberpunk game.\\" Swan felt the 144-page book was overly ambitious for its relatively short length, and should have focussed on one or two countries, not twenty: \\"It‚Äôs hard to cover the economy, politics, and geography of Italy in less then three pages. Spain and Bulgaria get about two pages each. Portugal gets about one.\\" He concluded, \\"A narrower focus would have allowed the designers more room to breathe.
