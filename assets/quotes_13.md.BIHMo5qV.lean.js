Biographical background Barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own and in 1775, after only a year of marriage, Barbauld suggested to her brother, John Aikin, that they adopt one of his children: Eventually her brother conceded and the couple adopted Charles; it was for him that Barbauld wrote her most famous books: Lessons for Children (1778–9) and Hymns in Prose for Children (1781). Literary analysis Barbauld’s Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children were a revolution in children’s literature. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them and, even more importantly, she developed a style of “informal dialogue between parent and child” that would dominate children’s literature for a generation.McCarthy, “Mother of All Discourses,\\" 88–9. Legacy Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose had, for children’s books, an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of William Blake and William Wordsworth,McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses,\\" 85–6. they were also used to teach several generations of school children. Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox ridiculed Barbauld’s children’s books and believed that she was wasting her talents,Rodgers, 71. Barbauld herself believed that such writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in her footsteps. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer explains, “she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard.”Rodgers, 72. In fact, because of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were inspired to write for poor children as well as organize a large-scale Sunday School movement, Ellenor Fenn wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children and Richard Lovell Edgeworth began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate in not only an educational treatise authored by Maria Edgeworth and himself but also in a large body of children’s stories by Maria herself.Myers, 261.

The village is in the eastern part of Punjab, India (31°5'12\\"N, 76°10'15\\"E http://wikimapia.org/8646413/Ram-Rai-Pur). It is situated on the right bank of the Sutlej which is one of the 5 main rivers in Punjab. It is also one of the oldest villages in Punjab with a history dating back to the 17th century. The village consists of 4 large Sikh family clans, which are represented by the Dhindsa, Dhariwal, Dharni & Jhaj clans. Some of these family members have since emigrated to places all over the world such as Canada, England, New Zealand, Australia and America The Dharni families are also known as \\"Sikhan de\\". The late Sant Sewa Singh was one of the main heads of the family and he was well respected by the whole village as well as the local politicians. The families originally came from the Bathinda district and relocated more than five decades ago. The original five families have now grown to more than twenty. Families There are four main families in Ram Rai Pur *Dhindsa *Dharni *Dhariwal *Jhaj History 1634 AD The battle of Kartarpur was fought between Mughal troops and Guru Hargobind. The imperial troops were routed and both Painda Khan and Kala Khan were killed whilst hiding on the outskirts of Ram Rai Pur. During the rest of the 17th Century, Jalandhar remained firmly attached to the Delhi Empire. With the death of Aurangzeb in 1707 the Mughal Empire began to disintegrate. 1710 AD Katar Singh Dhariwal of Ram Rai Pur and his army received appeals from the peasants of the Jalandhar Doaba to help them against the Mughal Faujdar, Shams Khan of Jalandhar. The news of the return of Katar was enough to put heart into the Sikhs and who then rose to fight back against the Mughals. Shams Khan was defeated in Rahon. 1716 AD The capture and execution of Katar Singh Dhaliwal and his followers in the year 1716 led to the persecution of the Sikhs. The Sikhs were thought to be completely crushed, in reality they were temporarily subdued. 1807 AD Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab) crossed the Sutlej and attacked the Rajput fort of Nariangarh in the Ambala district. Katar Singh Dhariwal's grandson Mohan Singh Dhariwal & Tara Singh Gheba, accompanied him; however Tara became ill and died on his way home during the siege. His death was kept secret while the body was sent in all haste to Rahon where he was from. According to J.D. Cunningham, Tara Singh Gheba's widow, Rani Rattan Kaur equalled the sister of the Raja of Patiala in spirit and she was described to have girded up her garment and fought, sword in hand. The Jalandhar Doaba had been absorbed into the dominion of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and given over to Dewan Mohkam Chand. 1846 AD John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence was appointed the commission of the Jalandhar Doaba on its annexation in 1846. He put a curfew around Ram Rai Pur the heart of the Sikh uproar against the British Raj and the surrounding villages, killing any one who did not adhere to his rules. In 1847 nine members of the Dhindsa family were shot and hanged in an action to scare other villages around Ram Rai Pur. 1918 AD Mahatma Gandhi visited Ram Rai Pur He organized a detailed study and survey of the villages, accounting for the atrocities and terrible episodes of suffering, including the general state of degenerate living. Building on the confidence of villagers, he began leading the clean-up of villages, which led to the building of schools and hospitals and also encouraging the village leadership to undo and condemn many social evils, as accounted above. 1947 AD The partition of India resulted in the process that led to the creation on 14 August 1947 and 15 August 1947, respectively, of the sovereign states of Dominion of Pakistan (later Islamic Republic of Pakistan) and Union of India (later Republic of India) upon the granting of independence from the British Empire, marking the end of the British rule of India. Over 60 people men, women & children were killed leaving Ram Rai Pur going to the new Pakistan. Many more would have been killed had it not been for the help of the local village people.

Founded in 2005 in Greenhithe, Auckland, New Zealand by Julie Chapman, it works to help New Zealand kids living in poverty (defined as living at 60% or less of the median wage, or one in four New Zealand children) through a variety of programmes (In Our Own Backyard, Food for Kids, Shoes for Kids, Raincoats for Kids, Warm Kids Cool Kids and Health for Kids). They provide food, socks, shoes and raincoats to over 46,000 disadvantaged children. The Child Poverty Monitor is a partnership between the New Zealand Children's Commissioner, the JR McKenzie Trust and the University of Otago who measures and reports on New Zealand child poverty annually. According to them, 265,000 kids live in poverty in New Zealand. 17% of New Zealand kids live in material hardship (where at least six out of sixteen predefined items and services like fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, a good bed, ways to keep warm, electricity bills etc. are not affordable) while 3 out of 5 kids already living in poverty have lived like that (with their income under the poverty line) for seven years or more. KidsCan was founded with a NZ$40,000 grant from Guardian Trust. It now supports over 40,000 kids in nearly 300 New Zealand low-decile schools in 14 regions nationwide with: \\\\- Food for Kids, providing nutritious and targeted food for 10,585 financially disadvantaged children across New Zealand every school day, either as a complete meal or to supplement what they have at home. 2.6 million items of food were provided for children with food insecurity in 2012. \\\\- Shoes for Kids, providing a free pair of shoes and two pairs of socks for children coming to school in winter without footwear or with footwear that is in bad condition. Over 8,000 pairs of shoes and 16,000 pairs of socks were distributed in 2012. \\\\- Raincoats for Kids, providing free fleece-lined, waterproof raincoats for kids whose families, struggling to make ends meet, often relegate as a lower-priority item. Schools recycle the raincoats every year and KidsCan tops them up as needed. 15,620 raincoats were distributed in 2013, in partnership with the New Zealand Warriors. \\\\- Warm Kids Cool Kids, providing thermal tops and beanies during the winter months and sunhats during summer in partnership with The Warehouse. Over 17,000 hand- knitted beanies and 10,000 sunhats were handed out in 2012. \\\\- Health for Kids, a new initiative for 2013 providing nit treatment, nit combs, hand sanitiser, band-aids and tissues for KidsCan partner schools. Over 2000 children were supported when the programme launched in Kaitaia - over 1000 basic hygiene items and 290 prescription medicines were provided.

Settlement of Shady Grove began in 1857, but with the advent of rural migration, the population had dropped to 25 by the 1950s. New housing developments begun during the 1990s and 2000s, however, have caused the empty community to be reborn, causing controversy along the way. Geography Shady Grove lies at the junction of county roads V65 and D47 between Brandon and Jesup. It lies 1/2 mile east of the Black Hawk county line. Other nearby towns include Jubilee and La Porte City in Black Hawk County and Mount Auburn in Benton County. History Shady Grove was founded in 1857 at the western edge of Jefferson Township, near the Buchanan-Black Hawk county line. Shady Grove was close to another town named Sunnyside. In 1886, a post office opened under the name Shady Grove. Despite attracting businesses including a machinery dealership, a creamery, a church and a general store, the town never incorporated. Years of rural migration caused the population to drop to 25 persons (seven families) by 1958. The general store closed in the 1980s and the building was moved from its original spot to one on Spring Creek Road. The town remained on county maps as late as the 1990s, though there was nothing left to mark the community other than a giant machine shed with the words \\"Shady Grove\\" on it. There is still evidence of Shady Grove's existence. Property owned by the Schares contained the building which once was a barber shop. They knocked it down in 2004 to make room for their cattle field. At the time of its destruction, newspapers lined the walls like wallpaper. Cattle land owned by the Youngbluts was discovered to hold the old Shady Grove Cemetery. The tombstones have tumbled and been broken up and some possibly lost due to flooded creeks and cattle tromps. The Buchanan County Historical Society has taken the cemetery area under their wing and turned it into a protected area with a sign outside the fence recognizing its existence. During the mid-1990s, there was renewed interest in the area as developers began selling plots of land. By 2007, more than forty new homes had been built in the area, causing concern for the area's local farmers. References External links * \\"Shady Grove sees a revival\\" RadioIowa.com.

After paying-off in April 1830 she was recommissioned the following month and was made flagship at Portsmouth Dockyard. From 1831 until 1834 she served in the Mediterranean. On 18 February 1834, St Vincent was at Malta when the British merchant schooner Meteor was destroyed there by the explosion of her cargo of gunpowder with the loss of 28 lives. The explosion severely damaged St Vincent and drove her aground. She was refloated on 21 February 1834 after discharging all 120 of her cannon. and subsequently was repaired and returned to service. Placed on harbour service at Portsmouth in 1841, St Vincent joined the Experimental Squadron in 1846. From May 1847 until April 1849 she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Napier, commanding the Channel Fleet. After a spell in ordinary at Portsmouth, from July to September 1854, during the Crimean War, she was used to transport French troops to the Baltic. Subsequently she became a depot ship at Portsmouth. She was driven ashore there on 11 January 1862, but was refloated. She was commissioned as a training ship in 1862, and specifically as a training ship for boys, moored permanently at Haslar from 1870. In this role she retained 26 guns. She continued as a training ship until 1905. Commander Cecil Thursby was in command from April 1899, succeeded by Commander Bentinck J. D. Yelverton from January 1902. The final commander was G. C.

It was called Minolta Maxxum 9000 in the US and Minolta α-9000 in Japan. As the first professional autofocus SLR system ever made, the Minolta 9000 AF sports of number of unique features showing the transition from electro-mechanical cameras to the next generation of fully electronic cameras. For instance, it is the only autofocus system ever made with a manual film transport rather than automatic electronic winding.  History  In the early 1980s, Minolta was developing several ranges of autofocus SLR cameras, with the Minolta 7000 aimed at the advanced amateur market, and the Minolta 9000 aimed at the professional market. Development on the Minolta 9000 was completed before that of the Minolta 7000, but for marketing purposes, the 9000 was held back and the 7000 was launched first in February 1985. For this reason, the 7000 is often considered to be the first ever autofocus-capable SLRNotwithstanding earlier SLRs retrofitted to incorporate autofocus capabilities such as the 1982/1983 Nikon F3AF; the poorly-performing Pentax ME F; and prototypes by Canon and Contax, such as the Yashica Contax 137 AF In any case, the Minolta 9000 AF was the first professional SLR system featuring a wide range of autofocus-capable accessories, with the New York Times calling it \\"The first 35-millimeter automatic-focusing camera built for professional use\\" and \\"revolutionary\\",Durniak, 12 January 1986 and Leif Ericksenn, editor-in-chief of Photo Methods magazine calling it \\"one of the most astonishing cameras of the decade\\". At the time of its introduction, the Minolta 9000 retailed for $684 (circa $1580 in 2017).  Characteristics  The body of the Minolta 9000 is a robust all-metal construction, with the pentaprism being the only component not to be completely encased in metal. The shutter was capable of the then-extremely short exposure time of 1/4000 seconds, as well as of 1/250 second synchronisation. The exposure meter provided the user with the usual range of automatic exposure modes: automatic, shutter priority, aperture priority and manual mode. As metering modes, it was capable of centre-weighted integral metering and spot metering; spot metering could be further refined with light and shadow corrections, which used an exposure memory to correct exposure by up to 2.3 EV. Furthermore, an optional back \\"program back super 90\\" (PBS-90) provided multi-spot measurements, with optional automatic weighting by average (AVERAGE), mean (CENTER), highlight (HIGHLIGHT) and shadow (SHADOW), as well as user-definable program curves.Backs, 9000.org The backs also provided automatic bracketing. The autofocus allowed not only quick focusing on static subjects, but also continuous focus. The Minolta 9000 also accepted a variety of focusing screens, a lockable button for depth of field preview, lighting of the viewfinder and a built-in eyepiece to protect the eye of the photographer from lateral light. The Minolta 9000 was compatible with Minolta AF accessories, including a full range of lenses in Minolta A-mount, flash units, and various other accessories such as a 5-frame/second motor winder,Motor/Winder, 9000.org a 100-exposure magazine and several backs.

History Born in Paris where he currently lives, he grew up with American culture, watching films by his favorite directors, Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Frank Capra, Sergio Leone. But it was French comedian Louis de Funès who is responsible for Monro's passion, when he discovered his films as a child. As a consequence, he started acting at age 9 before making his first films at 13. After graduating from French Film School ESRA, in 1997, he attended Jack Waltzer's (a lifetime Actors Studio member) masterclass for a few years in Paris and New York. From 1999, Gregory Monro has written, produced, performed and directed several professional short films, most of which toured international film festivals such as Toronto, Palm Beach, Bolzano and South Korea. Monro has a passion for the American West history and its legends, and is particularly concerned with feminine conditions. He is a specialist on Calamity Jane and has prepared various works on her. He published a few books, created a special exhibit in Paris in 2010, directed a docudrama for European broadcaster Arte, and is currently working on a feature film. Prior to his Calamity works, he purchased Calamity Jane's controversial diary and letters in 2004, which led to his projects. In recent years, Monro directed several biographical documentaries, amongst them \\"Louis de Funès Forever \\", Calamity Jane : Wild West Legend \\" and \\" Jerry Lewis : The man behind the clown \\", selected at the Telluride Film Festival, the Lumière Film Festival, and Haïfa International Film Festival. Aside from his artistic career, Monro has worked as a production manager for numerous commercials and music videos, including Ayo, Sepultura, The shoes and Hugh Coltman.

The machi-bugyō was expected to be involved in tax collection, policing, and firefighting; and at the same time, the machi-bugyō needed to play a number of judicial roles – hearing and deciding both ordinary civil cases and criminal cases. Only high-ranking hatamoto were appointed to the position of machi-bugyō because of the critical importance of what they were expected to do. The machi-bugyō were considered equal in rank to the minor daimyō. There were as many as 16 machi-bugyō located throughout Japan.

It is a flavorful rustic dish typical to the counties of Ribagorza, Sobrarbe and Somontano de Barbastro, high up in the Spanish Pyrenees. In the Catalan counties of Alta Ribagorça and Pallars, formerly territories united to the historic County of Ribagorza in medieval Aragon, chireta is known as gireta, or girella, respectively. Being a mountain recipe, nothing goes to waste: once the choice cuts of a slaughtered sheep have been reserved, the intestines, tripe, neck meat, minced liver including heart and lungs, are all used. This is enhanced with rice, chopped pancetta or bacon, cured ham, parsley, garlic, a pinch of cinnamon, salt and white pepper. Chireta literally means \\"inside out\\"—i.e., the sheep's intestines which make up the casings are cleaned and turned inside out for a smoother, more appetizing appearance. The casing is cleaned in white vinegar then rinsed very well before filling. The filling contains rice mixed with garlic, parsley and seasoned chopped meats. Casings are filled about a half to two-thirds of the way with the rice mixture, taking care not to overfill them, as the rice will expand once the chiretas are boiled in the broth—otherwise they are likely to burst. Once trussed, and just before cooking, they are also examined to make sure any air pockets are pushed out. Chiretas are usually served hot, as a main dish. However they taste just as good, if not better, when served up as tapas, sliced, dipped in an egg-flour batter, and fried to a golden color. Chiretas can be found on the menu in restaurants of the Ribagorza, and Sobrarbe regions, and can also be sampled as tapas in the wine valley cuisine of the Somontano area. In 2002, a Somontano meat packer initiated a chireta festival, which has been running every year since then, around the third weekend of October.

The Carmelite Church has Warsaw's most notable neoclassical-style façade, created in 1761-83. The church assumed its present appearance beginning in the 17th century and is best known for its twin belfries shaped like censers. History The present church is the second building to have arisen here, erected over the site of a wooden church originally constructed for the Discalced Carmelite Order in 1643 and burned down by the Swedes and Brandenburg Germans in the 1650s. Polish-baroque architecture The new building was founded in 1661 by Polish Primate Michał Stefan Radziejowski, who also established Warsaw's Holy Cross Church. It was built in 1692-1701 to the plan of Józef Szymon Bellotti. The church's basic structure had been largely completed by the end of the 17th century, but the present façade was not begun till 1761. It was erected by Prince Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, who commissioned the German architect Efraim Szreger to draw up a plan for a comprehensive new façade. This impressive façade was built in a style typical for the reign of King Stanisław II Augustus, with dominant columns supporting the cornice. The distinguished 18th-century artist Szymon Czechowicz embellished the church with his paintings. Another leading Polish painter, Franciszek Smuglewicz, created altar paintings. The interior is opulent, with magnificent rococo main altar, gilding and stucco ceiling decorations. The Carmelite Church was the site of Frédéric Chopin's first employment. He was invited to give a recital on the church's organ. Former Carmelite Church and monument to Adam Mickiewicz In 1864, after the January Uprising was brutally crushed by Russians, the monastery was liquidated by the Tsarist regime as a stronghold of Polish patriotism. The buildings have been since adapted for the Warsaw Archdiocesan Seminary and the former Carmelite Church serves as the seminary church. During World War II the church was saved from deliberate destruction by the retreating German forces and was only slightly damaged. It served as a procathedral until the reconstruction of St. John's Cathedral.

It was sold in North America as Maxxum 7000i, and in Japan as α-7700i. This camera had the usual Program AE, Shutter priority AE, Aperture priority AE and metered manual exposure modes (standard on the 7000), TTL autoflash (like the Minolta 7000) and added a newer faster and more sensitive AF system, faster shutter speed (1/4000s), faster film advance (3 frame/s), new flash hot-shoe that was incompatible with the older flash system. The 7000i supported the Minolta AF lens system, and other accessories such as the remote cords. Perhaps more innovative than any other improvement was the expansion card system. While also used in other models in the i-series, some models in the xi-series, and some si-series cameras, the Minolta Creative Expansion Card System debuted on this model. The expansion card system provided a way to add features to the camera, such as multi-spot metering, or re-program the built-in AE modes to favor faster shutter speeds or smaller apertures, such as the sports action card. While most of the cards' functions and effects could be duplicated by a technically knowledgeable photographer using the camera without the expansion cards, the card system was handy for less technically skilled users who just wanted to photograph their child's soccer/football team for example, without needing to learn about exposure settings and the effect they might have on how a picture \\"looked\\". This camera directly was squarely aimed at the same market as the Minolta 7000.

When built, Camp Century was publicized as a demonstration for affordable ice-cap military outposts and a base for scientific research.https://archive.org/details/TheU.S.ArmysTopSecretArcticCityUnderTheIceCampCenturyRestoredClassifiedFilm A preliminary camp for Project Iceworm whose end goal was to install a vast network of nuclear missiles launch sites that could survive a first strike. This was according to documents declassified in 1996. The missiles were never fielded and necessary consent from the Danish Government to do so was never broached. Powered by a nuclear reactor, the camp operated from 1959 until 1967. The base consisted of 21 tunnels with a total length of . Project Iceworm was aborted after it was realized that the ice sheet was not as stable as originally assessed, and that the missile basing concept would not be feasible. The reactor was removed and Camp Century later abandoned. However, hazardous waste remains buried under the ice and has become an environmental concern. Scientific research Ice core samples from Camp Century were used to create stable isotopes analyses used to develop climate models. Analysis of soil contained in the samples suggests that the site was ice-free as recently as 400,000 years ago, indicating a much reduced Greenland ice sheet and therefore much higher sea levels. History The \\"official purpose\\" of Camp Century, as explained by the United States Department of Defense to Danish officials in 1960, was to test various construction techniques under Arctic conditions, explore practical problems with a semi-mobile nuclear reactor, as well as supporting scientific experiments on the icecap. Construction on the camp and the sub-glacial nuclear reactor began without explicit permission from the government of Denmark, leading to a political dilemma for Prime Minister H. C. Hansen. Design and Performance Camp Century Trench Construction Camp Century Trench Deformation Designed as an arctic subsurface camp and constructed by use of the cut-and-cover trenching technique. Layout of the camp consisted of a series of parallel main trenches in which buildings and other structures were housed. The camp had a design life span of 10 years with appropriate maintenance. It was permanently manned for 5 years and abandoned after 8 years.Camp Century Evolution of Concept and History of Design Construction and Performance, Technical report 174 (PDF), p. 27 The trenches constructed in 1959 had compressed both vertically and horizontally that many had reached their design margins within 4 years. After that, extensive snow trimming was required to maintain the trenches as the snow encroached on the buildings.Camp Century Evolution of Concept and History of Design Construction and Performance, Technical report 174 (PDF), p. 41 The subsurface camp provided good protection from the elements and had modern bathroom, dining, and medical facilities.https://archive.org/details/TheU.S.ArmysTopSecretArcticCityUnderTheIceCampCenturyRestoredClassifiedFilm The camp maintained a number of vehicles and had plenty of storage for fuel and food. The reactor provided plenty of power and proved it could be installed, operated, and removed in such a remote location. It powered the base for over 3 years but was shutdown due to the unexpected accelerated compression of the reactor trenches, in part due to the residual heat in the reactor area required to maintain the feed water pools. The snow trimming required to maintain the trenches, and sewage disposal were both ongoing problems. The sewage sump was 150 feet from the nearest building and initially not vented. As a result, the odor of sewage became almost unbearable in the nearest quarters after the first year of operation. Subsequent venting of the sump reduced the odor but did not completely eliminate the condition. In 1962 core samples were taken in the areas near the sump and found that liquid wastes had horizontally permeated up to 170 feet (52 meters). Thus odor from the sump affected near by trenches with sleeping quarters and also accelerated trench deformation.Camp Century Evolution of Concept and History of Design Construction and Performance, Technical report 174 (PDF), p. 43 In Oct 1965 the US Army concluded that subsurface ice camps are feasible and practical, that nuclear power offers significant advantages, and that the wealth of data and experience obtained from Camp Century will be of inestimable value in future designs.Camp Century Evolution of Concept and History of Design Construction and Performance, Technical report 174 (PDF), p. 65 However, on permanent snow fields it is elevated structures that are in common use today.https://www.geosummit.org/sites/default/files/docs/Summit-Station_ERDC- CRREL_SR-14-2.pdf No large subsurface ice camps are known to have been constructed after Camp Century was abandoned.  Residual environmental hazards  In 2016, a group of scientists evaluated the environmental impact and estimated that due to changing weather patterns over the next few decades, melt water could release the nuclear waste, 200,000 liters of diesel fuel, a nontrivial quantity of PCBs, and 24 million liters of untreated sewage into the environment as early as the year 2090. Transition in ice sheet surface mass balance at Camp Century from net accumulation to net ablation is plausible within the next 75 years under one climate model. Another 44 to 88 years could expose the buried wastes between 2135 and 2179. Climate models differ. A Norwegian climate model suite (NorESM1) shows that increased snow fall is not overcome by increased melting. A Canadian model suite (CanESM2), gives an anticipated 2090 solid waste depth of 67 m, and between 44 and 88 years of persistent ablation that would be required to melt all overlying granular snow and expose wastes at the ice sheet surface. In either scenario, eventually contaminated and highly diluted melt water could be released at the coast. As of 2016, the majority of solid waste was likely buried at an approximate depth of 36 m (120 feet). Data suggests that in 2090 solid and liquid wastes will reside at depths of 67m (220ft) and 93 m (305ft), respectively. But surface and subsurface melt rates are uncertain. Neither the US nor Denmark had taken responsibility for the future clean-up.

The channel was available to high definition digital television viewers through Network 10 owned-and-operated stations. The multichannel broadcast live sport, entertainment, films, documentaries, science fiction and news. The channel ceased broadcasting on 25 March 2009, and the following day was replaced by One (now known as 10 Bold). Following the government's decision to remove the SD Primary Channel limitations, the channel returned as a HD simulcast on 2 March 2016 on channel 13, then to channels 1 and 15 following the addition of 10 Shake from 27 September 2020. To make room for this, 10 Bold's HD feed closed down and 10 Bold was reduced to two standard definition (SD) feeds. History =Origins= From 2002, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by Network Ten. =Breakaway era= Ten HD was officially announced on 14 September 2007, to replace Network Ten's existing high definition service, a simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services, through the use of an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2006 permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition. Although originally expected to be the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, the surprise launch of Seven Media Group's HD offering, 7HD, on 15 October 2007, two months before transmissions were scheduled to begin, meant that Ten HD was launched as the second high-definition multichannel in Australia. PBL Media announced the creation of a similar multichannel, 9HD, on 27 September, which was launched on 17 March 2008. Ten's parent company, and shareholder in metropolitan ratings system OzTAM, Ten Network Holdings Limited, began discussions with the ratings system operator to have digital multichannels, such as 10HD and ABC Comedy, included in television ratings for the first time on 17 September 2007. As well as this, on the same day, it was announced that the national weekend editions of 10 News First would be timeshifted from 10 onto Ten HD, an hour delayed at 6 pm, to directly compete with Seven News and Nine News. This would have seen 10 News First formally broadcast at 6 pm for the first time since 1992, however, the timeslot was later amended to 5.30 pm. In preparation for the launch of 10 HD, Ten's digital terrestrial channel line-up was updated on 19 November 2007, with changes consisting of LCN1 redirecting Network 10's current high-definition simulcast. Following this, on 21 November 2007, Ten Network Holdings Limited announced that it would launch the channel on 16 December 2007 at 5.00 pm, with the first program, Totally Wild. Opening night Ten HD officially commenced transmission on 16 December 2007 from the network's five metropolitan owned-and-operated stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. Prior to the official launch, at 5.00 pm the first program, Totally Wild, was broadcast. Following this, for the first time since 1992, 10 News First and Sports Tonight were broadcast in direct competition with Seven News and Nine News, timeshifted by thirty minutes to 5.30 pm and 6.00 pm respectively. The first official program on launch night began at 8.30 pm, the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down. This was followed by Bon Jovi's Lost Highway Tour at 11.30 pm and Video Hits Presents: The Music of Supernatural at 12.25 am. Video Hits Up-Late marked the end of the first night of transmission for 10HD at 12.50 am. In the lead-up to the opening night, the channel promised up to eleven hours of time-shifted programming from Ten in addition to fifty hours of exclusive programming, which included live sport, entertainment, films, documentaries, science fiction and news. This consisted of six movies per week, in addition to National Geographic documentaries in the afternoon, from 3pm to 5pm, music- oriented programming following the Sunday Night Movie, along with a primetime breakaway schedule on Thursdays and from 10.30 pm to 11.30 pm Monday to Wednesday. In addition to high definition broadcasting on channel 1, a high definition simulcast of 10HD was provided on channel 12 alongside a standard definition simulcast on channel 11 as Ten SD2. Full simulcast and launch of 10 Bold From 2009, commercial networks in Australia were allowed to broadcast a standard definition subchannel. Rather than introduce a new digital service, Ten decided to relaunch Ten HD as a sports-only channel, to be named One HD (now 10 Bold), and use its standard definition simulcast on channel 11 to broadcast a standard definition simulcast called One SD. Before One HD's official launch, most breakaway programming shown on Ten HD ceased from 1 January 2009, and only showed a high-definition broadcast of the existing Ten digital service, along with a few sports-based breakaway programs. Ten HD officially shut down on 25 March 2009, with One HD (now 10 Bold) launching the following day. =2016 revival= After the Nine Network restarted broadcasting 9HD in November 2015, 10 confirmed that it was working on rebroadcasting Ten HD. However, they did not put a time frame on it, stating that they are \\"working through some technical and rights issues\\". On 11 February 2016, some smart TVs began receiving notification messages advising of 10HD through a \\"ghost broadcast\\" that soon disappeared. Ten later recommenced simulcasting in high definition on 2 March 2016 on channel 13 from 3pm, in time for the 2016 season of the Supercars. As a result, One was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on both channel 1 and channel 12. Ten uses MPEG-4 technology to broadcast Ten HD. Upon the regional media shakeup on 1 July 2016 where WIN Television replaced Southern Cross Austereo as Ten's primary regional affiliate network, WIN's high definition simulcast on channel 80, WIN HD, became Ten HD's regional counterpart. NRN in Northern New South Wales carried 10HD from 21 September 2016 under Southern Cross' ownership. The station would sell off to WIN by 31 May 2017, keeping the 10 branding until playout and transmission were transferred to WIN's MediaHub facility the following September. Programming Ten HD broadcast programming consisting of news, live sporting events, entertainment, films, documentaries and science fiction. In addition to this, themed programming line-ups were broadcast on specified days, including Sci-Fi Saturday. The channel provided fifty hours of exclusive content per week including up to eleven hours of time-shifted programming from Ten, as well as additional programming from popular Ten franchises such as Australian Idol, The Biggest Loser, and So You Think You Can Dance. Overseas programming on Ten HD included; Psych, Battlestar Galactica, Cane, Conviction, Eureka, Friday Night Lights, Journeyman, One Tree Hill, Over There, Smallville, The 4400, The Bold and the Beautiful, The Shield and Veronica Mars. In the late evenings a mixture exclusive series, movies and encore screenings of series were broadcast. Late- night series broadcast included The X-Files, Charmed, JAG, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, NYPD Blue and Sex and the City. In addition to this, high- definition documentaries from the National Geographic Channel and Granada Television screened on weekdays from 3 pm to 5 pm. =News= To compete directly with Seven News and Nine News, Ten HD broadcast local editions of Ten News, timeshifted by half an hour, on weekdays at 5.30 pm, allowing the second half of the bulletin to compete with the offerings from the other commercial networks. On weekends, the national bulletin was delayed by half an hour at 5.30 pm and Sports Tonight followed at 6.00 pm. Ten HD simulcast the Early News and Morning News, 6 am and 11 am respectively. It did not simulcast Late News but instead showed exclusive programming from 10.30 pm, with a drama series and then a late movie, followed by repeats of Video Hits Up-Late specials. =Sport= 10 Sport broadcast live or near live exclusive and simulcast sporting events on 10HD. These included NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, Formula One, MotoGP, the NFL, the Indian Premier League, the World Golf Championships, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, the Mission Hills World Cup and the New Zealand PGA Championship. In addition to this, the Australian Football League was simulcast on the channel, with all of Ten's games filmed in high definition. Formula One Grand Prix and MotoGP races were televised on 10HD, usually on tape delay. Most of 10HD's sports content was kept after it was relaunched as 10 Bold. Availability =Original channel= In its former inception, Ten HD was available exclusively in 1080i high definition from the network's five metropolitan owned-and-operated stations, TEN Sydney, ATV Melbourne, TVQ Brisbane, ADS Adelaide, and NEW Perth. The breakaway programming was never available outside of the metropolitan areas, although Southern Cross Ten had planned to rebroadcast the service from mid-2009: it instead launched the One service. Foxtel added the channel to its line up for cable customers in June 2008, when the subscription television provider launched its Foxtel HD+ service. =Revival channel= Ten HD is available exclusively in 1080i high definition. Upon its revival on 2 March 2016, Ten HD returned to 1080i50 high definition, but was broadcast in MPEG-4 format as opposed to the standard MPEG-2 format. Ten HD covers all Ten- owned metropolitan stations as well as the Gold Coast (covered by its Brisbane station). It is also available to regional viewers via WIN Television on channel 80 for Southern NSW, regional Victoria, regional Queensland, Tasmania, regional SA, regional WA and channel 50 for Northern NSW and the Gold Coast. On 16 September 2020 in Metropolitan areas, 10 HD moved from Channel 13 to Channel 15 due to the impending launch of Network 10's third digital channel 10 Shake.

Reign  The eldest son of George VII of Imereti and Princess Rodam of Kartli, Alexander was brought up at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli and enjoyed his support in the power struggle in Imereti. He visited Istanbul in the 1710s in order to seek Ottoman aid against the Gurieli usurpers of the crown of Imereti. In August 1719, he returned with a detachment of Turkish auxiliaries, deposed George VIII Gurieli in June 1720, and was crowned king of Imereti. However, from 1721 to 1728, the government was effectively run by Bezhan Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. When Alexander assumed full ruling powers, Bezhan's son and successor Otia defied him and his pro-Turkish policy, and attempted to remove Alexander from the throne. Alexander managed to force him into submission in 1732 and brought, for the time being, a feudal anarchy to an end. In the early 1730s, the king effectively withdrew his loyalty from the Ottomans, refused to accept the Persian suzerainty and attempted to make an alliance with the Russian Empire. In 1738, he sent Bishop Timothy Gabashvili to St. Petersburg with a plan of joint actions against the Ottomans. However, the 1739 Russo-Turkish Treaty of Belgrade rendered the mission abortive. Indignant at his diplomacy in Russia, the Ottomans sponsored a coup that deposed Alexander in favor of his brother George IX. The Persian ruler Nadir Shah quickly took Alexander's side and protested to the Ottoman government. In 1742, Alexander was restored, but faced a revolt, in 1746, by his brother Mamuka who ruled as a rival king in parts of Imereti until the fratricide war ended in Alexander's victory in 1749. Yet, the general instability and occasional outbreaks of aristocratic disobedience continued to trouble the rest of Alexander's reign.  Family  Alexander was married twice. He married firstly, in 1721, Mariam (died 1731), daughter of Bezhan Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, and secondly, in 1732, Tamar (died 1772), daughter of Prince Levan Abashidze. Alexander had six sons and two daughters: * Princess Khoreshan, born of Alexander's union with Mariam Dadiani. She was married to Prince Nikoloz Tsereteli (1722–1772) * Prince Narin-David (c. 1727–1749), born by Mariam Dadiani. * Princess Rodam (died 1770), born by Mariam Dadiani, who married, in 1732, Prince Mamia IV Gurieli (died 1784). * Solomon I (1735 – 23 April 1784), born of Alexander's union with Tamar Abashidze, King of Imereti (1752–1766, 1768–1784). * Prince Ioseb (1739–1776), born by Tamar Abashidze, Catholicos of Abkhazia (1769–1776). * Prince Bagrat (1741–1800), born by Tamar Abashidze.

Since 1 September 2010, it is part of the town Harzgerode.  History  The village was established in 1530/31 in the district (Amt) of Bärenrode by the counts of Stolberg, but soon thereafter was transferred to the princes of Anhalt-Bernburg. The first village houses were erected on the present day Church Square (Kirchplatz). Farm workers were the first to settle here. They soon built a small church and, in 1542, received the first Evangelical priest. The Thirty Years' War devastated the peaceful village. In 1806 there were 58 houses with 370 inhabitants who lived off farming, cattle breeding, coal transportation and woodcutting. Neudorf developed into a mineworkers' village (the best-known ore mines were the Meiseberg and Pfaffenberg pits). In 1887 the present brick church was built. A workers' hostel was built for the many craftsmen hired for the mines. Neudorf im Harz was known its mining and the mineral specimens of great beauty that were discovered here and which had become much sought after collectors' items by the 19th century (including specimens containing galenite, siderite, quartz, zinc blend and bournonite crystals). Specimens from this period may be viewed e.g. in the Zincken Collection in Bernburg Castle. Following the closure of the pits, tourism sprang up as a new source of income. The spring of Stahlquelle (\\"Steel Spring\\") was made accessible to visitors in 1931 and contributed to Neudorf's good reputation as a tourist destination. On 1 September 2010 Neudorf was incorporated into Harzgerode.StBA: Changes to the municipalities of Germany, see 2010  Tourism  There is a checkpoint (no. 193) for hikers by the Stahlquelle which is part of the Harzer Wandernadel system.

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Mixcoatlus barbouri is a venomous pit viper species endemic to Mexico. No subspecies are currently recognized. Etymology The specific name, barbouri, is in honor of American herpetologist Thomas Barbour.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Cerrophidion barbouri, p. 16). Description Adults of M. barbouri generally grow to 30–40 cm (11¾-15¾ inches) in total length (including tail), with a maximum recorded total length of 51.0 cm (20 in). The species is terrestrial and moderately stout. The color pattern consists of a blackish ground color, overlaid with a vague dorsal zig-zag stripe that extends down the flanks, which looks like a series of triangular markings. The skin between the scales is rust-colored, as are the sides of the head. Geographic range Mixcoatlus barbouri is found in the highlands of the Sierra Madre del Sur in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. The type locality given is \\"Omilteme [or Omiltemi], Guerrero, Mexico\\". Habitat The preferred habitats of M. barbouri are mountain areas at some 9,000 feet (2,740 m) elevation in rocky pine forests and clearings with bunch grass. Conservation status The species M. barbouri is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: B1ab(iii) (v3.1, 2001). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that the geographic range, in the form of extent of occurrence, is estimated to be less than 5,000 km² (1,930 mi²), estimates indicate the population is severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than five locations, and a continuing decline has been observed, inferred or projected in the area, extent and/or quality of habitat. It is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. The population trend is down. Year assessed: 2007.

Today, this three-tiered structure is supported by UNICEF and The CORE Group and works exclusively for polio eradication in polio endemic and high risk areas in Uttar Pradesh, India. Community Mobilisation Coordinators (CMC) work at the grassroots visiting households and counselling families on a regular basis. In rural areas, each CMC is assigned the responsibility of maintaining contact with 500 families. In crowded urban areas, the CMC networks with 300 families in a given location.  Roles and Responsibilities of a CMC  As a frontline volunteer working with communities to influence health seeking behaviour, the CMC has four main goals: (a) to list all eligible children under the age of 5 years in the area allotted to her; (b) to mobilise all families with eligible children to vaccinate their children against polio at the booth; (c) to identify all likely non-acceptors and counsel and motivate families by addressing misconceptions and fears; and (d) to convert resistant families. Interpersonal counselling is the core of all CMC work. The SMNet relies solely on the continuous effort made by the CMC in influencing behaviour, building networks and partnerships at the local level and motivating people to ensure a huge turnout on booth day.  Interpersonal Counselling  The chief task performed by CMCs is interpersonal communication (IPC) and counselling with families. Children vulnerable to polio belong to communities that are also susceptible to other communicable diseases. In the absence of informed opinion about polio, frontline workers or CMCs counsel communities on ways to prevent an outbreak of polio - through repeated vaccination. The challenge is not to make information available and locally understood, but to combat prevailing notions about the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). Misconceptions about OPV arose chiefly because of lack of adequate knowledge among families and the frequency of polio rounds and the intense rigour with which vaccinators visited localities and immunised children. CMCs are trained to quell these fears through facts and information about polio, how it spreads and its prevention. In addition to factual inputs on polio, they were also oriented to disseminate their knowledge to parents and caregivers. For this, they needed appropriate skills to counsel families. All CMCs are trained to conduct interpersonal counselling sessions with caregivers, mothers in particular to dispel misconceptions about the vaccine and to encourage them to immunise their children. Also, IPC training enables CMCs to pass on information without the possibility of it getting distorted along the way.  Building networks of support  A CMC needs allies to mobilise families effectively. The polio programme has hinged on building networks of support at the grassroots. Partnerships are thus forged with community leaders and religious leaders who command wide respect within the community and are considered to be sources of reliable information. These leaders or influencers assist CMCs to allay fears of families that reluctant to vaccinate children for various reasons: illness, age or the child being too young, fear of sickness and even general ignorance. Influencers and partners help to sustain the momentum built before the round. Though CMCs identify and contact influencers, their supervisors or BMCs sustain the contact by assigning them minor responsibilities. Religious leaders were also similarly included in the strategy of initiating partnerships at the community level. Their cooperation was especially useful in making announcements in mosques before a polio round. Schoolteachers are a key contact for CMCs as they help to organise school rallies and bulawa tolis. While recruiting children to support the programme is an effective way to broaden the base of participation and support for the programme, it also serves the crucial role of creating awareness and a spirit of social service among impressionable children. Bulawa tolis are widely organised in most CMC areas.  Meetings  In between two polio rounds, a CMC conducts meetings with different stakeholders to ensure their support to the polio eradication effort. These are: (a) A meeting with influencers (b) A meeting with expectant mothers (mata baithak) (c) Saas bahu baithaks (meeting with mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law) w (d) Meetings with members of the panchayat and other community leaders (e) Meetings with schoolteachers to recruit bulawa tolis or children’s brigades that are deployed to fetch children to the booth (f) Ijtema or a meeting organised by Muslim men and women where religious topics are discussed with special emphasis on proverbs and the philosophy propounded by Islamic scholars based on their interpretation of the Koran and Hadis. CMCs are trained to introduce health topics during religious discourses  Mosque Élans and announcements in Temples  An important communication challenge was notifying the community of the date of the polio campaign. While there was an intensive media campaign on air and IEC material had been developed to serve this purpose, the community needed constant reminders. Booth turnout would surely increase if announcements were made in mosques and other places of worship. Mosques also had microphones that could ensure that a large number of people heard the announcement. Although there was a provision for miking, there was nothing to guarantee that announcements made would be widely heard. Targeting a congregation was a surer way to ensure that the message delivered was heard. If this message was delivered at a place of worship, it had greater credibility. The CMC networked with imams at mosques and pundits in temples to organise announcements prior to booth day. Today, mosque announcements are universally made in all CMC areas. Mosques and temples often offer space to vaccinators to set up booths in their premises.

Today it consists of 3 parts: a formal park, Woodhouse Moor (often referred to as Hyde Park - see below), of around 26 hectares in area on the west of Woodhouse Lane (the A660), and two other open areas on the east of it. These are known as the Monument (or Upper) and Cinder (or Gravel, or Lower) Moors which are used for events such as circuses and sporting matches, and sometimes car parking. Woodhouse Moor is north-west of Leeds city centre and is bounded by Woodhouse, the University of Leeds, Burley, Hyde Park, and Headingley. As of 2005 the park had just under 3 million visits a year and is the second most popular urban park in Leeds. The park has five main paths which meet in the centre, each is tree-lined and they divide the park into different areas of usage. In the New Year Honours 2009, Head Gardener John Egan was awarded an MBE for services to the community. History 1866 Leeds Map showing Woodhouse Moor top left The park was once part of a much larger moor of the same name, including land now occupied by the University of Leeds. At a relatively high position above Leeds, it has been a military rallying point, and Rampart Road is named after the ramparts which were once there.E. Bews (1998) \\"Woodhouse Moor\\" pp 109-118 in L. S. Tate Aspects of Leeds During the English Civil War, in 1642, Parliamentary forces led by Thomas Fairfax massed on Woodhouse Moor before taking Leeds from the royalists. The plague broke out in Leeds, in 1644, where it raged for a year and 20% of its population died. Many of the inhabitants fled from the town, to cabins hastily built on Woodhouse Moor and other open grounds, to escape the ravages of the disease. The land was acquired by Leeds Corporation for the sum of £3,000 on 19 May 1857. Clarendon Road, which runs alongside Woodhouse Moor, used to be Reservoir Street because of a reservoir belonging to Leeds Corporation Waterworks. The reservoir was begun in 1837, after cholera epidemics swept Leeds in 1832, and was covered over in 1863. Two stone lodges were built alongside the reservoir in 1840; one still stands (behind the gardener's cottage near the Victoria Monument); the other was converted into an observatory in 1906, and subsequently demolished. In 1858 Queen Victoria, in Leeds for the opening of the Town Hall, visited the Moor and listened to 26,000 Sunday School children sing hymns as the teachers tried to control them using placards with instructions such as 'Prepare to Cheer', 'Sing', 'Silence', and 'Dismiss'. The road north of Woodhouse Moor Park is called Hyde Park road, indicating the former name. As with Hyde Park, London this was a place where crowds would gather to hear public speakers, on specially built platforms. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were extensive pleasure gardens and features such as a bandstand and (from 1919) a First World War tank. With the Second World War, the tank was melted down and the Moor given over to more utilitarian purposes such as air raid shelters and allotments (some of which still exist). In 1937 some statues were moved from the centre of Leeds, to the Moor, including those of Queen Victoria and Sir Henry Marsden. The Moor was one of the locations of the Festival of Britain in 1951, opened by the Princess Royal (Mary, Princess Royal, the daughter of King George V and aunt of the future Queen Elizabeth II). Statues There are several Victorian statues in the park: near the Woodhouse Lane, Clarendon Road junction is the Victoria Monument, by George Frampton, which was originally placed at Leeds Town Hall. Near Hyde Park corner is a statue of Sir Robert Peel by William Behnes and at the opposite corner where Moorland Road meets Clarendon road is a statue of the Duke of Wellington by Carlo Marochetti. The statue on Monument Moor, on the opposite side of the A660 Woodhouse Lane to the main body of the Moor, is of Henry Rowland Marsden, a Liberal Mayor of Leeds for 1875-6. These statues are regularly the subject of pranks, and can often be seen with paint on them or traffic cones on their heads.

Activities right The park has playgrounds, allotments, skateboard and BMX park, formal gardens, and large areas of grassland. It is also the southern end of the Meanwood Valley Trail, a footpath through woods and parks to Golden Acre Park. Unity DayUnity Day is held in the park on a Saturday in July or August to help unite the community following riots in the local area in 1995. The actual date is not made public until two or three weeks beforehand. The park is also home to Woodhouse Moor parkrun, one of the many free, weekly 5k runs held in both the UK and internationally. It is held every Saturday at 9.00am (GMT). = Protest = On 21 June 2020, the Black Lives Matter peaceful protest was held in the park, calling for an end to systemic racism, both in the city and beyond.

He joined the New Zealand Labour Party in 1932, but when John A. Lee was expelled from the party in 1940, Douglas followed to join the new Democratic Labour Party. He rejoined the Labour Party in 1952 and represented the electorate in Parliament from 1960 until his retirement in 1975, serving time on the Opposition front bench. Biography =Early life= Douglas was born in Hikurangi in 1910, the son of a policeman. He was raised in a series of several small towns due to his father's job transfers. In 1925 he left school whilst in Mercer and became an apprentice baker. He lost his left arm in a duck-shooting accident in May 1927 leading him to give up baking and undertake secondary schooling at Pukekohe Technical High School for two years. There he became an avid reader and came under the influence of his teacher, Norman Shields, who introduced Douglas to left-wing ideology. In 1929, following his father's death, Douglas and his family moved to the Auckland suburb of Grey Lynn. There he spent one year studying a basic accountancy course via correspondence and attained a position as a clerk. This was short-lived however as after the onset of the Great Depression he was to spend four years either unemployed or underemployed. In 1934 he was eventually employed in a part-time clerical position at the Department of Labour. =Early political career= Whilst he was unemployed Douglas joined the Grey Lynn branch of the Labour Party in 1932, he became a close friend of Member of Parliament (MP) John A. Lee (who lost his left arm in World War I). He became president of the branch in 1935. In May of that same year he was elected to the Auckland City Council as a Labour Party candidate. He served three years as a councillor, chairing the council's library committee, until he was defeated standing for re-election in 1938. He then became the assistant secretary of the Auckland Coach and Car Builders' Union and the Auckland Brewers', Wine and Spirit Merchants' Employees' Union in 1936, and then secretary of both unions the following year, remaining in that post for the latter union until 1963. He was secretary of the Auckland Trades Council from 1939 to 1941 and led the Labour Party's Junior Labour League. When Lee was expelled from the Labour Party in 1940, Douglas left also and helped him set up the Democratic Labour Party (DLP). He was a member of the party's national executive and edited John A. Lee's Weekly. He ran for Parliament in a in and in the for the electorate as a DLP candidate but was defeated. He then operated a bookselling business for about 15 years from 1944, first with Lee and then on his own after he and Lee fell out in 1954. =Member of Parliament= Douglas was re-admitted to the Labour Party in 1952. He proceeded to become secretary of the branch of which his father-in- law Bill Anderton was the sitting MP for. As secretary Douglas undertook much constituency work on Anderton's behalf. Once Anderton had done everything in his power to ensure Douglas would succeed him as Labour's nominee in Auckland Central, he announced his retirement from Parliament in August 1960. Despite Douglas being fully qualified and experienced of his subsequent nomination, many in the Labour Party regarded his succession to Anderton as an act of nepotism. Norman Kirk (left) and Douglas (right) in 1967 In December 1965 he stood for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, but gained only 2 votes. Douglas was elected as president of the Labour Party in May 1966. He retained the position until 1970 when he did not seek re-election. Douglas also sat on the Opposition front bench. He served as spokesperson for a succession of portfolios from 1967 to 1972 including education, social security and industrial relations and immigration. Douglas was downhearted by Labour's shock defeat at the 1969 election and he notified national secretary of the party that he would not seek re-election at the 1972 election, a decision which he later reneged. When Labour finally came to power in 1972, Douglas missed out on selection for cabinet and took himself to the back benches in disappointment. His son, and parliamentary colleague, Roger, only 34, did win a place in the ballot for Cabinet. Douglas did not hide his bitter resentment. The day of the ballot, Prime Minister Norman Kirk was so concerned by the extremity of Douglas' reaction, and its effects on his son, that he called Douglas' wife Jennie to enlist her help regarding Douglas' lack of consideration for Roger's feelings. Kirk told his secretary Margaret Hayward, \\"It should have been the best day of Roger's life but instead it was the worst\\". For months afterwards Douglas was inconsolable and declined Kirk's offer of a position as an under-secretary. Following Kirk's sudden death in 1974 a complete re-selection of cabinet occurred and Douglas put himself forward once again. Another narrow defeat ensued, however this time he accepted it with comparative tranquility. He did derive fulfillment in his final term in parliament out of chairing the select committee which brought down a landmark report in June 1975 about the discrimination against women in New Zealand and their role in society. He then retired from Parliament at the 1975 general election. =Later life and death= In retirement Douglas worked at his family's herbal product business, Red Seal Laboratories. In the 1976 New Year Honours, Douglas was appointed a Companion of the Queens Service Order for public services. He remained politically active and at the 1978 general election he was fervently involved in his son Malcolm's successful campaign for the electorate. Douglas was briefly admitted to hospital in May 1983, after which his health steadily began to decline. He died in Auckland in 1985, aged 75. Personal life Douglas married Dorothy Jennie Anderton, a daughter of fellow politician Bill Anderton, in 1937. They had one daughter and three sons. Two sons, Roger Douglas and Malcolm Douglas, also became Labour MPs, the former becoming Minister of Finance and later founder and leader of the right-wing ACT New Zealand party.

Debrett's Peerage 1888, Foreign Titles of Nobility section, p. 822 Family background He was the elder son of Count John Francis William de Salis (1825–1871), a diplomat and renowned numismatist of Hillingdon, and Amelia Frances Harriet (1837–8 January 1885), eldest daughter of Christopher Tower, JP DL MP, (1800–84), of Huntsmoor Park, Iver, Buckinghamshire, and of Weald Hall, Essex, by his wife, Lady Sophia Frances Cust (1811–82), eldest daughter of the 1st Earl Brownlow (1779–1853). Armorial Achievement from Fox-Davies, 1929 Diplomatic career After being educated at Eton (1877–1882, Edward Compton Austen Leigh's house) he was nominated an attaché in the diplomatic service on 20 November 1886. He passed a competitive examination on 14 January 1887. On 12 June 1888 he was appointed to Brussels as an attaché and promoted to Third Secretary on 14 January 1889. From 24 April 1892 he served in Madrid, and was promoted to Second Secretary on 22 August 1893. From August 1894 he served in Cairo under Lord Cromer in charge of the agency there when the Dervishes were active (he was granted an allowance for knowledge of Arabic on 2 April 1895). In autumn 1897 he was in Berlin, in 1899 in Brussels and from 1901 in Athens, as head of chancery (dealing with the Macedonian problem). He was promoted to First Secretary on 1 April 1904. He was employed between 1901–06 at the Foreign Office in London, and appointed a British Delegate for negotiation of a new Commercial Convention with Romania on 7 September 1905. He served as Berlin chargé d'affaires and counsellor of embassy from 1 July 1906 to 1911, and was a British delegate at the International Copyright Conference at Berlin, October–November 1908. From November 1911 to 1916 he served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the King of Montenegro at Cettinjé, and was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary on a special mission to the Holy See in 1916–1923, (Pope Benedict XV 1916-1922, and same to Pope Pius XI 1922-1923). He was a member of the 1931 Malta Royal Commission (report issued in a blue book, 11 February 1932). De Salis Report Montenegro 1914 In 1919 the British Government sent de Salis to investigate the Serbian occupation of Montenegro, but his resulting report was suppressed. Alexander Devine in The Martyred Nation, 1924 wrote: The fact is the Report contains such a damning indictment of Serbian rule that its publication would immediately provoke interference; and that interference did not suit our policy towards the French Government. In the House of Commons, Ronald McNeill repeatedly asked about production of the Report and De Salis's possible arrest. But as Devine put it: When the day came that Mr. McNeill found himself Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the late Conservative Ministry, the Report was on his desk in the Foreign Office and Mr. McNeill could no more disclose its contents than his predecessors could. Meanwhile, Lord Sydenham in the House of Lords, Hansard, 29 November 1920 said: :The Papers for which I ask are two. The first is the Report of Count de Salis, which the noble Earl (Curzon) the Leader of the House said he had no objection to giving, but he added— If the report is made public, the names of witnesses would be contained in it who gave their evidence to Count de Salis only on the pledge of strictest secrecy, and who might, I think, suffer seriously from divulgation. Could there be a clearer admission of what is going on in Montenegro? In a letter, dated New York, 1 May 1922, published in The New York Times, 7 May 1922, Ronald Tree described the Count as: '..perhaps the greatest English authority on the Balkans'. In April 1920, months after the possible event, an alleged arrest and imprisonment by the Serbians, the New York Times reported: :Serbs arrest de Salis, Montenegro minister accuses Britain and Wilson to Nicholas. :Paris, 2 April. :\\"Count de Salis, formerly British Minister to Montenegro and later a special envoy to the Vatican for the British Government, has been arrested and imprisoned by the Serbians while executing a mission of investigation for his Government. This information is contained in a declaration made to King Nicholas of Montenegro, who is now in Paris, by the Montenegran Foreign Minister. Count de Salis's life has been in danger for a long time, according to this declaration, which prefaces the details of the incident by recalling Earl Curzon's declaration in the British House of Lords that the Montenegrans were anxious for a union with Serbia. Instead of demanding reparations, the declaration adds, the British Foreign Office suppressed the report of Count de Salis and continued to support Serbian claims. The declaration alleges the report was to the effect that the Serbian army 'which overran Montenegro after the armistice terrorized the population'. The reign of terror still continues, says the declaration, which, after asserting that whatever Serbian troops appear the occupation is followed by pillage, incendiarism and massacres, gives details. In conclusion the complaint is made in the declaration that 'Europe knows what is happening to Montenegro but remains indifferent,' and that President Wilson, 'the great champion of small nations, persistently turns a deaf ear.'\\" The sensitivity of the issue is shown by the fact that only one of his four obituaries in The Times (1939) (19 January 1939, page 17, column D) mentions his Montenegran Report, although not the arrest.

Implemented on a Segway platform, the Muppet Mobile Lab is a two-wheeled science-lab vehicle that resembles a small rocket ship. Two Muppet characters, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant, Beaker, pilot the vehicle through the park, interacting with guests and deploying special effects such as foggers, flashing lights, moving signs, confetti cannons and spray jets. The two animatronics characters and the special effects aboard the vehicle are controlled remotely by puppeteers, thanks to an advanced control system that allows the controllers to be located up to several miles away from the show location. On-board cameras, microphones and speakers allow the puppeteers to see and hear guests and interact with them. Muppeteers Dave Goelz and Steve Whitmire assisted in the development of the project. The project began as a continuation of Disney's \\"Living Character Initiative,\\" a program that has generated other interactive shows at Disney theme parks including Lucky the Dinosaur, Turtle Talk with Crush, Monsters, Inc.

Hossain was a pioneer educationalist of Bangladesh. He did original research in statistics and pioneered its education in Bangladesh both as a faculty and administrator. As one the early faculties of University of Dhaka, he was vigorously active in the cultural circles that grew around it. As a Dhaka-centric literary figure in late British India, a period marked by communality and religious sentiment, Hossain and his literary group Shikha distinguished themselves as proponents of communal harmony and rationalism. He was among the sceptical intellectuals who warned the consequences of the short-lived state of Pakistan. On several occasion, he vocally criticized Pakistani government policies, most importantly on the state language question. Early life and education Hossain was born to Qazi Gaohar Uddin Ahmed and Tasirunnesa, at his maternal home, Lakshmipur village, in Kushtia District, in the then British India. He passed his childhood years at his father's village Bagmara in Faridpur, a district adjacent to Kushtia. He received his earliest education from his father and from the village primary school. Hossain entered Kushtia High School, distant from his home, for Secondary studies. During his time in Kushtia, Hossain, coming from a relatively poor family, supported himself by various scholarships, lodged at nearby homes as house tutors and later settled at a hostel. Among the teachers, he specially later recalled of Jyotindranath Roy and Jatindra Mohan Biswas. During his years at the school, Jyotindranath Roy, an accomplished teacher of Mathematics and Sciences, laid Hossain's foundation in algebra, geometry, conic section and mechanics. Mr. Roy, recognizing Hossain's interest in mathematics, introduced the mechanics course solely for him. In 1915, Hossain passed Entrance from there. After passing entrance, already his interest in Science and Mathematics confirmed, Hossain went to Presidency College in Kolkata for I Sc. There he was highly impressed by eminent teachers like Praphulla Chandra Ghosh (English), Mr. Sterling (English), Prafulla Chandra Roy (chemistry). He, however, transferred himself to Rajshahi College, from where he completed his I Sc in 1917, in the middle of the academic year. In his college years, beside his studies, Hossain excelled in sports like football, tennis, etc. In 1917, Hossain arrived Dhaka, his first visit to the town where he would spend rest of his life, and got admitted to Dhaka College for his B A in Mathematics and Physics. Here he found W A Jenkins (Physics), Wrangler Bhupati Mohan Sen (Mathematics), Bankim Das Banerjee (Mathematics) and others as teachers. In 1919, he was awarded BA (honors) from this college. Hossain passed M A in physics in 1921 from the same college. In 1921, the University of Dhaka, was founded, where Hossain would spend the rest of his life, serving various roles; that year, Hossain, still a student of M A at Dhaka College, preparing for final exams, joined the newly founded university as demonstrator (junior lecturer) of physics. The same year, prominent physicist Satyendra Nath Bose joined the university as a reader of physics; Hossain got intimate with Bose as colleague and Bose also quickly recognized Hossain's genius. During his preparation of M A examination, Hossain recalls, Satyen Bose provided critical inputs; their co- operation would continue in later years and Bose would leave formative influence on Hossain's career. Satyen Bose, now head of the department of physics, encouraged Hossain to pursue higher study in statistics, a subject only getting its foothold in India, under premier Indian statistician, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis. Hossain accepted the offer and travelled to Calcutta, Bose himself accompanying him to introduce Hossain to Mahalanobis, to study at Mahalanobis's newly founded Indian Statistical Institute. Hossain returned to Dhaka, in 1938, with a diploma in statistics from Indian Statistical Institute and pioneered the subject in Bangladesh. Upon returning from Indian Statistical Institute , Hossain concentrated on statistics, both as an educator and a self-taught researcher at University of Dhaka. While at Indian Statistical Institute, Hossain learned about balanced incomplete block design, and then endeavoured a thesis, under informal supervision of Bose, who was working on related topics then: counting possibility of certain balanced incomplete block design configurations by trial method. He received a doctorate for this work. Career Hossain (right) with Abbasuddin Ahmed and Allauddin Khan (1955) = Teaching = Qazi Motahar Hossain joined the newly established University of Dhaka in 1921, still a student of M A at Dhaka College, as demonstrator of physics. Two years later, in 1923, he was promoted to assistant-lecturer. Spearheaded by Hossain, University of Dhaka introduced Masters in Statistics, in 1948; Hossain proudly reminisced that University of Dhaka preceded the much older Presidency College of Kolkata in this particular course. He retired from Dhaka University in 1961. Hossain founded the Institute of Statistical Research and Training (ISRT), University of Dhaka, in 1964, and served as founder-director until 1966. University of Dhaka appointed him Professor Emeritus in 1969. In 1975, after the liberation of Bangladesh, he was appointed as the National Professor of Bangladesh, the position he decorated until his death, in 1981. He was a founder fellow of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences. = Activism = In the 1920s and 1930s a Dhaka-based literary organization, Muslim Sahitya Samaj, comprising mainly Bengali-Muslim intellectuals, initiated a movement called Buddhir Mukti Andolon (Freedom of thought movement.) Hossain, through his friend Kazi Abdul Odud, got involved. Unlike the contemporary literary atmosphere of Bengal, mainly dominated by religious partisan spirit, Muslim Sahitya Samaj and their proceeding Shikha upheld values like rationalism, communal harmony, religious tolerance. Though unpopular among the mass, the Shikha group proved to be distinctively liberal and radical: they even went as far as criticizing the Caliphate system, a very unusual and bold feat during that time. Hossain edited two issues of Shikha. He wrote for The Muazzin, the journal of Khademul Insan Samity. Within few years of Pakistan's formation, the nation's opinion got divided over the state language question. Hossain defended the case of Bangla among other leading intellectuals. = Chess = An accomplished chess player, Motahar Hossain was the all India chess champion for seven times. He took the lead organizing chess in Bangladesh. He founded the All Pakistan National Chess Federation in 1969. After independence, he established Bangladesh Daba Sangha, which became the Bangladesh Chess Federation in 1974.  Family and Personal Life  In 1920, still a student, Hossain married Sajeda Khatun. They had eleven children together, some of them would be prominent figures later: daughters Zobaida Khatun, Obaida Khatun, Khurshida Khatun, Zaheda Khatun, Sanjida Khatun, Fahmida Khatun, Mahmuda Khatun and sons (two died in childhood), Qazi Anwar Hussain, and Qazi Mahbub Hossain. Death and legacy He died in Dhaka on 9 October 1981. A postage stamp was published by Bangladesh Postal Department to respect his contributions.

His first published book Shancharan was praised by Rabindranath Tagore. Bangla Academy has published his complete works in four volumes. He had also given many speeches in many occasions and written many biographical notes. A collection of his eighteen biographical essays was published in 2004 under the title Smritikatha by Qazi Motahar Hossain Foundation. The foundation has also reprinted his Gonit Shastrer Itihas in the same year.

He served as Minister of Internal Affairs in the second Labour Government, from 1957 to 1960. Early life Anderton was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England. He married Annie Gertrude Mason in 1913, and they had two daughters and one son. He served in the British Army (Royal Artillery) in World War I. The family arrived in New Zealand in 1921 and settled in Christchurch for a year, before moving to Auckland. Political career In 1933 Anderton was elected to the Auckland City Council on a Labour Party ticket. He was re-elected in both 1935 and 1938 but was defeated in 1941. In 1944 he was Labour's candidate for Mayor of Auckland City, but was defeated by John Allum in an election which saw all Labour candidates defeated. Anderton was one of five candidates for the Eden electorate in the , and came second after the incumbent, Arthur Stallworthy of the United Party. He represented the Eden electorate from 1935 to 1946, and then the electorate from 1946 to 1960, when he retired. In 1947 Anderton was one of three Labour MPs who supported Frank Langstone's contentious proposal that the government make the state-owned Bank of New Zealand the sole legal issuer of bank credit over loans and overdrafts in an attempt to secure state control over the means of exchange. The proposal was rejected as too radical however. Anderton was an agitator against the leadership of Walter Nash during Labour's spell in opposition in the 1950s. He was one of the main instigators of the challenge to Nash in June 1954, which was unsuccessful. As a result, Anderton together with Phil Connolly and Arnold Nordmeyer were called before Labour's National Executive and given warnings about the threat of divisiveness to the party. After Labour won the Anderton was nominated as a candidate for the position of Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, but lost the caucus ballot to Christchurch mayor Robert Macfarlane. He was then nominated to stand for a seat in cabinet in the Second Labour Government. In the third ballot for the final seat he was tied with Mount Albert MP Warren Freer. Freer cast his own vote in the next ballot for the 66 year old Anderton out of gratitude as he had helped Freer into politics years earlier. He was appointed as Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Civil Defence from 1957 to 1960 in the Second Labour Government. Private life Anderton was the father-in-law of Labour MP Norman Douglas. Two of his grandchildren, brothers Malcolm and Roger Douglas, also became MPs. He died in the Auckland suburb of Orakei in 1966.

Some are smaller and plumper than the common Cavendish banana, others much larger. When ripe, raw red bananas have a flesh that is cream to light pink in color. They are also softer and sweeter than the yellow Cavendish varieties, some with a slight raspberry flavor and others with an earthy one. Many red bananas are exported by producers in East Africa, Asia, South America and the United Arab Emirates. They are a favorite in Central America but are sold throughout the world.  Taxonomy and nomenclature  The red banana is a triploid cultivar of the wild banana Musa acuminata, belonging to the AAA group. Its official designation is Musa acuminata (AAA Group) 'Red Dacca'.

Red bananas should have a deep red or maroon rind when ripe, and are best eaten when unbruised and slightly soft. This variety contains more beta carotene and vitamin C than yellow bananas. It also contains potassium and iron. The redder the fruit, the more carotene and the higher the vitamin C level. As with yellow bananas, red bananas will ripen in a few days at room temperature and are best stored outside from refrigeration. Compared with the most common banana, the Cavendish banana, they tend to be smaller, have a slightly thicker skin with a sweeter taste, but do have a longer shelf life than yellow bananas. They tend to cost about 50% more per pound than yellow bananas, just because there is a much smaller supply of them.  Uses  Red bananas are eaten in the same way as yellow bananas, by peeling the fruit before eating. They are frequently eaten raw, whole or chopped, and added to desserts and fruit salads, but can also be baked, fried, and toasted. Red bananas are also commonly sold dried in stores. The red banana has more beta carotene and vitamin C than yellow banana varieties. All bananas contain natural sources of three sugars: sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The first bananas to appear on the market in Toronto (in the 1870s and 1880s) were red bananas.John V McAree (1953) The Cabbagetown Store (Toronto: Ryerson Press) p. 19.

History Share of the Foxdale Railway Company Ltd, issued 1888 The line was officially opened by the Foxdale Railway Company Ltd. (registered on ) on allowing rail access to the lead mining workings around the village of Foxdale. The company had close ties to the Manx Northern Railway (MNR), many of whose directors were also on the board of the smaller company. The line was leased from the outset by the MNR. Shortly after the line had opened, the lead mining industry started to decline and in the Foxdale company went into liquidation. The fortunes of the MNR were closely tied to the Foxdale line due to the terms of the lease being favourable to the smaller concern. Much of the MNR's freight revenue originated in Foxdale, with loaded wagons of lead being transported to the harbour in Ramsey and coal and mine supplies ferried back to the mines. The MNR operated the line on behalf of the liquidators until, following an investigation by a Tynwald committee, the Isle of Man Railway (IMR) took over all operations on the MNR including the Foxdale line on . The IMR was then authorised to purchase both the MNR and the Foxdale line a few months later on .  Decline and closure  The last lead mine in the area closed in 1911 and from then on only spoil trains and the infrequent passenger and general goods services used the line. From , tickets were no longer sold at Foxdale station, the station building being converted into a private dwelling during the 1920s. The last regular passenger train worked the branch in 1940, after which the service was replaced by buses. The line saw some troop specials during the Second World War as well as spoil trains and the occasional passenger service, run due to bus shortages. The last train reported to have used the branch was an engineering working in which removed rails and other material from Foxdale to be used elsewhere on the system. The rails were finally removed during the mid-1970s and much of the route is now a designated public walkway. Today, the station building at St. John's is still in place but now a private dwelling, similarly at the other end of the line the station is extant, but now forms part of a youth club for local children. The stanchions of the former viaduct also remain in place and there are still some rails visible in the road at the outer terminus. It is little known that the famous Scissors crossing behind the station is actually still in situ to this day, although unknown to most people as it was buried underneath a bank of hardcore from the mines(there are actually images which shows this happening). This possibly means that Foxdale has the distinction of being the station on the IoM's closed network which still has most of the original station trackwork surviving! The route and services The line ran from an end-on junction with the MNR west of St. John's, then passed to the north of the IMR station before curving south and crossing the IMR's line from Douglas via an overbridge (the only place where railway crossed railway on the Isle of Man unless one counts the 19-inch gauge Great Laxey Mines Railway tunnel under the Manx Electric Railway) to the east of the station. The line had a fairly constant incline through Waterfall Halt, the only intermediate station, to the terminus in Upper Foxdale. The tracks extended beyond Foxdale into the mine workings area. There were at one time plans to extend the line to join with the IMR's Port Erin line at Ballasalla, but these came to nothing. The railway initially used the MNR station at St. John's, situated to the west of the IMR station. Later, in 1886, the MNR abandoned this and built a new platform and station building on the alignment of the Foxdale Railway more closely adjacent to the IMR station. Foxdale line trains used this facility until 1927, after which trains reversed in and out of the IMR station. Upon the opening of the railway, the MNR ran some services from Ramsey to Foxdale, but passenger traffic on the line was always light and these services gave way to local shuttles between St. John's and Foxdale. Latterly, passenger services consisted of a loco and one coach. The coach used was specifically made for the branch and survives today (see The Foxdale Coach). The MNR purchased a more powerful locomotive to work goods services over the branch and its steep gradients (see Caledonia).

The film had its world release on October 2, 2012 at the Virginia Film Festival, and received a DVD and VOD release through Phase 4 Films on March 5, 2013. The film stars Marc Singer and Art LaFleur and follows two families that are trapped within a deserted farmhouse. Plot Charlie Hays, his daughter Emmy, and his second wife Susan follow a lead on a foreclosed house Charlie wants to buy. It's a seemingly perfect and beautiful home on 70 acres of private land. He also wants to use this as an opportunity for Emmy and Susan to get along, as neither likes the other. Meanwhile, another family – Don Thomson, his wife Leslie, and their live-in son Jason, who has suffered a broken leg in a car accident – meets a man in a red hat who gives Don an advertisement for the same house the Hayses are interested in. Finding it too good to be true, they too make the trip out to the house. Once both families arrive, they find the house abandoned. Charlie and his family go to the road to retrieve the realtor's phone number and, on the way back, nearly strike a distraught girl named Hanna running across the road. She is severely traumatized, and her tongue has been cut out. The families decide to take her to the hospital, but to their shock find themselves coming back to the house again and again. Don refuses to give up, but by nightfall, his car runs out of gas. They decide to stay in the house, despite Hanna's pleading not to enter. Once inside, they find firewood and cans of stew that account for each one of them: seven cans for seven people. Despite the arguments that ensue between Leslie and Susan, the families decide to stay and wait for help. They remain for one month, while recordings on the house tell them that only one family will claim the house. Cabin fever and close quarters have everyone on edge until Susan spurns a cheerful Leslie for being too happy. As the tension mounts, the house inexplicably begins providing only six cans. Reminded of her daughter Lizzy, who had previously died, Leslie falls into a deep depression and kills herself. After this, Susan learns that the house had been foreclosed on by Charlie himself, and Emmy begins seeing visions of a man who had killed his son. Soon after, Charlie and Emmy begin seeing visions of her mother, appearing before them with her throat slashed. Charlie confides in Emmy that her mother had left them long ago, but Susan seems to know more. Following clues by the mute girl Hanna and a puzzle, Emmy nearly makes it back to the road by walking backwards, but she is interrupted by Jason, who tries to rape her. Hanna strikes him with a log, and he impales himself on a branch; Don, who has slowly begun to fall into madness, rescues him, but Jason begins to suffer shock from blood loss. After being terrified by a vision, Jason admits that he killed a woman, later revealed to be an occupant of the house, in a hit and run accident nearby. Don leaves the Hayses bound and attempts to leave the property on his own. When he returns that night, he admits he found the road and starts to free them, but Susan, fearing him, attacks and kills him with an axe. Afterward, the house stops providing food for them, and Charlie becomes erratic. At the house, the ghost of the woman Jason killed attacks him and chokes him to death. Charlie snaps after a vision of himself lies to him about how Susan told Emmy about his responsibility for her mother's murder. After suspecting Susan of stealing their dwindling food supplies, he attacks and kills her. He chases Emmy and Hanna, saying that he believes that murdering Hanna will set them free. Charlie kills Hanna, but he is in turn killed by Emmy. Running to the road, Emmy comes across another family. They bring her into the car and drive back to the house. Emmy panics when she sees the family chase after the ghosts that had haunted her own family, but she is pulled into the car and her tongue is cut out, which starts the cycle again.

It is long and stretches from Stockton, to Anna Bay. Over many years Stockton Beach has been the site of numerous shipwrecks and aircraft crash sites. In World War II it was fortified against a possible attack by Imperial Japanese forces. During that time it served as a bombing and gunnery range as well as a dumping area for unused bombs by aircraft returning from training sorties. The length of the beach, its generally hard surface and numerous items of interest along the beach make it popular with four-wheel drive (4WD) enthusiasts. Four-wheel drive vehicles are permitted to drive on Stockton Beach provided the vehicles are in possession of valid permits. The beach is also popular with fishermen and several different varieties of fish may be caught. Geography Stockton Beach, on the Tasman Sea, starts on the northern side of the break wall that protects the entrance to Newcastle harbour in Stockton, Newcastle's northernmost suburb, and stretches for in an approximate north-easterly direction to Anna Bay in Port Stephens. In some areas it is as much as wide and has sand dunes over high although at the Stockton end it is at its narrowest with no dunes. Each year the dunes move north by approximately . The sand on Stockton Beach varies from hard to soft packed and changes daily with the changing winds and weather. The dunes are the largest continuous mobile sand dunes in the Southern Hemisphere. =Beach endpoint coordinates= * Southern – * Northern – =Worimi conservation lands= A large part of Stockton Beach lies within the Worimi conservation lands, which stretch from south-west of the wreck of the , north-east along Stockton Beach to just west of the end of the beach at Anna Bay. The lands consist of the Worimi National Park, Worimi State Conservation Area and Worimi Regional Park. Day-to-day management of the Worimi conservation lands is undertaken by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. History =Aboriginal history= The earliest inhabitants of the Port Stephens region and particularly the land close to Port Stephens itself were the members of the Worimi Aboriginal tribe and their middens may be seen at many points along the beach. These middens, which are up to 12,000 years old, consist mainly of the remnants of pipis and whelk shells. As the beach is constantly reshaped by the winds some middens are concealed while new ones are revealed. A midden conservation area, where beach driving is not permitted due to the cultural significance of the middens, has been established on the beach. =Tin City= Tin City In the late 19th century shipwrecks on Stockton Beach were so common that two tin sheds were constructed on a part of the beach in what is now Bobs Farm near Salt Ash to hold provisions for shipwrecked sailors. During the Great Depression of the 1930s a group of squatters constructed a series of tin shacks at the site which is approximately south west of Anna Bay. During World War II the shacks were torn down to make way for an Army camp. Today, eleven of the shacks, known collectively as \\"Tin City\\", remain but no new shacks may be built, nor can existing shacks be rebuilt if they are destroyed by the elements. Tin City and the beach's sand dunes were used for several scenes in the 1979 movie Mad Max. =Wartime history= Tank trap at the northern end of the beach in Anna Bay World War II resulted in fortifications against a possible amphibious assault by Imperial Japanese forces being installed along the beach. Many of these fortifications, in the form of barbed wire entanglements and concrete pyramid shaped blocks, commonly known as tank traps, may be seen along the beach. Some of the tank traps from the northern end of the beach have been removed and relocated to near the parking area at Birubi Point in Anna Bay while most from the southern end of the beach may be found outside Fort Wallace in Stockton. Some of the tank traps remain submerged and pose a hazard to swimmers. During World War II the beach was used as a military bombing range and Air Force pilots used to regularly drop unused bombs on the beach before landing at RAAF Base Williamtown. To this day it is occasionally possible to see exposed bombs in the sand. Stockton Beach is less than from RAAF Base Williamtown and is subjected to many overflights by both RAAF and civilian aircraft. On 10 February 1960 a CAC CA-27 Sabre from RAAF Base Williamtown crashed on the beach after overshooting its approach. The pilot was killed. The remains of this aircraft appear from time to time. =Leigh Leigh= In 1989 Newcastle High School student and Fern Bay resident Leigh Leigh was brutally raped and murdered on a section of the beach at Stockton. The attack was so vicious that it was spoken about at length in the Parliament of New South Wales and referred to for years after the event. A play, Blackrock (written by Australian playwright Nick Enright), and also a film of the same name, were both inspired by the event. =National park= A series of campaigns by local environmental groups and activists saw parts of the area declared a National Park in 2001. =Shipwrecks= The on Stockton Beach in June 2009 Stockton Beach has been the site of numerous shipwrecks over the past 200 years but especially since the late part of the 19th century. Wreckage from many shipwrecks continues to wash ashore periodically but the most well known, recognisable and permanent of the wrecks are the Uralla and the MV Sygna. The Uralla was a , long steamer that ran aground during a gale on 14 June 1928 approximately down the beach from Anna Bay. There was no loss of life but after the vessel was eventually refloated it drifted ashore and broke up. Its remains may be seen occasionally at low tide. The MV Sygna was a Norwegian bulk carrier that ran aground during a major storm on 26 May 1974. Attempts to refloat the ship were unsuccessful. The ship broke its back and the stern now lies off Stockton Beach where it is slowly decaying in the elements. The bow section was eventually towed to Taiwan and broken up. The ship is approximately from the southern end of the beach and usually easily visible from the Stockton breakwall. On a clear day the ship is easily visible from both ends of the beach. Tourism The beach is a popular camping area, at times there can be 200 camp sites with 2,000 people camped along the dunes. During the day, up to 4,000 people and thousands of cars can be on the beach. Vehicular access A 4WD vehicle heading toward the waterfront after entering Stockton Beach via Lavis Lane. No vehicular access is possible at the southern end of the beach. Instead, all vehicles must enter the beach through the Worimi Conservation Lands in the Port Stephens local government area. Vehicle entry to the beach is via Lavis Lane in Williamtown or Gan Gan Road in Anna Bay. A permit needs to be purchased before entering the beach. Drivers must ensure that they respect the natural habitat of the beach and refrain from driving on the plants and grasses on dune structure. Access to the recreational vehicle area is subject to restrictions. The beach is at its widest near the Lavis Lane entrance. Sand mining Sand mining is practised on Stockton beach. This has led to a significant loss of tertiary vegetation in the hind dunes of the beach which has led to a noticeable decrease in the numbers of native species sightings, for example the eastern grey kangaroo and sugar glider. There is considerable opposition to the controversial sand mining.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-04/bobs-farm- locals-worried-about-environmental-impacts-of-sand- mi/5939846http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2722182/plans-for-sandmine-next- to-primary-school/?cs=305#slide=1 Wildlife The waters just off Stockton Beach form part of a larger nursery for great white sharks. The Great white sharks in the nursery are thought to range in size from . Humpback whales can be spotted from the beach each year during the migration season. Big Beach Challenge Since 2010, an annual event called the \\"Big Beach Challenge\\" is held which sees competitors travel the entire length of Stockton Beach from Birubi to Stockton Surf Club. Some of the top runners manage to cover this in under three hours, whilst those who walk the distance finish in around seven. A shorter event from Stockton to the shipwreck of the Sygna and back is also held at the same time. The Big Beach Challenge helps raise money for local Stockton charity, Harry's House.

It has been cultivated for a red pigment derived from roots. Common names of this plant include manjistha in Sanskrit, Marathi, Kannada and Bengali, majith in Hindi and Gujarati, བཙོད་ in Tibetan, tamaralli in Telugu, manditti in Tamil. Description It can grow to 1.5 m in height. The evergreen leaves are 5–10 cm long and 2–3 cm broad, produced in whorls of 4-7 starlike around the central stem. It climbs with tiny hooks at the leaves and stems. The flowers are small (3–5 mm across), with five pale yellow petals, in dense racemes, and appear from June to August, followed by small (4–6 mm diameter) red to black berries. The roots can be over 1 m long, up to 12 mm thick. It prefers loamy soils with a constant level of moisture. Madders are used as food plants for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Hummingbird hawk moth. Uses Rubia cordifolia was an economically important source of a red pigment in many regions of Asia, Europe and Africa. It was extensively cultivated from antiquity until the mid nineteenth century. The plant's roots contain an anthraquinone called purpurin (1,2,4-Trihydroxyanthraquinone) that gives its red colour as a textile dye It was also used as a colourant, especially for paint, that is referred to as Madder lake. The substance was also derived other species; Rubia tinctorum, also widely cultivated, and the Asiatic species Rubia argyi (H. Léveillé & Vaniot) H. Hara ex Lauener [synonym = Rubia akane Nakai,Iwatsuki, K., T. Yamazaki, D. E. Boufford and H. Ohba. 1993. Flora of Japan IIIa: 232. based on the Japanese Aka (アカ or あか) = red, and ne (ネ or ね) = root]. The invention of a synthesized duplicate, an anthracene compound called alizarin, greatly reduced demand for the natural derivative. The roots of Rubia cordifolia are also the source of a medicine used in Ayurveda; this is commonly known in Ayurvedic Sanskrit as Manjistha (or Manjista or Manjishta) and the commercial product in Hindi as Manjith. It is known as btsod () in Traditional Tibetan Medicine where it is used to treat blood disorders; spread heat (), excess heat in the lungs, kidneys, and intestines; reduce swelling; and is a component of the three reds (), a subcompound included in many Tibetan preparations in order to remove excess heat in the blood.

These threats are often designed to intimidate victims in order to manipulate their behaviour, and thus a death threat can be a form of coercion. For example, a death threat could be used to dissuade a public figure from pursuing a criminal investigation or an advocacy campaign. In most jurisdictions, death threats are a serious type of criminal offence. Death threats are often covered by coercion statutes. For instance, the coercion statute in Alaska says: Methods A death threat can be communicated via a wide range of media, among these letters, newspaper publications, telephone calls, internet blogsBlog death threats spark debate BBC News retrieved September 30, 2007 and e-mail. If the threat is made against a political figure, it can also be considered treason. If a threat is against a non-living location that frequently contains living individuals (e.g. a building), it could be a terrorist threat. Sometimes, death threats are part of a wider campaign of abuse targeting a person or a group of people (see terrorism, mass murder). Against a head of state In some monarchies and republics, both democratic and authoritarian, threatening to kill the head of state and/or head of government (such as the sovereign, president, or prime minister), is considered a crime, for which punishments vary. The United States law provides for up to five years in prison for threatening any type of government official. In the United Kingdom, under the Treason Felony Act 1848, it is illegal to attempt to kill or deprive the monarch of his/her throne; this offense was originally punished with penal transportation, and then was changed to the death penalty, and currently the penalty is life imprisonment. Osman warning, letter or notice Named after a high-profile case, Osman v United Kingdom, these are warnings of death threat or high risk of murder that are issued by British police or legal authorities to the possible victim. They are used when there is intelligence of the threat, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the potential murderer.

He is also noted for describing and naming the previously unknown order Zoraptera. In 1938 he was nominated to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the scientific academy of the Vatican. Silvestri was born in Bevagna. A keen young naturalist, he became assistant to Giovanni Battista Grassi (1854–1925), Director of the Institute of Anatomical Research of the University of Rome. In 1904, Silvestri became Director of the Institute of Entomology and Zoology at the agricultural college in Portici (the Laboratorio di Zoologia Generale e Agraria, now Faculty of Agriculture), a position he held for 45 years. He discovered polyembryony in the 1930s while working on Litomatix truncatellus Hymenoptera. His collection is in the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova. Duplicates of Isoptera are in the Swedish Museum of Natural History and a few Diplopoda (millipede) types are in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin.

It originally appeared from 1865 to 1884, then was revived from 1899 to 1944, and then again from 1945 onwards. Original journal Léopold de Léseleuc, bishop of Autun, was the founder of the first Feiz ha Breiz. In 1865 he persuaded the then Bishop of Quimper and Leon, Monseigneur Sergeant, of the value of a newspaper written in the Breton language for the inhabitants of the diocese. He also encouraged Sergeant to entrust the journal to Goulven Morvan, priest of Tréhou, who spoke excellent Breton and had wide experience in a number of local parishes. Morvan edited Feiz ha Breiz from 1865 to 1875. The first issue of Feiz ha Breiz appeared on February 4, 1865. The review ceased publication on April 26, 1884, its last editor (1883 to 1884) being Gabriel Milin, a lay Breton language author, who had taken over from abbé Nédélec. Gabriel Milin had started to write in Breton after having become acquainted with Colonel Troude, the compiler of a Breton language dictionary. Revived journal Thanks to the activity of the Feiz ha Breiz Association, which was set up in the Diocese of Quimper and Leon to protect the Breton language, the review was revived in 1899. Number 1 of the new Feiz ha Breiz was dated January 1900. Within a short time it was absorbed into the Breton Catholic organisation Bleun-Brug, set up by abbé Jean-Marie Perrot. Participating in the editorial process from 1902, Perrot became the editor, initially only semi-officially, in 1907, then officially from 1911 until his death in December 1943. Feiz ha Breiz encompassed two other titles, publishing as Feiz ha Breiz, Arvorig ha Kroaz-ar-Vretoned from February 1921 until December 1926. A French language edition existed for Upper Brittany. Its title was Foi et Bretagne, organe du Bleun-Brug de Haute-Bretagne. During the war the journal became associated with the collaborationism of the Breton National movement. After Perrot was assassinated by the Resistance, the journal continued for a short while, but its last number appeared in March 1944, edited by abbé L. Bleunven, Rector of Ploudalmezeau. Post-war journal Feiz ha Breiz was recreated after the war in 1945 appearing under the new title of Kroaz Breiz which changed soon into Bleun-Brug. In 1956 Bleun-Brug split into two factions: one more progressive and regionalist- minded and one more conservative and nationalist-minded. As a result two separate journals emerged: *Nationalist: Barr-Heol war Feiz ha Breizh (in Breton, run by Father Marsel Klerg) *Regionalist: Bleun-Brug (this persists as a bilingual scholarly journal, directed by canon François Mevellec).

Crime  Holton, a Gulf War Veteran, was 36 years old when he shot his three young sons and their half- sister (Stephen Edward Holton (12), Brent Holton (10), Eric Holton (6), and Kayla Marie Holton (4)) with a Chinese-made semi-automatic rifle on November 30, 1997, at the garage where he worked in Shelbyville, Tennessee. Holton was divorced, and his ex-wife had custody of the children. About an hour later, Holton turned himself in to the Shelbyville police; he told investigators that he had killed the children because \\"families should stay together; a father should be with his children.\\" He said he had also planned to kill his ex-wife and then himself, but had changed his mind.  Trial  At his June 1999 trial, Holton declined to testify on his own behalf, although his attorney sought to convince the jury that Holton was mentally incompetent at the time of the killings. Witnesses for the defense testified that Holton showed signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, although they could not definitively conclude that he had been exposed to carbon monoxide. Psychiatrists for the state and the defense also testified that Holton had major depressive disorder and passive-aggressive personality disorder at the time of the murders. The jury rejected the insanity defense; Holton was found guilty and sentenced to death. During his imprisonment, Holton became an amateur legal expert, and he took steps to ignore the automatic and voluntary appeals process afforded to all condemned men and women under state and U.S. law. He also declined to cooperate with the federally or state-appointed capital defenders who sought to offer him legal assistance and counsel. For this reason, he is often included among the group described as death row \\"volunteers.\\" Execution Holton chose to die in the electric chair, rather than by lethal injection, which is now the standard method of execution in Tennessee. Death-row inmates who committed their capital crime when the electric chair was still the official execution method are permitted to choose between the two methods. Holton was the first person to be executed by electrocution in Tennessee in 47 years. Moments before his execution, prison warden Ricky Bell asked Holton if he had any final words. He replied: \\"Two words: I do\\". He declined the traditional special last meal before his execution and instead, ate the regular prison meal which consisted of riblets on a bun, mixed vegetables, baked beans, white cake with white icing and iced tea. Holton's was the fourth execution in Tennessee since 2000 and first by the electric chair since 1960 (the last Pre-Furman execution). It was also the first use of Tennessee's electric chair after it was retrofitted by Fred A. Leuchter and moved to Riverbend from the former Tennessee State Prison. Holton was the third death row inmate executed under administration of Governor Phil Bredesen. He was also the first American put to death by electrocution since July 20, 2006. The last was Brandon Wayne Hedrick in Virginia, who also chose electrocution over injection. His dead body was cremated after his execution.  Controversy  His case raised some controversy because of rumors about his history of mental illness. While execution of the mentally retarded was prohibited by the U.S. Supreme Court case Atkins v. Virginia of 2002, the execution of the mentally ill has never been held to be in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Holton, his motives, and the ethics of his execution are examined in the documentary film Robert Blecker Wants Me Dead.

On August 18, 2011 the official ceremony of Vladimir Gruzdev's inauguration was held in the Tula Kremlin. In his work as head of the region, Vladimir Gruzdev mostly relied on loyal but inexperienced staff from Moscow. He was famous for rough and aggressive style of management. For example, in the presence of many people, he suggested that the mayor of the city of Bogoroditsk shot himself. On August 13, 2014, Vladimir Gruzdev appointed the former State Duma member of the fifth convocation and ex-leader of the Young Russia movement Maksim Mishchenko to the post of deputy head of the government office of the Tula region under the Government of the Russian Federation and deputy minister of internal policy and local government development of the Tula region.Зам. министра Максим Мищенко: от нациков до педиков.

Since December 2012 the governor's salary in the amount of 48,115 rubles was transferred to the fund of the Tula Kremlin and for the organization of disabled people. The press department of the governor announced the transfer of his entire salary to charity throughout 2013. On February 2, 2016, he resigned at his own request. The official reason of the resignation - family circumstances (his daughter was born). Accepting his resignation, Vladimir Putin commented that \\"Vladimir Sergeevich is a Muscovite, he wants to be closer to Moscow.\\" Other versions of his dismissal circulated in the press later: his dismissal was caused by a criminal case against the closest assistant Maxim Mishchenko, as well as an investigation of misappropriation of grants worth 3 billion rubles in favor of trading house \\"Medved\\" and the company \\"Baltika\\". There was also a version according to which during the governorship Gruzdev violated the law and continued to engage in entrepreneurial activities and took direct part in the management of the company \\"Modny Continent.\\"История с грантами в 3 млрд руб в Туле напоминает «лихие 90-ые».

In March and April 2017, Gruzdev held meetings with the Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky (cooperation between the Association and the Russian Military Historical Society was discussed) and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. On April 21, 2017, Vladimir Gruzdev joined the government commission on legislative drafting activities. Under the leadership of V. Gruzdev, the Association of Lawyers of Russia monitors the current legislation. While interviewed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Vladimir Gruzdev says that the ALRF is preparing large proposals on introducing criteria for calculating compensation for moral harm. Later, the Commission on Determining Amounts of Compensation for Moral Harm has been established under the ALRF. During his speech at the II Stolypin Forum, V. Gruzdev suggested creating a working group on preparing new drafts of Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation. In order to improve the legal culture and literacy of the Russian population, the ALRF jointly with its partners has held the All-Russian Legal Dictation since 2017. About 55 thousand people took part in the first Dictation. In 2018, the second Dictation was joined by 165 thousand participants. “URA.RU” media in its interview dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the Russian Constitution, named V. Gruzdev as the main lawyer of the country.  Social activity  Since 2017 Mr. Gruzdev is Co-Chairman of the Centre for Public Procedures “Business Against Corruption”, founded particularly by the non-governmental organisation “Delovaya Rossia” under the Government Order of the Russian Federation. In 2017, the Association of Lawyers of Russia held the IV BRICS Legal Forum in Moscow, where Mr. Gruzdev initiated the discussion on developing new arbitration institutions of the BRICS countries, legal regulation of the digital economy and others. In 2018-2019, Mr. Gruzdev moderated sessions on the competitiveness of the national jurisdiction in the framework of the Saint-Petersburg Economic Forum and Eastern Economic Forum. Vladimir Gruzdev is also co-author of a number of publications on factors affecting the quality of the Russian legal system, as well as initiator of a public discussion of amendments to the legislation.  Scientific activity  In 2003, Gruzdev defended his thesis on \\"Legal status of civil servants of the Russian Federation and organizational and legal bases for the functioning of the system of training, retraining and advanced training\\" at the Department of Administrative Law of the Moscow University of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 2013, the Dissernet community found that the whole content of the work was plagiarism: 168 of 182 pages were entirely copied from the original work of Pavel Vostrikov \\"Organizational and legal problems of training, retraining and upgrading of civil servants\\", defended in 1998. Despite this, the academic degree of Vladimir Gruzdev was confirmed, as more than three years had passed since the defense of the thesis before the discovery of plagiarism.>.  Estimates of fortune  Gruzdev has been regularly included in the rating of the magazine Forbes since 2005, with the exception of 2008. He took positions from 36 (2009) to 135 (2017). The biggest fortune was reached in 2010 - 950 million dollars. In 2011, with the same fortune he took 104th place. In 2012, he took the first place in the ranking of the richest Russian officials with an income of 3.89 billion rubles. From the declaration which Gruzdev submitted in 2011 as an official, it is known that he had deposits in banks amounting to 9.4 billion rubles. He also owned shares in OJSC Bank Saint Petersburg, OJSC VTB Bank and Gazprom.

Accessed February 3, 2008. He was selected as #74 of the top 100 Jersey Shore athletes of the millennium by the Asbury Park Press in 1999. Kunkel reached the big leagues quickly, but never developed into a full-time player. The Rangers gave him the opportunity to win the starting shortstop position, but he was always thwarted by his hitting stats and obstacles such as Curtis Wilkerson, Scott Fletcher, Fred Manrique, Gary Green, and Jeff Huson. Plagued with numerous potential career- ending injuries, Kunkel worked hard to rehabilitate himself to finish an 11-year professional baseball career with 5½ years in the major leagues. A versatile player with the ability to play 8 of the 9 positions on the field he actually pitched three times in mop-up stints. 1984 debut Kunkel made his major league debut against the defending world champion Baltimore Orioles at Arlington Stadium on Monday, July 23, . Against O's ace Mike Boddicker, a 20-game winner that season, Kunkel recorded three hits and stole second base. Nevertheless, the Rangers lost the game 9 to 5. Kunkel spent the rest of the season alternating with Curtis Wilkerson, but was never able to duplicate the success of his first game. He concluded 1984 with 3 home runs, 7 runs batted in, and a .204 average in 50 games and 142 at-bats. Time in the minors After struggling during spring training in , Kunkel found little playing time with the Rangers over the next four seasons. He spent most of his time with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the Triple-A American Association and was recalled to the majors only due to other players being hurt or the rosters expanding in September. Best year In Kunkel recorded his best season, and more playing time opened for him due to the trade of Scott Fletcher to the Chicago White Sox. He responded by hitting a career-high .270 with 8 home runs and 29 RBI in 108 games. The success was short-lived, and by he was back to his previous role as a reserve player. Last seasons In , the Chicago Cubs gave Kunkel his last shot in the majors. He assumed the role as a utility player, receiving very limited playing time behind Ryne Sandberg and Shawon Dunston. Jeff concluded his short stay with the Cubs hitting .138 in 29 at-bats and never played in the big leagues again. In , Jeff signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians and played infield and outfield for the AAA International League Champion Charlotte Knights. In , Kunkel joined the Detroit Tigers' AAA team, the Toledo Mud Hens, where he finished his professional baseball career hitting .249 with 11 hrs.

No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults are 35.5–61 cm (14-24 inches) in total length. Stout with a wide neck and a sharply upturned snout, they usually have 25 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody.Behler, J.L., and F.W. King. 1979. The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians. Alfred A. Knopf. New York. 743 pp. LCCCN 79-2217. . The dorsal color pattern consists of a light brown, yellowish, grayish, or reddish ground color, overlaid with a distinct row of dark blotches that alternate with smaller blotches on the flanks. The belly is distinctly darker in color than the underside of the tail in juveniles. As the snake ages, the underside usually becomes a pale white. Habitat Heterodon simus occurs in dry and open sandy areas, dry river floodplains, fields, and wire grass flatwoods. Geographic range The Southern hognose snake is found on the coastal plain of the southeastern United States from North Carolina, south to Lake Okeechobee in Florida, and west to Mississippi. Diet Heterodon simus preys upon toads, frogs (especially Hyla gratiosa and Pseudacris ornata), spadefoots, and lizards.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright. 1957. Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Comstock. Ithaca and London. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes) (Heterodon simus, pp. 312-314, Figure 96. + Map 28. on p. 298.) Reproduction This species is oviparous. mature adults mate from April through August. The thin-shelled, leathery, whitish eggs are laid in clutches of 6-14. After 55–60 days the eggs hatch. Each hatchling is 15–18 cm (6-7 inches) in total length. Conservation status This species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: C1+2a(i) (v3.1, 2001). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that the population size is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, a decline of at least 10% is estimated to continue within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer, (up to a maximum of 100 years in the future), and a continuing decline has been observed, projected, or inferred, in numbers of mature individuals and no subpopulation is estimated to contain more than 1,000 mature individuals. It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. The population trend is down. Year assessed: 2007. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has listed the species as possibly extirpated within the state. References Further reading *Conant, R. 1975.

The consequence of the invasion of the Lombards. The location of the hydraulic breakthrough Rotta della Cucca (Breach at Cucca) is indicated. The city of Kucca is the modern city of Veronella. The breakthrough led to floods, breakthroughs of other dams and changes in river beds, provoking the \\"Domino Effect\\", which is why the port of Adria, which gave its name to the Adriatic Sea, was cut off from the sea for 22 kilometers inland. The invasion of the Lombards in the Western Roman Empire and the ruin of agricultural land. The Lombard king Authari had the goal of isolating large Italian cities such as Padua from Byzantine army based in Ravenna on South and franks army of Childebert II on north-west. Cucca was located on the territory of the Lombard duchy of Vicenza, founded by the Lombards to separate Padua from Ravenna. Repair and daily maintenance were stopped at dozens of dams and dams and irrigation canal locks. The sequence of formation of the meander. In 589, the Adige River formed a meander, which became a giant reservoir. Alagón river in Spain. The so-called breach at Cucca () traditionally refers to a flood in the Veneto region of Italy that should have happened on October 17, 589 according to the chronicles of Paul the Deacon. The Adige river overflowed after a \\"deluge of water that is believed not to have happened after the time of Noah\\"; the flood caused great loss of lives, and destroyed part of the city walls of Verona as well as paths, roads and large part of the country in lower Veneto. The tradition asserts that a breach opened in the banks of the Adige at Cucca, nowadays Veronella, about 35 km SE of Verona. Contemporary historians think that the breach never really happened, and the tradition simply refers to the disasters due to the lack of maintainment of the streams that followed the fall of the Roman Empire. The Lombards did not repair the banks, and the waters of the Adige had been let free to flow through the lower Veneto for centuries, in order to set a swamp on the borders with the Exarchate of Ravenna. This point of view should be balanced against the worldwide disastrous climate changes of 535-536. Even though the dates do not exactly align, it is a fact that in that century there was at least \\"one year without summer\\", it is conceivable that the exceptionally bad weather conditions reported worldwide for that unknown year, whose consequences included skipped harvests and famine in places as far apart as Ireland, Scandinavia and China, constitute the real background also for this reported climate disaster.  Consequences  The hydrography of the lower Veneto had a dramatic change after the breach at Cucca: the river Adige did no more pass through Montagnana and Este and diverted to the south passing through Legnago; centuries later, as the land dried up, it started following what had been the former course of the Chirola canal, passing through Badia Polesine and Cavarzere. The Tartaro river contributed to the swamp; as the land dried up, some villages started to be set around its course: they were the first hamlets of Lendinara, Villanova del Ghebbo, Rovigo and Villadose. The Mincio river diverted to the south and has become a tributary of the Po river since then; it had been a waterway from the Adriatic Sea to the lake Garda until then. The loss of this last significance contributed to the definitive decline of Adria and its port. The former lower course of the Mincio, that flowed into the Adriatic Sea by Adria, was still connected to the Tartaro. The flooding, along with the subsequent capture by the Lombards of the city of Padua in 601, led to the movement of crowds of refugees into the Venetian Lagoon, whose population explosively increased, which led to the creation of the Venetian state.

It is narrated by John Fothergill West, a Scot who has moved with his family from Edinburgh to Wigtownshire to care for the estate of his father's half brother, William Farintosh. It was first published in 1888 in the Pall Mall Gazette. Plot summary Near their residence, Branksome, is Cloomber Hall, for many years untenanted. After a little while it is settled in by John Berthier Heatherstone, late of the Indian Army. General Heatherstone is nervous to the point of being paranoid. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that his fears are connected with some people in India whom he has offended somehow. People hear a strange sound, like the tolling of a bell, in his presence, which seems to cause the general great discomfort. Every year his paranoia reaches its climax around the fifth of October, after which date his fears subside for a while. After some time there is a shipwreck in the bay and among the survivors are three Buddhist priests who had boarded the ship from Kurrachee. When John Fothergill West tells the general (to whose daughter Gabriel he is engaged) about the priests, he resigns himself to his fate and refuses any help from West. One night the three Buddhist priests summon General Heatherstone and Colonel Rufus Smith (who had been together with the general in India and apparently was under the same threat that was faced by the general) out of Cloomber Hall. With their psychic powers, they have a complete hold over the two erstwhile soldiers. The priests take them through the marshes to the Hole of Cree, a bottomless pit in the centre of the marsh and either throw the soldiers in or order them to jump in. The General had given his son a parcel and instructed him to hand it over to West in case of his death or disappearance. When West opens the parcel he finds a letter and some old papers. In the letter the general tells West to read the papers, which are pages from a diary that the general had kept in his days in the army of the English East India Company. As West reads the papers he understands the mystery of Cloomber. When he was in the army forty years ago, during the First Afghan War, the general was fighting against the Afridis in the passes of the Hindu-Kush. After defeating the Afridis in a battle, he chases them to a cul de sac to slaughter them. As the general was closing in on the remnants of the enemy forces, an old man emerges from a cave and stops him from killing them. The general, together with Rufus Smith, kills the old man and proceeds with the massacre. As it turns out, the old man was an arch-adept, who had reached the zenith of Buddhist priesthood. His chelas (students) vow to avenge his death. The three chelas let the general live on for forty years to prolong his misery. The sound that appeared to emanate from above the general's head was the tolling of the astral bell by the chelas to remind him that wherever he goes, he will never escape their wrath.

Due to the embryos resulting from the same egg, the embryos are identical to one another, but are genetically diverse from the parents. The genetic difference between the offspring and the parents, but the similarity among siblings, are significant distinctions between polyembryony and the process of budding and typical sexual reproduction. Polyembryony can occur in humans, resulting in identical twins, though the process is random and at a low frequency. Polyembryony occurs regularly in many species of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants.  Vertebrates  Armadillos are the most well studied vertebrate that undergoes polyembryony, with six species of armadillo in the genus Dasypus that are always polyembryonic. The nine banded armadillo, for instance, always gives birth to four identical young. There are two conditions that are expected to promote the evolution of polyembryony: the mother does not know the environmental conditions of her offspring as in the case of parasitoids, or a constraint on reproduction. It is thought that nine banded armadillos evolved to be polyembryonic because of the latter.  Invertebrates  A more striking example of the use of polyembryony as a competitive reproductive tool is found in the parasitoid Hymenoptera, family Encyrtidae. The progeny of the splitting embryo develop into at least two forms, those that will develop into adults and those that become a type of soldier, called precocious larvae. These latter larvae patrol the host and kill any other parasitoids they find with the exception of their siblings, usually sisters. Obligately polyembryonic insects fall in two classes: Hymenoptera (certain wasps), and Strepsiptera. From one egg, these insects can produce over thousands of offspring. Polyembryonic wasps from the Hymenoptera group can be further subdivided into four families including Braconidae (Macrocentrus), Platygasteridae (Platygaster), Encyrtidae (Copidosoma), and Dryinidae. Polyembryony also occurs in Bryozoa. Through recent genotype analysis and molecular data, it has been suggested that polyembryony happens in the entire order Cyclostomata.  Plants  The term is also used in botany to describe the phenomenon of seedlings emerging from one embryo. Around 20 genera of gymnospores undergo polyembryony, termed \\"cleavage polyembryony,\\" where the original zygote splits into many identical embryos. In some plant taxa, the many embryos of polyembryony eventually gives rise to only a single offspring. The mechanism underlying the phenomenon of a resulting single (or in some cases a few) offspring is described in Pinus sylvestris to be programmed cell death (PCD), which removes all but one embryo. Originally, all embryos have equal opportunity to develop into full seeds, but during the early stages of development, one embryo becomes dominant through competition, and therefore the now dormant seed, while the other embryos are destroyed through PCD. The genus Citrus has a number of species that undergo polyembryony, where multiple nucellar-cell-derived embryos exist alongside sexually-derived embryos. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described polyembryony in 1719 when the seed in Citrus was observed to have two germinating embryos. In Citrus, polyembryony is genetically controlled by a shared polyembryony locus among the species, determined by single-nucleotide polymorphism in the genotypes sequenced. The variation within the species of citrus is based on the amount of embryos that develop, the impact of the environment, and gene expression. As with other species, due to the many embryos developing in close proximity, competition occurs, which can cause variation in seed success or vigor.

Education and career  Kincaid received his B.A. (1967) in psychology from the University of Kansas. In 1967–1969, he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Colombia and facilitated community development and cooperative organization. He earned his M.A. (1971) and Ph.D. (1972) in communication from Michigan State University. In 1973, he joined the East-West Communication Institute at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, and worked as a research associate under the directorship of Wilbur Schramm. He was also an associate professor in the Department of Communication at the State University of New York at Albany. In the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Kincaid was founding director of the Research and Evaluation Division of the Center for Communication Programs from 1988 to 1997. He was also instrumental in establishing the Interdepartmental Health Communication Program and served as the first director.

Lawrence Kincaid (2002). Drama, emotion, and cultural convergence, Communication Theory, 12(2): 136–52. a nonlinear model of communication wherein two communicators strive to reach \\"mutual understanding.\\" He proposed the model in his 1979 East-West Communication Institute Monograph (Paper No. 18) and detailed it in his book, Communication Networks: Toward a New Paradigm for Research (Free Press, 1981) with Everett Rogers. In recent years this model has been particularly popular among proponents of development communication. Kincaid identified seven epistemological biases that had characterized the dominant Western models of communication: (1) a view of communication as linear rather than cyclical; (2) a message-source bias rather than a focus on relatedness and interdependence; (3) an analysis of objects of communication in a manner that isolates them from larger contexts; (4) a concentration on discrete messages instead of silence, rhythm, and timing; (5) a concentration on persuasion rather than understanding, agreement, and collective action; (6) attention to individuals rather than relationships; (7) a model of one-way mechanistic causation rather than mutual causation.D. Lawrence Kincaid (1979). The Convergence Model of Communication (East-West Communication Institute Paper No. 18). Honolulu, HI: East-West Center. Kincaid also developed new methods for multivariate causal attribution analysis of communication impact, the communication for participatory development model, the ideational model for behavior change communication and evaluation, computer programs to analyze the multi- dimensional image of audience perceptions, computer simulation of social networks for the theory of bounded normative influence, and drama theory to measure the impact of entertainment-education programs.http://www.jhuccp.org/research_bios .

History  The University of Nicosia is the largest private university in Cyprus; its current enrollment is over 12,000 students. = Founding = Intercollege was founded in 1980 by a team of academics and senior executives under the direction of Mr Stelios Zarafopoulos (BA, DMS, MCIM, FCAM), in order to prepare students for the examinations of recognized British professional bodies, such as the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) and the Communication, Advertising and Marketing Foundation (CAM). In 1981 the college began expanding its programs towards academic degrees. In its first decade of operation, Intercollege developed and modified courses of study in accordance with the college's growing constituencies, the needs of the Cypriot labor marke. To this end, Intercollege prepared students for the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations, which were accepted by the University of the State of New York and the Thomas Edison State College towards their external degrees. Through hard work and persistence, the college has steadily developed into a respected Cypriot college that awards its own diplomas, bachelor's and master's degrees on three campuses. In September 2007, the 27-year-old college was acknowledged as a university and now uses the name University of Nicosia, Cyprus. The university continues to offer a number of professional programs such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Certified Accounting Technician (CAT), and the Chartered Institute of Banking. = Important milestones = Intercollege's logo before achieving University status 1980 Intercollege of Management and Communication Studies (IMCS) was founded as a tertiary level institution offering the programs of various British professional bodies such as the Communication, Advertising and Marketing Foundation (CAM), the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) and the Association of Business Executives (ABE). 1981 * First international students join the college. * Internal certificates (after one year of study) and diplomas (after two years of study) are offered in programs such as business administration, hotel management, marketing, public relations, and advertising. 1982 * Tuition is provided for the University of the State of New York (USNY) external degrees through recognized external exams, such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Proficiency Examination Program (PEP), for which Intercollege becomes a testing center. * Intercollege moves to new, larger premises. 1983 Introduction of internal bachelor's degree programs in majors such as hotel management, business administration, and liberal arts. * Computer science leading to internal qualification and the British professional program of IDPM (Institute of Data Processing Management) is introduced. 1984 * Intercollege students begin transferring to accredited universities: e.g. University of Maryland (Hotel Management), University of Strathclyde (postgraduate diploma in business administration). * The Thomas Edison State College external degree program is offered. * The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) program is introduced. 1985 * Andreas Polemitis joins Intercollege, merging his institute (which offered University of Indianapolis qualifications) with the college. * University of Indianapolis programs in business administration and business data processing are introduced. * Professional training courses subsidised by the Industrial Training Authority are offered. * The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) British professional program begins. * The Secretarial Studies program is offered. 1986 * Travel and Tourism program, modelled on IATA and British Airways training programs, is introduced.

Founded in 2000, One Economy's mission is to ensure that every person, regardless of income or location, can maximize the power of technology to improve the quality of his or her life and enter the economic mainstream. One Economy brings broadband into the homes of low-income people, employs youth to train community members to use technology effectively, and provides public- purpose media properties that offer information on education, jobs, health care, and other vital issues. These initiatives target three barriers to sustained Internet use: affordability, accessibility, and lack of relevant content. By creating strong public-private partnerships and engaging local stakeholders and community organizations, One Economy aims to create a comprehensive and sustainable digital network. In April 2010, One Economy, in partnership with the Broadband Opportunity Coalition (BBOC), was awarded $28.5 million through the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, run by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. One Economy and the BBOC are supplementing this grant with $23 million of private sector matching support. Public-Purpose Media One Economy offers multiple public-purpose media properties that connect low- income people to online information and resources that address a range of topics including health, jobs, money, education, and housing. Over 19 million people around the world have accessed One Economy's online resources since 2000. =The Beehive= One Economy's signature online tool, The Beehive], is an award-winning, multilingual web portal that provides low-income individuals with online resources concerning financial services, education, jobs, health care, and housing. Domestically, the Beehive has been localized for 26 U.S. cities. Internationally, the Beehive is available in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Turkey, Cameroon, Rwanda, Kenya, Jordan, South Africa, Israel, and Mexico. Localization of the Beehive is used to target specific community needs. For example, the Beehive served as the first source of local news in the Bronx Mt. Hope community, which before that had been without such a service. The Beehive also provided targeted tax help services in the Cascades area of Oregon. =PIC.tv= The Public Internet Channel, PIC.tv, is a multimedia experience that encourages its viewers to actively take steps to improve their lives. One of the primary tools on PIC.tv is the Make It Easy toolbox, which connects audiences with relevant, local resources related to the content featured in individual videos. Digital Connectors One Economy's Digital Connectors program was launched in 2001, in Washington, D.C., and has since expanded to include more than 20 rural and urban areas nationwide. Similar programs have been launched in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Cameroon, and Nigeria. The Digital Connectors program identifies and trains talented youth, immersing them in certified technology training and encouraging leadership skills that prepare students to enter the 21st century workforce. These youth range from ages 14 to 21 and come from diverse backgrounds. Participants give back to their community by teaching technology skills to family members, friends, and community members for no less than eight hours of community service each week. In addition to hands-on learning and community service work, Digital Connectors are also given the opportunity to learn about career paths through sponsored visits to technology companies, job shadowing programs, and campus tours. In return for their efforts, Digital Connectors receive new computers or stipends through their city's employment program. Since its inception, nearly 3,000 youth have given more than 56,000 hours of community service through the Digital Connectors program. Digital Connectors have also trained over 15,000 families on how to use technology and online resources to improve the quality of their lives. Access Services To address the issue of accessibility to online resources, One Economy works with affordable housing organizations, other non-profits, municipalities, and technology companies to extend the benefits of technology to low-income people. One Economy builds \\"state-by-state affordable housing finance policies that promote inclusion of broadband into low-income households.\\" These digital inclusion programs offer free or low-cost broadband Internet access, affordable computer options, and capacity-building plans for local organizations that integrate technology into their work. As a result of these efforts, over 360,000 Americans have received broadband Internet Access. According to One Economy, the results of a comprehensive technology strategy produce tangible results in a community; in Greene County, North Carolina, residents saw an increase in SAT scores, business and job opportunities, and the number of high school seniors applying to college. One Global Economy One Global Economy was founded in 2005, with the goal of expanding One Economy's domestic efforts to communities around the world. One Global Economy's methodology involves identifying underserved international areas and then identifying the key developmental issues facing those communities. One Global Economy consults with community members, collaborates with local organizations, and holds local workshops to discover what resources residents would like to have access to on their local Beehives. These web portals deliver \\"highly contextualized information on issues including employment, civic life, health, and education\\" and \\"equip low-income households and individuals with the information and resources necessary for social mobility and immediate improvement of their quality of life.\\" In addition to the global Beehives in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Turkey, Cameroon, Rwanda, Kenya, Jordan, South Africa, Israel, and Mexico, One Global Economy also operates a computer center in Durban, South Africa and recently partnered with e-Mexico to open a community technology center in Mexico City. Much of One Global Economy's work is part of Cisco's four-year, $10 million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative to alleviate poverty in sub- Saharan Africa. Cisco has partnered with four NGOs--Habitat for Humanity, Inveneo, One Global Economy, and Teachers Without Borders—to provide \\"affordable housing, community connectivity, online content and tools, and hands-on training\\" to sub-Saharan residents.

Background  The company was founded in 1998 under the name 'Henry's House' by music PR Julian Henry, Beverley Luckings, and entertainment entrepreneur Simon Fuller. The firm represented popular consumer brands, UK TV shows and celebrities, initially trading from a workshop in Acklam Road, Notting Hill, west London, from where the company expanded to become one of the most influential publicity firms of its time launching the soft drink Tango, Victoria Beckham, S Club 7, TV presenter Jamie Theakston, David Beckham,http://www.guardian.co.uk › News › Media › Marketing & PR and TV shows that included Big Brother, The Big Breakfast and Pop Idol.  Client work  In 1998 The firm staged the sponsorship of London's Regent Street Lights by the drinks brand Tango, an event that featured pop group All Saints. The company quickly became well known for its work in art and pop culture and in 2002, Henry's House mounted an open air ice exhibit outside London's Design Museum for YBA Anya Gallacio to launch a new flavour of Absolut Vodka. During this period Absolut Vodka would work with members of the YBA in its advertising campaigns, including Damien Hirst. photographers Martin Parr and Pierre et Gilles, as well as staging the last photographic shoot with writer Quentin Crisp by Rankin, shortly before Crisp's death in New York. In 2009 the firm also developed and promoted a biopic on Crisp's life. In 2000 Henry's House was taken on by Channel 4 to promote Big Brother and The Big Breakfast, and later launched Pop Idol for ITV, the show that uncovered singer Will Young and TV personality Simon Cowell. FHM, MTV, as well as others including David Beckham, and American Airlines also became the firm's clients. They won the Orange account in 2001 and spent several years promoting the telecoms sponsorship of the BAFTA Awards in London. The agency eventually parted with Orange and were recruited by Richard Branson's Virgin Mobile company. The firm held a long-term relationship with Coca-Cola in the UK. The company also held long running relationships with Virgin / NTL, for whom it promoted the V Festival each year. Simon Fuller resigned his interest in the company in 2005 when he sold his company to become a director of CKX while founder Julian Henry stepped away from the business to work alongside Fuller in 2007. The company has since changed its name to House PR.  Big Brother  In April 2001 Henry's House was appointed by Channel 4 to publicise the 2nd season of the Endemol format Big Brother.http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/109546/?DCMP=ILC- SEARCH The programme's 1st season had attracted negative comment and HH were appointed by Endemol Controller of Entertainment Ruth Wrigley, C4 Commissioning Editor Liz Warner and C4 Head of Communication Yvonne Taylor with a brief to generate Fleet Street support for the innovation around the show which included 24-hour streaming for the first time. HH won the pitch for the business by renting a townhouse next to the studio in 3 Mills where the TV show was filmed and staffing it with a team of experienced publicists working on a 24/7 rota to provide cover for the live streaming. The publicity team consisted of Catriona Halsby, Louise Foglia, Charlotte Hickson, Loretta De Souza and Julian Henry, and their publicity work turned Big Brother into a weekly media event with regular press conferences, daily tabloid briefings and exclusive media interviews. The runner up Helen Adams signed a newspaper contract for £150k following the finale in July 2001, which was seen by over 50% of the available TV audience. According to The Observer, the publicity campaign for Big Brother became “the biggest story of the year, generating more coverage and selling more copies than any other subject, including the Conservative leadership election, the foot and mouth crisis and Tim Henman's Wimbledon run”. Henry's strategy of promoting a reality TV format aggressively to the tabloids has been duplicated by other UK based reality TV shows and as a result Henry's House were asked by ITV Head Of Communication Nicola Howson to launch their new format Pop Idol.http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/143723/CAMPAIGN-Media-Relations---Pop-Idol- show-climaxes-mediafrenzy/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH References Public relations companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Henry's House (PR firm)"},{"id":"13262580","text":"Ng See-yuen, born 1944 in Shanghai, is a Chinese director of independent film companies in Hong Kong.

Biography =Early life and career= Glover was born in Nottingham, England, in 1849. At age 13 he sailed with his parents to New Zealand and arrived in Auckland in 1862. Afterwards he spent several years working for his father in a hotel he owned in the Coromandel. He then became involved in mining and moved to Thames during the gold rush. Later, Glover returned to Coromandel after unsuccessfully prospecting for gold and then had a holiday in Rarotonga. Upon returning he set up business in Auckland importing fruit from the island and selling it on to local grocers. He would remain in the trade until his retirement from business in 1920. =Political career= Glover became involved politically and joined the local branch of the Liberal-Labour Federation. In 1893 he was elected to the Auckland City Council where he would serve two separate spells totaling 16 years combined. In addition he was also a member of the Auckland Harbour Board, Hospital Board and Schools Committee. Glover stood for Parliament in 1908 and was elected to represent the electorate. He ran against former Mayor of Auckland Alfred Kidd (the incumbent), both were from the Liberal Party, and it was not unusual at the time for there to be more than one Liberal candidate. Glover held the seat for three terms until 1919, when he was defeated by Labour candidate Bill Parry. Three years later he attempted to regain the Auckland Central seat for the Liberal Party, but was again beaten by Parry. In 1929 he stood unsuccessfully for the Auckland City Council as an independent candidate. =Rugby league administrator= As the local MP, Glover chaired a meeting of 150 people on 20 July 1909 that formed the Auckland Rugby League. Glover was elected one of the ARL's first Vice-Presidents at the meeting.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009, 2009. , p.18. =Later life and death= Glover's wife Nancy died in 1934 aged 85. The Glover's had five children, three sons and two daughters. Glover died on 11 September 1941 aged 92. He was survived by all five of his children. His son James Glover, then resident in Australia, enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) eight times between 1915 and 1918 but was discharged for a raft of military offenses. In 1918 he was in the Rabaul Relief Force, but was discharged for drunkenness and using obscene language or creating a disturbance. Postwar he received two campaign medals, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

The village is famous for its Basilian monastery which is a popular pilgrimage site. The monastery was established in the 16th century by two monks from the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, Joel and Silvester, who settled in nearby caves. Around 1612 or 1618 the owner of Zhovkva, Stanisław Żółkiewski offered the monks land to build their monastery, later surrounded with fortifications during the second half of the 17th century to defend it from roaming Tatar hordes. In the 18th century the monastery's prosperity rose and wooden buildings were replaced with stone ones which stand there today. At the beginning of the 19th century it suffered from the policies of Austrian emperor Joseph, however by the end of the century it was one of the main centers of the rebirth of Ukrainian monasticism. The hardest time for Krekhiv came with the advent of Soviet occupation in 1939; by 1949 the monastery was closed and many of the monks were martyred in Soviet prisons while others had to live undercover. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the monastery was reopened on 29 August 1990 and the complex has undergone a thorough renovation. The monastery is known for its miracle working icons of the Mother of God and of St. Nicholas.

Cuckold's Point is part of a sharp bend on the River Thames on the Rotherhithe peninsula, south-east London, opposite the West India Docks and to the north of Columbia Wharf. The name comes from a post surmounted by a pair of horns that used to stand at the location, a symbol commemorating the starting point of the riotous Horn Fair, which can also symbolise a cuckold, a man whose wife had openly cheated on him. The Horn Fair was a procession which led to Charlton. It is said that King John, or another English monarch, gave the fair as a concession, along with all the land from the point to Charlton, to a miller whose wife he had seduced after a hunting trip, Swiftstone Trust'Parishes: Charlton', The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 1 (1797), pp. 420–41. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=53782. Date accessed: 14 September 2007 though this story is disputed. Cuckold's Point was also the location of a riverside gibbet, where the bodies of executed criminals (usually river pirates) were displayed as a deterrent to others, while it also gave its name to an adjacent shipyard during the 18th century. Cuckold's Point is near to Pageant Crescent, Rotherhithe and to Nelson's Pier, from which the Docklands Hilton has a ferry connection to Canary Wharf. Literary and artistic links Cuckold's Point is mentioned in the diaries of Samuel Pepys. On Friday 20 February 1662/63, Pepys described a river journey from Woolwich back to The Temple: :\\"Up and by water with Commissioner Pett to Deptford, and there looked over the yard, and had a call, wherein I am very highly pleased with our new manner of call-books, being my invention. Thence thinking to have gone down to Woolwich in the Charles pleasure boat, but she run aground, it being almost low water, and so by oars to the town, and there dined, and then to the yard at Mr. Ackworth’s, discoursing with the officers of the yard about their stores of masts, which was our chief business, and having done something therein, took boat and to the pleasure boat, which was come down to fetch us back, and I could have been sick if I would in going, the wind being very fresh, but very pleasant it was, and the first time I have sailed in any one of them. It carried us to Cuckold’s Point, and so by oars to the Temple, it raining hard, where missed speaking with my cosen Roger, and so walked home and to my office; there spent the night till bed time, and so home to supper and to bed.\\" It is also mentioned by Daniel Defoe in his description of London (Letter V) and in A Journal of the Plague Year (part XX). The location is the subject of a painting, A Morning, with a View of Cuckold's Point (c. 1750–1760), by Samuel Scott, currently in the collection of the Tate Gallery.

Life He was the second born son of Gil Aires and wife Leonor Rodrigues. He was a Vedor of Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra, son of King John I of Portugal. Marriages and issue He married firstly Catarina Fernandes, daughter of Fernão Rodrigues, a Knight, and wife, to whom King Afonso V of Portugal made the grace of restoring the estate that had been taken from her husband for having turned to Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra at the Battle of Alfarrobeira in the year of 1449, without issue. Later he married secondly before 1459 Eléonore de Lusignan, in Portuguese called Leonor, originary of the Kingdom of Cyprus and of the lineage of the Kings of that Kingdom for being a daughter of Phoebus de Lusignan (in Portuguese called Febo or Febos), Titular Marshal of Armenia and Titular Lord of Sidon, and wife, whose name is unknown. She was married firstly in 1450/1455 or 1451/1452 to Soffredo Crispo (d. 1458), Lord of Nisyros, of the Dukes of Naxos, without issue, and died in Lisbon around 1475. She was said to have come from Aragon as a Dame of Isabella of Aragon, Countess of Urgell, wife of Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra, but most likely met her husband when he went to Cyprus in the company of Infante John of Portugal who was marrying Charlotte de Lusignan, Queen of Cyprus. He returned to Portugal with his wife either when his master Charlotte's first husband was murdered or, after deciding to stay after that event, when his master's widow was deposed and at the same time his father in law Phoebus left Cyprus, returning to his country instead of going to Rome with him. For this reason their issue bore both the Arms of the Moniz and de Lusignan families joint. They were both buried in his Chapel of Our Lady of Piety at the Carmo Convent in Lisbon in a tomb with the mentioned Arms. They had an only son, Febo Moniz de Lusignan.

Under his reign, the Xiongnu Empire continued to expand against the Yuezhi and the Xiongnu thus gained control of the Hexi Corridor. Name Laoshang in Chinese means \\"old and elevated' and is probably a translation from a Xiongnu title, but might represent an attempt to phonetically represent a Xiongnu word.Hulsewé (1979), p. 120, n. 284. Life In 177 BC or 176 BC, following direction from his father Modu, Jiyu put an end to the danger of the Yuezhi, made their king's skull into a drinking cup, and chased them from Gansu. The Yuezhi migrated west. In 174 BC, Modu died and Jiyu became Laoshang Chanyu. The Shiji chap. 110 says: > \\"Shortly after this, Maodun died and his son Jizhu was set up with the title > of Old Shanyu.

In 166 BC, Xiongnu forces under Laoshang raided within sight of Chang'an and carried off a large number of people and animals. In 165 BC, the Xiongnu returned and raided within sight of Chang'an again. In 164 BC, the Xiongnu under Laoshang overran Gansu and the Tarim Basin completely, driving out the Yuezhi and Sakas, who invaded Bactria and occupied Sogdia. The Yuezhi would be pushed out by the Wusun, forcing them further into Sogdia and driving out the Sakas. The Sakas went to Parthia and some to India. A group known as the Lesser Yuezhi fled into southern Gansu and merged with the Qiang population. Laoshang also defeated a group of people in northern Bactria known as the Hathal and turned their chief's skull into a drinking cup. From this western position the Xiongnu conducted yearly raids on the Han. In 161 BC, Laoshang died and was succeeded by his son, Junchen Chanyu. Footnotes References *Benjamin, Craig G. R.

In 2007, a brand new incarnation of Grand Slam was released in the 8\\" Sigma 6 line. This was the only Grand Slam toy to ever feature a unique head sculpt. Every other version of him used a repainted head from a different character. A 25th Anniversary/Modern Era figure was released with a recolored SHARC in 2008. A Rise of Cobra figure was released as a Target exclusive with a different color scheme and lower legs. Another movie figure using the original 25th Anniversary mold was packaged with Hawk and Laser Artillery Weapon as a Wal-Mart exclusive. Grand Slam appeared once again in 2014 as a part of the G.I. Joe Collector Club's Figure Subscription Service sporting the original 1982 color scheme with the same portable missile launcher included with most versions of the Cobra weapons specialist Scrap Iron figures.

In the episode \\"Worlds Without End\\" of the ongoing 1985 series, Steeler was portrayed as being weary of the G.I. Joe/Cobra struggle, and questioned whether it would really matter if Cobra were to win. In the second part of \\"Worlds Without End\\", Steeler was among a group of Joes who visited an alternate version of Earth, in which Cobra had already won and G.I. Joe had been all but wiped out. Indeed, the only surviving \\"Joe\\" depicted in the episode was the Baroness, who (in that continuity) was a double-agent and the alternate-Steeler's lover.

Steeler, Clutch, and Grunt elect to stay in the alternate reality in order to re-build G.I. Joe.

The magazine was started by Andy Waide (Zero), Neil Hargreaves, Martin Heywood (X) and 'JC'. On the day it was decided to write & publish the first issue Andy Waide adopted the name Andy Zero and Martin Heywood became Martin X. The first edition was dedicated to The Distractions, and City Fun went on to document and inform the music scene in Manchester in the late 70's and early 80s. No one else at the time was writing about what was happening as it happened, and when others did write about Manchester music and culture it was from the outside not the inside. City Fun invited its readers to contribute articles and reviews and to tell people what was going on, or what they felt about life at the time. City Fun went through various stages of evolution, Series 1 was anarchic and inclusive trying to include the submissions from all contributors. Series 2 was more structured and selective, Neil, Martin and JC left the 'day to day' operations and a new editorial team of Andy Zero, Cath Carroll,Larkin, Colin (1997) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music, Virgin Books, , p. 96-7 Liz Naylor and Bob Dickenson became the core editors. Andy Zero left in 1982 and publication/editorship was continued by Liz, Cath and latterly (vol 3 which lasted 4 issues), Nigel Chatfield. During the beginning of Volume 2, City Fun operated from an office in Lower Broughton in the building where The Fall had rehearsal rooms. Later this was produced from Liz Naylor and Cath Carroll's flat in Hulme. Many people contributed articles including Ray Lowry (every edition of series 1 and 2), Tony Wilson, Mark E Smith, Claude Bessey, Steve Morrissey and many others. City Fun periodically promoted benefit concerts to top up the funds needed for publication, The Distractions, Joy Division, and The Fall all performed. \\"Stuff The Superstars\\" all day festival (which include The Distractions, The Fall, Joy Division, The Hamsters, the Frantic Elevators among the dozen bands) attracted about 2000 people and a later benefit \\"Dr Fun's Carnival Chance\\" at Manchester Polytechnic (also with The Fall) featured John Peel as DJ. The film No City Fun, by Charles Salem, was based on a City Fun article by Liz Naylor. This was used as a basis for the film Factory Flick with music by Joy Division.

He was the 18th Mayor of Auckland. Early life Born at Hounslow, Middlesex, England, Alfred Kidd had arrived in New Zealand in 1865 on the ship Ballarat, at fourteen years old, and worked in Mangere on farms for three years. On the opening of the Thames Goldfields, he moved there and \\"has seen it develop from a canvas town—there being only one wooden house then (Sheehan's)—to its present proportions.\\" He was one of the first arrivals and he began to prospect immediately. For seven years he worked in most of the principal mines and before leaving he was an amalgamator at the Kuranui Battery. He left to take the position of steward and providore for the steamers of the Waikato Steam Navigation Company. He did this for three years and married Christine Whisker. With the opening of the railways taking the passenger traffic from the river, Kidd came to Auckland and entered into the hotel keeping business. On his arrival he took over the licence of the old Provincial Hotel in Prince's Street and the Anchor Hotel. He held the license for the Commercial Hotel, (the oldest licensed house, it is claimed, in New Zealand—dating from 1841), now de Bretts, on the corner of High Street and Shortland Streets from 1882 until 1903. Political career Alfred Kidd started his political career by being a Parnell Borough councillor. On the Auckland City Council, he was chairman of the Streets Committee, a member of the Library Committee and chairman of the Finance Committee. He was acting mayor during the term of David Goldie, as Mr Goldie was often ill. Then Logan Campbell made it a condition of his accepting the mayoralty that Alfred Kidd be acting mayor again. There are several press reports of the time saying it was scandalous that Kidd was not made mayor during the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York as he had effectively done all the work under the previous mayoralty of Goldie, one of the reports pointing out that a factor in the decision was that he would not be able to entertain the Duke at the Northern Club as he was not a member. Kidd was elected mayor in his own right for three years in 1902. He worked tirelessly to create the new electric tramways, new sewerage and roads. He followed very popular movements, promoting workers rights and opening up Maori land, and was then pressured to go into parliament, suggesting that he was the only man who could control the Prime Minister Richard Seddon. At the time of purchasing the land at 74 & 76 Gillies Avenue, Kidd was one of the oldest sitting members of the Auckland City Council, having been first elected in 1885. He had resigned in 1888, when his projects for developing 159 acres at Ellerslie in the southern part of Remuera, fell victim to a property crash and he filed for bankruptcy. However he paid his creditors in full and the bankruptcy was annulled then, after a brief period, he was re-elected, and held his seat until he became MP for Auckland in 1905. From 1902 to 1905, he was one of the three Members of Parliament representing the multi-member City of Auckland electorate. For the 1905 general election these multi-member electorates were split up, and he won the electorate, for which he became the sole Member of Parliament. He held the seat until 1908, and was Chief Whip – Seddon and Ward Governments. He ensured that the new Auckland Post Office was built, now the site of Britomart station and introduced several bills, including an important gambling bill that restricted gambling to racecourses. In the 1908 general election, he was challenged by Albert Glover and came a distant second to him. Both were from the Liberal Party, which was not unusual at that time. Other interests He was president of the Licensed Victuallers Association for many years. As a Druid, Kidd was district president for thirteen years, and one of the founders of the Friendly Societies Conference. He was initiated into Freemasonry in the Sir Walter Scott Lodge, Thames in 1876. On leaving Thames, he joined the \\"Ara,\\" Auckland, and passed through all the chairs of that lodge; he was later on elected master of Lodge Waiuku. Kidd also passed the chair in the Royal Arch Chapter and 18 degree. For two years he was president of the Board of General Purposes for the Grand Lodge of New Zealand, and was then elected grand senior warden. Kidd was the possessor of several good horses, notably \\"St. Hippo,\\" whom he sold to the Nathan family. He was president and steward of the Auckland Racing Club. In addition he was chairman of Auckland Harbour Board, (in which role he laid the foundation stone of Admiralty House), Charitable Aid Board, trustee of Auckland Savings Bank, board of governors of Auckland Grammar School and Auckland College, board of governors of the Veterans Home, chairman of Auckland Draining Board. He was a member of the Costley Trust board and had held a seat on most local boards. Financial background His money appeared to come from mining companies with successful land and stock market speculation, as he was a director of a great many companies. At one stage he was a director of twenty-two mining companies. In 1896, it was reported that although he had lost all his money in the property slump of 1888, had made over £30,000 out of a recent mining boom in Thames. It was reported that he was going to use some of this money to rebuild the Commercial Hotel. He also had financial interests in farming around Waiuku, then known as the Aka Swamp. He owned 2000 acres of land, said \\"to be second to none in the North Island\\". In the late 1880s he was in partnership in a booksellers and stationers called Kidd & Wildman based in the Victoria Arcade which competed with the main book dealers of the time, Champtaloup & Cooper, Upton, Waytes, Varty and Chapman . It was also a lending library and publisher and printed ‘Our Dealings with Maori Lands or Comments on European Dealings For the Purchase and Lease of Native Lands and the Legislation Thereon’ by L Mackay and ‘The financial depression: its cause and remedy’ by R D L Duffus among others. Kidd collected early New Zealand literature, described in a newspaper letter to the editor of 1886 as \\"the best private collection of books on New Zealand that is probably to be found in the city\\" and \\"the finest private collection of New Zealand literature (touching this colony, that is) extant\\" in an article in the New Zealand Graphic. Estimated to be over 500 books on Polynesian and New Zealand history in 1887, he left a collection of 304 books, the earliest being dated 1773, to the Auckland University College in an inlaid wood bookcase upon his death. These books were mostly travel experiences but included political and botanical books with books in Maori. Private life He and his first wife, née Christine Whisker born in Auckland in 1874 to Private Whisker, had three sons, Alf (b.1875), Charles (b.1882) and Frank (b.1885) and one daughter Flora (b.1879). He and his wife were hugely popular figures, and he was petitioned several times to sit for mayor before he accepted the post. Kidd was well known for blushing, his immaculate dress sense and his interesting clever conversation. His eldest son, Alfred John Kidd, was born at Ngāruawāhia, in 1875 and died at Waiuku in 1941. He was educated at St. John's College, and the Auckland Grammar School, and afterwards studied at the Agricultural College at Lincoln, Canterbury. On leaving the Grammar School he went to Te Akau station, where, in four years, he acquired a practical knowledge of stock and farming. After studying at the Agricultural College at Lincoln, Christchurch, he entered the firm of Messrs Hunter and Nolan, and obtained a further experience of stock. Kidd then went to Waiuku, where he had purchased the estate of ‘Brookfield.’ and superintended the large interests of his father at the neighbouring property, ‘Arrowville’ of 2,000 acres. In 1901 this land in the Aka Aka swamp annually fattened about 500 cattle for the Auckland markets as well as running a dairy herd for which Kidd built a creamery near the swamp property. Before the First World War the farms were shipping sheep for sale to Sydney and getting record prices. Alfred Kidd Jr married Miss Elizabeth Ann Parker, of Waiuku, and had a family of five children. His sister Flora married a son of Judge Gillies, Mr William F Gillies. Christina Kidd died in 1904, and in April 1907 Alfred Kidd married Miss Ethel Anne Bridgeman, (born 1876), who was Matron of the Cambridge Sanatorium, at St Andrew's Church Epsom. They took a month in Australia as a honeymoon. Ethel Kidd was a highly active person in Auckland society. She was three times president of Trained Nurses' Association, president of Auckland Trained Nurses Association & Civic League, dominion president of Registered Nurses, dominion president of NZ Free Kindergarten Union for five years, founder of Auckland Hospital Auxiliary and then president for 9 years and a member of Auckland Hospital Board for 10 years. She represented the NZ Council of Women at the Women's International Peace Conference in Copenhagen in 1924 and represented New Zealand at the Women's International Peace Conference at Budapest in 1937. She was made a JP in 1933, received the MBE in 1938 and was the holder of Coronation and Jubilee medals. In 1910 Mr and Mrs Kidd travelled to England by way of ten days in Sydney, Cairo and the Pyramids, landing from the SS Otway in Naples, then travelled to Rome, Venice, Monte Carlo, Nice and Paris. They arrived in England in time to attend the Derby in May 1911. During this journey, Kidd told a reporter \\" I have travelled largely over the continent and I still hold that there are within our own dominion better sights and scenes than any I have seen on my travels\\". In September they travelled through the Home Counties, then went to Belgium and Germany. They had intended to leave for New Zealand from Naples in October but changed their minds, possibly as they had let the house in Auckland for a longer period. They went on to travel in Ireland and England and passed November in Scotland. Over the Christmas period, the Kidds travelled in Yorkshire and Lancashire. In March 1912 the Kidds travelled to Switzerland, the Riviera, Paris, Berlin and northern Italy, then returned to England in order that Kidd could attend the first levee at St James's Palace and Mrs Kidd could be presented at the first court of the season. Kidd was presented to King Edward VII on Monday 2 March by Sir William Hall-Jones, the NZ High Commissioner. On 8 March Mrs Kidd was presented to the King and Queen by Mrs Lewis Harcourt, the wife of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Mrs Kidd's gown was \\"of ivory satin with an overdress of d’Alencon lace arranged in paniers. The train was an old French design of gold and white chiffon brocade hemmed with graduated cloth of gold falling from both shoulders in a cascade, allowing the lace gown to appear through. Mrs Kidd’s bouquet was an early Victorian posy composed of mauve orchids, white lilac, pink rosebuds and blue forget me nots. It was tied with streamers of mauve and pink ribbons\\". They left England in the Mauretania travelling to New York, and then travelled to Chicago and Winnipeg. They visited the Rockies, then met the Zealandia in Vancouver on 15 April and reached New Zealand on 7 May 1912. The house at 28 Domain Road (now 74 & 76 Gillies Avenue) was advertised to let, furnished, in the Auckland Star of 17 February 1911 and described as a \\"Alfred Kidd’s, Esq., beautiful property in Domain Road Epsom\\" with \\"a house of nine rooms with all modern conveniences, stables, tennis lawn, good garden and about 2 acres of land\\".

He played parts of four seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the San Diego Padres and Cleveland Indians. Wojna is of Polish descent.  Early career  Wojna attended Masuk High School and then played at Indian River Junior College. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies. He was traded by the Philadelphia Phillies with Marty Decker, Darren Burroughs and Lance McCullers to the San Diego Padres on August 31, 1983 as part of trade in which the Padres gave up Sixto Lezcano and a player to be named later (Steve Fireovid).  Major league career  Wojna made his debut with the Padres in 1985, but was seldom used on a very strong pitching staff. In 1986 he enjoyed his best season by going 2–2 with a 3.23 ERA. The highlight of the season, and his career, came on September 11, 1986 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego. That night he hurled a 9 inning complete game and defeated the Atlanta Braves 9 to 1. He allowed only three hits in the game (two singles by Ken Griffey and one by Rafael Ramírez) and only one unearned run. During the 1987 season Wojna did not pitch well and was up and down between San Diego and their Triple-A Pacific Coast League team, the Las Vegas Stars. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox after the season, spending a year in their organization before being traded to the Indians. His last appearance in the major leagues came in 1989 out of the Indians bullpen for a handful of games. He spent 1990, his last professional season, with the Tacoma Tigers in the Oakland Athletics organization. For his career Wojna won 4 games, lost 10, and had a 4.62 ERA over 132.1 innings. He pitched in 36 games and started 20 of them. Last name humor * The Padres' broadcasting crew of Jerry Coleman and Dave Campbell often had trouble with Wojna's Polish name. Fellow Padre teammates Garry Templeton and Marvell Wynne pronounced his name as \\"Wash-nuh\\" despite manager Steve Boros' attempts to teach them otherwise. * In the Polish language, \\"wojna\\" means war.

It has been developed for quick assessment of power loss in electrical steel sheet without the need for cutting and annealing, as it is the case for standardised methods like Epstein frame. The power loss can be estimated at 1.0 T, 1.5 T and 1.7 T and two frequencies 50 Hz and 60 Hz. Lamination thickness can be set within a range from 0.01 mm to 0.99 mm and there is no option for selecting the material density.Jeremy P. Hall, Evaluation of residual stress in electrical steel, PhD Thesis, School of Engineering, Cardiff University, 2001 The power loss is measured as a product of magnetic field and flux density. Both these signals are detected from the magnetising yoke, which is contained in an aluminium head (55 mm in diameter as shown in the photo). The flux density is measured from a secondary winding wound on the yoke. For that reason there is a great influence on the measured values, hence great care should be taken that the measuring head is placed on a clean and even sample. The measurement is based on similar principle as employed in the standardised single sheet tester. The manufacturers of the instrument claim that its measurement uncertainty is lower than 5% (as referred to results from Epstein frame).Soken Direct Reading Iron Loss Tester (Model DAC-1R-1), User Manual, Yokogawa-Martron Ltd., 20 Park Street, Princess Risborough, Bucks., UK The Soken tester has been developed in the second half of 20th century initially as a relatively cheap and easy to use analogue device, but recently also digital devices are available.Direct Reading Iron Loss Tester References Magnetism ","title":"Soken tester"},{"id":"13263024","text":"Self-envy is a psychoanalytic concept developed by Rafael López-Corvo who argues that it is crucial for the understanding of disorders of the self that are manifested in addictions, acting out, and inhibition of creativity. This concept is based on the use of object relations theory, that many psychoanalysts view as a fundamental instrument for examining the architecture of the internal world that describes behavior as influenced by the multiple interactions of early representations of self and other that operate in our inner selves. Self-envy is produced by 'child part self-objects', self representations from early development that remain split off from the self and harbor destructive and envious feelings toward the creative aspects of the self and results from direct aggressive attacks by these childhood self- objects against the part of the self identified with a harmonious mother- father or parent-sibling relationship. The internal dynamics of self-envy cause intense unconscious conflict, dissociation, and disturbances of the self, all of which underlie severe psychopathologies, such as repetitive destructive behavior, and even the living of seemingly normal but constricted lives. López-Corvo suggests that the psychoanalytic interpretation of such patients, for whom one part of the self is ruthlessly pitted against another, should address directly the phenomenon of a war within the internal self. W.C.M. Scott first used this term in 1975 in his article \\"Remembering sleep and dreaming: self-envy and envy of dreams and dreaming\\" in the International Review of Psychoanalysis, Vol. 2/3 (1975): 333-354. López-Corvo credits Scott in his paper \\"About Interpretation of Self-Envy\\" in the same journal (1992): 73, 719, and also in his book Self-Envy: Therapy and the Divided Inner World, which also draws from Melanie Klein, Wilfred Bion, and other object-relations theorists in order to develop its more extended argument.

It is part of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), which is funded by the Government of India through the Department of Atomic Energy. The radio telescope is a long and tall cylindrical parabolic antenna. It operates at a frequency of 326.5 MHz with a maximum bandwidth of 15 MHz at the front end.  Design  Stainless steel wires forming the parabolic reflector The Ooty Radio Telescope has been designed and fabricated with domestic Indian technological resources. The ORT was completed in 1970 and continues to be one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world. Observations made using this telescope have led to important discoveries and to explain various phenomena occurring in the solar system and in other celestial bodies. The reflecting surface of the telescope is made of 1,100 thin stainless-steel wires running parallel to each other for the entire length of the cylinder and supported on 24 steerable parabolic frames. An array of 1,056 half-wave dipoles in front of a 90-degree corner reflector forms the primary feed of the telescope. It has an angular resolution of 2.3deg x 5.5sec(dec)'.  History  The structure of the radio telescope was designed in July 1963. Muthorai village near Ooty was selected as the suitable location and the construction work began in 1965. The telescope was completed in 1970. Normal post-commissioning and calibration use began in 1971. The ORT was upgraded in 1992 by the addition of a phased array of 1,056 array of dipoles each followed by a GaAsFET low noise amplifier (LNA) and a four-bit PIN diode microstripline phase shifter behind each dipole. The new feed was installed along the focal line of the 530 m long and 30 m wide parabolic cylindrical reflector of the ORT. This new feed brought about an improvement in the sensitivity of the ORT by a factor greater than three compared to the previous feed. The high sensitivity of the feed system and the large collecting area of ORT has been exploited for the studies of astrophysical phenomena such as pulsars, solar wind, recombination lines, and protogalaxies. , the ORT is undergoing a major upgrade to its receiver chain, which will result in a new system called the Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA). The OWFA is designed to function as a 264-element interferometric array, and to provide a significantly larger instantaneous bandwidth as well as field-of- view compared to the legacy ORT receiver system. This upgrade will significantly enhance the ORT's capabilities for heliospheric studies. Additionally this upgrade is also expected to open other avenues of research particularly in the newly emerging areas of intensity mapping and studies of transient radio sources.  Features  The large size of the telescope makes it highly sensitive. As an example, it is in principle capable of detecting signals from a 1 watt radio station located away in space. The telescope sits on a natural slope of 11°, which matches the latitude of the location. This gives the telescope an equatorial mount that allows tracking of celestial sources for up to ten hours in the east-west direction. In the north-south direction, the telescope operates as a phased-array and is steerable by varying the phase gradients The telescope can be operated in either total power or correlation mode. In each mode, 12 beams are formed; beam 1 is the southernmost beam and beam 12 is the northernmost. These 12-beam systems are useful in sky survey observations. Recently, the reflecting surface of the ORT has been refurbished. A new digital back-end has been built for the ORT by the colleagues at Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore.  Observations  The ORT has produced results on radio galaxies, quasars, supernovae and pulsars, One long-term program determined the angular structure of several hundred distant radio galaxies and quasars using the lunar occultation method.

The school begins at pre- kindergarten and continues through the twelfth grade. The school also operates a pre-school on four campuses in the area and has an enrollment of over 300. History Mars Hill Academy, the first predecessor of today's school was opened by Theophilus Brown Larimore in 1871. He drew the name \\"Mars Hill\\" from the New Testament book of Acts (17:22) Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill... He later changed the name to Mars Hill College. The academy and college operated for 16 years teaching hundreds of young men. Larimore offered a diverse curriculum of classes including business writing, rhetoric and Latin as well as advanced studies in the Bible. from his students came many preachers that established numerous congregations around the area. The college was closed in 1887 in order for Larimore to spend more time preaching. Mars Hill Bible School was reopened in 1947 through a collaboration among local churches of Christ Charlie Morris being the head of the reinstitution of the school on the original campus of Larimore's Mars Hill Academy. The Larimore Home was used as the main building of the school with classes being taught in the 12 rooms of the historic house. A high school building was later built and a few years later a new elementary building was constructed. While Mars Hill Bible School affiliates itself with the churches of Christ and although the Mars Hill Church of Christ is next to the campus, the school is completely independent of all churches and is a fully autonomous entity. Academics MHBS has been awarded the \\"Excellence in Education Award\\" on 3 separate occasions. In 2016 the school received an overall score of 306.15 from AdvancED which is a national school accreditation agency. Their score was above the agency's network average of 278.34 The Honors Diploma, one of 4 offered diplomas, requires 28 credits that include Bible, English, Social Studies, Humanities, Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Foreign Language, Health and Physical Education. To receive this diploma, students must maintain a 90.0 or higher cumulative average. The Dual-Enrollment program in partnership with Northwest-Shoals Community College allows students to take college classes on the MHBS campus. This is possible because MHBS offers a block schedule that mimics college schedules and allows time for juniors and seniors to take college classes while still in high school. MHBS also offers the Early-Scholar Program which allows students to take courses at the University of North Alabama during the day. The timing of the block schedule and the close proximity to the UNA campus allows students the time to commute. The school also conducts ACT preparation for their high school students. A strong spiritual emphasis is placed on academics with daily Bible class being part of the mandatory course load for all students. Daily chapel attendance is also required to begin each day where the students sing worship songs, read scripture and hear short devotional talks. Corresponding with the strict biblical literalism of the Church of Christ, students at MHBS are taught that the Earth is between 6,000 and 8,000 years old and that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is a myth. Athletics Mars Hill competes in the Alabama High School Athletic Association in the 1A classification. Their nickname is the \\"Panthers\\". The school has won 17 Alabama High School Athletic Association championships, with five in baseball (including 1977, 1978, 2010, 2012 and 2019), seven in girls' basketball, one in boys' golf, two in girls' track and field, one in girl's softball, and one in Football. The Panthers' Football program began in 2009 and was built into a Varsity program over the period of a couple of years. On August 21, 2014 Mars Hill played their first varsity football game against the Sheffield Bulldogs. After making their way into the 2A Playoffs in the 2017-18 season, the Panthers defeated the Linden Patriots at Jordan-Hare Stadium to claim its first state championship in Football. *Men's sports **Football **Baseball **Basketball **Cross country **Forensics Squad **Golf **Soccer **Tennis **Track and field *Women's sports **Basketball **Cross country **Forensics Squad **Golf **Soccer **Softball **Tennis **Track and field **Volleyball Administration * Irven Lee (first president) * Paul O.

Ajuda National Palace, in Lisbon, where the manuscript is kept. The Cancioneiro da Ajuda (, ; \\"Ajuda Songbook\\") is a collection of Galician-Portuguese lyric poems probably dating from the last quarter of the 13th century. It is the oldest of the Galician-Portuguese cancioneiros with secular music. The Cancioneiro is kept in the library of the Ajuda National Palace, a former royal residence located in Lisbon. It consists of a parchment codex written in Gothic script by three hands and containing illuminated miniatures. Both the text and the miniatures remained unfinished and not a note of music was written in the space left for it. The whole codex contains 310 poems, nearly all of them cantigas de amor (male-voiced love songs, though a few are satiric and there are a few male/female dialogs). The first (crude) edition dates from 1823, but a monumental critical edition, still a standard work, was published by the German-born Romance philologist Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos in 1904.

Prior to 1992, the middle schools in the Smithtown CSD were as follows: *Accompsett Middle School *Great Hollow Middle School *Nesaquake Middle School In 1992, redistricting led to the consolidation of the three middle schools into Smithtown Middle School, a facility housed in the former and now present Smithtown High School East, containing all sixth, seventh and eighth graders in the Smithtown CSD. The student population grew again, which caused Smithtown Middle School to be split again, first reopening Great Hollow Middle School and then disbursing the rest of its students to Nesaquake and Accompsett Middle Schools when the high school split back into East and West. =Smithtown High Schools= The Smithtown Central School District serves students through the Smithtown High School on two different campuses, the East Campus in St. James and the West Campus in Smithtown.

Former Smithtown schools =New York Avenue Junior High School= The building located at 26 New York Avenue was formerly a junior high school, which served students grades seven through nine. It served the middle-western portion of the Smithtown Central School District. Graduating students of the New York Avenue Junior High School would enter Smithtown High School (West). In its time, the New York Avenue Junior High School operated along with three other junior high schools in the district, Great Hollow Junior High School, Accompsett Intermediate High School and Nesaquake Junior High School. Today it serves its function as the district's central office, adult education programs, and board of education meetings. It is also known as the Joseph M. Barton building. =Smithtown Branch High School= Prior to the opening of Smithtown Central High School building in St. James in 1960, Smithtown High School operated out of the New York Avenue school building. At some point, before the opening of the Lawrence Avenue Elementary school, the New York Avenue building served as a K through 12 school.

This article deals with the pin as it is defined in amateur wrestling. A pin ends a match regardless of when it occurs. Situations which are almost pins but for whatever reason do not meet the criteria—for example, have only one shoulder down or have the defending wrestler blocked in a neck bridge—are rewarded with exposure points (in collegiate wrestling, known as near fall points or back points) in order to encourage wrestlers to take risks to try to pin their opponents. Conditions =Greco-Roman and freestyle= In Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, the two shoulders of the defensive wrestler must be held long enough for the referee to \\"observe the total control of the fall\\" (usually ranging from one half-second to about one or two seconds). Then either the judge or the mat chairman concurs with the referee that a fall is made. (If the referee does not indicate a fall, and the fall is valid, the judge and the mat chairman can concur together and announce the fall.) In the United States, for the Kids' Freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling division (wrestlers ages 8 to 14) in competitions sponsored by USA Wrestling, it is specified that a fall must be held for two seconds. =Folkstyle= In American collegiate (or folkstyle) wrestling, a pin must be held for one second. In American scholastic (or folkstyle) wrestling, a pin must be held for two seconds. Techniques =Half nelson= In the half nelson, the attacking wrestler is on top of the opponent on the ground with both wrestlers face down; a half nelson can be used to turn the opponent over. The attacker's arm is pushed below the opponent's shoulder from the outside, and across and behind the opponent's neck. The attacker's arm lifts the opponent's shoulder while the attacker's hand presses his neck down; simultaneously the attacker drives forward perpendicularly to the opponent's body to roll him over onto his back. With the opponent on his back and the attacker perpendicular to him chest-on- chest, the attacker tightens his arm around the opponent's neck, often also controlling the opponent's lower body by hooking the free arm in the opponent's crotch or around the near or far thigh. =Three-quarter nelson= In a three-quarter nelson, one arm again goes under the opponent's shoulder and behind his neck to press it down, but in addition the attacker's other arm goes under the opponent's body from the same side, across the body to the other side of the neck, and up the other side of the neck to lock with the first hand behind the neck and press down. Again the attacker drives forward to roll the opponent over; once that is accomplished, the attacker can convert to a half nelson or, if the attacker's leg has hooked behind the opponent's knee, the three-quarter nelson can be maintained to accomplish the pin. =Cradle= A cradle is a move where the attacker performs the cradle by grabbing the neck of his opponent with one arm, and wrapping the elbow of the other arm behind the knee of the opponent. The wrestler then locks both hands together, forcing the opponent's knee toward his face, and rolls the opponent over onto his back. The hooked leg can be either the near leg (a \\"near-side cradle\\") or the far leg (a \\"far-side cradle\\"). =Armbar or chicken wing= In this move, the top wrestler, just to his opponent's left, grasps the opponent's left elbow with his left hand, putting his right arm on his waist in front of his right hip. He quickly pull his left arm out while still holding onto it. He pushes him down with his body, using his right knee to push him forward and off-balance. He then grabs his right wrist with the right hand and pulls it outward. His belly is now down on the mat, legs flat. The aggressor is above the opponent with his chest several inches above his back. The aggressor's left knee holds up most of his own body weight. The aggressor's right leg is extended between his legs with the ball of the foot on the floor. The aggressor curls his wrist, then encloses the opponent's left arm inside the aggressor's left elbow joint. With the aggressor's chest is resting on the opponent's left elbow, he uses his body to push his left shoulder into his ear, using both legs for leverage. He slowly moves his feet into a walking position while crouched, walking in a circle and rolling the opponent over onto his back without releasing his arms. The pin is finished by the aggressor leaning on his knees with his chest toward the floor. =Guillotine= A guillotine is initiated when both wrestlers are face down on the mat, the attacker on top of the opponent. The attacker hooks one leg around the opponent's same-side leg, also hooking the ankle with the foot. The attacker reaches across to grab the arm opposite to the side that the leg ride is on. This arm is pulled back and up to allow the attacker to slip his head under it, at or just above the elbow. (The guillotine is most easily applied if the opponent is reaching back during the leg ride.) The attacker uses his head to lift and turn the arm and opponent. The attacker's leg-hook-side arm is applied under the opponent's arm and behind his head in a similar fashion to a half nelson. The attacker rolls backward to roll the opponent is onto his back, and the attacker locks his hands around the opponent's neck.

It is based on Samuel Wright's story of the same name, and the Music Machine albums. The video also spun off a partially animated series called Lessons in Agapeland. It features Stan Freberg and Pat Boone as voices for certain characters. Cast Mr. Conducter played by Pat Boone Mr. Pimms played by Stan Freberg Stevie played by Donovan Frebreg Nancy played by Hannah Cutrona Growdy played by Alan Oppenheimer Snark played by Merrill Mael Boogwart played by Bob Ridley Rabbit played Joni Robbins  Synopsis  While flying a kite on a hill, two children named Stevie and Nancy are swept away aloft by their kite in sci-fi fashion to a fantasy, wonderland-type world called Agapeland. It is a lush green place near a river, containing oversized mushrooms, living plants, and friendly woodland animals. Shortly after their arrival in the pleasant Agapeland, Stevie and Nancy discover the Marvelous Music Machine, which Stevie explains is a \\"quanamatic digilator.\\" Stevie tries to make it work, but only succeeds in causing it to produce a loud noise, which shoves him back into the Music Machine's caretaker (possibly creator), The Conductor. When one of the children asks how the machine works, The Conductor simply smiles and replies: \\"You put something in it [a slot on the machine], and a song comes out.\\" The next few minutes are spent singing songs, playing around, and learning important things. But partway into the film, the storyline (which has so far stayed close to the plot of the original 1978 cassette) takes a twist: across the river from Agapeland, it is revealed that there is a barren, dry, creepy, dark place plagued with misery (due to its lack of love). This land is inhabited by the Pudges (three barefoot, waif- like, young characters similar to dwarves), and their scheming, grouchy \\"friend\\", Mr. Pims. Upon the transition to the miserable land, we see Mr. Pims enlist the three Pudges, Snard, Grum, and Bubort, to help him in a mastermind, wildly wacky scheme of schemes; steal Agapeland's source of happiness (the Music Machine). Pims figures that—once the machine is away from Agapeland, people will have to buy their happiness from him and the Pudges. Immediately, Pims puts his plan into action. He and the Pudges pack up a mule-driven wagon, raft across the river to Agapeland, and spy on Stevie, Nancy, and the conductor, waiting for a moment to steal the machine. Once the three humans leave, the Pudges try everything to get the machine away from Agapeland; however, they continually get distracted (and annoy Pims) until they finally come up with a terrific distraction: a picnic to keep Stevie, Nancy away from the music machine. Their trick works! Stevie and Nancy return from the picnic to find the machine roped up and being (or trying to be) lifted onto Mr. Pims' wagon. In the nick of time, Stevie uses a jackknife to cut the ropes and thwart Pims' plan (and it makes the Pudges and Pims escape from Agapeland as soon as they can), but the Music Machine has been wrecked and disformed from all of its mistreatment and no longer works. The Conductor does everything he can to fix it, but it refuses to play anything. Nancy, upon realizing that the Music Machine is ruined, cries a tear, which falls into the slot. The music machine comes back to life!  Quotes  Nancy: \\"The music machine must make everybody happy!\\" The Conductor: \\"Not everybody, Nancy. Some people just seem to enjoy being miserable.\\" Nancy: \\"The music machine was so wise. How did it know all those things?\\" The Conductor: \\"Oh, we all know them, Nancy. We just... don't always listen to what we know.\\" Mr. Pims: (after explaining his plan to steal the music machine) \\"Anyone who wants to be happy will have to buy their happiness from us. In other words, we'll be rich.\\" Bubort: \\"Yeah, and we might even be happy, too!\\" Mr. Pims: \\"Don't be ridiculous. When you're rich, you don't need to be happy.\\"  Notes  *Three songs, \\"A Land Called Love,\\" \\"Goodness\\" (which is heard in the background as the Pudges try to steal the machine), and a re-done version of \\"Patience (Herbert the Snail)\\" are all from the original 1977 album. 1991 films Christian animation 1991 animated films American children's films American films ","title":"Music Machine (film)"},{"id":"13263391","text":"The Bradford & Foster Brook Railway was one of the earliest, if not the first, monorails in America. Inspired by a working demonstration of the Centennial Monorail at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876, Col. Roy Stone thought it would solve transportation problems near Bradford, Pennsylvania. In 1876, Bradford was a booming oil town with much machinery and oil supplies awaiting delivery. Because of muddy road conditions, deliveries to the oil fields were delayed. Construction of the railroad was already started by October 31, 1877, when the Railway Corporation was founded. The railway consisted of a series of piles driven into the ground connected by 12\\" square timbers upon which set a single rail. Three feet below the railhead was a stringer on each side. This stringer bore a wear strip upon which the rail cars pressed a wheel for balance. Road crossings operated like a fence gate, as did switches. A variety of engines were constructed for the railway. The first engine had twin boilers and sat low on the rail. It wore out quickly, and was replaced by a heavier engine of more conventional single-boiler design. This engine had only two drivers and bore heavily on the rail, crashing through on its fourth trip along the railway. No one was hurt in the accident, although several people had to be rescued from the stream. By the beginning of the next year, a third locomotive had been constructed, again using twin boilers. This third locomotive had second-hand boilers. They were tested to their specifications; however, on the engine's trial run, one boiler ran dry and when too much water was introduced by an inexperienced fireman. The resulting explosion killed six people, and putting an end to the railroad.

Typical forms of content creation include maintaining and updating web sites, blogging, article writing, photography, videography, online commentary, the maintenance of social media accounts, and editing and distribution of digital media. A Pew survey described content creation as the creation of \\"the material people contribute to the online world.\\" Content creators =News organizations= News organizations, especially the biggest and more international, such as The New York Times, NPR, and CNN and others, consistently create some of the most shared content on the Web. This is especially true for content related breaking news and topical events. In the words of a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, \\"Mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK.\\" While the rise of digital media has disrupted traditional news outlets, many have adapted, and have begun to produce content that is designed to function on the web and be shared by social media users. The social media site Twitter is a major distributor of breaking news in traditional formats, and many Twitter users are media professionals. The function and value of Twitter in the distribution of news is a frequent topic of discussion and research in journalism. User-generated content, social media blogging and citizen journalism have changed the nature of news content in recent years. The company Narrative Science is now using artificial intelligence to produce news articles and interpret data. =Colleges, universities and think tanks= Academic institutions, such as colleges and universities, create content in the form of books, journal articles, white papers, and some forms of digital scholarship, such as blogs that are group edited by academics, class wikis, or video lectures that support a massive open online course (MOOC). Institutions may even make the raw data supporting their experiments or conclusions available on the Web through an open data initiative. Academic content may be gathered and made accessible to other academics or the public through publications, databases, libraries and digital libraries. Academic content may be closed source or open access (OA). Closed source content is only available to authorized users or subscribers. An important journal or a scholarly database may be closed source, available only to students and faculty through the institution's library. Open access articles are open to the public, with the publication and distribution costs shouldered by the institution publishing the content. =Companies= Corporate content includes advertising and public relations content, as well as other types of content produced for profit, including white papers and sponsored research. Advertising can even include auto-generated content, blocks of content generated by programs or bots for search engine optimization. Companies also create annual reports which count as content creation as it is part of their company's workings and a detailed review of their financial year. This gives the stakeholders of the company insight of the company's current and future prospects and direction. =Artists and writers= Cultural works, like music, movies, literature, and art, are also forms of content. Traditionally published books and e-books are one type of cultural content, but there are many others, such as self-published books, digital art, fanfiction, and fan art. Independent artists, including authors and musicians, have found commercial success by making their work available on the Internet. These changes have revolutionized the publishing and music industries. =Government= Through digitization, sunshine laws, open records laws and data collection, governments may make whole classes of statistical, legal or regulatory information available on the Internet. National libraries and state archives turn historical documents, public records, and unique relics into online databases and exhibits. At times, this has raised significant privacy issues. For example, in 2012, The Journal News, a New York state paper, sparked outcry when it published an interactive map of gun owners' locations using legally obtained public records. Governments also create online or digital propaganda or misinformation to support law enforcement or national security goals. This can go as far as astroturfing, or using media to create a false impression of mainstream belief or opinion. Governments can also use open content, like public records and open data in the service of public health, educational and scientific goals, such as crowdsourcing solutions to complex policy problems, or processing scientific data. In 2013, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) joined asteroid mining company Planetary Resources to crowdsource the hunt for near- earth objects, asteroids that could threaten the Earth. Describing NASA's crowdsourcing work in an interview, technology transfer executive David Locke spoke of the \\"untapped cognitive surplus that exists in the world\\" which could be used to help develop NASA technology. This is just one way crowdsourcing could be used to enhance public participation in government. In addition to making government more participatory, open records and open data have the potential to make government more transparent and less corrupt. =Users= With the introduction of Web 2.0 came the possibility of content consumers being more involved in the generation and sharing of content. Also with the coming of digital media and the ease of access at home, the amount of user generated content has increased as well as the age and class range. Eight percent of Internet users are very active in content creation and consumption. Worldwide, about one in four Internet users are significant content creators, and users in emerging markets lead the world in engagement. Research has also found that young adults of a higher socioeconomic background tend to create more content than young adults from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Sixty- nine percent of American and European internet users are \\"spectators,\\" who consume—but don't create—online and digital media. The ratio of content creators to the amount of content they generate is sometimes referred to as the 1% rule, a rule of thumb that suggests that only 1% of a forum's users create nearly all of its content. Motivations for creating new content may include the desire to gain new knowledge, the possibility of publicity, or simple altruism, among other reasons. Users may also create new content in order to help bring about social reforms. However, researchers caution that in order to be effective, context must be considered, a diverse array of people must be included, and all users must participate throughout the process. According to a 2011 study, minorities create content in order to connect with niche communities online. African-American users have been found to create content as a means of self-expression that was not previously available. Media portrayals of minorities are sometimes inaccurate and stereotypical which in turn affects the general perception of these minorities. African-Americans respond to their portrayals digitally through the use of social media like, Twitter and Tumblr. More importantly, the creation of Black Twitter has allowed a community to be able to share their problems and ideas.  Teen users  Younger users now have more access to content and content creating applications and publishing to different types of media, for example, Facebook, DeviantArt, or Tumblr. As of 2005, around 21 million teens used the internet. Among these 57%, or 12 million teens, are Content Creators. This creation and sharing was happening at a far higher level than with adults. With the advent of the internet, teens have had far more access to tools for sharing and creating. Technology is also becoming cheaper and more accessible as well, making content creation far easier for everyone, including teens. Some teens use this to seek fame as social influencers through online platforms like YouTube, while others use it to connect to friends through social networking sites. Either way, this demographic is becoming more than just observers, they are creators as well. Issues =Quality= The rise of anonymous and user-generated content presents both opportunities and challenges to Web users. Blogging, self-publishing and other forms of content creation give more people access to larger audiences. However, this can also perpetuate rumours and lead to misinformation. It can make it more difficult to find quality content that meets users' information needs. =Metadata= Digital content is difficult to organize and categorize. Websites, forums, and publishers all have different standards for metadata, or information about the content, such as its author and date of creation. The perpetuation of different standards of metadata can create problems of access and discoverability. =Intellectual property= The ownership, origin, and right to share digital content can be difficult to establish. On one hand, user- generated content presents challenges to traditional content creators with regard to the expansion of unlicensed and unauthorized derivative works, piracy and plagiarism. On the other hand, the enforcement of copyright laws, such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the U.S., also make it less likely that works will fall into the public domain.  Social movements  = The Egyptian revolution of 2011 = Content creation serves as a useful form of protest on social media platforms. The Egyptian revolution of 2011 was only one example of content creation being used to network protestors from all different parts of the world for the common cause of protesting the \\"authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa throughout 2011\\". The protests took place in multiple cities in Egypt such as Cairo and what started out as peaceful quickly escalated into conflict. Social media outlets allowed protestors to network with each other across multiple regions to raise awareness of the widespread corruption in Egypt's government and unite in rebellion. Youth activists promoting the rebellion were able to formulate a Facebook group, \\"Progressive Youth of Tunisia\\". = Other = Examples of more recent social media protesting through online content include the global widespread use of the hashtags #MeToo and #BLM to raise awareness and exact change for women and the black community.

The load causes the lithosphere to flex by depressing the plate beneath it. Because of the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, the area around the load is uplifted by a height that is 4% of that of the depression under the load. The load and the resulting flexure place stress on the mantle, causing it to flow into the area around the loaded area. The subsidence of the area under the load and the uplift of the forebulge continue until the load is in isostatic equilibrium, a process that takes on the order of 10,000 to 20,000 years. Because of the coupling with the mantle, the rate of forebulge formation and collapse is controlled by mantle viscosity. Glacial One cause for forebulge formation is loading of the continental lithosphere by ice sheets during continental glaciations. Because of the removal of the ice sheets, the formerly-glaciated areas are currently rising in a phenomenon known as post-glacial rebound. Because of the coupling of the mantle with the plates, data from post-glacial rebound are used as a direct probe of the viscosity of the upper mantle. As the ice melts and the land under it rises by isostatic recovery, the forebulge also subsides. Forebulge subsidence is the reason why the Netherlands and parts of southern England are still slowly sinking.p54 in Doggerland: a Speculative Survey, by B.J.Coles, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, #64 1998 pp 45-81. One estimate is that the centre of the North Sea rose by about 170 m (558 ft) during the Ice Age because of forebulging.Glacial deposits of Britain and Europe: general overview, by D.Ehlers, P.Gibbard, & Tj.C.E van Weering, 1979: in Glacial Deposits in Britain and Ireland, edited by J.Ehlers, P.Gibbard, & J.Rose, pp 493-501, Rotterdam: Balkema. Tectonic Collisions between tectonic plates and island arcs lead to loading and flexure of the lithosphere. The flexure produces a significant forebulge, which divides a forearc basin and a back arc basin. Physics The existence of a forebulge is predicted by the solution to the equations for the flexure of a thin elastic beam or plate (the lithosphere). The magnitude of the flexure goes as an exponentially decaying sinusoid. The lithosphere is therefore anomalously high at a flexural half-wavelength past the load; the flexural wavelength is determined in large part by the elastic thickness of the lithosphere.

Its formal name is benzo[10,11]phenanthro[2',3',4',5',6':4,5,6,7]chryseno[1,2,3-bc]coronene (IUPAC name) or benzo[1,2,3-bc:4,5,6-b'c']dicoronene (name sometimes used in Chemical Abstracts). It has 15 rings and is a brick-red solid. Its formula is . Dicoronylene sublimes under high vacuum, 0.001 torr, between 250 °C and 300 °C. Structure Due to its large size and limited availability, the organic chemistry of dicoronylene is little known. Dicoronylene does undergo a Diels–Alder reaction with maleic anhydride on one or both of the central bay regions on either side of the bridging ring. The double bond of maleic anhydride forms two carbon–carbon bonds on the ends of the bay region, making a new six-membered ring. Heating removes the anhydride as carbon dioxide gas and gives the corresponding 16-ring and 17-ring PAHs. Occurrence Dicoronylene was first observed in the solid residue produced in coal gasification. This residue contained large amounts of coronene and ovalene. After these were extracted and identified, a reddish residue remained, which was sparingly soluble in organic solvents. Elemental analysis indicated that it was most likely the condensed dimer of coronene. Dicoronylene was later discovered to occur as a by-product of the catalytic hydrocracking used in petroleum processing. It is formed when two coronene molecules fuse. It is estimated that catalytical hydrocracking produces several hundred metric tons of dicoronylene worldwide per year, making it the most prevalent large PAH. In this process, the analogous 18-ring PAH formed from coronene and ovalene () is also formed in 1% to 20% proportions. It is purple in color. Properties The formation of dicoronylene in hydrocracking reactors is a serious problem because its low solubility make it precipitate in any cooler part of the reactor flow path. This causes plugging of flow lines that require periodic shutdown and removal of the reddish deposits. Dicoronylene is also a constituent of coke formed on hydrocracking catalysts, which reduces their activity. Thermal pyrolysis of coronene shows masses of dicoronylene and the condensed trimer, tetramer, and pentamer in the mass spectrum of the black product. These larger coronene condensates are black in color. Dicoronylene is moderately soluble in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and these solutions have a greenish yellow fluorescence. Unlike coronene, dicoronylene has symmetrical fluorescence excitation and emission spectra. It is virtually insoluble in most solvents. Dicoronylene has been studied as a model for interstellar PAHs. Its large size and planarity have also shown promise as a chromatographic separation material.

The Turkish title is Bir ömür yetmez. It had its United States premiere at Frameline in San Francisco on 20 June 2008. Plot A group of very close friends live in Rome and cope with the sudden death of one of their members. The original group, who have been together for many years, are two straight couples, Antonio and Angelica, and Roberto and Neval; and a gay couple now separated, Sergio and Davide, a successful author. Relatively new additions to the group are Davide's current lover Lorenzo and Lorenzo's friend Roberta. Early in the movie a final member is added to the group: Paolo, an aspiring writer who is an acquaintance of Lorenzo and Roberta. Although the members of the group love each other and spend much time together, there are tensions both within the group and within the three couples who make up the group. Antonio and Angelica seem to be a perfect couple, but their two young children are dysfunctional, and Antonio has been having a secret affair with Laura, a married woman with teenage children. Roberto feels like an outsider, because while Neval is a core member of the group he is not. And although Davide and Lorenzo look like the epitome of a beautiful, affluent gay couple, Paolo's entry into the group stirs up hidden currents of competition and infidelity that begin to test the relationship. During a dinner party in Davide's apartment, Lorenzo without warning suffers an aneurysm and falls into a coma from which he does not recover. His friends are deeply shaken by his death; problems that have until then been hidden begin to emerge and threaten to destroy the group; and Davide almost commits suicide. They all finally convene at Davide's retreat in the mountains overlooking the sea and come to terms with one another and Lorenzo's death.

That year, he played in the International League with the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he became a pitcher, and was sold to the Boston Red Sox in 1947. Late in the season he was called up to the Red Sox, making his debut on September 11 as a pinch-hitter. In his first major league at bat, he connected a game-winning RBI single off Cleveland Indians pitcher Bob Lemon, while posting a 0–1 mark in five appearances. Deal earned a spot as a starting pitcher during 1948 spring training, but hurt his arm after that. It was an injury which would plague him for the rest of his career. Despite the pain, he would eventually pitch in four games with the Red Sox that year and went 1–0 with a perfect 0.00 ERA in 4 innings of relief. In 1949 he was traded by Boston to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for a minor leaguer. He spent 1949 with the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association and later pitched in 36 games for the Cardinals in 1950 and 1954. In four major league seasons Deal posted a 3–4 record with a 6.55 ERA in 45 games, including two starts, 34 strikeouts, 48 walks, 12 games finished, one save, and 89 innings of work. As a hitter, he collected a .167 batting average (4-for-24), including one home run, one double, five runs, and four RBI. Deal later established himself in the St. Louis organization as an outfielder, catcher and switch-hitting pinch- hitter, while winning 108 games as a pitcher. His highlights included starting and completing a twenty-inning game for Columbus against the Louisville Colonels on September 3, 1949. In addition to winning the game and giving up one earned run during the 20 innings, he collected four hits in eight at bats. He also hit a home run during the 1952 Caribbean Series while playing as a pitcher/outfielder for the Puerto Rico team. Between 1951 and 1959 Deal spent most of those years with the Cardinals' AAA International League farm team, the Rochester Red Wings. He had a record of 61–38 as a pitcher for Rochester. Deal also was a utility outfielder, back-up catcher and pinch-hitter for the Red Wings. Coaching career When Rochester manager Dixie Walker resigned after the 1956 season Deal was the first choice to manage the 1957 Red Wings. Deal would manage the Red Wings until he resigned in August 1959. He was inducted into the Red Wings' Hall of Fame in 1994. Following his playing career Deal served as a pitching coach for the Cincinnati Reds (1959–60), Houston Colt .45s (1962–64), New York Yankees (1965), Kansas City Athletics (1966–67), Cleveland Indians (1970–71) and Detroit Tigers (1973–74). He also worked as outfield coach and defensive coordinator with the Houston Astros (1983–85), as assistant minor league director for the Chicago White Sox (1986), and with the San Francisco Giants organization as minor league hitting and outfield coach (1987–89). As a minor league manager Deal led the Indianapolis Indians to the 1961 American Association championship. He also managed the Oklahoma 89ers (PCL, 1968; AA, 1969); coached and managed the Toledo Mud Hens (IL, 1972 and 1973); coached the Columbus Clippers (IL, 1978), and returned with the PCL Oklahoma team as coach and interim manager (1979–82).

Reynolds Tobacco Company in the U.S. and by British American Tobacco outside of the U.S. First introduced in 1966, the brand is no longer commercialised since 2006. History Barclay cigarettes were first introduced in the United States by Brown & Williamson in 1966, as a long-size (80 mm) brand tipped with the \\"Millecel\\" filter (which was used on various cigarette brands throughout the world in the 1960s). This version was later discontinued. The brand got re-launched in 1980 by Brown & Williamson as an \\"ultra-low tar\\" product featuring an \\"Actron\\" filter. The launch of the brand was the most expensive in history ($150 million in 1980, equal to about $340 million today). Remarkably, the 1 mg tar King Size (3 mg tar 100 mm) cigarette broke sales records for a new cigarette within months of release. To introduce Barclay cigarettes, B&W; rolled out an advertising campaign that claimed the product was 99% tar free. The product had a specific design that generated phenomenally low yield data in the Federal Trade Commission tests for tar. This alarmed B&W;’s competitors, who then petitioned the FTC for help. In doing so, they disclosed their knowledge that the FTC testing procedure was flawed and the yield data was thus invalid for human smokers. During the 1980s and 1990s, 2 films were made. One was to show its design and production, and the other was a compilation of BBC clips as well as various German television programs about BAT's Barclay and the flaws of smoking machine testing results. In 2006 British American Tobacco sold the brand to R.J. Reynolds and renamed it in many countries to Kent. Controversy Dutch pack of Barclays Brown & Williamson claimed Barclay gave the smoker just 1 milligram of tar and 0.2 milligrams of nicotine by the FTC method of testing. Barclay immediately caused a stir at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, who claimed that the Barclay cigarette had a new filter design that allowed it to circumvent the FTC tests and misreport the amount of tar and nicotine being delivered to the smoker. Cigarette makers traditionally lower the \\"tar\\" content of cigarettes by designing filters that allow air to mix with the smoke, diluting it. The filters of most \\"low tar\\" cigarettes have rows of small ventilating holes encircling the filter which allow air to mix with smoke during inhalation, diluting the \\"tar\\" and nicotine in the smoke. The Barclay cigarette, however, had four lengthwise channels which conducted the air from the ventilating holes directly into the smoker's mouth, preventing air from mixing with the smoke until the level of the smoker's mouth. The amount of air dilution in the Barclay cigarette could be reduced if the smoker crushed the channels or blocked them with his lips. Since the FTC machine did not block the channels, it allowed the maximum of amount of air to mix with the smoke. RJR wrote to the FTC and argued that the FTC's testing machines did not collapse the, or block the filter holes on Barclay as a human smoker does, and thus the machine indicated a much lower \\"tar\\" content when testing Barclay than is typically delivered by Barclay to consumers. One account claimed that consumers were able to obtain up to seven times more smoke from Barclay cigarettes than from other cigarettes. An RJR memo highlighted by the United States Department of Justice discussed the deception and what would occur if the FTC failed to stop Barclay from being marketed as a low tar cigarette. RJR wrote, > ...This generation of [Barclay-type] products, or the next, could easily be > products which will deliver NO 'tar' or nicotine when smoked by the FTC > method, and yet when smoked by humans essentially be unfiltered cigarettes. > Such products could (and would) be advertised as 'tar-free', 'zero > milligrams FTC tar,' or 'the ultimate low-tar cigarette', while actually > delivering 20-, 30-, 40-mg. or more 'tar' when used by a human smoker!

In December 1981, Brown & Williamson accused the Federal Trade Commission of injustice because of the way the agency aired a tobacco industry dispute about their product. In June 1982, the Federal Trade Commission unanimously concluded that Brown & Williamson no longer can advertise its popular low-tar Barclay as a \\"one-milligram-tar\\" cigarette. Within minutes after the FTC made its announcement, Brown & Williamson filed suit in a federal court in Louisville, Kentucky asking that the FTC be barred from taking action against Barclay advertisements pending a lawsuit. The stay was granted only minutes after the suit was filed. Advertising Brown & Williamson made various magazine and print adverts to promote the Barclay brand since its launch in 1980. The ads showed a man with a classy tuxedo suit with a Barclay cigarette in his mouth with the slogan \\"The pleasure is back\\" underneath. The slogan \\"99% tar free\\" was also present, but eventually had to be removed after the FTC filed a complaint that the claim was misleading.

Accessed September 18, 2007. Fort Runyon was the largest fort in the ring of defenses that protected Washington during the Civil War and was named after Brigadier General Theodore Runyon, commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia during the First Battle of Bull Run. Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling following the end of the Civil War in 1865. Today, no trace of the fort remains on the site, which is now exit 9 on Interstate 395, though a historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society. Occupation of Arlington Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the county in Virginia closest to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Originally part of the District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846 act of Congress that took effect in 1847.Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C., The Historical Society of Washington, D.C. Accessed September 13, 2007. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee.Evacuation of Arlington House, U.S. National Park Service. Accessed September 13, 2007. Following the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 14, 1861, new American president Abraham Lincoln declared that \\"an insurrection existed,\\" and called for 75,000 troops to be called up to quash the rebellion.E.B. Long with Barbara Long, The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac 1861-1865 (Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1971), pp. 47-50 The move sparked resentment in many other southern states, which promptly moved to convene discussions of secession. The Virginia State Convention passed \\"an ordinance of secession\\" and ordered a May 23 referendum to decide whether or not the state should secede from the Union. The U.S. Army responded by creating the Department of Washington, which united all Union troops in the District of Columbia and Maryland under one command.Long, p. 67 Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, commander of the Department of Washington, argued that northern Virginia should be occupied as soon as possible in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and the Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to wait until after Virginia voted for or against secession.Cooling, Benjamin Franklin, III, Symbol, Sword, and Shield: Defending Washington During the Civil War Second Edition Revised (Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Company, 1991), pp. 32-26, 41.

Engineer officers under the command of then-Colonel John G. Barnard accompanied the army and began building fortifications and entrenchments along the banks of the Potomac River in order to defend the bridges that crossed it.Cooling, Benjamin Franklin, III, Symbol, Sword, and Shield: Defending Washington During the Civil War Second Edition Revised (Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Company, 1991), p. 37 By sunrise on the morning of the 24th, ground had already been broken on the first two forts comprising the Civil War defenses of Washington — Fort Runyon and Fort Corcoran. Fort Runyon was named for Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon, a native of New Jersey who commanded one of the first brigades of volunteers from that state. Later named commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia, he led that force into the First Battle of Bull Run, and served as commander for the first three years of the war. In 1864, he was elected mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and was later named the U.S. Ambassador to Germany.\\"Theodore Runyon.\\" Officers of the Volunteer Army and Navy who served in the Civil War, L.R. Hamersly & Co., 1893. At the time of the occupation of northern Virginia, Runyon commanded a brigade of four New Jersey regiments: the First, Second, Third, and Fourth New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. Men from these regiments supplied the labor involved in the construction of Fort Runyon, while engineers under Colonel Barnard's command directed the work. Also participating in the construction effort were men from the 7th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, temporarily attached to the New Jersey Brigade.The United States Service Magazine Henry Coppee, ed. 1865. \\"New York State Militia\\", p. 235.

Due to the importance of the Long Bridge, which linked northern Virginia directly with downtown Washington, Fort Runyon was designed to be the largest fort in the entire system of defenses protecting Washington. of perimeter were protected by 21 guns of various types and manned by over 300 artillerymen. Over 1,700 more men manned the walls of the fort, making the total garrison in October 1861 just over 2,000 men.Scott, et al., Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 628. The fort was arranged in a rough pentagon shape, with one wall facing the Alexandria Turnpike, another facing the Columbia Turnpike, and the other three walls facing Washington and the Potomac River, which lay just to the north and east sides of the fort.(1) See map. (2) Large gates were built into the two southernmost walls in order to provide passage for wagons and passengers traveling along the two turnpikes that linked to the Long Bridge. Fort Runyon was built directly at the crossroads of the two turnpikes, and served as a checkpoint for vehicles entering the city via the Long Bridge.See illustration. =Problems of terrain= The sites for Forts Runyon, Corcoran, and the other works that represented the first defenses built in Virginia had been surveyed prior to the occupation of northern Virginia. Colonel Barnard directed individual engineers and small groups to survey likely sites for forts even before Virginia seceded from the United States.Scott, et al., Volume 11, Chapter 23, p. 106. The ground they chose for Fort Runyon consisted of the first high terrain south of the Long Bridge. Low, gradually-sloping hills provided an excellent site for the walls of the fort. Despite the flat, open nature of the terrain on which Fort Runyon was built, Barnard reported that the work was difficult. \\"The first operations of field engineering were, necessarily, the securing of our debouches to the other shore and establishing of a strong point to strengthen our hold of Alexandria. The works required for these limited objects (though being really little towards constructing a defensive line) were nevertheless, considering the small number of troops available, arduous undertakings.\\"Scott, et al., Volume 5, pp. 678-679 Within a week of the beginning of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington Heights, and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and sneak up on the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling for the construction of a fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.J.G. Barnard. A Report on the Defenses of Washington to the Chief of Engineers U.S. Army. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 1871. p. 9. In the seven weeks that followed the occupation of Arlington and the beginning of work on Fort Runyon, Barnard and his engineers were forced to focus virtually all of their effort on Corcoran, Runyon, Albany, and a few other minor batteries owing to the limited resources available. By the time Barnard was beginning to focus his efforts on tying the two forts into an entire interlocking system of fortifications, his engineers were drawn off by the approach of the Confederate Army and the incipient Battle of Bull Run. =Renovation and obsolescence= A sketch of Fort Runyon, as published in Harper's Weekly in November 1861. The sketch is an interior view of one of the fort's bastions. Following the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to strengthen the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1941), pp. 101-110. Many of the makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Runyon. On July 26, 1861, five days after Bull Run, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was named commander of the military district of Washington and the Army of the Potomac. Upon arriving in Washington, McClellan was appalled by the condition of the city's defenses, despite the hurried efforts in the wake of the Union defeat: > In no quarter were the dispositions for defense such as to offer a vigorous > resistance to a respectable body of the enemy, either in the position and > numbers of the troops or the number and character of the defensive works... > not a single defensive work had been commenced on the Maryland side. There > was nothing to prevent the enemy shelling the city from heights within easy > range, which could be occupied by a hostile column almost without > resistance.\\"Scott, et al., Volume 5, p. 11. To fix the problems McClellan perceived in Washington's defenses, he directed Colonel Barnard to construct a continuous line from the Potomac north of Alexandria to a point west of the Aqueduct Bridge, one of the three bridges that crossed the Potomac River. By the time the Army of the Potomac was deployed for the Peninsula Campaign in March 1862, the line of defenses stretched completely around Washington, and extensions to the ring of defenses ensured the protection of the town of Alexandria and the Chain Bridge, the furthest west of the three bridges connecting Maryland and Virginia.Scott, et al., Volume 11 (Part 1), Chapter 23, p. 107. Cavalry depart Fort Runyon through one of the fort's main gates. The defenses south of the Potomac were combined into the Arlington Line, an interlocking system of forts, blockhouses, rifle pits and trenches that would defend Washington throughout the entire course of the war. Their intimidating nature was designed to dissuade an attack as much as repel one,Scott, et al., Volume 19 (Part II), Chapter 31, p. 391. and over the four years that would pass before the final armistice, no Confederate force would ever seriously attempt to penetrate the Arlington Line. A side effect of the new building campaign inaugurated by General McClellan was the obsolescence of Fort Runyon, which soon was overshadowed by forts built atop the Arlington Heights and adjacent to Fort Albany. Due to the distance between Fort Runyon and the new line of defenses, direct fire support was not an option, and thus Runyon could only offer indirect support to the forts that now served on the front lines. Fort Runyon's cannon were removed and emplaced further forward, and the fort was designated an \\"interior\\" fortification.Scott, et al., Volume 19 (Part II), Chapter 31, p. 212; Volume 21, Chapter 33, p. 907. The soldiers who had served the guns were also removed to other positions that needed trained artillerymen.Scott, et al., Volume 19 (Part II), Chapter 31, p. 292. Owing to its location on the approaches to the Long Bridge, however, it still maintained some importance as an inspection point for wagons and trains entering Washington via the Long Bridge. By 1863, however, the minutes of a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War referred to Fort Runyon as \\"an important work when it was first built, but we have now an exterior line of fortifications ... there is merely a guard in Fort Runyon now.\\"United States Congress.

Following the Battle of Bull Run, the engineering depot at Fort Runyon served as a rallying point for engineering troops dispersed during the Union defeat. Officers and men alike reunited at the fort, only to be reassigned to hurried entrenchment efforts in order to prevent a threatened Confederate march on Washington.Scott, et al., Volume 2, Chapter 9, p. 336. From July 14, 1861 to August 31, 1861, the fort was garrisoned by the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry.Phisterer, Frederick. New York in the War of the Rebellion, 3rd ed. Albany: J. B.

A total of 41 men were convicted of dereliction of duty and imprisoned in Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas before eventually agreeing to satisfactorily complete their enlistments.The Union army: a history of military affairs in the loyal states, 1861-65 -- records of the regiments in the Union army -- cyclopedia of battles -- memoirs of commanders and soldiers. Madison, WI: Federal Pub. Co., 1908. Volume II. Link Accessed September 18, 2007. In November 1861, the fort was garrisoned by men from the 14th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, commanded by a Colonel Greene.Harper's Weekly, \\"Forts Runyon and Albany\\". November 30, 1861; p. 767. By 1863, the garrison had dwindled to a single company from that regiment. A May 1864 report by Brigadier General A.P. Howe, artillery inspector for the Union Army, found Fort Runyon to be \\"out of repair and at present unoccupied.\\"Scott, et al., Volume 36 (Part II), Chapter 48, p. 883. Howe recommended that the fort be repaired and reoccupied as soon as possible. \\"It holds ... an important position, being at the head of Long Bridge, and if occupied would hold the bridge and guard it from surprise. I recommend that it be put in order and occupied.\\" Post-war use After the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, the primary reason for manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature and the fact that the fort was unimportant to the overall defenses of Washington, Fort Runyon fell into the third-class category.Scott, et al., Volume 46 (Serial 97) , Part 3, p. 1130. With the two remaining guns removed to Fort Corcoran for storage and the garrison sent home, the fort was left abandoned. Due to its proximity to Washington and the large influx of freed blacks to the city that followed the end of the Civil War, the fort became residence to many squatters, most of whom were African-American. By 1932, no trace of Fort Runyon was left on the approaches to the new 14th Street Bridge, built in 1906. > All the forts around or overlooking the city are dismantled, the guns taken > out of them, the land resigned to its owners.

Though the wood and timber that made up the fort was undoubtedly burned by squatters or scavenged for building materials in the first few years after the war, the fort's embankments and trenches lasted quite a bit longer. A 1901 Rand McNally tour guide of Washington instructs tourists to look out of the windows of their train at the south end of the Long Bridge to catch a glimpse of the decaying fort. \\"At its further end there still stands, plainly seen at the left of the track as soon as the first high ground is reached, Fort Runyon, a strong earthwork erected in 1861 to guard the head of the bridge from raiders.\\"Rand McNally and Co. Rand, McNally & Co.'s Pictorial Guide to Washington and Environs. Rand McNally Publishers, 1901. Chapter 13, p. 159. A brickworks was also located nearby, sometimes utilizing the clay that formed the bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go into the walls of Washington homes.Snowden, William Henry. Some Old Historic Landmarks of Virginia and Maryland G.H. Ramey & Son, 1902. Page 7. Two years later, a new railroad bridge was constructed, replacing the old Long Bridge. In 1906, a highway bridge was constructed nearby. Together, these two projects destroyed what little remained of Fort Runyon. The approach routes to the bridges ran directly through the earthworks of the old fort, and these were leveled in order to provide smooth passage for trains and automobiles.\\"14th Street Bridge,\\" Roads to the Future.com By 1941, when ground was broken for work on the Pentagon, nothing remained of the fort. Today, Interstate 395 runs through the site of the fort, and Exit 9 from the interstate is at the approximate center of where Fort Runyon stood. A nearby historical marker erected by the Arlington Historical Society commemorates the fort's existence.

Febo (or Febos) Moniz (1515 – aft. 1580) was a Portuguese nobleman who distinguished himself during the 1580 Portuguese succession crisis. Life He was the second son of Jerónimo Moniz and wife Violante da Silva. Fidalgo, he fulfilled offices in the Paço and was Semilher do Corpo or Semilher de Corpus and a valet of King Sebastian of Portugal and his Major Chamberlain and Gentleman of his Chamber. He was also the Lord of the Chapel of Our Lady of Piety at the Carmo Convent, in Lisbon. =1580 Portuguese succession crisis= He distinguished himself in the opposition to the pretensions of the Castilian King Philip II in the Cortes of Almeirim, where he was a Procurator elected by the people of Lisbon, after Cardinal Henry, King of Portugal having despotically annulled the election of Dom Manuel de Portugal and Dom Diogo Salema. He counted then 64 years of a peaceful life, but his energy before the weaknesses and hesitations of Henry surprised everyone and gave him a sudden popularity. At the Cortes of Almeirim, on 11 January 1580, as President of the Deputies of villages and cities, Febo Moniz vigorously impeached the suggestions of Cardinal Henry to consider with calm the pretensions of Philip II of Spain to successor of Sebastian. His energy communicated to the Cortes, which unexpectedly rejected a message from the King that had the manifest intent of restrain the Cortes' prerogatives. Henry went exasperated and have told by the Bishop Dom António Pinheiro that for his will should Philip be considered as possible successor in the throne. Febo Moniz, outraged, protest with vehemence against what said the treason, before the Crucifix, taken as symbol of the idea of Justice thus knocked. He reunited around him the Procurators of the people and with them assented in that all the Councils were immediately warned of the imminent danger. On 22 January 1580, Febo Moniz and all the Procurators swore upon the Host that they would prefer to die that to accept the sovereignty of Philip of Spain. In contrast with the arm of the nobility, which contemporized ever more, the popular arm augmented its resistance, to the point of deciding, with the greatest serenity, despite repeated messages of the Cardinal, that only to Lisbon, and not to all the realm, should compete the election of the new King. The Cortes envoyed Henry a deputation, presided by Febo Moniz. It was violent the discussion between the Procurator and the King, who unmannerly had the conference ended. He soon regretted and took the resolution of damping the people's resistance, through the force of patience. As he felt death close and was able to admit the pretensions of the Castilian King, he had called to the Paço the five Procurators of the first bench, who were the ones of Lisbon, Porto, Évora, Coimbra and Santarém, and in the presence of all of them, he prompted that they ceased the opposition, referring them the decisions of the nobility and the clergy, favourable to the acclamation of Philip of Spain, but Febo Moniz denied himself to any deliberation, as Henry was getting along with suspicious people and enemy of the motherland. The Cardinal-King tried uselessly to impose his will, invoked the formidable power of Spain, but Febo Moniz did not cede and revindicated for the people the right of electing a Portuguese King, as it had been done, two centuries before, with the Master of Aviz. The Cardinal-King could not win this resistance and, time later, dead himself, the events came to show the corruption and venality of the upper classes of the Nation. Febo Moniz proposed to disobey the Governors of the Kingdom and saw, with astonishment, that his proposal was rejected by a large majority, despite the enthusiasms of the first moment. The gold and the fear, employed as arguments by Cristóvão de Moura, replaced the patriot's influence. The Governors of the Kingdom dissolved the Cortes of Almeirim, at instances of Cristóvão de Moura. Deeply dispirited, Febo Moniz retired himself to Santarém, where the tumultuous acclamation of the Prior of Crato as King of Portugal made him understand that the national cause was losing itself. He kept withdrawn and, when he triumphed, Philip ordained the incarceration of the patriot in a gaol, in which he died soon after. Febo Moniz Street, in Lisbon, was named after him. Marriage and issue He married his relative Dona Isabel de Lima, daughter of Dom Pedro de Castelo-Branco, of the Admirals of Portugal, and wife Margarida de Lima, and had seven children: * Pedro Moniz, who died unmarried and without issue a captive at Fes * Jerónimo Moniz, second son, who served at Tangiers and after widowed went to Flanders with the Cardinal and married to Elvira de Alarcão, daughter of Gaspar de Torres and wife Leonor de Alarcão, and a widow without issue of Sebastião da Silva * João Moniz, who was a Page of the Bell of King Sebastian of Portugal and was held captive at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, and had a Command at the Order of Christ, the one of Sabugal, and died unmarried and without issue * Maria Luísa or Antónia da Silva, Dame of Queen Catherine of Austria, married as his second wife to Francisco (or António) de São-Paio de Melo or de Melo de São-Paio, 7th Lord de Vila Flor and Alcaide-Mór de Moncorvo who succeeded in his father's House at the death of his brothers * Maria Catarina, alias, Margarida da Silva, a Nun at Santa Clara, in Lisbon * Violante or Maria Violante da Silva, a Nun at Santa Clara, in Lisbon * Ana or Maria Ana de Ataíde, married to Heitor de Melo, bastard son of Martim Afonso de Melo, without issue Sources * Manuel João da Costa Felgueiras Gaio, \\"Nobiliário das Famílias de Portugal\\", Tomo Vigésimo Primeiro, Título de Monizes, § 17, § 18 e § 19, Tomo Vigésimo Sexto, Título de Sampayos, § 1 * Various Authors, \\"Armorial Lusitano\\", Lisbon, 1961, pp. 370–372 * Dom Augusto Romano Sanches de Baena e Farinha de Almeida Portugal Sousa e Silva, 1.º Visconde de Sanches de Baena, \\"Archivo Heraldico-Genealógico\\", Lisbon, 1872, Volume II, p.

In 1967 Louis le Brocquy was commissioned by publisher Liam Miller to illustrate Thomas Kinsella's inspired version of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, the record of Ireland's proto-historic past. Ailbhe Ní Bhriain remarked, \\"The Táin Bó Cuailnge - táin, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories. It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior Cúchulainn (The Hound of Ulster) and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne.\\" Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory. The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first 'living version of the story\\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.'Ailbhe Ní Bhriain, 'Le Livre d'Artiste: Louis le Brocquy and The Tåin (1969)' New Hibernia Review, 5.1 (2001). Louis le Brocquy painted several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations. The artist noted, \\"Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible. The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament. They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it. Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work. In particular, they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text. If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's Táin, they are a humble one. It is as shadows are thrown by the text that they derive their substance.\\"Louis le Brocquy, 'Artist's Note', The Táin (Mountrath, Co. Laois: Dolmen IX, The Dolmen Press 1969), colophon. The Táin, 1969 The Táin, (Dolmen Press, Dublin) was published in September 1969. Widely acknowledged as the great Irish Livre d'Artiste of the 20th century, Seamus Heaney writes in The Listener: \\"The book is illustrated lavishly and magnificently by Louis le Brocquy: 'marks in printer's ink', he calls his contribution, 'shadows are thrown by the text'. Sometimes they are runs, sometimes a rush of brush strokes, sometimes a tall totem in the margin. The remote significance of the story, the bold vigour among the ranks of heroes and the wily, sexual presence of the women are continuously insinuated by the graphic commentary. Altogether the poetry, painting and printing make this an important book, the fulfilment of a publishing dream.\\"Seamus Heaney, 'King Conchobar and his Knights', The Listener (London, March 26, 1970). Le Brocquy's illustrations received critical acclaim for their level of interplay with Kinsella's writing. According to Aidan Dunne: \\"The brush drawings merged seamlessly with the text; stark, fluent images, they expressed with great economy of means an epic breadth, evoking the movement of vast masses of people. Individual participants in the drama were also pulled into close focus. To achieve this, le Brocquy developed his brilliant idiom of calligraphic illustration ... Le Brocquy's achievement lies in having absorbed the general technical possibilities and harnessed them to his own specific ends, and, in the process, having managed to break new ground. The Táin drawings managed a well-nigh perfect marriage of text and image, and their impact was considerable.\\"Aidan Dunne, 'Le Brocquy's Joyce's Dubliners', ILS (Dublin, Spring 1988), p. 13. Bhriain further observed: \\"The strong linear quality of le Brocquy's illustrations coheres with the upright, unfussy Pilgrim font, which is also suited to the direct tone of Kinsella's translation. The lettering, or initial letter, plays an important function in the livre d'artiste, and it can be seen here as a strong integrating element, as it is applied to the initial word of each tale. The bold font of the lettering echoes the dense black of le Brocquy's images, creating a fine balance between the literary and the visual symbol. These formal elements make it clear that The Tain is a production of carefully choreographed visual information, one comparable with the unity of Verlaine's language, Bonnard's arabesques, and the floral font in Parallèlement ... In his Tain illustrations, the ability of le Brocquy's drawings to emerge and dissolve gives fitting expression to the peculiar marriage of mysticism and raw physicality contained in Kinsella's text. Like gestures of primaeval fear, strength, or passion, the 'explosive' energy of the brushwork captures the physical exuberance of the text, as can be seen in the images of \\"bodily matters\\" and of violence, as in the several drawings of Cúchulainn's 'warp spasm'.\\" The illustrations establish le Brocquy's reputation as an interpretive draftsman of considerable originality. Kinsella stated, \\"There are certain staying qualities that help an artist to major achievement. The gift of concentration is one (in the sense of economy as well as of intensity), and so is steady energy. le Brocquy has these qualities to a degree unique among Irish painters or designers since the death of Jack B. Yeats. He also has that individual force, stemming from tireless curiosity, which gives coherence to a career - the kind of force that insists on artistic growth, or change, and ensures that any stimulus, however seemingly random, find a central response.\\"Thomas Kinsella, 'Louis le Brocquy', exhibition catalogue: In association with ROSC '71, The Irish Imagination 1959-1971 (Dublin: Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, October 23–31 December 1971), p. 78.

Exhibited for the first time at the Dawson Gallery, Dublin in October 1969, Brian Fallon writes in The Irish Times: \\"The Kinsella-Le Brocquy Tåin was a stunner in terms of book production, a triumph for Liam Miller and the Dolmen, and a high-water mark in Irish publishing ... The result is very impressive, I should say one of the very best things Le Brocquy has done. It will be impossible from now on to think of the Irish Iliad in terms of the pseudo-medieval clutter of the old-style illustrations - helmeted warriors laden with \\"props\\" and looking rather like understudies for a Wagner opera. Le Brocquy's conception is epic, stark and primitive, at times even sinister (as in the superb \\"Morrigan\\"). In an idiom that can take in its stride hints from oriental art, cave painting, Picasso and other sources he has created powerfully and economically an entire mythical-legendary world.\\"Brian Fallon, 'Le Brocquy's illustrations a triumph', Irish Times (November 17, 1969).

Background  Despite Jiang Ke's high status, little is firmly established about his background or career except for the years that he served as chancellor—as, unusual for a chancellor, he did not have a biography in either the Old Book of Tang or the New Book of Tang.See the Table of Contents for the Old Book of Tang and the Table of Contents for the New Book of Tang. (The table of chancellors family trees in the New Book of Tang indicated that his father was the general Jiang Baoyi (姜寶誼),New Book of Tang, vol. 73.2. who served during the reign of the founding emperor Emperor Gaozu, but oddly enough did not list him as one of Jiang Baoyi's sons in Jiang Baoyi's biography, as would be customary.)New Book of Tang, vol. 88. Little is known about Jiang Ke's career prior to his becoming chancellor in 665, although it was noted in the biography of his colleague Yan Liben that he was a renowned general who was promoted for his battlefield achievements.Old Book of Tang, vol. 77. The only real record of his military accomplishment came in 662, when he served as the deputy of the general Qibi Heli (契苾何力) in a campaign to pacify the Tiele tribes (of whom Qibi's own tribe was related) -- a successful one, as Qibi was able to persuade the tribes to give up the chieftains who had rebelled against Tang and to resubmit to Tang.  Service under Emperor Gaozong  In 665, Jiang Ke was serving as the minister of defense, when Emperor Gaozong gave him the additional designation of Tong Dong Xi Tai Sanpin (同東西臺三品), making him a chancellor de facto. Around the new year 669, Jiang was made acting Zuo Xiang (左相) -- the head of the examination bureau of government (東臺, Dong Tai) -- and a post considered one for a chancellor still. In fall 670, in the aftermaths of a major defeat that the generals Xue Rengui and Guo Daifeng (郭待封) suffered at the hands of Tufan's prime minister Gar Trinring Tsendro (\\"Lun Qinling\\" (論欽陵) in Chinese) earlier that year, Emperor Gaozong commissioned Jiang with an army to attack Tufan, but if the army was actually launched, the results were not recorded in history. In 671, he was formally made the head of the examination bureau, with the title now being Shizhong (侍中). Jiang died in 672 with the title of the Duke of Yong'an (which he apparently inherited from Jiang Baoyi), but his posthumous name, if any, was not recorded in history.

He campaigned to give the vote to all common men and women, driven by a strong desire for \\"justice and freedom for all mankind\\". He was a leading figure in the Reform League, which campaigned for the Reform Act 1867. He was called the \\"Burns of Labour\\" and \\"the poet of the poor\\" for his political songs and poems, which were sold widely in penny publications, and recited and sung by workers in Britain, Europe and America. He was an entertaining and persuasive orator and his speeches were in great demand around London. He owned, edited and contributed to Radical and Liberal newspapers and journals, and printed and distributed bills advertising London Reform meetings and demonstrations. He wrote the international hit 'The Song of the Spade'.George Howell. Howell Collection Biographies. London: Bishopsgate Institute  Roots  John Bedford Leno was born on 29 June 1826 at 14 Bell Yard, Uxbridge, Middlesex, England. He was the eldest child of John Leno (1800–1885) (Gentleman's footman, baker and publican) and Phoebe Bedford (1801–1875) (lady's maid, needlewoman & teacher in a Dame's school) who met whilst working for Mr. Chippendale, a well known Uxbridge philanthropist.  Early years  Although not well educated, John Bedford Leno's mother taught him to read and it is to her he attributed his love of learning. He was sent to preparatory school at the age of eight but was quickly expelled on the grounds of telling a falsehood. He maintained that this was untrue. He suspected that the lie had been fabricated by a few of the better off scholars who found out that he hailed from Bell Yard, and thought it degrading to have to associate with someone of such poor standing. He was then sent to live with his aunt at Stanwell Moor. She was in charge of the parish poor house, along with her husband, in which they had apartments. He found the workhouse a \\"queer\\" place. In a strange twist of fate he next worked as a cleaner and errand boy at the very same school he had been expelled from. At the age of twelve he worked for a firework maker whom he disliked for making false marketing claims and building sub-standard squibs. He became a rural postboy under the Uxbridge post master, who was also a printer and stationer. John Bedford Leno delivered to the Uxbridge Common, Ickenham, Ruislip and Eastcote areas, walking twenty miles every day, from 6am to dinner time before returning to finish off the day with some print work. It is during his time as postboy that his theatrical interest was aroused; he was often called upon to read out the contents of letters to the villagers, many of whom were illiterate. He found that he had the power to \\"create smiles and draw forth tears\\" and found this very satisfying. This lasted for twelve months before he became so useful in the print office that he was enrolled as a printer's apprentice. Due to his incomplete education he struggled for three years and made little progress. Despite this, he persevered and was given extra instruction after work by the most able, and benevolent, printer in the office called Mr. Kingsbury, who he felt indebted to for the rest of his life.  Theatre, singing, poetry & gambling  During this time, Uxbridge was regularly visited by theatre groups and John Bedford Leno watched numerous actors perform with admiration. When one of the visiting theatre companies hit some bad luck, and was on the verge of bankruptcy, John Bedford Leno was spurred into action. Despite never having acted before, he and three friends decided to put on an amateur performance of Roundheads and Cavaliers, with the proceeds going to the manager of the impoverished theatre company. John Bedford Leno played the lead character and also arranged for billings to be distributed around the town. The identities of the actors were not revealed and rumours were circulated that they were persons of \\"the highest social position\\". The performance was a sell out and was followed by one of the bankrupt theatre company's own plays. This proved so successful that it then played in Uxbridge for the next nine months and saved the company from ruin. The manager of the company later became wealthy and attributed much of his success to John Bedford Leno and his three enterprising friends. John Bedford Leno's father bought a malthouse with an inheritance gained from his recently deceased brother, Mathew Leno, who had won the grand prize in a government lottery a few years earlier. John Bedford Leno had bad memories of this place and some of the rogues that filled it. He was often called upon to sing to customers, having a good voice, and to take part in singing competitions which he usually won. However, his interest in poetry was sparked here by a customer leaving a copy of Lives of The Poets by Samuel Johnson. John Bedford Leno read and re-read it and decided to become a poet.  Introduction to politics  John Bedford Leno was also introduced to politics at his father's malthouse. He became friends with a Chartist, Fred Farrell, who used to argue about various theories with Mr. Kingsbury, from the print office, who was a conventional Liberal. He was introduced to The Examiner newspaper, Star, New Moral World and other various publications and could soon hold his own in arguments about one tenet or another. He became converted to Chartism and joined at the first opportunity. He formed a branch in his home town and became its branch secretary, buying and selling Chartist publications to the residents of Uxbridge.  Printing  Towards the end of his apprenticeship John Bedford Leno grew to be more competent than some of his more qualified colleagues and became office foreman. After seven years he finished his apprenticeship but parted ways with his employer due largely to the financial difficulties of the business and ensuing tensions between the two of them. He found work in another printing works in Eton, Berkshire for a while before again being released due to tensions with his foreman (JBL was quick-witted and had a strong sense of justice which, when combined with an exploitative or dishonest employer, landed him in trouble). Printing was suffering a slump and so John Bedford Leno decided his best chance of employment was to be found in the country. He travelled far and wide, surviving by singing and reciting poetry in exchange for food or money and travelled over a thousand miles around the country before deciding to head back to Uxbridge. Upon his return he was persuaded to hold a Benefit Concert for himself at the town hall, which he did and raised £40. He bought himself his own printing press and set up shop in Windsor St, Uxbridge.  Chartism  As well as founding the Uxbridge Chartist branch John Bedford Leno also daringly established the Eton branch in Windsor which was the home of Queen Victoria. He also served as a Delegate of the Chartist movement. His first publication was the Manuscript Newspaper, of which he was co-editor. This was then succeeded by the Uxbridge Pioneer which was edited by Gerald Massey, Kimber, Hudson, Gurney and a few others who had all been elected by the Uxbridge Young Men's Improvement Society. Political differences soon caused a split in this group and John Bedford Leno and Gerald Massey went on to produce their own paper: Spirit of Freedom, and Working Man's Vindicator. This was printed for the next year until Massey left Uxbridge to work as the secretary for the Tailor's Association in London. Here Gerald met the \\"Promoters\\", a body of gentleman who were known as Christian Socialists (now known as the Christian Socialist Movement) and included many eminent men. They decided to set up a Working Printers' Association which they invited John Bedford Leno to take charge of. He declined however, on the grounds that they would be setting up in opposition to some of his old friends who had just set up their own \\"Co-operative Printers' Association\\" in London, which he joined as a rank and file printer. When their existence became known to the heads of the Christian Socialists, they received considerable financial support, from the likes of Frederick Maurice and Thomas Hughes, the author of Tom Brown's Schooldays. The \\"Co-operative Printers' Association\\" disbanded after three years and John Bedford Leno set up his own printing shop in Drury Lane, London in which he lived with his family for most of the rest of his life. One of John Bedford Leno's first London experiences was attending the Chartist rally at Clerkenwell Green in 1848. This was disbanded by an army of police constables who swept the green. When asked to disperse by a plain clothes policeman John Bedford Leno at first refused, whereupon he was battered in the face with a truncheon.  International Socialism  In 1848 John Bedford Leno joined the First International [this is not correct First International formed Sep. 28, 1864], which had been started by his friend, George Julian Harney [??? needs a source]. He attended International Meetings (the first international) at Jacques, a café kept by a French exile in Chapel St. just off of Oxford Street, London. After one such meeting he was approached by the Russian revolutionary, Alexander Herzen, who inquired whether he would mind running an underground printing office for him. It would be used to print leaflets which were to be used to flood Russia with revolutionary literature. John Bedford Leno eagerly agreed and they arranged to meet again. Herzen never showed up and it seems he had been forced to flee, later being caught and thrown into prison in Siberia. John Bedford Leno met Karl Marx several times while he was in London. After a public meeting of the Reform League in 1855 an impromptu committee meeting was held in the parlour of a tavern in Chancery Lane. Here John Bedford Leno reminisced about conversing with the Russian who he found to \\"be deeply interested, a firm believer in the doctrines and who never ceased to advocate\\". When Napoleon III visited England in 1858 Leno arranged for an \\"appropriate welcome\\" to be made. Leno had a hatred of Napoleon because of his \\"betrayal of the French Republic\\" (Napoleon became Emperor of the French after a coup in 1851), and believed he was no friend of England. This view was shared by other Chartists, Lord John Russell, Gladstone and John Bright. Leno printed 10,000 leaflets advertising Napoleon's visit and called for demonstrations at Cheapside and Long Acre. The French refugees in London responded in great numbers, wanting revenge for their expatriation. Napoleon was the main subject of debate in London debating halls at this time and it was in one of these that Leno gave a speech arguing for regicide in certain circumstances i.e., when a monarch used a nation's troops for their own or unconstitional ends, as Napoleon had done. John Bedford Leno was also a Delegate of the International and a member of the committee appointed to meet Lajos Kossuth in 1851 and Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1864, the Hungarian and Italian revolutionaries.  Post-Chartism  He spent much time attending meetings, making speeches, giving council or writing political articles or songs during this period. He was a regular contributor to the weekly journal the Christian Socialist and served as a representative to the Christian Socialists. Jones offered to pay Leno to join him in his battle against Harney for leadership of the Chartist movement. However, Leno declined, having just started his own group (known as the Propagandists who pledged to speak on behalf of the working class, free of pay). They met weekly to hold discussions at the \\"Windsor Castle\\", Holborn and leading members included George Odger, William Randal Cremer, George Howell, Robert Applegarth, William Davis & John Henriette. Most of the Propagandists joined the Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious ClassesF.M. Leventhal. Respectable Radical. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1971 in 1863, of which Leno was made chairman. It was from the nucleus of this group that the Reform League was formed in 1865.  The Reform League and the Reform Act 1867  When the Reform League was established to press for manhood suffrage and the ballot, John Bedford Leno was elected a member of its council almost unanimously. The Reform League was the successor of Chartism and achieved much success unlike its predecessor. John Bedford Leno aged 40  Hyde Park demonstration  At the height of the Reform League's popularity it arranged for a meeting to be held at Hyde Park. The authorities declared it to be illegal but the Reform League thought otherwise and was determined it should be held. The procession started off from the Reform League's headquarters, at 8 Adelphi Terrace, headed by a cab containing the Reform League's president, Edmond Beales, his friend Colonel Dickson and a few other aristocratic supporters. As they headed up Regent Street it was decided that these gentlemen would visit Gunter's Tea Shop in Berkeley Square and so left the procession. This left John Bedford Leno, his brother and a few others, at the head of the procession. When they reached Marble Arch they were confronted by a line of policemen. They demanded to be let through, but were refused, and so signified their intention to break through the line. This they tried, only to be laughed at. While arguing with the police, Leno's friend, Humphreys, noticed that the railings would stand no pressure and began to sway them backwards and forwards. He was soon helped by the masses and the railings fell. The people flooded into Hyde Park despite the efforts of the police to restrain them. Simultaneously, two other parts of the demonstration also broke into the park; one from Knightsbridge headed by Charles Bradlaugh, and another from Park Lane. The meeting then proceeded as planned under the Reformer's Tree. At its end it was decided to hold another meeting the next evening in Trafalgar Square. Leno and the leaders of the Reform League heard a rumour that the government was determined to oppose it and so decided to confront the Home Secretary, Walpole. They pointed out to him that if the police or military stepped in bloodshed would ensue. With tears in his eyes Walpole agreed that restraint was the best option. Leno and George Odger went back to the crowds and announced the next evening's meeting at Trafalgar Square. The crowds dispersed and the police and military held back, out of sight, and the meeting passed without violence. The next evening's meeting at Trafalgar Square was chaired by Leno and was also peaceful.  A Second English Civil War  Gustave Paul Cluseret fled Ireland and arrived in London just after the Reform League's Hyde Park demonstration in 1867. He met a dozen members of the Reform League, including John Bedford Leno, in a private room of the \\"White Horse\\" in Rathbone Place. He proposed that they create civil war in England and offered the service of two thousand sworn members of the Fenian body, and that he would act as their leader. John Bedford Leno was the first to reply and denounced the proposal, stating that it would surely lead to their \\"discomfiture and transportation\\", and added that the government would surely hear of the plot. During subsequent speeches Leno noticed that only a matchboard partition divided the room they occupied, with another adjoining room, and that voices could be heard on the other side. Leno declared his intention to leave at once, the others agreed, and the room was soon cleared. The next day the meeting was fully reported in The Times, although Leno's speech had been attributed to George Odger, who had in fact supported Cluseret's proposal. Leno concluded that there had been a leak and that the traitor had been none other than Robert Hartwell, the editor of The Bee-Hive journal. John Bedford Leno was fully satisfied with the success of the Reform League and, being opposed to unnecessary violence, bitterly opposed the interference of Cluseret, as did most of the other members of the Reform League. Cluseret's \\"call to arms\\" was rejected and he left England for Paris to start his War of the Commune.  Working class Liberal  In 1868 John Bedford Leno and William Worley helped Gladstone and the Liberal party assess which boroughs would have strong support for working class Liberal candidates. They visited thirty-three boroughs in all. The Liberal Whip thanked them in a letter stating that \\"none had gauged events with equal accuracy\\". At the time of the General Election Leno was rewarded by being chosen as the parliamentary agent of the former secretary of the Reform League, George Howell, in the Aylesbury division. Unfortunately, they were faced by millionaire bankers, John Abel Smith and Lionel de Rothschild, who could afford to transport all of their voters to the poll, and Howell lost by two hundred votes. John Bedford Leno also strove hard for the abolition of liability of the goods of poor tenants for rent, for limited liability with regard to investments, for the spread of education, for the abolition of drunkenness, although he was not an abstainer, and rushed to the assistance of Joseph Arch in his support for the agricultural labourer in 1872. He thought there was justice underlying Socialism, but felt that it was coming piecemeal and that its advocates were too eager. Whenever it was thought advisable to send deputations on questions affecting the working classes he was generally chosen, and so would meet with Palmerston, Disraeli, Derby and Gladstone. He was intimate with almost all of the working class leaders of the day and stood in the foremost rank of those selected as future working class members of the British House of Commons, although he never took up this post.  Publishing  Throughout his adult life Leno published a wide variety of literature. As well as political matter he published trade journals (his handbook of shoemaking became the definitive cobblers book for the next seventy years), newspapers (he set up the first newspaper in Westminster) and non-fiction books such as The History of Temple Bar. It was for his poems and songs, however, that he was best known, and was most proud of. He reminisced that Ernest Jones had once said to him \\"Do you think, Leno, that a writer of lyrics could ever acquire a big reputation?\\". Leno's \\"Song of the Spade\\" was published in most European languages, to at least four different tunes, in Europe and America, and was proclaimed by the Athenaeum as \\"being one of the best songs we possess\\", as well as giving him the title of the \\"Burns of Labour\\". His admirers included Gladstone, Thornton Hunt and William Morris amongst others.  Demise  In his sixties his health slowly declined, including his voice which he had used to such a great effect in singing and oration. He suffered from gout, which sometimes limited his mobility. His eldest son died in 1882, followed by his wife Sarah (née. Thrift) in 1886 and then his eldest daughter. He wrote an autobiography which was published with a collection of his poems in 1892 and was called The Aftermath with Autobiography of the Author. In late 1892 he was incapacitated from work by paralysis and received financial support from William Randal Cremer M.P., William Bowen Rowlands and several other members of Parliament. In 1893 he was granted a gratuity of £50 from the Royal Bounty by Prime Minister Gladstone.The Times, Tues, 21 November 1893. pg10 issue 34114 col B He spent the last two years of his life in Windsor St, Uxbridge where he died on 31 October 1894, aged 68. He was buried at Hillingdon parish church and was survived by one son and three daughters.  Songs  \\"Mr. Leno is a working man to the backbone.

The Abbenrode manor, possibly named after a first settler called Abbo, arose in the medieval Duchy of Saxony and was first mentioned as Abbenrot in an 1129 deed issued by King Lothair III of Germany. About 1145 Bishop Rudolf of Halberstadt established a monastery of Benedictine nuns here. His foundation received the confirmation by Pope Eugene III in 1148. The abbey was devastated during the 1525 German Peasants' War and finally dissolved under the rule of the Protestant Halberstadt administrator Sigismund of Brandenburg in 1554. The present-day parish church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, was consecrated in 1575. After World War II the village became isolated and decayed owing to its location close to the inner-German border.

The type species of the genus Berberosaurus is B. liassicus, in reference to the Lias epoch. Berberosaurus might be the oldest known ceratosaur, and is based on partial postcranial remains. Classification Ronan Allain and colleagues, who described Berberosaurus, performed a phylogenetic analysis and found their new genus to be the most basal known abelisauroid, more derived than Elaphrosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Spinostropheus, but less so than Xenotarsosaurus and abelisaurians. Berberosaurus is distinguished from other theropods by anatomical details found in its vertebrae, metacarpals, and hindlimb bones. Its assignment as an abelisauroid pushes back the record of this group and shows that it had diversified by the Early Jurassic. However, Carrano and Sampson (2008) found it to be a basal ceratosaur outside Neoceratosauria instead.Carrano & Sampson, 2008. The phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda). Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 6, 183-236. Subsequently, the analysis of Xu et al. (2009) recovered it as a dilophosaurid in unresolved polytomy with Dilophosaurus wetherilli, \\"Dilophosaurus\\" sinensis, Dracovenator and Cryolophosaurus. The phylogenetic analysis performed by Ezcurra, Agnolin and Novas (2010) recovered Berberosaurus in unresolved polytomy with Ceratosaurus and Abelisauroidea, while the 2018 description of the basal ceratosaur Saltriovenator places Berberosaurus as the sister taxon to that genus.https://peerj.com/articles/5976/ Discovery and history The remains of Berberosaurus were discovered during a series of expeditions to the High Atlas beginning in the early 2000s. It is based on an associated partial postcranial skeleton of a subadult individual cataloged in the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle de Marrakech; bones from this skeleton include a neck vertebra, part of the sacrum, a metacarpal, a femur, and parts of a tibia and both fibulae. Part of another femur has been assigned to the genus as well. Its remains were found in bone beds in mudflow deposits. Later tectonic activity has affected the bones. Paleoecology and paleobiology Berberosaurus, like other ceratosaurians, was a bipedal carnivore. It was of moderate size; its estimated femur length of is comparable to femur lengths given by Gregory S. Paul for animals like Elaphrosaurus () and Dilophosaurus ().Paul, Gregory S. (1988). Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. 268. Its remains were found with those of the early sauropod Tazoudasaurus. Also from the Early Jurassic of the High Atlas, but from another formation, are the fossils of another, smaller theropod (currently in preparation). It's been estimated to be 5.1 meters (16.7 ft) long and 220 kg (485 lbs) in weight.

Braunvieh cow on high pasture in the Engadin (2007) Almabtrieb, Kufstein (2005) bringing livestock to summer pasture, Schwägalp (Jun 2004) Alpine transhumance is transhumance as practiced in the Alps, that is, a seasonal droving of grazing livestock between the valleys in winter and the high mountain pastures in summer (German ' from the term for \\"seasonal mountain pasture\\", '). Transhumance is a traditional practice that has shaped much of the landscape in the Alps, as without it, most areas below would be forests. While tourism and industry contribute today much to Alpine economy, seasonal migration to high pastures is still practiced in Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia, Italy and Switzerland, except in their most frequented tourist centers. In some places, cattle are taken care of by local farmer families who move to higher places. In others, this job is for herdsmen who are employees of the cooperative owning the pastures.Lauber S., Herzog F., Seidl I., Böni R., Bürgi M., Gmür P., Hofer G., Mann S., Raaflaub M., Schick M., Schneider M., Wunderli R. (eds.) (2013) Zukunft der Schweizer Alpwirtschaft. Fakten, Analysen und Denkanstösse aus dem Forschungsprogramm AlpFUTUR. Birmensdorf, Eidg. Forschungsanstalt WSL; Zürich-Reckenholz, Forschungsanstalt Agroscope. 200 S. (in German, French and Italian, see www.alpfutur.ch) Most Alpine pastures are below ; all are below .The alp of Bréona (Evolène, Valais) is among the highest, with buildings at 2,435 m (Remointse de Bréona) and pastures reaching as high as 2,800 m. The higher regions not suitable for transhumance are known as the High Alps.  Etymology  The German word Alp or Alm (meaning \\"seasonal mountain pasture\\", from Old High German alpa, alba) is originally identical to the name of the Alps (German Alpen) itself, probably a pre-Roman (and possibly pre-Indo-European) term for \\"mountain\\". Alp, Alb, Alm (feminine); see Wolfgang Pfeifer (ed.) Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Deutschen (1995, 7th ed. 2004, s.v. \\"Alp\\") and Schweizerisches Idiotikon I.193. The word was etymologized as meaning \\"white\\" (PIE *albh-, Latin albus) from an early time (at least since the Roman era), and it is impossible to say for certain whether this is the true etymology, of whether the word has an unrelated pre-Roman or even pre-Celtic origin. Friedrich von Tschudi, Landwirthschaftliches Lesebuch für die Schweizerische Jugend (1863, cited in Idiotikon) states explicitly that Alpen in dialectal usage does not refer to the mountain ranges as a whole, but exclusively to the high pastures, while \\"people are completely indifferent towards the barren parts of the high mountains ([which they refer to as] the 'wild' [as opposed to 'tame', zam] mountain)\\" ([das Volk] ist gegen die unwirtlichen Teile des Hochgebirges (den 'wilden' Berg) vollkommen gleichgültig). The variant form Alm develops in the late 15th century out of the oblique cases alben. Duden now treats Alm as the unmarked Standard German form, while the more conservative Alp is marked as \\"rural, especially Swiss and West-Austrian\\". Variant forms of the word, such as alpe, arpe, arpette, aulp, etc. are found in toponymy. In French, the corresponding word for \\"alpine pasture\\" is alpage. History Evidence survives of a transhumance economy in the Alps dating to the later Neolithic period (c. 3000 BCE). discussed \\"...mixed farming, mobile stock keeping, and dairying\\" (emphasis added) around 3500–2500 BCE with evidence for pastures above the treeline reported for the Bronze Age (17th to 11th centuries BCE) in the Northern Limestone Alps. Franz Mandl, Almen und Salz, Hallstatts bronzezeitliche Dachsteinalmen (Zwischenbericht), 1 February 2007. Calibrated C-14 dates (between 1030 BCE and 1685 BCE) for remnants of wooden shelters in the Dachsteingebirge at elevations between 1,600 m and 2,070 m. The transhumance system in the Alps has remained virtually unchanged since at least the High Middle Ages, with a document referring to a summer pasture from 1204.Barker 114 Along the edge of the Alps, starting around 1300 in west and central Switzerland and a little later in eastern Switzerland, cattle production became the primary agricultural activity. A number of specialized cattle markets grew up in Arona, Bellinzona, Como and Varese in the south and Villeneuve in the west. In these communities on the edge of the Alps, transhumance included both the vertical movement of cattle to the alpine pastures as well as horizontal movement to the cattle markets. In the communities located in the central Alps, the herds were more diverse. Generally there were large herds of sheep with much smaller cattle herds and other animals such as pigs and goats.Barker 115 While the inhabitants of the Alps had practised transhumance for thousands of years, during the Late Middle Ages it became increasingly important as the population decreased following the Black Death and the wars of this era. Cattle production was much less manpower-intensive than farming, which was ideal with the reduced population. However, cattle production is much more capital- and especially land-intensive. Cattle production became an investment opportunity for monasteries and citizens of nearby cities. The investors would purchase the cattle and then rent the beasts out to small farmers or to herders for the summer. The smaller alpine communities generally did not want \\"foreign\\" cattle pastured in their alpine pastures, which led to conflicts between the alpine farming communities and the neighboring cities and monasteries. Conflicts over grazing rights and ownership of the alpine meadows led to several wars within what is now Switzerland, including the pivotal Battle of Morgarten (1315), which started due to a long-simmering feud between Schwyz and Einsiedeln Abbey. In 2011, the UNESCO declared Alpine transhumance in the Bregenz Forest as intangible cultural heritage. Agriculture near the Alps In the valleys along the edge of the Alps, cattle production with associated transhumance was generally the rule. However, in the inner alpine valleys the climate was drier which allowed farming even at higher elevations. These areas tended to be mixed between farming and animal husbandry, with the animals being kept mainly for fertilizer and plowing rather than food. However, in both regions the yearly movement was generally similar. Throughout the year, most of the population of the village remained on the valley floor and farmed the surrounding land for grains and hay. In the spring the herdsmen took the animals up to the middle pastures on the mountain slopes. In the summer, pigs were left in the middle pastures while the rest of the animals were moved to the high alpine pasture. At the end of September the animals were moved back to the lower pastures and cattle were stabled in the following month. Sheep and goats were stabled in December, unless the winter was mild, then they remained at the middle pastures with the pigs. In the regions where breeding dominated, the farms were relatively large and isolated from each other. Where both breeding and farming were mixed, the plots were generally smaller and common fields were shared between the community. During the Middle Ages many fields were converted into meadows, because of the prevalence of the breeding. In the north the fields were rotated without a fallow period. They were cultivated for 2 to 5 years, then used as a meadow (and fertilized by the animals) for 3 to 10 years before going back under cultivation. However, in the mountain valleys, the fields near the communities were cultivated every year (sometimes producing two crops a year in Ticino) while the outer fields and alpine pastures were more often allowed to lie fallow or used as a meadow. Culture and folklore Some people spent the winters isolated in the high pastures. In Johanna Spyri's novel Heidi, the \\"Alp-Öhi\\"\\" (\\"high-pasture grandfather\\") is such a person, despising and despised by the villagers. Transhumance contributes a great deal to traditional Alpine culture, such as Yodel, Alphorn or Schwingen. Swiss folklore also records many traditional tales about mythological creatures such as dwarves (Barbegazi, etc.) inhabiting the Alpine pastures, either helpful or causing mischief; in particular, this is to punish the cruelty or discourtesy of a bad Senn. In many cases, the stories tell about curses on specific Alps, appearances of the devil or spirits of earlier Sennen, etc. Statistics In 1997, Austria had over 12,000 sites where 70,000 farmers took care of about 500,000 cattle. Alpine pastures amount to a quarter of the farmland. Bavaria had 1,384 sites hosting 48,000 cattle, about half of them in Upper Bavaria and the other half in the Allgäu. In Switzerland, about 380,000 cattle including 130,000 milk cows as well as 200,000 sheep are in summer on high pastures. Milk from cows here is usually made into local cheese specialities, handmade using traditional methods and tools. Alpine pastures amount to 35 percent of Swiss farmland and 13 percent of the entire country.Swiss Federal Statistics Office accessed 2 April 2009 The total population of mountain farmers has decreased to about 43,000 (in 1980) from 160,000 (in 1910). The farmers that are involved in mountain farming only make up about 15% of the total farming population in Switzerland.  Cheese production  Bergkäse Alpine transhumance has a strong impact on the production of cheese in the Alps. It ensures that cows, sheep and goats produce high-quality aromatic milk, the so- called Heumilch (\\"hay milk\\"), based on their special diet of natural meadow grasses. The use of hay milk in cheese production contributes to the distinctive flavour that determines more than 30 Alpine cheeses, including Alpkäse, Bergkäse and Sura Kees. The chief shepherd in charge of the Alp and responsible for the cheese production is known as the Senn. The Käsestraße Bregenzerwald (Bregenz Forest cheese trail) in Vorarlberg is an association of farmers which aims at contributing to the maintenance of small-scale agriculture and the diversity of local products in the Bregenz Forest. Members of the association include dairymen who will inform tourists about artisan cheese production.

S. Stanley, who won critical acclaim for his debut in April Madhathil, collaborated with Dhanush, who had given back-to-back hits in Kadhal Kondein and Thiruda Thirudi to make a film. Actress Sridevi Vijaykumar was initially approached to play the leading female role but was not available. Aparna Pillai won the Miss Chennai contest as a student and was sent to other pageants including the Miss Petite International contest in the United States. The director Stanley saw an article which appeared in The Hindu about her trip to the USA and asked her to come for a make-up test, before selecting her to play the female lead in the film. Pudhukottaiyilirundhu Saravanan was the first Tamil film after MGR's 1973 Tamil film Ulagam Sutrum Valiban to have scenes shot in Thailand. The film was shot also in Singapore, Malaysia and Pulicat in the Thiruvallur District of India. The musical scene with Tharika was shot on a large set, complete with waterfalls and a pond erected by art director Santhanam at the Prasad Studios, and took about five days to shoot. The film was sold to distributors for Rs 11 crore, showing the actor's high market value at the box office. Release Theatrical rights for Tamil Nadu was sold for a record 11 crore helped by previous Dhanush hits.Pudhukottaiyilirundhu Saravanan fecthed 11 crore in TN rights But the film attracted poor reviews with a critic from The Hindu noting that \\"Story wise there's nothing much. All the same there are no boring villains or a contrived climax. Intended to be a light film, it stays that way till the end, but the director could have given a thought to the plausibility angle.\\" Dhanush's fight scene was well received. After this film Dhanush was referred to as the Indian Bruce Lee. Aparna, who made her debut in this film, was also praised. The romance was considered sweet and believable. The climax was praised for being short and effective. The film was later dubbed and released as Sourya in Telugu. Post-release it was caught in controversy when a song, to which the lyrics had been censored, was shown uncut. Dhanush claims that he is not to blame for these controversies. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film, composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and released on 4 December 2003, features six tracks and was hailed as the highlight of the film. Yuvan Shankar Raja himself sang two songs and hero Dhanush sang the song 'Naatu Sarakku', debuting as a playback singer as well. Lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay, Thamarai, Snehan and Na. Muthukumar. Pudhu Kaadhal and Malargale are melodious while Baby Baby is catchy with its lyrics transitioning smoothly from English to Tamil.

He appeared in almost 70 films, primarily in Hong Kong action cinema, including roles in the films of martial arts stars including Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. He often played villains or supporting roles. He retired from the Hong Kong film industry in 1996. History Born in Chao'an County, Guangdong, James Tien-chun moved with his family to Hong Kong in 1958. He became a student of the Fu Sheng Opera School in Taipei, Taiwan, along with Angela Mao and Philip Kwok. His acting career began in the late 1960s, when he joined Shaw Brothers Studio. His first significant acting role was in the 1969 film Raw Courage, directed by Lo Wei. After appearing in a number of further Shaw Brothers films, he moved to Golden Harvest, where he played Bruce Lee's cousin in The Big Boss (1971). This was followed by a role in Lee's next film, Fist of Fury. He was originally intended to co-star in Game of Death, but his role was reduced after Bruce Lee's death in 1973. In 1976, Tien starred in John Woo's Hand of Death, a film that also featured early acting roles for the \\"Three Brothers\\", Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao. A year later, he appeared in Hung's directorial debut, The Iron-Fisted Monk. From there, he went on to take roles in many more of the three brothers' films for Golden Harvest, often playing bullies or villains. He played roles alongside Jackie Chan in Spiritual Kung Fu (1978), The Fearless Hyena (1979) and Dragon Fist (1979). Appearances with Yuen Biao include The Prodigal Son (1982), Rosa (1986) and Righting Wrongs (1986), and he appeared in Sammo Hung films such as Millionaire's Express (1986) Eastern Condors (1986) and The Gambling Ghost (1991). Tien also had roles in most of the handful of films that starred all three together, including Winners and Sinners (1983), My Lucky Stars (1985) and Dragons Forever (1988). Late in his career, he appeared with Andy Lau in Lee Rock and Lee Rock II (both 1991). His last acting role to date was in the final Lucky Stars film, How to Meet the Lucky Stars (1996), after which he retired.

Primarily this concerns the amount of capital that EU insurance companies must hold to reduce the risk of insolvency. Following an EU Parliament vote on the Omnibus II Directive on 11 March 2014, Solvency II came into effect on 1 January 2016. This date had been previously pushed back many times. Aims EU insurance legislation aims to unify a single EU insurance market and enhance consumer protection. The third- generation Insurance Directives established an \\"EU passport\\" (single licence) for insurers to operate in all member states if they fulfilled EU conditions. Many member states concluded the EU minima were not enough, and took up their own reforms, which still led to differing regulations, hampering the goal of a single market. Political Implications of Solvency II A number of the large Life Insurers in the UK are unhappy with the way the legislation has been developed. In particular, concerns have been publicly expressed over a number of years by the CEO of Prudential, the UK's largest Life Insurance company. Doubts about the basis of the Solvency II legislation, in particular the enforcement of a market-consistent valuation approach have also been expressed by American subsidiaries of UK parents - the impact of the 'equivalency' requirements are not well understood and there is some concern that the legislation could lead to overseas subsidiaries becoming uncompetitive with local peers, resulting in the need to sell them off, potentially resulting in a 'Fortress Europe'. Background Since Directive 73/239/EEC was introduced in 1973, more elaborate risk management systems developed. Solvency II reflects new risk management practices to define required capital and manage risk. While the \\"Solvency I\\" Directive was aimed at revising and updating the current EU Solvency regime, Solvency II has a much wider scope. A solvency capital requirement may have the following purposes: * To reduce the risk that an insurer would be unable to meet claims; * To reduce the losses suffered by policyholders in the event that a firm is unable to meet all claims fully; * To provide early warning to supervisors so that they can intervene promptly if capital falls below the required level; and * To promote confidence in the financial stability of the insurance sector Often called \\"Basel for insurers,\\" Solvency II is somewhat similar to the banking regulations of Basel II. For example, the proposed Solvency II framework has three main areas (pillars): * Pillar 1 consists of the quantitative requirements (for example, the amount of capital an insurer should hold). * Pillar 2 sets out requirements for the governance and risk management of insurers, as well as for the effective supervision of insurers. * Pillar 3 focuses on disclosure and transparency requirements. Contents ;Title I General rules on the taking-up and pursuit of direct insurance and reinsurance activities *Chapter I Subject matter, scope and definitions *Chapter II Taking-up of business *Chapter III Supervisory authorities and general rules *Chapter IV Conditions governing business *Chapter V Pursuit of life and non-life insurance activity *Chapter VI Rules relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities, technical provisions, own funds, solvency capital requirement, minimum capital requirement and investment rules *Chapter VII Insurance and reinsurance undertakings in difficulty or in an irregular situation *Chapter VIII Right of establishment and freedom to provide services *Chapter IX Branches established within the community and belonging to insurance or reinsurance undertakings with head offices situated outside the community *Chapter X Subsidiaries of insurance and reinsurance undertakings governed by the laws of a third country and acquisitions of holdings by such undertakings ;Title II Specific provisions for insurance and reinsurance ;Title III Supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings in a group ;Title IV Reorganisation and winding- up of insurance undertakings Pillar 1 The pillar 1 framework set out qualitative and quantitative requirements for calculation of technical provisions and Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) using either a standard formula given by the regulators or an internal model developed by the (re)insurance company. Technical provisions comprise two components: the best estimate of the liabilities (i.e. the central actuarial estimate) plus a risk margin. Technical provisions are intended to represent the current amount the (re)insurance company would have to pay for an immediate transfer of its obligations to a third party. The SCR is the capital required to ensure that the (re)insurance company will be able to meet its obligations over the next 12 months with a probability of at least 99.5%. In addition to the SCR capital a Minimum capital requirement (MCR) must be calculated which represents the threshold below which the national supervisor (regulator) would intervene. The MCR is intended to correspond to an 85% probability of adequacy over a one- year period and is bounded between 25% and 45% of the SCR. For supervisory purposes, the SCR and MCR can be regarded as \\"soft\\" and \\"hard\\" floors respectively. That is, a regulatory ladder of intervention applies once the capital holding of the (re)insurance undertaking falls below the SCR, with the intervention becoming progressively more intense as the capital holding approaches the MCR. The Solvency II Directive provides regional supervisors with a number of discretions to address breaches of the MCR, including the withdrawal of authorisation from selling new business and the winding up of the company. Criticisms Think-tanks such as the World Pensions & Investments Forum have argued that European legislators pushed dogmatically and naïvely for the adoption of the Basel II and Solvency II recommendations. In essence, they forced private banks, central banks, insurance companies and their regulators to rely more on assessments of credit risk by private rating agencies. Thus, part of the public regulatory authority was abdicated in favor of private rating agencies.M. Nicolas J. Firzli, \\"A Critique of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\\" Revue Analyse Financière, Nov. 10 2011 & Q2 2012 The calibration of the standard formula for assessing equity risk has been strongly criticized by the German economist Stefan Mittnik for the fact that the procedure used for determining correlations between different asset classes gives rise to spurious (i.e., unreliable) correlations or spurious relationships.Stefan Mittnik: \\"Solvency II Calibrations: Where Curiosity Meets Spuriosity\\" Working Paper Number 04, 2011, Center for Quantitative Risk Analysis (CEQURA), Department of Statistics, University of Munich, The demanding nature of Solvency II legislation compared to current regulations has attracted criticism. According to RIMES, complying with the new legislation will impose a complex and significant burden on many European financial organizations, with 75% of firms in 2011 reporting that they were not in a position to comply with Pillar III reporting requirements. The Matching adjustment mechanism of Solvency II has also been criticised as a form of creative accounting that hides the real value of liabilities.Danielsson, J., R. Laeven, E. Perotti, M. Wüthrich, R. Ayadi and A. Pelsser (2012) \\"Countercyclical Regulation in Solvency II: Merits and Flaws.”VoxEU, 23 June. https://voxeu.org/article/countercyclical-regulation- solvency-ii-merits-and-flaws Solvency II was also criticized for its impact on the emerging markets in which a lack of access to banking credit and to financial services shall display relevant effects on the economic growth of the local systems, e.g. precluding to the agrarian farms the possibility to migrate from a subsistence and extensive agricolture into an intensive and market-oriented one. On the contrary, the financial instability of a undercapitalized loaner could have a very low likelihood to generate global and systemic impacts, due to the limited presence of credit institutes too big to fail in the Third World countries' economies.

The history - SLV and T30 SLV camera (1982). The production of the Silvestri cameras started in Florence, Italy, at the beginning of the eighties by the work of Vincenzo Silvestri who designed and developed the original project. The intents were that of providing the photographers of architecture, indoor and outdoor, with a wide angle camera extremely compact and light-weight, compared to the large view cameras produced in that period, and with the essential movements for the perspective correction. The first camera, the SLV, was born with the 6X7 / 6X9 format, with a rotating back with click stop each 90 degrees and the lens, a Super Angulon 5,6/47 mm in focusing helical mount by Schneider, was not interchangeable. The shift mechanism permitted a total rise or fall of 25 mm, it consisted in a control knob and two counter posed screws right/left and allowed a precise setting and locking of the shift. The attachment of the roll film back was Graflex compatible that opened the system to the application of various backs like Mamiya, Horseman, Wista, etc. The image viewing and the focusing were made on the round glass by mean of a magnifying lens in a leather bellows. The whole camera structure was made in anodized aluminium worked with CNC machineries, ensuring constructive exactness and reliability. From a conceptual point of view the SLV camera allowed to shift in any direction by simply placing and levelling the back horizontally or vertically and by orienting the camera body leaning it to the right or left, or upwards or up side down. Some samples of this first model were made in an almost handcraft way but meeting a good interest among the specialized photographers, Silvestri was pushed to develop a new and improved model of SLV. This second model had a bayonet for attaching the lenses and an interchangeable system for the backs. This gave the SLV a major extension and flexibility and the range of lenses grew to 3 Schneider Schneider lenses: Super Angulon 5,6/65 mm, Super Angulon 5,6/75 mm and Symmar 5,6/100 mm, beside the Super Angulon 5,6/47 mm, all lenses had a bayonet attachment and a focusing helical mount. The interchangeable backs allowed to insert the extension rings to compensate the difference in focal distance among the various lenses. The 4 points of 8° attachment, quick and precise to use, also accepted backs of different formats like the 6x12cm and the 4x5”. These modifications opened to the SLV new fields of application and attracted other photographers from Italy and abroad. The SLV will be substituted by the T30 camera in 1997, The T30, having 30 mm of shift movement, was more suitable to the new lenses with lager image circle that were introduced on the market in that period. The T30 is still in production. A further step towards the flexibility of use consists in the design and production of the shiftable viewfinder with interchangeable frames. The viewfinder is extremely useful for quick works and in difficult work situations compared to viewing the image on the ground glass. Mod.H New concept camera that renews the characteristics of the SLV, using most of its accessories, has the shiftable viewfinder embodied which coupled to the shift movement gives operative easiness and simplicity of use. The lens-format frames are interchangeable, starting from the Schneider series the including the Rodenstock one too. The camera is now out of production. S4 The S4 camera was designed later to answer the need of full coverage of the 4x5 inches format, where the SLV camera could not give enough versatility with this format. Standard 4x5 inches back with format adapters for 6x9 and 6x12, interchangeable backs with short rotation attachment 8° and bayonet attachment or interchangeable lens boards for the lenses. Large in dimension, it is later on provided with a front bellows (Flexibellow) that performs the lens focusing, tilting and swinging. With this accessory the lenses can be used without focusing mount and permitted the focus extension on the two orthogonal axis by using the lens tilting and swinging. The S4 camera is still in production. Bicam With the arrival of digital photography and considering that it would substitute le film in a short time, Silvestri began to study a camera able to face the double need of working with film but at the same time can be converted back to digital applications. There were two possible solutions, the scan backs or the matrix ones. The choice selected the matrix backs, creating a compact, easy to carry, proportioned to the small size of the high resolution sensors. Two series of Rodenstock and Schneider lenses, from the 23 mm to the long focal ones, specifically designed for high resolution digital photography are its range of lenses. The Bicam introduced in the late nineties was added with new accessories and components so to follow the continuous evolution of the sensors’ technology. Its main characteristics are the possibility to work with lenses mounted in helical focusing mount and bayonet, or with a bellows system which add to the camera all the necessary correction movements typical of view cameras; side shift, rise and fall, tilt and swing; all movements are extremely precise and micrometric. The reversible and interchangeable backs have a large range of accessories, from the sliding adapters with viewing screen and drop-in plates to interface the most popular digital backs: Hasselblad V, Hasselblad H, Mamiya 645, Contax 645, Rollei AFI. S5 Micron S5 micron camera with sliding back adapter for high resolution digital backs (2006). Classical view camera. Designed for studio photography, it has full micrometric movements. All the parts related to lenses and backs are interchangeable. The lenses are on board or on bayonet, le lens boards are flat or recessed, the lenses have no need of helical focusing mount. The backs and their accessories are in common with the Bicam system. The bellows is interchangeable. The peculiarity of the S5 micron is to be built on two separate shifting blocks that do not interfere between them allowing the two standards to get to touching. This characteristic make it possible to use extreme wide angle lenses and to perform adjustment movements otherwise impossible. The S5 camera was published in the ADI Index 2005 for the industrial design award the Compasso d'oro. Flexicam Award winner for the best project at the Premio Vespucci 2008. This camera was conceived for on location works, light weight (less than 1 kg.) and with absolute precision for the use of high resolution digital backs. It offers the flexibility of a mini view camera having the same essential correction movements. Rise and fall, rail extension with the micrometric movement of the focus, tilt and swing.

Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the Nordharz municipality. Geography View from the Harz mountains It is located at the northern foot of the Harz mountain range and Harz National Park, about north of the town of Ilsenburg. The small Ecker river in the west, a tributary of the Oker, forms the border with the town of Bad Harzburg in Lower Saxony. The settlement has access to the Bundesstraße 6 federal highway running from the Bundesautobahn 395 near Goslar to Halle and the Bundesautobahn 14. Stapelburg station is served by the Vienenburg-Halberstadt railway line.  History  Stapelburg Castle was first mentioned in a 1306 deed as a property of the Counts of Wernigerode; it was meant to protect and control the trade route to the Imperial City of Goslar near the border with the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Prior to that an Imperial castle, mentioned as Ahlsburg in the 14th century, was erected a few kilometres south-southwest in the Harz mountains on a spur high above the Ecker valley. The Stapelburg estates passed to the Prince-Bishops of Halberstadt in 1394 and were temporarily given in pawn to the Counts of Stolberg. The settlement emerged in the second half of the 16th century from the outlying estate (Vorwerk) of Bilenshausen or Bilashausen, that had been established by the former Halberstadt councillor Heinrich von Bila (1535–1584) at the foot of medieval castle. After lengthy negotiations, castle and village were finally purchased by Count Christian Ernest of Stolberg-Wernigerode in 1722. Reconstructed Jungborn pavillon The meadows in the Ecker valley south of the village were the site of the Jungborn destination spa, founded in 1896 by Adolf Just, which hosted notable guests like Franz Kafka in July 1912. As the Ecker formed part of the inner German border after World War II, the facility was closed and finally demolished in 1964 to make space for border fortifications.

It did not have much commercial success, reaching No. 50 on the Billboard Top Black Albums chart. Despite that, it has had a very good evaluation by critics since its publication and it is considered one of the best and most important rap albums, both in the 1980s and in history. In 1998, the album was listed in The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums. The album is broken down track-by-track by MC Lyte in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique.Coleman, Brian. Check The Technique: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007. Overview In 1987, at the age of 16, Lyte released her debut single, \\"I Cram to Understand U (Sam)\\", about drug addiction and its impact on relationships, being one of the first songs written for the crack era. As she has stated, she was 12 years old at the time of writing. In September 1988, a couple of weeks before she turned 18, released his first album, Lyte as a Rock. In addition to being one of the first female rap LPs (previously only some groups like Salt- N-Pepa and J. J. Fad had published), it would be the first full album of a female rapper as a solo artist. As stated in an interview for Okayplayer, all the lyrics on the album are from a rhyming book that she has written over the course of several years. Most of the songs had the contribution in the composition and production of the rap duo Audio Two (who were also very close to Lyte since childhood) and King of Chill. The track \\"Mc Lyte Likes Swingin\\" had Prince Paul of Stetsasonic in production, who later gained much recognition for his work in De La Soul's debut album 3 Feet High and Rising. Reception and influence At the time of publication, The New York Times rated an \\"I Cram to Understand U (Sam)\\" as one of the best 12-inch singles of the year, noting \\"Unlike the dozens of raps that are simply comic put-downs, Ms Lyte's plaintive tone and her self-deprecating story add up to a complex emotional statement.\\" Regarding the album \\"Lyte as a Rock\\", Robert Christgau from Village Voice has commented \\"Unlike so many of her femme-metal counterparts, she knows how to talk tough without yielding to the stupid temptations of macho.\\" but also criticized the producers as \\"chill too close to the max as she attempts to carry the music with her rap.\\", and following the album's release, that year Village Voice would also call Lyte \\"hip-hop's best female vocalist.\\" For his part, Ken Tucker from The Philadelphia Inquirer would give a rating of 4/4. =Retrospect= Rob Theakston of AllMusic reviews \\"(...) Lyte as a Rock has aged better than most records that came out during hip-hop's formative years, although at certain moments it has become dated since its release. But what has aged is more than compensated by the classic tunes and the disc's potent historical impact on a generation of women MCs. A classic.\\" PopMatters' Mark Anthony Neal called the album \\"one of the most underrated debuts in hip-hop history\\". In December 2016 Gino Sorcinelli from Medium would comment: = Accolades = In 1998, \\"Lyte as a Rock\\" would be listed in The Source's \\"100 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list. In 1999 hip hop magazine Ego Trip ranked the album 12th on their list \\"Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of 1988\\". This year they also released \\"Hip-Hop’s Greatest Singles By Year\\", in which \\"I Cram to Understand U (Sam)\\" was on the 1987 list while \\"10% Dis\\" and Paper Thin on the 1988 list. In February 2008, Rolling Stone included \\"Lyte as a Rock\\" along with other albums such as N.W.A's debut album Straight Outta Compton and Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back on their list of the best albums of 1988, which considered \\"Rap's greatest year\\". In August 2013 was included 3rd on NME's \\"25 Albums That Changed Hip- Hop Forever\\" list. In October 2017 the album was ranked 30th on Complex magazine's \\"Best Rap Albums of the 80s\\" list, which Michael Gonzales commented \\"MC Lyte emerged from the depths of Brooklyn caring more about her rhyme skills than her make-up.(...)

(Photo ca 1899.) The Barbour County Courthouse in Philippi, Barbour County, West Virginia, USA is a monumental public building constructed between 1903 and 1905 in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. It dominates the town center and is the county's chief symbol of government. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History =Original courthouse= The original Barbour County Courthouse, a wood-frame Greek Revival structure, was built in 1844–46. From its octagonal cupola, in 1861, floated the first Confederate flag in what would become the state of West Virginia. Later, the building was used to house Union troops during the American Civil War. =Present courthouse= J. Charles Fulton of Uniontown, Pennsylvania was contracted in 1901 and designed the present courthouse building in the Richardsonian Romanesque (Romanesque Revival) style. It was constructed by contractor J.P. Conn during 1903–1905. The 1905 structure was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. A restoration effort began in 1995 and included repair and replacement of the original stained glass interior dome. This project was named \\"Best Interior Rehabilitation Project\\" in 1999 by the Main Street Project of the West Virginia Development Office. Description The Barbour County Courthouse is situated in Court Square, facing Main Street, in Philippi. Its plan is a modified rectangle of solid masonry about 95 feet across the front elevation and 60 feet across the sides. =Exterior= The exterior of the building is constructed of Hummelstown brownstone, a high- quality, medium-grain, dense sandstone quarried near Hummelstown in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. At the time, the stone would have traveled to West Virginia via the Brownstone to Middletown Railroad and the Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad. This stone is dark brown with reddish to purplish hues. The entirety of the exterior ashlar stonework is rusticated with the exception of the smooth voussoirs defining the arcuated portal and window openings and the stringcourses and window sills. The overall impression created is one of mass and dignity. The 2 ½ story structure rests on a raised basement and is dominated by a colossal offset tower to the left of the massive main entrance portal and by smaller, secondary prominences such as steeply pitched wall dormers and an octagonal turret on the corner to the right of the main portal. This massive portal is flanked on its left by a large smooth shaft column with Byzantine capital; the place of its mate on the opposite side is occupied by the heavy main tower. The spandrels of the portal arch are decorated with a delicate, foliate relief pattern. The massive, square tower, which looms asymmetrically to the left of the main portal, encompasses four stories, each delineated by smooth stone stringcourses. Its open belfry, with double, arched openings on each of the four sides, is crowned by a pyramidal roof whose four chamfered corners each terminate at the cornice level in a small spire. A stringcourse just below the cornice carries (just above the chamfered corners of the belfry superstructure) four gargoyle-like, projecting blocks of stone, which may be sculptor's blocks left unfinished. The arched, tripartite window immediately above the main portal is echoed by similar window treatments in the wall dormers and another just to its left. The main window above the portal and the one in the front elevation dormer are adorned with smooth shaft colonnettes. These arched windows, as well as the building's other, flat- headed window openings (also arranged in threes) are embellished with stained- glass transoms and smooth transom bars. Aesthetic merit An authority on the Hummelstown Brownstone Company, which supplied the stone of which the courthouse is constructed, has said: > As impressive as many of the buildings trimmed in [Hummelstown] brownstone > are, nothing can match the magnificence of those structures built primarily > of brownstone. Perhaps the most impressive extant public building built > entirely of Hummelstown brownstone is the Barbour County Courthouse in > Philippi, West Virginia ... Erected in 1903, it remains a testament to the > finest expectations that the public at large at the turn of the century > wanted to see in their municipal architecture. Crowned with a tile roof, the > alternating narrow and wide bands of rock face masonry contrast with the > smooth finish of the arch and its Rococo embellishment.Olena, Ben F., > \\"Brownstone Revisited: The Hummelstown Brownstone Industry\\", In The > Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association, Inc., September > 2003, pg 14.

Born in Logan, Utah, Kimball was signed by the Chicago Cubs in 1934, winning twenty games for their Class C Ponca City, Oklahoma affiliate as a nineteen-year-old. He worked his way up the Cubs chain, eventually being called up late in both the 1937 and 1938 seasons, before Chicago returned him to the minors in 1939. In 1940, the Cubs dealt Kimball to the Brooklyn Dodgers, who used him mainly in relief through 1943.

After three seasons with the PCL Hollywood Stars, Kimball was hired by the Boston Braves in 1947 to manage their new Class D club, the Las Vegas Wranglers. The club finished third in the six-team Sunset League, and Kimball (despite a 14–5 record on the mound and a .361 batting average), was let go as both player and manager at season's end.

The movie was directed by Mario Camerini, who co-wrote the screenplay with writer Franco Brusati. The original choice for director was Georg Wilhelm Pabst but he quit at the last minute.Dino de Laurentiis Obituary The Guardian 11 November 2010 The film's cinematographer Mario Bava co-directed the Polyphemus Cyclops segment (uncredited). In the film Silvana Mangano plays two roles, as Penelope, the faithful wife of Ulysses and the sorceress Circe. American star Kirk Douglas plays the Greek hero, Ulysses. Anthony Quinn plays Antinous. The tremendous success of this film led to the making of Hercules (1957), which was credited with igniting the Italian peplum craze of the 1960s. Plot The palace of Ulysses, king of Ithaca, is beleaguered by a horde of suitors wooing his wife Penelope after his failure to return from the war against the city of Troy. Penelope has promised under pressure to marry one of her many suitors, who under the leadership of Antinous squander her husband's wealth and land. She holds them off by telling them she first wants to finish her tapestry, but she unweaves it every night to stall. Telemachus, the son of Ulysses and Penelope, is sick of the suitors' behavior and decides to search for his father. In the meantime, at the nearby island of Phaeacia, royal princess Nausicaa and her handmaidens find a shipwrecked man washed up on the shore. Due to his ordeal, the stranger has lost his memory, not even remembering his name. He is taken in by Nausicaa's parents, King Alcinous and Queen Arete, and in short time he and Nausicaa fall in love. Just on the day they are scheduled to be married, however, the stranger, longing to remember who he really is, returns to the shore and stares out to the sea. And as he does so, his lost memories begin to stir. Gradually, the stranger remembers that he is Ulysses, who was lost at sea when his ship was blown off course in a storm during his return voyage to Ithaca, as a consequence of his desecrating Neptune's temple during the sacking of Troy. Going ashore on an unknown island to forage for food, they intrude on the cave of the cyclops Polyphemus, who locks them inside and then eats one of Ulysses' men. Upon the giant's complaint about the taste of human flesh, Ulysses suggests for Polyphemus to collect grapes for making wine. After Polyphemus leaves to tend to his herds, Ulysses and his men prepare a stake to blind the cyclops after getting him drunk. The plan succeeds, and after Ulysses has taunted the blinded giant into removing the rock from the cave entrance, the Greeks make their escape. Some time afterwards, Ulysses' ship passes the rock of the sirens. Eager to learn what they sound like, Ulysses has himself tied to the mast while his men plug their ears to resist their enchanting singing, and is tormented when the sirens speak to him with the voices of his family. After passing the rocks, a strange current pulls the ship towards another island. Leaving his men to explore, Uylsses returns to find them all missing, captured and transformed into pigs by the mistress of the island, the sorceress Circe. Circe, who has fallen in love with Ulysses after learning of his heroics, strives to keep him here, but Ulysses forces her to return his men to their original forms. Persuaded by Circe to stay for a while, he stirs resentment in his men, who want to return home. Ignoring Circe's warning that Neptune will strike them down if they leave, they set out to sea on their own and perish in a storm. Blaming Circe for allowing them to die, and determined to return to his family, Ulysses begins building a raft. Circe tries to make him stay and enjoy an eternal life by her side by calling the dead from the underworld, including Ulysses' crew and his lost comrades-in-arms from Troy. But then his recently deceased mother Anticlea appears before him, telling him of Penelope's plight. With his resolve reaffirmed, the embittered Circe lets Ulysses go, daring him to defy Neptune's wrath. With his memory fully returned, Ulysses reveals his identity and sets out for home, breaking Nausicaa's heart. Returning to his palace disguised as a beggar, he meets Penelope, pretending to be an old friend of her husband. Upon witnessing her despair and faithfulness for him, he suggests that she hold a contest to determine the suitor who shall marry her the next day: Stringing Ulysses' hunting bow and fire an arrow through a dozen axe heads. As he turns to leave, he stops to pet his old hunting dog Argos. Telemachus, who has just returned, witnesses this, and he and Ulysses reveal themselves to each other. The next day, Penelope stages the archery contest, with Ulysses attending in his disguise. When the suitors are unable to string the bow, Ulysses taunts them into letting him try and succeeds with his shot, thus revealing his identity. With the assistance of Telemachus and the servants still loyal to him, Ulysses locks down the feast hall and slays all the suitors. After the slaughter is complete, Ulysses reunites with Penelope to rebuild their long-strained bond.

In 1941, while living in the Bronx, Sol Stein wrote his first book, \\"Magic Maestro Please\\", followed shortly by \\"Patriotic Magic\\". He attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he served on the Magpie literary magazine with Richard Avedon and James Baldwin.Lester, Julius. \\"Afterglow; BALDWIN Early Novels and Stories By James Baldwin Edited by Toni Morrison; The Library of America; Volume I: 970 pp., $35; Volume II: 870 pp., $35\\", Los Angeles Times, February 15, 1998.

He graduated in 1942 and, upon the death of his stepfather a year later, moved to Greenwich Village.\\" He graduated in 1942 and enrolled at CCNY, which then provided a free education. Between the time of Stein's enlistment in the Army Air Corps in 1944 and being called to active duty on March 1, 1945, Stein had completed nearly three years of infantry ROTC at CCNY. After qualifying for pilot and bombardier training, a backlog of pilots caused Stein to voluntarily transfer to the infantry. Overseas, he served as an Information & Education officer in the Headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division (United States) in Germany as Commandant of Division Schools, located in three cities, Regensburg, Ansbach, and Triesdorf. On 5 November 1946 Stein was cited by Lt. General Geoffrey Keyes for having organized and commanded the best occupational training schools in the Third Army Area in the American Zone of Germany. Upon returning from Europe in 1946, Stein completed work for his degree at CCNY and simultaneously with his graduation in 1948 was employed at the college as a lecturer in social studies. While teaching, he took his master's degree in English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in 1949 and was accepted for the famed doctoral seminar conducted jointly by Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzun, both of whose writings Stein was to later to edit. Script writer for the Voice of America From 1951 to 1953 Stein was employed by the Voice of America, eventually as senior editor of the Ideological Advisory Staff of the Voice of America. He wrote daily scripts that were translated into 46 languages and broadcast to two million people risking their lives listening behind the Iron Curtain. It was at the Voice that Stein's association with Bertram Wolfe began; Stein was instrumental in causing the re-publication of Wolfe's masterpiece, Three Who Made a Revolution, which had been allowed to go out of print. The book subsequently sold half a million copies in a few years and was adopted in almost all Soviet Studies programs in the U.S. and elsewhere. In 1953 Stein, a centrist, was appointed Executive Director of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, an organization of 300 leading American intellectuals of left and right working together in support of civil liberties“Audience Mail: Letters from VOA Listeners, Readers, & Viewers” The Voice of America.

It was in this period that the eventual publisher supervised the writing and publication of McCarthy and the Communists, which made The New York Times Bestseller List for 13 weeks and was credited with contributing to the unseating of Senator McCarthy. Playwright In 1952 Stein was granted a leave of absence from the Voice of America to accept back-to-back fellowships at Yaddo, an artists’ colony, and the MacDowell Colony.MacDowell Colony, The. “Index.” The MacDowell Colony. Retrieved from on 13 September 2007. At MacDowell, Stein completed his first play, Napoleon, under the watchful eye of Thornton Wilder, a fellow at the same time. The verse drama was produced the following year by the New Dramatists organization at the ANTA Theater in New York and was chosen by the Dramatists Alliance as “the best full length play of 1953”. Stein completed a second play, A Shadow of My Enemy, originally intended as an adaptation of Whittaker Chambers' best-selling memoir, Witness (1952), but, when denied rights, based on public record and published in 1957. The play, whose synopsis runs \\"A senior editor of Time magazine accuses his closest friend of being a Communist\\", was originally commissioned by the Theater Guild and subsequently produced on Broadway by Roger Stevens, Alfred deLiagre Jr., and Hume Cronyn. The cast starred Ed Begley and Gene Raymond. In the early 1950s, Stein and Elia Kazan formed a friendship that was cemented in 1955 when Stein served as the production observer from first reading to opening night of the Tennessee Williams play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama that year. Stein's play A Shadow of My Enemy was produced in 1957 by Roger Stevens, Alfred deLiagre Jr. and Hume Cronyn at the National Theater in Washington and the ANTA theatre on Broadway in New York starring Ed Begley and Gene Raymond. In 1957 Stein was one of 10 founding members of the Playwrights Group at the Actors Studio in New York with William Inge, Tennessee Williams, Lorraine Hansberry, and others. From 1957–1959 Stein served for two and a half years as Managing Editor of the Executive Membership Division of the Research Institute of America. Editor and publisher In 1953 Stein edited and supervised the publication of McCarthy and the Communists by James Rorty and Moshe Decter for the Beacon Press in Boston. Melvin Arnold, director of the Beacon Press appointed Stein as General Editor of Beacon's Contemporary Affairs Series in the book size trade paperback format developed by Stein.

Lee Bailey, among others. Stein and Day was also the American publisher of J. B. Priestley, Eric Partridge, Anthony Sampson, Maxim Gorky, Che Guevara, L. P. Hartley, and George Bernard Shaw. The WritePro Corporation In 1989 Stein founded a software publishing company with his wife Patricia Day Stein and his youngest son, David Day Stein. Together they took their combined knowledge of writing with their son's technical expertise and created software to teach aspiring writers how to write fiction. WritePro® teaches in-depth character creation, how to create plot, suspense and conflict through the interaction of characters and more advanced topics. WritePro® has over 100,000 users in 38 countries and received many accolades in its reviews. After the success of WritePro®, they created two sets of writing tools for professional writers called FictionMaster® and FirstAid for Writers®. Though they were also successful, Stein chose to license the software to another company in 1995. The licenses were taken back in 2010 and the process of updating the programs began in 2011 and The New WritePro was launched in 2012. However, Stein became ill shortly thereafter and work to bring back the professional tools was interrupted. Stein's son David still hopes to bring them back some day with the help of his brother Leland who now co-owns The WritePro Corporation with him. The New WritePro® is still available through writepro.com.

He was the son of a diplomat famous for inventing a letter-copying machine, and the grandson of Count Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg. Early life Adam Neipperg was born in Vienna as a son of Count Leopold von Neipperg and his fourth wife Maria Ludovica Countess Hatzfeld-Wildenburg-Werther. In 1766, the County of Neipperg, centred on Schwaigern, had become an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire, but was mediatised to the Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806. Neipperg was educated at the Karlsschule military academy in Stuttgart. At the age of sixteen, Neipperg attempted to enlist in the French army at Strasbourg but, in 1791, he joined the ranks of the Austrians. He participated in the Battle of Jemappes, Battle of Neerwinden, and Siege of Valenciennes. On 14 September 1794, at the village of Doel, on returning from one of many missions to deliver secret instructions to forts in the Dutch Republic, he became trapped behind enemy lines and received such serious bayonet wounds that he was left for dead; he lost his right eye in this skirmish. The following day, while burying the dead, the French found him still breathing and hospitalised him. Speaking French rather too well for a common soldier, he was assumed to be a traitor and sentenced to be shot once his health had returned. However, his convalescence was lengthy due to the seriousness of his injuries. By the time he recovered, the command having changed, he became part of a prisoner exchange. In a different account, he lost his eye not to a saber wound sustained in battle, but as a result of his maltreatment while being held prisoner by the French.Wurzbach, Constantin (1869), Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich, Universitätsbibliothek Graz, Vol. 20, pp. 146-152. He was unable to return to active duty for over a year. Neipperg rejoined the Austrian army and took part in the Battle of Mainz in 1795, and led Austrian troops in Italy, culminating at the disastrous Battle of Marengo in 1800 that drove the Austrians out of Italy. Following Marengo, Major Neipperg went to Paris in July 1800 as secretary to Feldmarschallleutnant Graf St. Julien, who was conducting peace negotiations with the French. When these failed in the autumn, he was appointed to 5. Ott Hussars on 1 December, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Pozzolo on 25 December. As the Oberstleutnant (Lt-colonel) of the same regiment, he fought in NE Italy again in the 1805 campaign, notably in the rearguard action on the Tagliamento. In 1806 he was appointed Oberst (colonel) of the regiment and directed the Neutrality and Frontier Cordon force, which observed the 1806-7 war. Jaromir Hirtenfeld: Der Militär-Maria- Theresien-Orden und seine Mitglieder (1857) Vol 2 pp.1124-5 Diplomat and general In 1809, after the Austrian campaign, he was appointed ambassador to Sweden and encouraged Bernadotte to enter in the coalition which was formed in 1813. In reward for this service, he was decorated by the Swedish king. Neipperg rejoined the Austrian army and fought at Leipzig where he distinguished himself sufficiently to be appointed as lieutenant field marshal. In 1814, Klemens von Metternich sent him to negotiate with the King of Naples, Joachim Murat, who signed a secret peace treaty with Austria in order to keep his throne. Metternich's other intrigue was to try to distance Prince Eugene (stepson of Napoleon and son-in-law of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria) from the French. When Napoleon returned from exile, Murat once again allied with his brother-in-law the Emperor, triggering the Neapolitan War. Neipperg commanded a corps in the Austrian army (called the Army of Naples) under Field Marshal Frederick Bianchi. Murat dispatched General Carrascosa with a division of Neapolitan troops to prevent Neipperg's corps linking up with Bianchi and the Austrian main body. Neipperg defeated Carrascosa at Scapezzano on 1 May 1815. The main Neapolitan force under Murat's command attacked Bianchi's smaller force, which was in a strong defensive position, at Tolentino on 2 May 1815. The attack was renewed on 3 May and the Neapolitan force was gaining an advantage over the Austrians, when Murat received news of Carrascosa's defeat. With the threat of Neipperg's large force approaching his flank, Murat had to order the Neapolitan army to withdraw, turning Tolentino from a potential Napoleonic victory into a defeat. In 1815, Neipperg participated in the short occupation of France. In July 1815, as the Austrian army crossed the Rhone, he took command of the troops in the French departments of Gard, Ardèche and Hérault. He was under the supervision of Bianchi, commanding the Austrian army in the south of France. He lived in Nîmes and left the city with the rest of the troops on 14 September 1815. Marriages Neipperg family coat of arms Neipperg married Therese Josephine Walpurgis, Countess Thurn-Valsassina (1778-1815) in 1806 and they had four sons. He was succeeded in the headship of the House of Neipperg by his eldest son Alfred (1807–1865) who married, secondly, Princess Marie Frederike Charlotte (1816-1887), daughter of King William I of Württemberg. Alfred died childless and his brother Erwin Franz (1813–1897) followed him. The male heirs of this senior line of counts still live at Schwaigern in Germany. The present head of the house, Karl-Eugen, Count von Neipperg (born 1951), is the husband of Archduchess Andrea von Habsburg. In August 1814, he was instructed to escort Napoleon's wife, the Empress Marie-Louise, to Aix- les-Bains to take the waters. However, the true purpose of his mission was to prevent the Empress from joining Napoleon in exile in Elba. Neipperg, who had understood this perfectly, was rumored to have told his mistress in Milan: \\"Inside of six months I shall be her lover, and soon her husband.\\"Geer, Walter (1925), Napoleon and Marie-Louise; the fall of the empire, New York, Brentano's, p.315. The quote is most likely apocryphal, and at any rate, he did not need that long, as Marie-Louise soon fell into his arms and talk of Elba never arose again.von Wertheimer, Edouard (1902), The Duke of Reichstadt (Napoleon the Second), London, Ballantyne & Co., p.120. Four months after the death of Napoleon in 1821, he married Marie-Louise in a morganatic marriage. She had become sovereign Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, styled Maria-Luigia di Parma, in the final act of the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815. From this union, four children were born, the first two before the marriage, whilst Maria-Luigia was still legally married to Napoleon: * Countess Albertine di Montenuovo (Italian translation of Neipperg) (1817–1867), who married Luigi Sanvitale, Count di Fontanellato; * William Albert, Count then 1st Prince von Montenuovo, (1819–1895), who married Countess Juliana Batthyány von Németújvár; * Countess Mathilde di Montenuovo, born in 1822, died young. * Count Gustavo di Montenuovo, born in 1823, died young. Neipperg died in Parma on 22 February 1829 of a heart condition. His descendants with the Duchess Maria-Luigia, the Princes von Montenuovo, intermarried with the Austro-Hungarian nobility and served as courtiers and diplomats at the Imperial Hofburg in Vienna, dying out in the male line in 1951.

It comprises three properties: the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged, in Auburn; the nearby Harriet Tubman Residence (just across the city/town line in Fleming); and the Thompson A.M.E. Zion Church in Auburn. They are located at 180 and 182 South Street, and 90 Franklin Street, respectively. The Zion Church unit is administered by the National Park Service (NPS), while the South Street properties, including a historic barn and a visitor center, are jointly managed and operated by both the NPS and the Harriet Tubman Home, Inc. The church also works with the NPS in park operations. The Harriet Tubman Grave in nearby Fort Hill Cemetery is not part of the park. The group of properties also makes up a National Historic Landmark, the first parcel having been declared in 1974, with two others added in 2001. Tubman was a major conductor on the Underground Railroad, and known as \\"the Moses of her people\\". She moved to Auburn with her parents after spending eight to ten years in St. Catharines, Ontario. She continued working as a suffragist, and worked all her life to care for others who were unable to care for themselves. The Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged is the house where she fulfilled her dream of opening a home for indigent and elderly African-Americans. In 1911 she was admitted there, herself, and remained there until her death in 1913. Harriet Tubman Residence The Harriet Tubman Residence was Tubman's home during much of the time she lived in Auburn, from 1859 through 1913. The land was sold to her in 1859 by then-Senator William H. Seward.http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/underground/ny1.htm Seward was U.S. Senator, not Governor, contrary to the NPS site Thompson A.M.E. Zion Church Thompson A.M.E. Zion Church is an African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church where Harriet Tubman attended services. Later in her life, she deeded the Home for the Aged to the church, for it to manage after her death. History of the Home Harriet Tubman moved herself and her parents from St.Catherines, Ontario to Auburn, NY in 1857. They relocated into a brick home on the outskirts of Auburn located at 180 South Street she had purchased from an acquaintance William H. Seward, which then was an illegal transaction. Seward's deal along with being illegal was fair priced with flexible terms, this probably stemmed from their friendship from the Underground Railroad. In 1896, Tubman purchased a 25-acre parcel from a property next door, 182 South Street, for $1,450, this land would later become the Home for the Aged.Harriet Tubman Historical Society.

She donated it to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AME Zion Church) that same year with an agreement that they would continue to run the Home for the Aged. She was an active member of the AME Zion Church and supported the construction of the Thompson AME Church building as well. In 1908, after working for 5 years to equip the staff the house become the Harriet Tubman Home for the Elderly in which Harriet Tubman also lived. In 1911, her health would not allow that anymore and she later became a patient herself until 1913 when she died. The Home for the Elderly continued to function for a couple more years but then closed. The house became vacant in 1928 and was demolished in 1944 after being vacant for nearly 16 years. In 1953, the house was rebuilt and restored in memory of Tubman's life and accomplishments. This was all organized by the AME Zion Church whom Tubman had given the property to over 50 years before. Since 1953, there has been 2 more buildings added to the property due to the transitions of it becoming a historic site, national park and public attraction. The site received a prestigious Save America's Treasures grant in 2000.

Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1978), Volume 13, p.1385, \\"Huot\\". Since the Ross rifle had finally been taken out of service, there were large numbers of surplus rifles. Joseph Alphonse Huot (1918) That year, Joseph Huot, an engineer from Richmond, Quebec,Phillips, Roger F. The Ross Rifle Story (Sydney, NS: James A. Chadwick, 1984), p.354. adapted the Ross' straight-pull bolt action. His sample model, which shared 33 parts with the Ross Mark III,Phillips, p.355. had a gas piston parallel to the barrel, which moved a sleeve on the bolt backward, operating the action. To absorb excess energy, the bolt was buffered. The entire mechanism was sheathed in sheet metal. Huot copied the cooling system from the Lewis Gun, then standard in British Army service.Phillips, p.354. It fed from a 25-round drum magazine. He filed Canadian patents; #193724 on 8 March 1917 (granted 4 November 1919) and #193725 on 13 November 1917. Early in September 1916, he approached the government to licence-produce the weapon, meeting with a Colonel Matyche on 8 September, and was hired by the Government Small Arms Experimental Department. The Dominion Rifle Factory (formerly the Ross rifle factory) built a finished version of the design, under the supervision of Assistant Inspector of Small Arms Major Robert Mills of the Seaforth Highlanders. It was tested at Quebec City on 12 November 1916, with a second 650-round trial of an improved version on 15 February 1917. The Master-General of Ordnance, Blair, demanded a third test, firing 11,000 rounds (half Dominion Cartridge Company, half Dominion Arsenal) on 5–6 March 1917. The Huot was also examined at the Rockcliffe Rifle Range on 22 October 1917, which led S. C. Meuburn to recommend it be adopted by the British Army. To further this aim, Blair, A.A. Janson, and Huot sailed for Britain, arriving at Sandling, Hythe on 10 January 1918, for an extensive British trial at the arms testing establishment at RSAF Enfield. This took place between 19–21 March 1918, and the Huot competed against the Lewis, Hotchkiss, and Farquhar-Hill. The results appeared favorable. \\"The Huot did better in some tests than the Lewis. It was superior in snapshooting from a trench, in quickness of getting into action...\\" Even muddy, after firing four or five clearing rounds, it would function again, without the need for stripping and cleaning;Phillips, p.362. Blair noted it was the only weapon on the trial able to suffer immersion and do so. In firing 10,000 rounds through the Huot, Enfield uncovered fouling of the gas cylinder at 4,000 rounds, and the barrel worn out at 10,000. Since this example had already had some 11,000 rounds fired through it before coming into Enfield's hands, this is understandable. Using all varieties of Mark VII ammunition it would be likely to encounter (including K, KN, J, and US), they found the Huot had no major problems, though there were unexplained stoppages, and it did not require the specially chosen ammunition the Lewis did. Furthermore, the Huot proved able to fire 4,000 rounds without oiling or cleaning; which the Lewis was unable to do.Phillips, p.363. In a 22 October 1917 letter to the British Minister of Munitions, Blair said tooling existed in Canada and the Dominion Factory was ready to begin manufacturing the Huot, using parts from Rosses scheduled for scrapping. After exposure to it in France, Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie, commanding the Canadian Corps, reported every soldier to come in contact with the Huot liked it, and on 1 October 1918 wrote requesting 5,000 be purchased, arguing casualties required increased firepower for each remaining man, as well as to allow his men to answer the growing number of German light machine guns. It was ugly, but at C$50, considerably cheaper than the original C$1,000 cost of the Lewis.Phillips, p.355: citing Public Archives of Canada, Record Group 24. One drawback was the Huot was fully automatic only, with no provision for semi-automatic fire. The magazine could be emptied in just 3.2 secondsPhillips, p.364 (a drawback shared by the Browning Automatic Rifle), however the rate of fire is slow, much like a Bren Gun's, so that was not a problem. A magazine could be changed in four seconds, and an empty magazine could be filled with ammunition in 30 seconds. The Huot used a 25-round stripper clip to fill the drum magazine. In addition the Huot functioned just as well upside-down.Phillips, p.364. Enfield noted 13 flaws, all with simple fixes, remarking \\"converting the Ross was not a complicated matter.\\" Field trials in France showed \\"well authenticated\\" reports of few breakages or stoppages. View inside the Huot breech Enfield recommended a number of changes: the barrel cover be fitted with a continuous length of tubing and a wooden forend, allowing the weapon to dispense with the rest, which was criticized for its fragility; a corrugated metal cover be fitted to the body, with a dust shield over the bolt handle; the magazine mouth be bevelled to ease feeding; the magazine be made of thinner metal to reduce its excessive weight; the breech cover not extend so far back to prevent injury to the firer; strengthen the extractor to prevent failures to feed with thick-rimmed cases (one of the few feeding problems noted); the hand-cocking lever be deleted [a puzzle as the weapons still has to be cocked for the first shot], also removing eight new parts; and the barrel casing be made in one piece, to eliminate a minor double failure issue.Phillips, p.363-5. The war ended before it entered service, and the idea was dropped. Huot was out of pocket about C$30,000.Phillips, p.368. Major Robert Blair with a Huot Four specimens are known to exist (2015).

Prior to Ecotrust, Beebe was president of The Nature Conservancy International Program and founding president of Conservation International. Ecotrust's advisors have included urbanist Jane Jacobs, ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, forestry scientist Jerry Franklin, and counterculture icon Stewart Brand.

Ecotrust began by surveying temperate rain forests as a distinct ecoregion, an analysis that led the organization to identify British Columbia's Kitlope River as the largest intact temperate rain forest watershed in the world. Beebe and others from Ecotrust visited the region and engaged the Haisla First Nation, whose traditional territory included the Kitlope. The organization supported the Haisla in launching a Rediscovery Program for cultural education and, four years later, in securing provincial government recognition for over of temperate rain forest as Huchsduwachsdu Nuyem Jees (the Kitlope Heritage Conservancy Protected Area).Linden, Eugene. \\"Our Home and Native Land: In a North American rain forest, two indigenous tribes have become a force for conservation,\\" Time Magazine, May 2, 1994.Smith, Fran and Dolores Pollard. \\"Haisla Rediscovery Builds on Cultural Roots\\", from \\"Sharing Stories: Community Economic Development in British Columbia.\\" Simon Fraser University, 1995.

Loosely based on real events, the story is set in France in two distinct periods, 1699 and 1717, and incorporates real historical characters such as Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. Plot summary Si tu ne viens pas à Lagardère, Lagardère ira à toi! (\\"If you don't come to Lagardère, Lagardère will come to you!\\") Such is the oath given by the adventurer Lagardère to the wicked Prince de Gonzague, who has plotted to murder the daughter and seize the fortune of the dashing Duc de Nevers. In the first volume, Le Petit Parisien, the Prince de Gonzague murders the Duc de Nevers. Henri Lagardère rescues Nevers' daughter Aurore and raises her in exile, where she makes friends with a gypsy girl named Flor. The second volume, Le Chevalier de Lagardère, describes Lagardère's triumph over the Prince de Gonzague. Influence The novel is one of a number of works such as The Three Musketeers (1844) which helped define the genre of \\"swashbuckler\\" novel, known in French as a \\"roman de cape et d'épée\\". Lagardère's promise of revenge – \\"Si tu ne viens pas à Lagardère, Lagardère ira à toi!\\" – became a proverbial phrase in the French language. Paul Féval's son, Paul Féval, fils, borrowed his father's hero for his own series of \\"Lagardère\\" novels. Adaptations The book has formed the basis for a large number of film versions, including Le Bossu (released as On Guard in English-speaking countries), directed by Philippe de Broca in 1997, with Daniel Auteuil (Lagardère), Marie Gillain (Aurore de Nevers), and Fabrice Luchini (Gonzague).

He is considered a peer of the most prominent architects in the history of Chicago. He has also done significant work throughout Illinois and the Midwest, although much of it no longer exists. Biography John M. Van Osdel was born in Baltimore, Maryland on July 31, 1811, the eldest son of carpenter James H. Van Osdel. During John's teenage years, James was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and the family thereafter struggled through poverty. To help the family, John began to work as a carpenter himself. He moved to New York, New York to work with his father once recovery was complete. In the city, Van Osdel found the Apprentice's Library, a catalogue of books related to carpentry and architecture. He returned to Baltimore in 1829 to work. The next year, Van Osdel began a profitable school for prospective draftsmen. In 1836, after another relocation to New York, Van Osdel met New York State Assemblyman William B. Ogden. When Ogden moved west to Chicago, Illinois, he requested that Van Osdel follow him and design his house. After its completion, Van Osdel became engaged in steamboat construction, building the James Allen and George W. Dole. After construction began on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Van Osdel built several water pumps and a horizontal windmill to aid with excavation. He returned to New York in 1840 to tend to his sick wife and to work as an associate editor for Rufus Porter's American Mechanic. The next year, after Van Osdel fell ill, he returned to Chicago. Van Osdel built some of the city's first grain elevators upon his return. In 1843, he co-founded an iron foundry and machine factory with Elihu Granger. With his health continuing to fail, he left the partnership two years later to focus on his architecture. Van Osdel opened an office on Clark Street, the first architectural office in Chicago. During his time there he designed the Cook County Courthouse, the Chicago City Hall, and the Tremont House. He also designed a house for Governor Joel Aldrich Matteson which later saw use as the Illinois Executive Mansion. By 1859, Van Osdel was making over $32,000 in profit per year. Palmer House Hotel Ladies Entrance (1903-09-19) Van Osdel married Caroline Gailer in 1832. After her death, he married Martha McClellan. Van Osdel had no biological children, although he did adopt a few. He was named a trustee of the Illinois Industrial University, now known as the University of Illinois. As a member of its Committee on Buildings and Grounds, he was instrumental in the founding of a branch university in Chicago, today known as the University of Illinois at Chicago. Upon completion of the branch, he was named its Treasurer. Politically, Van Osdel was active in the abolition movement. Previously unaffiliated, Van Osdel became a Republican in 1860, printing pamphlets supporting the party. Reputation He is considered a Chicago school architect and a peer of William LeBaron Jenney, Dankmar Adler, Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, John Wellborn Root and Frank Lloyd Wright. In fact, he and William W. Boyington are considered the most prominent Chicago architects of the period from the city's incorporation in 1837 until the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. La Porte County, Indiana Second Court House c.1848 Other buildings Much of his work has been destroyed by fire, but remaining structures stand as local landmarks, with many listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Van Osdel designed the Palmer House, Tremont House and Page Brothers Building in Chicago, the Illinois Executive Mansion in Springfield, the state capital, the Old McHenry County Courthouse, Old Main at the University of Arkansas, and some courthouses in Indiana. He also designed the first cast-iron building for the Lake Street central business district. Chicago City Hall sits on the site of a former Van Osdel building that housed a county courthouse and city hall. Van Osdel's 1872 McCarthy Building was demolished along with the rest of Block 37 in 1987 despite its Chicago Landmark status. Another work is Second St. Joseph County Courthouse, 1854; South Bend St. Joseph County, Indiana. Van Osdel died at age 80 in Chicago.

Biography Baumann was a construction worker. His nickname derives from his favorite drink, Bommi mit Pflaume (plum-flavoured spirit), although it is often wrongly attributed to his occasional preference for explosives during student unrests. In the 1960s, he got in touch with the West Berlin student movement and with Kommune 1. His views became more radical after various experiences with police, media and bureaucracy. After the death of Benno Ohnesorg on 2 June 1967, he started to espouse violence as a means of political struggle. Unlike many students in the SDS (German Socialist Student Union), he also stressed the importance of \\"direct action\\" and Kampf in den Metropolen (combat in the metropolises) to support guerrilla warfare in the third world. After arson attacks against a British airline, which had flown young German Military deserters from West Berlin into West Germany, where they would have faced trial, Baumann had to spend some months in prison from February 1970 to summer 1971. With his friend Georg von Rauch, he joined the Zentralrat der umherschweifenden Haschrebellen (\\"Central Council of Rambling Hashish Rebels\\"), one of the organisations that founded the Movement 2 June. The police tried to arrest von Rauch for driving a stolen car, and shot him at the scene. After this incident, Baumann decided to end his participation in urban guerrilla warfare, but he was sought by police as an accomplice. In 1972 he escaped and traveled to various countries, including Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and India. In 1974 he abjured violence in an interview with the news magazine Der Spiegel. His quotation \\"Freunde, schmeißt die Knarre weg\\" (Friends, throw away your gat/gun) became well-known in his political circles.Der Spiegel, 11 February 1974, page 32: \\"Freunde, schmeißt die Knarre weg\\" In 1975 his autobiography Wie alles anfing (\\"How it all began\\") was published (translated as Terror or Love? in 1979). In it he describes his personal evolution into a proponent of urban guerrilla warfare, and comments critically on armed struggle. This edition, from the Munich publishers Trikont, was seized by police after its appearance because of its supposed incitement to violence. A nationwide search was ordered immediately. In 1976, however, more than 300 left-wing writers and publishers from several European countries, some of them quite prominent, united to protest this censorship. They published an unchanged new edition, which could be sold without problems. In 1981, Baumann was arrested in London and sentenced to a five-year imprisonment for bank robbery and bombing. While in prison, he wrote another autobiographical book, which appeared after he was released. When documents of the former East Germany were made accessible by the Stasi Records Agency after the German reunification, it became known that in 1973, Baumann had written a 125-page report to the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) about 94 people within the armed struggle movement, including information on assaults, attacks, weapons, and sexual preferences. Beyond that, 165 pages of interrogation records exist on Baumann. During a period of six weeks, Baumann shared his insider knowledge in 114 hours of interrogation.Wolfgang Kraushaar: \\"Unsere unterwanderten Jahre,\\" Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 7 April 1998, page 45 He died on July 19, 2016.Mitbegründer der \\"Bewegung 2.

Records in 1992. The album presents a shift from reggae- tinged Led Zeppelin covers to disco music cover songs from the 1970s. The album was produced by Jah Paul Jo, Rasta Li-Mon and Greg Edward. Recording Jah Paul Jo and Rasta Li-Mon decided early on that they would like to attempt to record basic tracks for the album at their own home studio, The Mapletree Ranch. To accomplish this, they hoped to bring in an outside engineer/producer with the mobile equipment necessary. Early candidates were Ron and Russell Mael, collectively known as Sparks, who were keen to produce but had problems with scheduling.The Making Of It's Not Unusual By Jah Paul Jo Greg Edward was a staff engineer and producer at Virgin Studios and also had the recording gear necessary. He became a valuable member of the production team and also served as cheerleader when the going got tough due to personnel changes within the band. Sessions for the album began in early 1992. Within weeks it became obvious that Tortelvis had personal problems and would not be able to continue. Some early recordings of songs from \\"It's Not Unusual\\" exist with Tortelvis vocals. Basic tracks continued to be recorded despite the fact that Dread Zeppelin no longer had a lead vocalist. After an exhaustive search for a replacement, it was decided that band bassist, Put-Mon, would take on the vocal duties. Inexplicably taking on the name of Gary B.I.B.B., Put-Mon cut a more trim, youthful, pre-Army era Elvis-like figure. \\"It's Not Unusual Live!\\"With the departure of Tortelvis, as well as Ed Zeppelin and drummer Fresh Cheese 'n' Cheese, the production team decided a new approach was necessary. Rasta Li-Mon introduced \\"Velveeta,\\" a computer-driven drum machine and samples box that included a lot of the sound effects that the live Dread Zeppelin had become famous for. Augmenting \\"Velveeta\\" was new percussionist, Spice. Overdubs were recorded at Virgin Studios in Los Angeles with Greg Edward engineering. The band were honored to have Randy Bachman of Bachman- Turner Overdrive and The Guess Who contribute a guest vocal and guitar solo on his composition, \\"Takin' Care of Business.\\" Also adding several amazing vocal performances was the legendary Screamin' Jay Hawkins who had become a regular at Dread Zeppelin gigs in the Los Angeles area. In the true Dread Zeppelin spirit, Screamin' Jay insisted on being credited on the album as \\"Dr. Paradox.\\" \\"Jungle Boogie\\" became a vocal tour-de-force for Screamin' Jay as he both sings and performs his trademark vocal effects. The album's final mix was recorded at Scream Studio in Studio City, CA by Jah Paul Jo and Rasta Li-Mon. Album Cover The original working title of the album was \\"Groovy Booty Bomb\\"The Making Of It's Not Unusual By Jah Paul Jo which is where it was to be filed according to the finished cover. Photos for the album cover were by I.R.S. Art Director Hugh Brown. The band show off their new glittering Disco outfits designed exclusively by Consuela of Soto Street. Album cover and alternate longbox cover was designed by fRed Davis. On the longbox cover, each member of the band hold up their individual instruments which, by this time in their career, had become quite stylized. Controversy This version of the band caused more of a stir than the original explosive popularity of Un Led- Ed. Their sudden change in style to disco and the absence of Tortelvis puzzled long-time listeners. Reviews were mixed, but extremely polarized - either extremely positive or negative. Despite many positive reviews of their live concerts and a North American tour, sales of the album failed to meet expectations and Dread Zeppelin were dropped by I.R.S. Records. However, soon after Dread Zeppelin left I.R.S., the label signed another act called \\"The King\\" whose act was doing covers Elvis-style, but he never came close to achieving the popularity of Dread Zeppelin. Two songs were withheld from the final version of \\"It's Not Unusual.\\" The sequel to the Dread Zeppelin original song \\"Do the Claw\\", called \\"Do the Claw (Again)\\", was withheld for copyright considerations (too much like Chubby Checker's \\"Do The Twist Again\\"). \\"Brickhouse of the Holy\\" was pulled because of reservations by co-writer of \\"Brick House,\\" Lionel Richie.

The Hastings Academy opened on 1 September 2011 moving into a new building during February 2013.The school has around 900 students and over 100 staff. The Principal is Ms Hilary Morawska. It is run by the University of Brighton Academies Trust. History Hastings A School was completed in 1953, where it opened as a girls secondary school. At around this time the school campus was made up of B-Block and the sports fields. With the closure of the boys school in Priory Road in the late seventies, (next to Castledown School), Hillcrest accepted both male and female students. In 2007 the school closed its 6th Form. On 21 November 2008 The Hastings Observer reported that \\"The worst school in Hastings has been dealt a further blow after being told it will be put into special measures by Ofsted\\". In 2011 the school was closed down by Ofsted and knocked down by East Sussex County Council. September 2013 saw the closing of Hillcrest School and the opening of The Hastings Academy. The Old Hillcrest Campus Former school buildings The school campus was divided into four blocks: L block, the Sports Centre, A Block and B Block. In addition to the Sports Centre, there is a gymnasium in B Block. There were three tennis courts on site and four playgrounds. There were two fields east of the Language Block. The school owned part of the woodland behind A Block's playground. A multi use games area was opened in 2006. =A Block= *Humanities: Geography, History and religious education *Science *Drama *Administration *Caretakers' office There were huts behind A Block where maths is taught and student services, the health clinic, library and canteen were located there. =B Block= *English and media *Maths *Art *IT *PE (gym) *Music *Design technology *Student Services *SENCO Department (also, Remedial Block, also J Block) *Food Technology The main entrance was there and leads to Kenway Hall. =C Block (also, L Block)= The language college was where French, German and Spanish was taught to the students; Japanese. Other languages were taught during after school classes. There was an ICT suite, primarily for the use by Language classes. Hastings Federation In 2008, a proposal to create a federation between Filsham Valley, Hillcrest and The Grove secondary schools to improve major aspects of the school was approved by East Sussex County Council. Under the federation, led by Sir Dexter Hutt, the school has improved in all areas including attitude towards learning, behaviour both in and out of the classroom, OFSTED inspections and GCSE results with 76% of students achieving 5 A* – C, and at least 93% 5A* – G grades. The federation continues today in the form of the University of Brighton Academies Trust which includes Hastings Academy and The St Leonards Academy (the result of a merger between Filsham Valley and The Grove). The Hastings Academy opened on 1 September 2011 and an extensive building programme saw the old buildings occupied during the development and construction of the new buildings. The old school was demolished and the current buildings have been used since February 2013. =Toilet pass controversy= Hastings Academy has a policy of issuing toilet passes to avoid the abuse of toilet breaks during lesson time. In September 2018 an 11-year- old girl, who was experiencing her first menstrual bleed was not allowed to use the toilet and sent home with bloody knickers, tights and shorts. The school wanted a doctor's certificate, at a cost of £15, before they would issue a toilet pass. In the year 2019, various groups of students 'swarmed' aspects of the school with desperate attempts at gaining their freedom back. These swarms continued across 2 days, and it was reported that weapons, including rods and knives, were brought in by students. The police were within the school building on both days. The school denied any and all of these accusations, although children told parents anyway. Across the two days, the hill of east was vandalized by students, as well as powder bombs being dropped into the canteens, temporarily blinding numerous students. Results of these activities saw that all WIFI was now removed from student use. Frequently, the school experiences 'black-outs' were the lights, and all power, was lost for minutes at a time. These events continued into a year 11 business GCSE exam, where the select students had already received grief from the examiners phones going off.

It was recorded on July 29, 1965. The song was also included on an early, European Dylan compilation album entitled Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits 2. An earlier, alternate version of the song has been released, in different takes, beginning with the appearance of one take on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991 in 1991. Music and lyrics The version of the song on Highway 61 Revisited is an acoustic/electric blues song, one of three blues songs on the album (the others being \\"From a Buick 6\\" and \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\"). It is made up of lines taken from older blues songs combined with Dylan's own lyrics. Rather than the aggression of some of the other songs Dylan wrote during this time, \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" reflects world-weary resignation. The imagery is sexual, and the song can be interpreted as an allegory of someone who is sexually frustrated. Dylan would return to similar images and suggestions in later songs, such as \\"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\\" and \\"Señor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\". This version was recorded on July 29, 1965, the same day that Dylan also recorded \\"Positively 4th Street\\" and \\"Tombstone Blues\\". Musically, the song has a lazy tempo driven by lazy-slap drumming with a shuffling beat and slight emphasis on the offbeat from session drummer Bobby Gregg. There is also a barrelhouse piano part played by Paul Griffin, a raunchy bass part played by Harvey Brooks, an electric guitar part played by Mike Bloomfield and an unusual harmonica part. Dylan played the album version of the song live for the first time as part of his set in the August 1971 Concert for Bangladesh. The earlier version of the song went by the title \\"Phantom Engineer\\". This version has a more upbeat tempo and four lines of different lyrics. It was recorded on June 15, 1965, the same day that recording of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" began. Different takes of the June 15 version may be heard on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991, The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home, and the 2-disc version of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966. Take 1 of the song, released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 12 and on Dylan's Vevo channel, is played in a more moderately paced, brooding arrangement, before Dylan and the musicians settled on a more upbeat version. On The Bootleg Series Vol. 7 and The Bootleg Series Vol. 12, the version is a speedy bouncing blues with a signature guitar riff being played on each bar and a fast clicking organ. (The 6-disc and 18-disc editions of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12 include outtakes from both the June 15 and July 29 sessions.) This alternate version was played as part of Dylan's controversial electric set, backed by members of The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Al Kooper, at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25, 1965, after \\"Maggie's Farm\\". After being heckled during the electric set, and especially during \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\", by fans who wanted Dylan to play acoustic folk music, Dylan returned to play acoustic versions of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\". The Newport performance of \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" features jamming by guitarist Bloomfield and organist Al Kooper. Kooper preferred the alternate version to the version that ended up on Highway 61 Revisited. The Newport performance was released in 2018 on Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections. A November 1975 performance of the song from Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour was released on the 2002 album The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. In 2019, that performance and three other live renditions of the song from the same tour were released on the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings.

After the dissolution of the Thai Rak Thai Party in 2007, the National Development group merged into the Ruam Jai Thai Chart Pattana Party. It was founded by the former prime minister Chatichai Choonhavan. During the 1990s, it was among the country's four strongest parties. Like other Thai parties, it consisted of internal factions and lacked a strong organisation. It had no political ideology, but served the personal interests of its opportunistic leaders. It was often affected by defections to other parties. The heartland of the National Development Party was the Northeastern region (Isan). Establishment Legally, the National Development Party was the successor of the Thai People's Party established by General Arthit Kamlang-ek in 1982. By 1992, it was only an empty shell, as General Arthit and all notable members had abandoned it. Shortly ahead of the elections in September 1992, Chatichai Choonhavan, who had been prime minister until the military coup d'état in 1991, and a group of other Thai Nation Party politicians around Chatichai's nephew Korn Dabbaransi took over the party and renamed it. The establishment followed a rupture in the Thai Nation Party, whose leadership around Somboon Rahong and secretary general Banharn Silpa-archa had stood at the side of the military junta (NPKC) during the popular protests and bloody crackdown of Black May. Therefore, the Thai Nation Party was considered one of the \\"devil parties\\". A faction of Thai Nation deputies around Chatichai's cousin Korn Dabbaransi felt uncomfortable with this policy and persuaded Chatichai to leave the party. The new party was set up as a vehicle to support a second premiership for Chatichai. They were joined by members of the likewise military-allied Justice Unity Party who now wanted to disassociate themselves from the junta. They included General Arthit Kamlang-ek (who thus returned to his original party), Somchai Khunpluem (\\"Kamnan Poh\\", or the \\"Godfather of Chonburi\\") and Suwat Liptapanlop, an entrepreneur from Nakhon Ratchasima. Moreover, the party could win over Democrat Party secretary general Prachuab Chaisarn. Chatichai stressed the fact that his party had nothing to do with the military junta and the Black May events. He presented it as a new party which consisted mainly of younger lawmakers, espoused democracy and took a neutral position in the polarised political spectrum. The party succeeded in winning financially strong sponsors and win over politicians from other parties. In the September 1992 election, the party won 60 seats and thus become the third strongest force countrywide. It joined the government coalition led by Chuan Leekpai but left it again after less than a year. Thaksin government In December 2001, the National Development Party, which had been the largest opposition party, joined the coalition government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin dropped the party from the coalition in November 2003. Therefore, several politicians left the National Development Party to join Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai Party Thaksin exerted further pressure and before the 2005 election, the party had merged into the Thai Rak Thai Party. After the 2006 coup d'état, the Constitutional Tribunal dissolved the Thai Rak Thai Party in May 2007, and in September the National Development Group merged with Thais United to form the Ruam Jai Thai Chart Pattana Party.

A protégée of Gordon Ramsay who was made famous by her appearances on British television, she was Chef-Patron at Angela Hartnett at The Connaught in London. Currently, she is Chef Patron for Murano restaurant, Cafe Murano in St James's and Covent Garden, Cucina Angelina in Courchevel (France) and joint owner of Merchant's Tavern in Shoreditch. Early life and education Angela Hartnett was born in Kent to Patrick Hartnett, an Irish sailor in the Merchant Navy and Giuliana Pesci, a Welsh mother whose parents had migrated from Bardi in Italy to the Welsh town of Ferndale. Her father died when she was eight years old. Her mother Giuliana moved the young family (older brother and younger sister) to Upminster to be closer to both sets of grandparents, where they were brought up by their Italian maternal grandmother whilst Giuliana worked long hours as a dinner lady and nanny. At 18 Hartnett went to Italy for a year to work as an au pair before graduating with a degree in History at Cambridge Polytechnic. Career Starting relatively late in her chosen career path, she learned on the job at a hotel in Cambridge, then at the Sandy Lane Hotel restaurant in Barbados. In 1994, she returned to the UK, and undertook a one- day trial at Gordon Ramsay's first restaurant Aubergine. Alongside Marcus Wareing, she worked six days a week alongside Ramsay for longer than the two weeks Wareing predicted – Ramsay called her a bitch occasionally, alongside his favoured name for her: Dizzy Lizzy. She supported Ramsay at Zafferano and L'Oranger, then joining Wareing as his sous chef at Petrus. After launching Amaryllis in Scotland with David Dempsey in 2001, Hartnett helped with the launch of Gordon Ramsay's Verre in Dubai. In 2003, Hartnett won the 'Best Newcomer Award' and the Square Meal Guides' BMW Best New Restaurant award for the two restaurants at The Connaught. In 2004, she netted her first Michelin star. In the 2007 New Year Honours, she was awarded an MBE for Services to the Hospitality Industry. Also in 2007, she opened Cielo, a Ramsay Group restaurant in Boca Raton. She made her first television appearance in the first series of ITV1's Hell's Kitchen. In 2015, Angela took part in the final episode, and oversaw the final task for MasterChef UK. The Murano in 2010 Just before The Connaught Hotel closed for restoration in mid-2007, Hartnett published her first book \\"Cucina: Three Generations of Italian Family Cooking;\\"; while it was closed she was seen on BBC's Kitchen Criminals and Take on the Takeaway. Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd agreed to cease their contract with The Connaught Hotel in September 2007, and in August 2008 Hartnett launched Murano, a fine-dining Italian restaurant in Mayfair. Murano has subsequently been awarded one Michelin star and is the holder of 4 AA Rosettes. Since then Angela Hartnett opened Cafe Murano, a more relaxed version of Murano in St James in November 2013 and a further site in Covent Garden in July 2015, alongside Pastificio, a deli-cafe, wine bar and modern pasta factory, making fresh pasta for the restaurants every four hours. In 2013, Merchant's Tavern was also opened as the result of a collaboration between Hartnett, Neil Borthwick and Canteen founders Dominic Lake and Patrick Clayton-Malone. From January to March 2016, Hartnett presented Tomorrow’s Food alongside Dara Ó Briain, Chris Bavin and Dr Shini Somara. The BBC One show looks at the cutting-edge technologies and produce appearing in farms, supermarkets, kitchens and restaurants around the world, and how this is transforming the way we grow, buy and eat our food. In 2020, Hartnett joined Bavin and Mary Berry as a judge on the BBC One reality cooking show Best Home Cook, replacing series one judge Dan Doherty. Personal life Hartnett is married to Neil Borthwick, and lives in Spitalfields with her sister, in a house owned by Hartnett and her brother. She owned a Jack Russell called Alfie that she rescued from Battersea Dogs Home in 2007, and also has a Beagle named Otis that was previously owned by her sister. She spends a holiday every year in Bardi, the town from where most of the Welsh-based Italian families can trace their roots.

He was a Senior Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center where he conducted research on the policy implications of the demographic, health and environmental crises in Russia.[1] He was a frequently turned-to source for both detailed analysis and a broad understanding of trends in the USSR and then the Former Soviet Union. His work had a major impact on the entire Western understanding of the Soviet Union, Russia and Eastern Europe. His role in sharing data, and in providing guidance to students and research assistants, helped shape a generation of scholars who came after him. Over time he moved from general demographic analysis to a focus on the impact of the Soviet population of problems in the health care system and ecological degradation. His pioneering article analyzing infant mortality trends in the USSR led to internal improvements which likely saved many lives. And his first major book, Ecocide in the USSR (with Alfred Friendly, Jr.) outlined the ways in which the medical system and environmental disasters were significant factors in the end of the Soviet Union. He was among the first in the West to identify a major decline in the size of the ethnic Russian population, and to grapple with its internal implications and its potential impact on Soviet and Russian policy. Feshbach was born in New York. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Syracuse University, his Master of Arts in European diplomatic history from Columbia University, and his Ph.D. in economics from American University. \\"He served as Chief of the USSR Population, Employment and Research and Development Branch of the Foreign Demographic Analysis Division (now the Center for International Research) of the Census Bureau from 1957 to 1981.

The Apollo Abort Guidance System (AGS, also known as Abort Guidance Section) was a backup computer system providing an abort capability in the event of failure of the Lunar Module's primary guidance system (Apollo PGNCS) during descent, ascent or rendezvous. As an abort system, it did not support guidance for a lunar landing. The AGS was designed by TRW independently of the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer and PGNCS. It was the first navigation system to use a strapdown Inertial Measurement Unit rather than a gimbaled gyrostabilized IMU (as used by PGNCS).Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience -- Chapter Two: Computers On Board The Apollo Spacecraft Although not as accurate as the gimbaled IMU, it provided satisfactory accuracy with the help of the optical telescope and rendezvous radar. It was also lighter and smaller in size. Description The Abort Guidance System included the following components:The Abort Guidance System (AGS) * Abort Electronic Assembly (AEA): the AGS computer * Abort Sensor Assembly (ASA): a simple strapdown IMU * Data Entry and Display Assembly (DEDA): the astronaut interface, similar to DSKY The computer used was MARCO 4418 (MARCO stands for Man Rated Computer) whose dimensions were 5 by 8 by 23.75 inches (12.7 by 20.3 by 60.33 centimeters); it weighed 32.7 pounds (14.83 kg) and required 90 watts of power. Because the memory had a serial access it was slower than AGC, although some operations on AEA were performed as fast or faster than on AGC. The computer had the following characteristics: * It had 4096 words of memory. Lower 2048 words were erasable memory (RAM), higher 2048 words served as fixed memory (ROM). The fixed and erasable memory were constructed similarly so the ratio between fixed and erasable memory was variable. * It was an 18-bit machine, with 17 magnitude bits and a sign bit. The addresses were 13 bits long; MSB indicated index addressing. * Data words were two's complement and in fixed-point form. =Registers= The AEA has the following registers: * A: Accumulator (18 bit) * M: Memory Register (18 bit), holds data that are being transferred between the central computer and memory * Q: Multiplier-Quotient Register (18 bit), stores the least significant half of result after multiplication and division. It can be also used as extension of Accumulator * Index Register (3 bit): used for index addressing Other less-important registers are: * Address Register (12 bit): holds the memory address requested by central computer * Operation Code Register (5 bit): holds 5-bit instruction code during its execution * Program Counter (12 bit) * Cycle Counter (5 bit): controls shift instructions * Timers (2 registers): produce the control timing signals * Input Registers: 13 registers =Instruction set= The AEA instruction format consisted of five-bit instruction code, index bit and a 12-bit address. The computer had 27 instructions: \`ADD\`: The contents of memory location are added to Accumulator A. The contents of the memory location remain unchanged. \`ADZ\` _(Add and Zero)_ : The contents of memory are added to Accumulator A. The contents of memory are set to zero. \`SUB\` _(Subtract)_ : The contents of memory are subtracted from Accumulator A. The contents of memory remain unchanged. \`SUZ\` _(Subtract and Zero)_ : The contents of memory are subtracted from Accumulator A. The contents of memory are set to zero. \`MPY\` _(Multiply)_ : The contents of Accumulator A are multiplied by the contents of memory. The most significant part of the product is placed in the Accumulator A, the least significant part is placed in Register Q. \`MPR\` _(Multiply and Round)_ : Identical to \`MPY\` instruction, the most significant part of the product in Accumulator A is rounded by adding one to the contents of Accumulator A if bit 1 of Q Register equals one. \`MPZ\` _(Multiply and Zero)_ : Identical to \`MPR\` instruction, the contents of memory are set to zero. \`DVP\` _(Divide)_ : The contents of Accumulator A and Register Q that form a dividend are divided by the contents of memory. The quotient is placed in Accumulator A and rounded unless the rounding would cause overflow. \`COM\` _(Complement Accumulator)_ : The contents of Accumulator A are replaced with their two's complement. If the contents of the Accumulator A are positive, zero or minus one, the contents remain unchanged. \`CLA\` _(Clear and Add)_ : The Accumulator A is loaded from memory. The contents of memory remain unchanged. \`CLZ\` _(Clear, Add and Zero)_ : Similar to \`CLA\` instruction; the contents of memory are set to zero. \`LDQ\` _(Load Q Register)_ : The Q Register is loaded with contents of memory. The contents of memory remain unchanged. \`STO\` _(Store Accumulator)_ : The contents of Accumulator A are stored in memory. The contents of Accumulator A remain unchanged. \`STQ\` _(Store Q Register)_ : The contents of Q Register are stored in memory. The contents of Q Register remain unchanged. \`ALS N\` _(Arithmetic Left Shift)_ : The contents of Accumulator A are shifted left N places. \`LLS N\` _(Long Left Shift)_ : The contents of Accumulator A and bits 1 - 17 of Q Register are shifted left as one register N places. The sign of Q Register is made to agree with sign of Accumulator A. \`LRS N\` _(Long Right Shift)_ : Similar to \`LLS\`, but the contents are shifted right N places. \`TRA\` _(Transfer)_ : The next instruction is taken from memory. \`TSQ\` _(Transfer and Set Q)_ : The contents of the Q Register are replaced with an address field set to one greater than the location of the \`TSQ\` instruction. Next instruction is taken from memory. \`TMI\` _(Transfer on Minus Accumulator)_ : The next instruction is taken from memory if the contents of the Accumulator A are negative. Otherwise the next instruction is taken in sequence. \`TOV\` _(Transfer on Overflow)_ : If the overflow indicator is set, the next instruction is taken from memory. \`AXT N\` _(Address to Index)_ : The Index Register is set to N. \`TIX\` _(Test Index and Transfer)_ : If the Index Register is positive, it is decremented by one and the next instruction is taken from memory. \`DLY\` _(Delay)_ : Execution stops until a timing signal is received. The next instruction is taken from memory. \`INP\` _(Input)_ : The contents of input register specified by address are placed in Accumulator A. The input register is either set to zero or remains unchanged (depending upon the selected register). \`OUT\` _(Output)_ : The contents of the Accumulator A are placed in output register specified by address. =Software= First design ideas of the Abort Guidance System did not include the use of the computer but rather a sequencer without any navigation capability. This would be adequate to put the Lunar Module into lunar orbit where the crew would wait for rescue by the Apollo CSM. Later design included a digital computer to provide some autonomy. The AGS software was written in LEMAP assembly language that uses 27 instructions described above and a set of pseudo-operations used by the assembler. The main computation cycle was 2 seconds long. This 2-second cycle was divided into 100 segments; each of these segments had a duration of 20 ms. These segments were used for computations that needed to be recalculated every 20 ms (like IMU signal processing, update of PGNCS downlink data, direction cosines update, etc.). There was also a set of computations that had to be performed every 40 ms (engine commands, external signal sampling, attitude control, etc.). Other computations were performed every 2 seconds and these equations were divided into smaller groups so they could be recalculated during the remaining (i.e. unused) time of 20 ms segments (e.g. radar data processing, calculation of orbital parameters, computation of rendezvous sequence, calibration of IMU sensors, etc.)Bettwy, T.S., TRW Report 05952-6076-T009, 25 January 1967, pp 12-29, \\"LM AGS Flight Equations Narrative Description\\" The software for AGS was reviewed many times to find program errors and to reduce the size of the software. There are some known versions of the software that were used for uncrewed and crewed tests.Evolution of the Flight Software =User interface= The AGS User interface unit was named DEDA (Data Entry and Display Assembly). Its function was entry and readout of data from the AGS. Some of the system's functionality was built into DEDA unlike the DSKY used by AGC. DEDA had the following elements: * Numeral keys 0 - 9 * + and - sign key * CLR key: clears the entry display and clears the OPR ERR light * ENTER key: for data/address entry * READOUT key: reads the data from the specified address and displays the refreshed data every half second * HOLD key: stops the continuous outputting of data * OPR ERR light: indicates Operator's error * displays are used to enter and read the data Use of AGS There are few actual descriptions of the use of the AGS, as a landing abort was never needed during the Apollo missions. There were, however, four cases in which the AGS was used. Its first use was for testing of the Lunar Module descent stage in Earth orbital flight during the Apollo 9 mission. It was used again in the Apollo 10 mission, following separation of the Lunar Module descent stage prior to the APS burn. An incorrect switch settingApollo 10 Mission Report leaving AGS in Auto rather than Attitude Hold mode led to a prompt and pronounced deviation in attitude moments before staging. The situation was quickly brought under control. The next use of the AGS was during the lunar ascent phase of the Apollo 11 mission, when the LM crew performed a sequence of rendezvous maneuvers that resulted in gimbal lock; the AGS was subsequently used to acquire attitude control.

His photographs captured the village's residents, mostly Tlingit Indians, at a time when the fish canning industry and other outside influences were beginning to change or eclipse traditional ways of life. Kayamori lived in Yakutat for some 30 years and never returned to Japan. But even before Pearl Harbor was bombed, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected him and other Japanese immigrants on the West Coast of spying. Two days after the attack, awaiting his arrest, Kayamori committed suicide. No credible evidence has ever been produced to indicate that he was a spy. Today, about 700 of Kayamori's photographs are housed at the Alaska State Historical Library in Juneau. Early life in Japan Kayamori was born in 1877 in what was then the village of Dembo, today part of Fuji City in central Japan.Kayamori, Shoki. Alien Registration Form, U.S. Department of Justice. Dec. 8, 1940. Yakutat, Ak. Form No. 5749551 He was the fifth of eight children; the second of four sons. The wealthy and prominent Kayamori family owned a paper mill, farm lands and a small department store. Under Japan's conscription law, Kayamori likely served a three-year military term. The law also required an additional three-year term in the reserves. In 1903, Japan was on the brink of war with Russia, and reservists like Kayamori waited to be recalled up to duty. Life and death in Alaska In September 1903, Kayamori turned 26 aboard the steamer Iyo Maru during the voyage from Yokohama to Seattle. He arrived with $87.10 and a steamer ticket for San Francisco, according to the ship's manifest, which lists his last residence as Tokyo and his occupation as \\"laborer and farmer\\". The ship's manifest lists his destination as the Japanese Methodist Mission on Pine Street. By 1910, Kayamori was living in a Seattle's Welcome Hotel and working as a \\"cleaner and passer\\" at a dye works, according to census records. Around 1912, he moved to Yakutat, a small Tlingit village in southeast Alaska, where he worked in the Libby, McNeil & Libby fish cannery. Racist attitudes and active unions at the time ensured that the jobs available to Japanese immigrants on the West Coast were largely limited to agricultural, railroad, laundry and cannery work. Today, Yakutat is a large (9860 square mile), sparsely populated, consolidated city/borough. After his father's death, Kayamori's mother went to live with her grandson's family in Manchuria, then a Japanese colony. According to family members, Kayamori sent letters, money, pictures, toys and once a whole salmon packed in salt. In Yakutat, children just called Kayamori Picture Man. For thirty years, he photographed celebrations, ceremonies, Tlingit culture, and the growing influences of colonialism. Kayamori had a box camera with a hood, and a darkroom in his small house near the cannery on Monti Bay. Yakutat's exposed Pacific coastline made it vulnerable and U.S. military forces began to fortify the area as World War II escalated. Soldiers warned Yakutat residents to prepare for an attack. In October 1940, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover sent a letter to the bureau's Juneau agent requesting the names of \\"persons who should be considered for custodial detention pending investigation in the event of a national emergency.\\" The reply included the name S. Kayamori and a description: \\"Is reported to be an enthusiastic photographer and to have panoramic views of the Alaskan coast line [sic] from Yakutat to Cape Spencer.\\" A day before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Hoover wrote to the War Department's military intelligence division requesting information on a number of individuals. Under Kayamori's name the reply noted: \\"Reported on suspect list, Alaska.\\" After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, soldiers reportedly beat up the 64-year-old, 5-foot-3 (160 cm) photographer, according to a town resident. Locals say Kayamori knew he would soon be arrested and interned. On December 9, he committed suicide in his home. Under cause of death, his death certificate asks \\"Drug?\\" The doctor who responded to Kayamori's death later wrote that he found evidence of an attempt to burn some documents. Locals say soldiers buried Kayamori across the bay, a site that was later paved for a naval ramp. Photograph collection Twenty years later, a Yakutat couple found boxes of Kayamori's negatives, mostly fragile 5×7 inch glass plates, in the attic of an abandoned church mission house scheduled for demolition. Yakutat residents eventually delivered the collection to the Alaska State Library in Juneau. In the late 70s, the city of Yakutat and the library shared expenses to develop two sets of prints from about seven hundred negatives, and to make copy negatives of about three hundred photographs. A group of Yakutat residents met with the state librarian to identify people and places in the pictures. One set of prints currently resides at the Yakutat City Hall, the other at the state library, which lists 694 photographs. According to the library, ethnologists and historians from various universities have studied the photo collection, listed under the name Fhoki [sic] Kayamori.\\"Fhoki\\" is impossible in Japanese, and presumably is a mistranscription of \\"Shoki\\". Kayamori family members have confirmed that the photographer's first name was actually Seiki, though Kayamori himself sometimes signed his name \\"Shoki.\\"The characters for \\"Seiki\\" can also be pronounced \\"Shoki\\". The Alaska Historical Library collection includes at least three pictures of Kayamori (ASL-P55-140, ASL-P55-197 & ASL-P55-714).

It is situated behind JP Nayak Hospital, the Gurudwara is a tribute to Mata Sundri, the wife of the 10th Guru – Guru Gobind Singh [4]. Mata Sundri was considered to be the first wife of the tenth Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708). The Delhi Gurdwara Committee constructed an imposing shrine on the site of the Haveli, where Mata Sundri stayed after the departure of the Guru to Deccan [5]. While some claim that Sangat (public) raised a shrine in her loving memory on the spot where she lived for half of her life. Most of the Sikhs believe that after the passing away of Guru Gobind Singh at Nanded in October 1708, she nurtured and guided the Khalsa for forty years after the Guru's death [6]. Sikhs followed her instructions and respected her [8], looked up to her for guidance. Mata Sundri Kaur left for her heavenly abode in 1747 at this place where now the temple resides and her last rites were performed at the place of Gurdwara Bala Sahib [8].  History  Mata Sundri was the daughter of Bhai Ram Saran, a Kumarav Khatri of Bijvara, in present-day Hoshiarpur, district of the Punjab. She was also known as Mata Jito[10], As a child, Sundri was extremely beautiful, so her parents gave her this name according to her looks. Since her father knew Guru Tegh Bahadur [11], it was then decided that she would marry to Guru Gobind Singh at Anandpur(Punjab)on 4 April 1684. On 26 January 1687, at Paonta, she gave birth to Ajit Singh, the eldest son of Guru Gobind Singh. But due to the battles between Guru Gobind Singh and the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, Mata Sundri’s son died [11]. Later on it is known that Mata Sundri adopted a child because he resembled to her late son Ajit Singh [3]. Guru Gobind Singh Ji went to Deccan from Talwandi Sabo (a place in Bathida District of Punjab State), Mata Sundri came to Delhi and stayed at the Haveli (house) of Bhai Jawahar Singh for some time [8]. In 1708, Guru Gobind died at Nanded in October 1708. Some Sikhs believe that Guru Gobind Singh left for his heavenly abode at Nanded (a place in Maharashtra State) [8]. From 1727 onwards the holy mother stayed in newly constructed building, then called Mata Sundri’s Haveli and now called Mata Sundri’s Gurudwara [9 . After which Mata Sundri herself guided the troubled community through this transition, as it is evident from extracted hukumnamas (written orders) issued with her seal and authority between 1717 and 1730. The grateful public raised in her memory a shrine on the spot where she lived half of her life  Architecture  The Temple is built in brick and lime mortar, on the farther end of the hall is a marble-paved gallery. The carved weed beam of the gallery bears an inscription in Gurmukhi script in bold letters. There is a marble slab in the center which surrounded by the inscribed sacred emblem of the Sikhs [3]. It has a standard square-domed sanctums, arched copings and a traditional styled entrance perfectly characterizes the religious structure of Gurudwara Mata Sundri [4].

A simultaneous referendum was supposed to be held in Abyei on whether to become part of Southern Sudan but it was postponed due to conflict over demarcation and residency rights. On 7 February 2011, the referendum commission published the final results, with a landslide majority of 98.83% voting in favour of independence. While the ballots were suspended in 10 of the 79 counties for exceeding 100% of the voter turnout, the number of votes was still well over the requirement of 60% turnout, and the majority vote for secession is not in question. The predetermined date for the creation of an independent state was 9 July 2011.Sudan referendum: what's being voted on and what will happen? The Telegraph. 8 January 2011 Background left The prerequisites for the referendum included a census, which was used to define how wealth and political power will be apportioned between regions. The census was the basis of a voter registration process, which was also used for the national elections in 2010, which in turn set the stage for the referendum. The census was delayed three times. Problems included disagreements between the north and south over what they are obliged to do by the Naivasha Agreement, funding difficulties and an enormous logistical challenge. In the south, unmapped minefields from the war continue to make movement difficult, while up to 5,000,000 Sudanese are nomadic. Up to 2,000,000 internally displaced persons from the south remain in camps around Khartoum, in the centre of the country, whilst refugees remain in Uganda and Kenya. A further complication results from the conflict in Darfur to the west, where civilians who have fled attacks refuse to take part in census out of fear that the government would use the results against them. Darfuri rebel groups are unanimous in their denunciation of the planned census, while the Justice and Equality Movement group has threatened to attack any census- taker.Henshaw, Amber, \\"Sudanese stand up to be counted\\", BBC News, 21 April 2008 There were disagreements between the National Congress Party (NCP) and the SPLA/M about what proportion of voters will have to be in favour of independence (the NCP wanted at least 75% support required), whether Southern Sudanese living in the north should be allowed to vote, and the post- referendum separation process (including the division of the national debt). Modest progress was made in early September 2010, but disagreements on fundamental points remain. It is envisaged that \\"popular consultations\\" in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, without a clear reference to referendums and/or independence, would raise concerns about the future of these regions.Will Sudan's Nuba Mountains be left high and dry? by Peter Martell, BBC News, 24 November 2009SUDAN: The Nuba Mountains – straddling the north-south divide, IRIN, 12 November 2009 According to the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (or CPA), in October 2009, the central government of Sudan and the South Sudanese government agreed that turnout would have to be at least 60% of 3,800,000 voters would be necessary to validate. In this case, a simple majority vote in favour of independence would result in secession for South Sudan;\\"Sudan referendum law endorsed in cabinet, 51% ‘Yes’ vote & 60% turnout required\\", Sudan Tribune, 14 February 2009.\\"Terms for Sudan referendum agreed\\", BBC News, 16 October 2009. should the turnout be insufficient in the first referendum, a second one will be held within sixty days. Campaign The flag of the Government of Southern Sudan Sudanese officials have said throughout campaigning that, regardless of their pro-unity or pro-separatist stance, the ultimate aim was a peaceful transition. Vice President Kiir acknowledged his administration had failed to deliver \\"the dividends of peace,\\" and noted that a campaign to confiscate arms was a solution to maintaining stability. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir said that the southern region had a right to choose to secede and that the referendum was helpful because unity \\"could not be forced by power.\\" He also said he would respect the outcome of the vote and support the south. However, he also said that though secession was a right it may not resolve issues for the south: \\"The stability of the south is very important to us because any instability in the south will have an impact on the north. If there is a war in your neighbour's house, you will not be at peace. The south suffers from many problems. It's been at war since 1959. The south does not have the ability to provide for its citizens or create a state or authority.\\" Negotiations continue between the ruling parties in the north and south on potential post-referendum arrangements—looking at future issues such as citizenship, security, finance and wealth sharing. Minister of Petroleum Mr. Deng said he fears that an immediate budget cut for the north would ignite a war. \\"In order to avoid conflict, we could look to a phase-out arrangement whereby you provide the north some [oil] until they get an alternative\\". The pipeline to export southern oil currently cuts through the north, and the south has not begun construction on a pipeline that would avoid that route. In an article published by The Washington Post on 21 September 2010, Deng noted that an interim agreement could help both north and south and result in a \\"win-win\\". The northern government said it would assume most of the country's $38,000,000,000 debt if secession was voted upon. National campaigns were being held by both parties to address issues of potential clashes ahead of the referendum. President Al-Bashir wanted to reassure and assuage tension surrounding the issue of citizenship rights in the case of South Sudan secession. He said that even if southerners opted for secession, \\"the sentimental unity and social relations between north and south Sudan will remain standing.\\" Al-Bashir vowed that the rights of southern citizens staying in the north after secession would be safeguarded, saying that his party would not allow anyone to infringe on the rights of southerners in the north, their properties, freedoms and residence regardless of citizenship. The northern Justice and Peace Forum Party advocated separation of the country citing unity as a \\"bad forced marriage.\\" Its chairman Al Taieb Mustafa said that the prospective support for the referendum would be \\"the real independence day for Sudan.\\" On 8 January, the mood in Juba, the southern capital, and the wider region was said to be jubilant with final pro-secession rallies celebrating independence in advance. =Egyptian and Libyan involvement= Early during the referendum process, an Egyptian proposal was made to have a confederation between the north and south of the country. However, President Omar al-Bashir said it was not being considered because the issue of the referendum was about \\"unity or separation. Our brothers in the south are refusing at the moment the proposal of confederation. If the separation was the result of the referendum, the two sides are going to negotiate over the future of relations between them.\\" Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi later went to Sudan to try to assuage the conflict, though both men had previously called for the country to stay united. Egypt's Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the meeting sought to ensure the referendum could be held in a \\"climate of freedom, transparency, and credibility, reflecting the will of the sons of the south\\" and also that both the South and North could strengthen bonds.N Africa leaders calm Sudan tension Al Jazeera, 21 December 2010 Issues Observers and key players feared violence ahead of the South Sudan referendum for a variety of reasons. =Abyei= Line for voter registration in Abyei, 2009 Talks on resolving the status and of the eligibility criteria for voters in the disputed Abyei region broke down in October 2010, although both the central ruling NCP and southern SPLM said their respective teams \\"will meet again in Ethiopia toward the end of October to continue their discussions. The parties continue to commit themselves to their mutual goal of avoiding a return to conflict.\\" Didiri Mohammad Ahmad, an NCP official, said it was \\"not possible\\" to hold the referendum on the future of Abyei on time, and it could be delayed for months or be settled without a vote. He added that \\"We agreed that in the next talks we will try to look for other alternatives.\\" Sudan's Defense Minister, Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein, suggested the vote may have to be postponed. \\"According to the reality on the ground...border issues and Abyei must be resolved within the framework of one nation because doing so in the framework of two countries open[s] the door for foreign interference. The referendum is not a goal but a tool to consolidate and promote security and stability. This [UDI] is illegal and will not be recognized by the African Union or the other [organizations] because it would contradict the peace agreement and its procedures.\\" Sudan's UN ambassador Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman told the Security Council that \\"It is evident that any attempt to conduct the plebiscite before achieving an acceptable settlement between the two parties [in Abyei] will mean only a return to war.\\" The United States said it was working to avoid the \\"danger\\" that would follow the failure to hold the referendum. The government Sudan asked the UN for the printing of ballots for the referendum as diplomats and the electoral commission warned of any further delay would miss the deadline to hold the election.South Sudan vote put in doubt Al Jazeera, 1 December 2010 Abyei was not finalized for the vote.Caught in Sudan's ethnic faultline Al Jazeera, 29 December 2010 Bishtina Mohammed El Salam of the Misseriya, who dominate the region along with the Dinka tribe, said he would not accept Abyei's seceding and joining the south even though the latter favored secession. \\"If the Dinka take this decision – to annex Abyei to the south – there will be an immediate war without any excuse. We think they should be reasonable and think about it. They should know that those who are pushing them to take that decision will not give them any back-up.\\" =South Kurdufan and Blue Nile= \\"South is for southerners\\" - tensions from the civil war were a factor in the vote. The status of the Nuba Mountains region of South Kurdufan and Blue Nile is more complex as ethnic data is less clear. In the Blue Nile, African ethnic groups such as the Berta, Anuak and Koma are dominant in the South. The Northern part, however, has an Arab majority, although the enclave of Ingessana in Tabi Hills is mostly Animist and was targeted by the northern forces during the civil war. The total population stands at 832,112 according to the Election Commission. During the 2010 provincial elections, the NCP won 29 out of the 48 seats, while the SPLM won 17 seats. In the National Assembly elections, the NCP won 6 out of the 10 seats, while the SPLM got 4. However, the SPLM accused the NCP of fraud. The separate gubernatorial election was won by the SPLM candidate, who polled almost 5% votes more than his NCP rival. The Nuba Mountain was home to some 1,000,000 ethnic Nuba during 1980. A total of 99 different tribes used to live in this region. When the civil war broke out during the late 1980s, the Nuba aligned with the SPLA. The vast majority of Nuba were taken as prisoners of war and forcibly relocated to camps in North Kordofan and Khartoum. When the fighting ended, only about half the population survived. The rest either surrendered and moved north or were killed during the fighting. After the signing of the peace accord, some of the Nuba returned to the mountains, but the tribal elders refused to re-admit them into the tribes as they feared the abductees (mostly young men) were too Islamised. They were finally allowed back into the tribal fold after a 6-month re- education camp. The SPLA controls four counties in Southern Kordofan: Lagawa, Kadugli, Rashad and Dilling. In 2005, the Arab dominated West Kordofan was merged in to South Kordofan, resulting in Arabs gaining a majority in the new province. The 2008 census reported the total population of South Kordofan at 1,406,404 (though the SPLA claims many ethnic Nuba living in remote regions were not counted). This figure includes the Abyei region and it is not known how many are Nuba, Ngok and Baggara. During the 2010 National Assembly election, the NCP won 13 out of the 17 seats, while the SPLM won 4 seats. The gubernatorial elections were postponed to 2011. During the 2010 Presidential elections, the NCP received 69.3% of the votes in South Kordofan and 56.6% in the Blue Nile, while the SPLM received 18.5% of the votes in South Kordofan and 32.7% in the Blue Nile. Ahmed Harun of NCP defeated Abdelaziz al-Hilu of the SPLM in the 2011 South Kordofan Gubernatorial elections. Harun received 201,455 votes compared to Hilu's 194,955 votes. NCP won 33 seats in the legislature to SPLM's 22 seats. SPLM refused to acknowledge the results, accusing the NCP of voter intimidation and electoral fraud. =Religion and tribes= Religion was also expected to significantly influence the referendum. Christian commentators have noted that there is a \\"climate of chronic discrimination against Sudanese Christians and other minorities.\\" For some, religion was not the issue,\\"Racism undermines Sudanese unity\\". Al Jazeera, 22 December 2010 while other southerners objected to alleged \\"Islamisation.\\" Some Southern Sudanese had also claimed that tribalism and racism affected their choice. South Sudanese Muslims supported secession. South Sudan's Muslims welcome secession, Agence France-Presse President Omar al-Bashir said dual citizenship would not be allowed. According to the CPA, 20 percent of civil service jobs were reserved for southerners, which would then be lost if the country splits. Questions were also asked about the status of tribes such as the Nuba and Misseriya of South Kordofan that inhabit the border regions with South Sudan. Polls When questioned in a poll prior to the official referendum, 97% of South Sudanese people said that they would be voting for independence. An early poll of 1,400 individuals was carried out by a coalition of civil society organisations in Southern Sudan prior to the January referendum, indicating that 97% of voters would likely vote for secession. According to John Andruga, chairman of the coalition, 100% of respondents in the states of Unity and Eastern Equatoria would vote for secession. A similar survey carried out one year prior by the US-based National Democratic Institute had indicated that 90% of voters would vote for secession. Controversies Authorities in both the north and south of Sudan have been accused of harassment and intimidation against the media in order to avoid dissenting coverage. Rights groups warned the media could be slapped with further restrictions. The Youth and Sports Minister, Haj Majid Suwar, of the National Congress Party (NCP) suggested the government \\"may not recognise the results\\" and would \\"talk to ... the USA and the UN and the AU and say that the Sudan People's Liberation Movement didn't fulfill the CPA Comprehensive Peace Agreement\\" by allowing open campaigning and the withdrawal of their soldiers from southern areas. He also said that the potential borders between them would have to be drawn up pending redeployment of the SPLM's forces to the 1956 border.Associated Press Salva Kiir, the president of the southern region and the first vice president of Sudan, said that the referendum's timing was important as there was \\"a risk of a return to war in case of delay or denial of this exercise, and it would be on a very massive scale.\\" Kuol Deim Kuol, the spokesman for the SPLM's military, accused the NCP of \\"just looking for a pretext of starting a war\\" and called Suwar a \\"war monger.\\" Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accused the SPLM of breaching the terms of the peace deal and warned of a return to conflict if the disputes were not settled before the referendum. Despite that, he said he was committed to holding the referendum, but insisted on settling differences over the shared border and how to share the oil, debt and Nile river water. The NCP accused the SPLM of discouraging southerners who were living in the north of the country from registering, as the SPLM threatened not to recognize the referendum if its demands were not met. Southerners in the North were reluctant to vote because of fears of being uprooted from their homes.Reluctance in Sudan referendum Al Jazeera, 30 November 2010 Muslims in the border provinces of the South also expressed fear of a campaign of violence that could be unleashed as a consequence of the referendum.South Sudan braces for trouble Al Jazeera, 30 November 2010 Many feared a return to civil war, should the referendum fail because of the increasingly heated rhetoric. Along with Chad, Sudan sought to secure the border area ahead of the referendum.Sudan, Chad in joint army operation Al Jazeera, 12 December 2010 In addition to warnings of civil war, it was also read that a possible civil war could involve the Lord's Resistance Army and bring Uganda into the conflict.\\"People and Power.\\" Al Jazeera English. 9 January 2011. Despite rifts amongst Southern parties, more than 20 parties ironed over their differences to put a show of unity before the referendum. Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal also said the referendum could \\"reignite violence...rather than bring peace,\\" while he said the vote must be \\"fair and free.\\" The United States extended sanctions against Sudan on 1 November 2010 in order to pressure the government to stick to the referendum deadline. The US then offered to drop Sudan from a US list of state-sponsors of terrorism if the two referenda were held on time and the results were respected. They again partook in a statement before the referendum in lauding al-Bashir's statement to respect the vote. Following concerns from the UN about delays, representatives of both regions affirmed a commitment to hold the referendum on time; a media campaign was also launched to raise awareness and increase the turnout. Minni Minnawi, the only Sudan Liberation Army faction signatory to the Darfur Peace Agreement, quit the agreement and resigned his post as Special Advisor to the President, saying the deal had failed. He consequently moved to Juba in the south saying the referendum would be successful as southerners \\"reject the policy of this [Khartoum] government\\" and the north would then be a \\"failed state.\\" In return, the government declared Minnawi an \\"enemy\\" and closed his Khartoum office.Darfur leader 'ready to do battle' Al Jazeera, 13 December 2010 In December 2010, the Constitutional Court agreed to carry out an investigation into a petition filed by local lawyers seeking the dissolution of the electoral body that was organizing the referendum.Sudan's highest court to probe vote complaints Reuters, 15 December 2010 Despite calls from the government in southern Sudan that northerners living in the south should be protected, some northerners who were uncertain of their future in an independent state started heading north. =Violence= Two days prior to the vote, David Yau Yau's militia and the SPLA clashed outside Pibor.http://allafrica.com/stories/201212260784.html External precedents Questions were asked if a positive vote on the referendum would set a precedent for other secessionist movements on the African continent. An Al Jazeera English analysis said a few reasons for seeking secession were: a lack of expertise by post-colonial political elites in governing their respective countries and managing natural resources; the impact of the Cold War where many African countries took sides, rendering sovereignty ineffective; tribal prejudices and preferential service that dominate African politics; failure of governments to provide basic freedoms such as guaranteeing full citizenship for all. Citing these examples, it asked where such a precedent for secession could lead: East Sudan and Darfur, Nigeria or South Africa. As two important members of the African Union the latter two could be reluctant to support a new independent southern Sudan as a recognition thereof could \\"send a very clear message to these groups in their struggle for autonomy.\\" Monitors Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former Tanzanian Prime Minister Joseph Warioba led the Carter Center international observation delegation. US Senator John Kerry, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited Southern Sudan three times during the referendum period, including during polling. Actor George Clooney, who is supporting the Satellite Sentinel Project (using satellites as a conflict early warning system for Sudan), also made visits to Sudan during the referendum period. Several major regional organisations deployed international observers, including the African Union, the European Union, the League of Arab States and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). These organisations issued a joint press statement on the first day of polling. Domestic observation organisations also deployed Sudanese men and women to observe the process, these included the Sudanese Network for Democratic Elections (SuNDE), the Sudan Domestic Elections Monitoring Programme (SuDEMOP) and the Sudanese Group for Democracy and Elections (SuGDE). Other national civil society organisations were also accredited as observers. Normally, the UN does not deploy electoral observers, however, in response to a request from the parties of the CPA, the United Nations Secretary-General's Panel on the Referenda in Sudan was established. The panel is composed of three senior officials, former Tanzania President Benjamin Mkapa, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal António Monteiro, and Bhojraj Pokharel, a former Chairman of the Election Commission of Nepal, who are appointed by and report to the UN Secretary-General. The panel made periodic visits to Sudan during the referendum period and is supported by field reporting officers and stakeholder-observer liaison officers. Registration Registration for the vote started on 15 November with Salva Kiir's appeal for registering en masse. Many of those who fled South Sudan during the civil war returned in the months and weeks leading up to the referendum, with some southern politicians trying to have them play a role in swinging the vote towards independence. Almost four million citizens registered before the deadline on 5 December; as the stream of returnees continued unabated, however, many arrived too late to register for the referendum.Registration starts for Sudan vote Al Jazeera, 15 November 2010 Results Voting form used in the referendum. Voting on the referendum began on 9 January 2011. On 12 January, after three days of voting, representatives of the SPLA/M announced that, according to their estimates, the 60 percent turnout threshold required for the referendum's validity (corresponding to around 2.3 million voters) had been reached. Official confirmation came later the same day when the referendum commission released a statement announcing that turnout would \\"exceed\\" the required 60 percent threshold. Jimmy Carter expressed his belief on 13 January that the referendum would likely meet international standards for both the conduct of the vote and freedom of voters. The United Nations reported that preliminary results would be expected by 2 February 2011, with final results expected within the following two weeks. According to preliminary counts reviewed by the Associated Press, consisting of 30,000 ballots in 10 polling stations, the sample had a 95% turnout with 96% in favour of secession, 3% in favour of unity and the rest invalid. Mohamed Ibrahim Khalil, chairman of the referendum commission, said 83 percent of eligible voters in the south and 53 percent in the north had voted. The South Sudan Referendum Commission affirmed the validity of the vote, however the vote was still ongoing at the time. As voting ended, Sudan again vowed to recognise the result. =Diaspora voting= Southerners living in Darfur were given the opportunity to vote in the referendum from special polling stations as some tribes advocated unity and others supported separation with possible ominous precedence for Darfur itself. Polling stations were also set up in eight countries with large South Sudanese populations, namely Australia, Canada, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, where an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 South Sudanese nationals reside, polling booths were opened in eight states: Virginia, Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Tennessee, Nebraska, Arizona and Washington. Similar polling booths were set up in the Canadian cities of Calgary and Toronto, to cater to the South Sudanese community there; an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Sudanese live in Canada, about 2,200 of whom had registered to vote in either of the two cities. Members of the South Sudanese diaspora have been split as to their support for or against separation; members of some tribes advocate unity, while members of other tribes supported separation. Some Canadian Sudanese have called for a boycott of the referendum, accusing the International Organization for Migration, which was tasked with operating the vote in that country, of \\"being influenced by the government in Khartoum.\\" Calgary-based journalist Mading Ngor of The New Sudan Vision dismissed these claims as \\"a conspiracy theory,\\" adding \\"It's a very fragmented community here along tribal lines.\\" Although over 99% of those in the South voted for independence, 42% of those who lived in the north at the time voted for unity. =Security= Several days before voting began, the SPLA/M and a rebel faction led by Lieutenant General George Athor in Jonglei State agreed to a ceasefire agreement after nearly a year of fighting, meaning a halt to military operations, troop movement and recruitment by either side. The agreement was seen as important for a \\"peaceful voting environment\\". The day before voting began, at least six people were killed in clashes between South Sudan security forces and a pro-Khartoum Sudan militia in Unity state. One person was also killed in clashes between the Misseriya tribe and police in Abyei. The SPLA/M said the fighting started a day earlier because of the Misseriya. One day into the vote, on 10 January, a further 6 people were killed in clashes near Abyei, bringing the total to 30 dead in that region.Clashes during south Sudan referendum, James Copnall, BBC, 10 January 2011 Last updated at 22:13. =Reactions= U.S. Senator John Kerry said that the referendum represented a \\"new chapter\\" for Sudan. ;Domestic As of 15 January, Radio France Internationale reported that the Sudanese central government in Khartoum had begun to recall ambassadors named by the SPLA as part of the CPA and had stopped shipping material for passports to Juba.Radio France International, Southern government reacts to Khartoum provocation, 15 January 2011 Sudan also became the first state to recognize South Sudan. ; International President of the United States Barack Obama said the result of the vote was \\"inspiring\\" as voters decided \\"their own future [and marked] another step forward in Africa's long journey toward justice and democracy\\". He also said that the United States would recognize South Sudan's independence when it is formalized in July. Salva Kiir met the leaders of the Polisario Front Mohammed Abdel-Aziz at an African Union summit. Abdel-Aziz congratulated Kiir for on a successful referendum process. He lauded \\"the wisdom and courage\\" of people of South Sudan people for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and expressed his hope that post-referendum arrangements and agreements could be finishing in the interim period before statehood. He also briefed Kiir of the Western Sahara's process to a similar referendum. Analysis The precedence of the vote was seen as important because most African states' borders were decided during colonial times which resulted in a heterogeneous mix of religions, ethnicities, and cultures. The Organisation of African Unity, however, refrained from redrawing boundaries for the fear that wars of secession could be sparked. Post-electoral issues New names for an independent country were being suggested, with South Sudan being controversial as it does not offer a break from Sudan. Over 12 names had been suggested, including: Nile Republic, Jubian Republic, Kush Republic and Azania. The SPLM proposed naming the country South Sudan, with Nile Republic, Jubian Republic, Kush Republic as other possibilities. The country was then officially named the Republic of South Sudan. Amongst the issues to be handled by a new government are job creation. =Violence= The Minister of Cooperatives and Rural Development Jimmy Lemi Milla was shot dead in his office along with his bodyguard in an apparent personal feud.

Life He was the son of George IX of Imereti, who had briefly ruled in 1741. After the death of his cousin, King Solomon I, he became a regent but prevented the rival princes David (the future king Solomon II) and George from being crowned.Rayfield, p. 251 With the support of Katsia II Dadiani, prince of Mingrelia, he seized the throne and proclaimed himself king on May 4, 1784. He attempted to establish a contact with Imperial Russia and to restrict the powers of great nobles. In 1787 David sent the poet Besiki ostensibly to negotiate with the Russians (Besiki was rumoured to be the lover of David’s queen). Besiki lingered in the Ukraine until 1789, forbidden to proceed to St Petersburg, and eventually dying in Iaşi.Rayfield, p. 254 David's policy drew many leading aristocrats, including the Mingrelian prince Grigol Dadiani, into opposition. In 1789, King Heraclius II of Georgia sent his army into Imereti and helped David-Solomon to expel David II into Akhaltsikhe in the Ottoman- held Georgian province. In 1790, he returned with a Turkish force and deposed Solomon II, but was eventually defeated and fled Imereti. Later, through the mediation of Heraclius, David was allowed to return to Imereti and granted a fiefdom.

Grennfelt. 1988. Critical loads for sulphur and nitrogen. UNECE/Nordic Council workshop report, Skokloster, Sweden. March 1988. Air pollution research in relation to critical loads has focused on nitrogen and sulfur pollutants. After these pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere, they are subsequently deposited into ecosystems. Both sulfur and nitrogen deposition can acidify surface waters and soils. As added acidity lowers the pH of water, fish and invertebrate health are negatively impacted.Greaver, T. L., T. J. Sullivan, J. D. Herrick, M. C. Barber, J. S. Baron, B. J. Cosby, M. E. Deerhake, R.

Acidic Deposition in the Northeastern United States: Sources and Inputs, Ecosystem Effects, and Management Strategies. BioScience 51:180-198. Nitrogen deposition can also act as a fertilizer in the environment and alter the competitive interactions of plants, thereby favoring the growth of some plant species and inhibiting others, potentially leading to changes in species composition and abundance. The deposition of nitrogen contributes to nutrient enrichment in freshwater, coastal, and estuarine ecosystems, which may cause toxic algal blooms, fish kills, and loss of biodiversity.Bobbink, R., K. Hicks, J. Galloway, T. Spranger, R. Alkemade, M. Ashmore, M. Bustamante, S. Cinderby, E. Davidson, F. Dentener, B. Emmett, J.-W. Erisman, M. Fenn, F. Gilliam, A. Nordin, L. Pardo, and W.

Effects of nitrogen deposition and empirical nitrogen critical loads for ecoregions of the United States. Ecological Applications 21:3049-3082. Air pollutants impact essential ecosystem services such as air and water purification, decomposition and detoxification of waste materials, and climate regulation. When deposition is greater than the critical load of a pollutant for a particular location, it is considered a critical load exceedance, meaning the biota are at increased risk of ecological harm. Some components of an ecosystem are more sensitive to deposition than others; therefore, critical loads can be developed for a variety of ecosystem components and responses, including (but not limited to) shifts in diatoms, increases in invasive grass species, changes in soil chemistry, decreased forest health, altered and reduced biodiversity, and lake and stream acidification. The history, terminology, and approach used to calculate critical loads differ by region and country. The differences between approaches used by European countries and in the U.S. are discussed below.  Europe  In European countries, critical loads and the similar concept of critical levels have been used extensively within the 1979 UN-ECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. As an example the 1999 Gothenburg protocol to the LRTAP convention takes into account acidification (of surface waters and soils), eutrophication of soils and ground-level ozone and the emissions of sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxide and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). For acidification and eutrophication the critical loads concept was used, whereas for ground-level ozone the critical levels were used instead. To calculate a critical load, the target ecosystem must first be defined and in that ecosystem (e.g. a forest) a sensitive \\"element\\" must be identified (e.g. forest growth rate). The next step is to link the status of that element to some chemical criterion (e.g. the base cation to aluminium ratio, Bc/Al) and a critical limit (e.g. Bc/Al=1) which should not be violated. Finally, a mathematical model (e.g. the Simple Mass Balance model, SMB) needs to be created so that the deposition levels that result in the chemical criterion reaching exactly the critical limit can be calculated. That deposition level is called the critical load and the difference between the current deposition level and the critical load is called exceedance. In the early days, critical loads were often calculated as a single value, e.g. critical load of acidity. Today a two-dimensional critical load function is often calculated, with the x-axis as N-deposition and the y-axis as S-deposition. The critical loads concept is a steady-state concept and that it therefore includes no information whatsoever regarding how long it takes before effects are visible. A simplified illustration of dynamic aspects is the target load function, which is the load at which the chemical criterion recovers before a chosen year, the target year. Thus, for target years in the near future the target load function is lower than the critical load and for target years in the distant future the target load function approaches the critical load function. Calculating critical load functions and target load functions include several simplifications and thus can be viewed as a risk concept: The higher the exceedance the higher the risk for adverse effects and there is a certain risk that zero exceedance will still lead to adverse effects.  United States  In the U.S., while various entities were discussing critical loads prior to 2000, efforts were independent and disjointed. However, in 2010, following a series of critical loads workshops from 2003 to 2005 and an ad hoc committee established in 2006, national efforts were unified through the development of the Critical Loads of Atmospheric Deposition (CLAD) Science Committee as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP). CLAD is a multi-agency group consisting of federal and state government agencies, non-governmental organizations, environmental research organizations, and universities. The goals of CLAD are to: facilitate sharing of technical information on critical loads topics within a broad multi-agency/entity audience, fill gaps in critical loads development in the U.S., provide consistency in development and use of critical loads in the U.S., and promote understanding of critical loads approaches through development of outreach and communications materials. Federal Land Managers, such as the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, use critical loads to: identify resources at risk, focus research and monitoring efforts, inform planning and other land management activities, evaluate potential impacts of emission increases, and develop pollution reduction strategies. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expanding use of critical loads for assessments and policy development, including consideration of critical loads when setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The U.S. has adopted two approaches for creating critical loads: empirical and steady-state mass balance critical loads. Empirical critical loads are derived based on observations of ecosystem responses (such as changes in plant diversity, soil nutrient levels, or fish health) to specific deposition levels. These relationships are created using dose-response studies or by measuring ecosystem responses to increasing gradients of deposition over space or time. Steady-state mass balance critical loads are derived from mathematical mass-balance models under assumed or modeled equilibrium conditions. A steady-state condition may be achieved far into the future. The models used to determine steady-state critical loads vary in complexity with regard to process representation but can include water and soil chemistry, mineral soil weathering rates, deposition data, and ecological response data.  Asia  In Asia, both empirical and steady-state mass balance approaches have been used to estimate critical loads.Liu, X.J., L. Duan, J.M. Mo, E.Z. Du, J.L. Shen, X.K. Lu, Y. Zhang, X.B. Zhou, C.E. He, and F.S. Zhang. 2011. Nitrogen deposition and its ecological impact in China: an overview. Environmental Pollution 159:2251-2264.Duan, L., Q. Yu, Q. Zhang, Z. Wang, Y. Pan, T. Larssen, J. Tang, and J. Mulder. 2016. Acid deposition in Asia: emissions, deposition, and ecosystem effects. Atmospheric Environment 146:55-69. Empirical critical loads were simply determined as the deposition levels with reported field occurrence of detrimental ecological effects. The steady-state mass balance model calculates the critical load of an ecosystem over the long-term by defining acceptable values for elements leaching out of the ecosystem. Although empirical nitrogen critical loads have been well summarized for Europe and the United States, large uncertainties still exist in Asia due to very limited and short-term experimental studies by using relatively high levels of nitrogen application. In regions (e.g., eastern and southern China) where historical nitrogen deposition has already been very high and perhaps even higher than the actual critical load, experimental studies may fail to quantify the critical loads because substantial ecosystem changes had already occurred. Moreover, the values of the critical loads can vary remarkably when based on different biological or chemical response of an ecosystem, such as physiological variation, reduced biodiversity, elevated nitrate leaching, and changes in soil microorganisms. Empirical critical loads have been assessed for some forests and grasslands in China, but the values for many other ecosystems remain unassessed. With more emerging field experiments, critical loads will be better estimated in the near future. In South and East Asia, comprising China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Indo- China, Indonesia, and the Indian subcontinent, critical loads were first computed and mapped as part of the impact module of the Asian version of the Regional Air pollution INformation and Simulation model (RAINS-Asia) based on the steady-state mass balance approach.Hettelingh, J.P., H. Sverdrup, and D. Zhao. 1995. Deriving critical loads for Asia. Water, Air, and Soil Pollution 85(4):2565-2570. Thereafter, critical loads with higher resolution were calculated in many Asian countries such as Japan, Russia, South Korea, India, and China. Although similar methods were applied in Asia as in Europe, the steady state mass balance approach has been improved by considering base cation deposition. Steady-state mass balance critical loads have been used to designate Acid Rain Control Zones and Sulphur Dioxide Pollution Control Zones in China. In the near future, critical loads will be more widely applied to guide emission abatement strategies.

Background The HLA system recycles energy by converting kinetic energy into potential energy during deceleration via hydraulics, storing the energy at high pressure in an accumulator filled with nitrogen gas. The energy is then returned to the vehicle during subsequent acceleration thereby reducing the amount of work done by the internal combustion engine. This system provides considerable increase in vehicle productivity while reducing fuel consumption in stop-and-go use profiles like refuse vehicles and other heavy duty vehicles. Parallel vs. series hybrids The HLA system is called a parallel hydraulic hybrid. In parallel systems the original vehicle drive-line remains, allowing the vehicle to operate normally when the HLA system is disengaged. When the HLA is engaged, energy is captured during deceleration and released during acceleration, in contrast to series hydraulic hybrid systems which replace the entire traditional drive-line to provide power transmission in addition to regenerative braking. Hydraulic vs. electric hybrids Hydraulic hybrids are said to be power dense, while electric hybrids are energy dense. This means that electric hybrids, while able to deliver large amounts of energy over long periods of time are limited by the rate at which the chemical energy in the batteries is converted to mechanical energy and '. This is largely governed by reaction rates in the battery and current ratings of associated components. Hydraulic hybrids on the other hand are capable of transferring energy at a much higher rate, but are limited by the amount of energy that can be stored. For this reason, hydraulic hybrids lend themselves well to stop-and-go applications and heavy vehicles. Applications =Concept vehicles= Ford Motor Company included the HLA system in their 2002 F-350 Tonka truck concept vehicle, reported to have lower emissions and better fuel economy than any V-8 diesel truck engine of the time, with HLA designed to eventually improve fuel economy by 25%-35% in heavy truck city driving. =Shuttle bus= Eaton, Ford, the US Army, and IMPACT Engineering, Inc. (of Kent, Washington), built an E-450 shuttle bus as part of the Army's HAMMER (Hydraulic Hybrid Advanced Materials Multifuel Engine Research) project. =Refuse= Eaton has been awarded the Texas government’s New Technology Research and Development grant to build 12 refuse vehicles with HLA systems. Peterbilt Motors has designed a Model 320 chassis that incorporates the HLA system, which was featured on the cover of the December 13, 2007, issue of Machine Design.

(1969) is a television special adaptation of Cinderella featuring The Muppets. Kermit the Frog hosts the special with King Goshposh and Rufus (from the Tales of the Tinkerdee and The Land of Tinkerdee pilots) and Splurge (the first full-bodied Muppet) appearing in this special as well. The music score was composed by Joe Raposo.IMDB The one-hour special was first shown on the CBC on March 16, 1969, and on ABC on April 10, 1970. It was later re-aired in syndication, alongside The Muppet Show. Plot The story follows Cinderella (Belinda Montgomery): a beautiful girl who is forced to do all the chores by her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters with only her dog Rufus to help her. At the palace, King Goshposh (performed by Jim Henson) is bored and wishes to throw a party so that he may be given presents. As an excuse, he decides that his son Prince Arthur Charming (Robin Ward), ought to wed and use the ball as a means to find a suitable princess bride. Arthur does not like this arrangement and while gardening explains to his friend Kermit the Frog (also performed by Jim Henson) that every girl who knows him is a snob. His only hope to find an unsnobbish girl is to find a girl who does not recognize him as the prince. Shortly after, Cinderella meets Arthur in the gardens as she is fulfilling a task given to her by her stepmother (to muddy her shoes, dirty the kitchen floor, and then scrub the floor). Seeing that Cinderella does not recognize him as the prince, he introduces himself as Arthur the gardener and secures an invitation for her by convincing his father to invite every person in the land to the ball rather than just the princesses (the king agrees, as it will get him more presents). Because the ball is a masquerade, Arthur and Cinderella decide to each wear a geranium as a means of recognizing the other. The night of the ball, the stepfamily leave with a gift of old socks for the king. Cinderella is only allowed to attend if she finishes her chores, and finds a suitable dress, carriage, and coachman for the ball before the last minute (an impossible task, as she is told this at the last minute). When Cinderella dreams of attending the dance as well, her fairy godmother appears (who had been seen prior, attempting to turn a pumpkin into a coach as a magic trick, but gets pelted every time she fails). In a rare instance of her magic working, the fairy godmother provides Cinderella with a beautiful dress and glass slippers. She convinces Kermit to drive the carriage (though he refuses to turn human for it). It is pulled by his monster friend Splurge after he accidentally scares away all the horses. The fairy godmother warns Cinderella to be home by twelve and attends the ball as well, to make sure the deadline is met. Unfortunately, the King decided to give all guests a geranium to wear so Arthur and Cinderella are unable to recognize each other. When they dance, Cinderella knows Arthur only as \\"Prince Charming\\" and he knows her only as a mysterious maiden. At the stroke of midnight, the fairy godmother and Cinderella run from the palace leaving behind only one glass slipper which Arthur accidentally steps on and smashes. Determined to force Arthur to marry the \\"mysterious maiden\\", the king first hires all his horses and men (a reference to Humpty Dumpty) to put the slipper back together and - when that is unsuccessful—look in all the unlikely places for the other one. Cinderella learns of this plan and though she realizes that she is the maiden they are searching for, she wishes to marry Arthur the gardener and not the prince. She convinces Rufus to bury the slipper, only for the prince to arrive and for Cinderella to realize that he and the gardener are the same person. She tries to explain that she's the mysterious princess, yet no one believes her. Finally, the fairy godmother appears, but in an attempt to turn Cinderella's rags back into the ball gown, Cinderella vanishes. In the meantime, Kermit and Splurge return the slipper. After a number of times, Cinderella appears in ball regalia, and she and the prince are finally married (with Kermit commenting that he could have solved the mystery much sooner, had he only been asked). Afterwards, Kermit receives a personal invitation to Arthur and Cinderella's royal wedding. Sitting by a well and reading it, it includes he must bring a present for King Goshposh. After reading it, he remarks \\"How's that for a Happily ever after?\\" before jumping backwards into the well. Development Hey, Cinderella! was originally conceived as a Snow White series by new CBS children's programming executive Fred Silverman, as a fallback option during contract negotiations with Captain Kangaroo's Bob Keeshan. Silverman brought in Jon Stone and Tom Whedon, whom he had worked with on the CBS Children's Film Festival, to write the pilot, and Jim Henson, who recommended using his Muppets over the realistic-looking animal puppets Stone and Whedon had envisioned in their original draft, as producer/director. When CBS re-signed Keeshan, development on Snow White halted, and Silverman gave Stone and Whedon permission to shop their pilot around. After the writers got ABC's approval, the network insisted they change the story's heroine to Cinderella. The series idea got axed when ABC's Roone Arledge landed a Saturday NCAA college football game-of-the-week broadcast deal, requiring a revamp of their late morning/early afternoon Saturday schedule. The pilot was revised to a one-hour special, and Henson filmed it in Canada (presumably at CBC's studios in Toronto) in the fall of 1968. This project was the first collaboration of future Sesame Street-ers Henson, Joe Raposo, and Stone.Michael Davis, Street Gang, Chapter 6.

Like the Combatant Status Review Tribunals, also run by OARDEC, the Boards form were modeled after the US Department of Defense's Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunals, but differed in its mandate. All three procedures consisted of at least three officers, of whom the most senior was to be of field grade. The AR 1900-8 Tribunals was to set out the details of how the US military was to comply with the US's obligations, under the Third Geneva Convention, to convene a \\"competent tribunal\\" to determine the status of captives whose status was in doubt. Competent tribunals, like the AR 190-8 Tribunal, are authorized to determine that captives are innocent civilians, lawful combatants, or combatants who have violated the laws of war. According to the Geneva Conventions, innocent civilians should be immediately released; lawful combatants should enjoy the protections of POW status until hostilities are over; and only those determined to have violated the laws of war can face charges for hostile activity. The position of the George W. Bush Presidency was that captives apprehended during the \\"war on terror\\" were not eligible for the protections of the Geneva Conventions. The United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush that captives could not be held indefinitely. Captives were to receive annual Administrative Review Board hearings, to determine if they continued to pose a threat to the US, or whether they continued to hold any intelligence value. In practice the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba contains over one hundred captives who do not receive annual Administrative Review Board hearings, because their Combatant Status Review Tribunal had already been determined not to have been enemy combatants, or because an earlier Administrative Review Board had already determined that they should be released.
