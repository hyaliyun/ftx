History The lands of P√∂hlde were given in dower in c 927 to Queen Matilda by her husband, Henry I the Fowler (d. 936). This is the earliest written record of the place. Dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saint Servatius, the abbey was founded in 952 by Matilda and received generous endowments from her son, Emperor Otto I. It benefited greatly from its close connection to the imperial palace then also situated at P√∂hlde, and for a time was one of the wealthiest monasteries in Germany. The foundation was originally for Canons regular, but it adopted the Rule of St. Benedict in 952. In 1131 it joined the Premonstratensian Order. In 1200 the old Romanesque church burnt down. Its Gothic successor was consecrated in 1240. In 1525 both church and monastery were destroyed by peasants from Eichsfeld in the Peasants' War. The monks moved to Duderstadt. In 1533 in the Reformation Duke Philip of Grubenhagen dissolved the abbey and took over its property. In 1629 a brief attempt to revive the abbey ended in failure. Later in the Thirty Years' War what little remained on the site was completely destroyed. After the return of peace the present half-timbered village church was built on the foundations of the nave of the destroyed abbey church. Present site There are no visible traces of the abbey left. Between 1971 and 1974 the remains of the abbey were uncovered during archaeological excavations, but for their better preservation were covered over again. The remains of the palace, to which the abbey buildings were physically connected, were also excavated at about the same time, but were also covered over again. References * Heine, H.-W., 1995.

Background By 2002, Sparks had released eighteen albums, the last several of them in the new wave/synthpop vein. While this had been successful, breaking them in the US with 1983's \\"Cool Places\\" and in Germany with \\"When Do I Get To Sing 'My Way'?\\" in 1995, it had not secured them much critical acclaim or a consistent audience. 1997's Plagiarism, which consisted entirely of new recordings of earlier material, had been intended to introduce the group's back catalog to their new German audience, while building on the success with high-profile collaborations for the UK and US audience. It had only been partially successful. The next album, Balls, had not been at all successful and was generally perceived as Sparks treading water. The duo had already written an entire album's worth of material for a follow-up, but found that they were unenthusiastic with the results and so the album was scrapped, a decision which they admitted was difficult but ultimately crucial for them to continue challenging themselves and evolving their sound. Sparks then decided to change track, dropping the synthpop sound, reducing the musical palette and developing the music upon piano lines and lyrics of Ron Mael and the vocals of Russell Mael. In 2001, the Maels were commissioned by a German broadcasting company to produce a song for G√ºnther Koch Revisited (Voll In Den Mann), an album that featured samples of sports commentator G√ºnther Koch set to music. The band's contribution, \\"Wunderbar\\", placed Koch's highly-spirited exclamations over an orchestral backing. The duo acknowledged that making the track provided them a blueprint for the direction that they would take on Lil' Beethoven. As has been the case with each Sparks album since 1988's Interior Design, the album was self-produced by the duo and recorded in Russell Mael's home studio. Sound Described by the band themselves as a \\"career-defining opus\\", Lil' Beethoven saw the duo move into a more classical-influenced sound, with a heavy reliance on repetitive lyrics and piano lines, synthesized orchestration and multi-tracked vocals in place of percussion. Opening track \\"The Rhythm Thief\\" is an overall introduction to the band's new direction by declaring \\"say goodbye to the beat\\". \\"My Baby's Taking Me Home\\" largely consists of the title repeated over 100 times with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, \\"Your Call Is Very Important To Us\\" uses a corporation style call-hold message: \\"Your call is very important to us. Please hold\\" which is then sung with some additional words: \\"At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold.\\" The only other lyrics in the song are \\"Red light\\", \\"Green light\\", \\"I'm Getting Mixed Signals\\" and \\"Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold\\". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect. The majority of the sounds on Lil' Beethoven were produced with a Yamaha S80 keyboard. Reaction The album was critically applauded, which led to renewed interest in the band; Record Collector magazine named the album as one of its Best New Albums of 2002, describing it as \\"... possibly the most exciting and interesting release ever from such a long established act\\" and later in 2003 saying \\"... it really does feel like one of the best albums ever made.\\" Release Lil' Beethoven, while critically acclaimed, did not chart inside the top 100 in the UK, Germany or the US. It was released in a limited edition which had hard-cover book binding. The album was promoted by the single Suburban Homeboy: it, too, did not chart. The single was backed two b-sides, an extended version of Suburban Homeboy (Suburban Homeboy (Extended \\"Ron Speaks\\" Version)) and Wunderbar (Concerto In Koch Minor), which samples the voice of German sports commentator G√ºnther Koch. Re-release In March 2004, Sparks re-issued Lil' Beethoven in a deluxe edition. This version had a black sleeve as opposed to the white original, and included three audio tracks (two of which were exclusive), a video of \\"The Rhythm Thief\\" (directed by long-time collaborators Kuntzel+Deygas), a short film by Ron Mael, and a screensaver. An LP version of the album (which did not include any bonus tracks) was also released at the same time. A DVD produced by Demon Vision was also released of a live performance of the album. The live performance was filmed in March 2004 at the S√∂dra Teatern in Stockholm, Sweden. The DVD features the album performed in full and in order, followed by a set of twelve other Sparks songs.

The most widely used standard on which an EMS is based is International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001.Melnyk, Steven A., Robert P. Sroufe, and Roger Calantone. \\"Assessing the Impact of Environmental Management Systems on Corporate and Environmental Performance.\\" Alternatives include the EMAS. An environmental management information system (EMIS) or Environmental Data Management System (EDMS) is an information technology solution for tracking environmental data for a company as part of their overall environmental management system. Goals The goals of EMS are to increase compliance and reduce waste:Sayre, D., 1996. Inside ISO 14001: the competitive advantage of environmental management. St. Lucie Press, Delray,Beach, FL. *Compliance is the act of reaching and maintaining minimal legal standards. By not being compliant, companies may face fines, government intervention or may not be able to operate. *Waste reduction goes beyond compliance to reduce environmental impact. The EMS helps to develop, implement, manage, coordinate and monitor environmental policies. Waste reduction begins at the design phase through pollution prevention and waste minimization. At the end of the life cycle, waste is reduced by recycling. To meet these goals, the selection of environmental management systems is typically subject to a certain set of criteria: a proven capability to handle high frequency data, high performance indicators, transparent handling and processing of data, powerful calculation engine, customised factor handling, multiple integration capabilities, automation of workflows and QA processes and in-depth, flexible reporting.  Features  An environmental management system (EMS): * Serves as a tool, or process, to improve environmental performance and information mainly \\"design, pollution control and waste minimization, training, reporting to top management, and the setting of goals\\" * Provides a systematic way of managing an organization's environmental affairs * Is the aspect of the organization's overall management structure that addresses immediate and long-term impacts of its products, services and processes on the environment. EMS assists with planning, controlling and monitoring policies in an organization. * Gives order and consistency for organizations to address environmental concerns through the allocation of resources, assignment of responsibility and ongoing evaluation of practices, procedures and processes * Creates environmental buy-in from management and employees and assigns accountability and responsibility. * Sets framework for training to achieve objectives and desired performance. * Helps understand legislative requirements to better determine a product or service's impact, significance, priorities and objectives. * Focuses on continual improvement of the system and a way to implement policies and objectives to meet a desired result. This also helps with reviewing and auditing the EMS to find future opportunities. * Encourages contractors and suppliers to establish their own EMS. * Facilitates e-reporting to federal, state and provincial government environmental agencies through direct upload. EMS Model The PDCA cycle An EMS follows a Plan-Do-Check-Act, or PDCA, Cycle. The diagram shows the process of first developing an environmental policy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The process also includes checking the system and acting on it. The model is continuous because an EMS is a process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system. This is a model that can be used by a wide range of organizations ‚Äì from manufacturing facilities to service industries to government agencies. Accreditation Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS) can be accredited under the UK Environment Agency's Monitoring Certification Scheme (MCERTS) for performance standards and test procedures. Other meanings An EMS can also be classified as *a system which monitors, tracks and reports emissions information, particularly with respect to the oil and gas industry. EMSs are becoming web-based in response to the EPA's mandated greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting rule, which allows for reporting GHG emissions information via the internet. *a centrally controlled and often automated network of devices (now frequently wireless using z-wave and zigbee technologies) used to control the internal environment of a building. Such a system namely acts as an interface between end user and energy (gas/electricity) consumption.

It is made of a metal sheet (commonly steel, and played with a stiff brush, thus being similar to the Haitian graj (a perforated metal cylinder scraped with a stick) and the Cuban guayo (metal scraper) and g√ºiro (gourd scraper). G√ºira, guayo and g√ºiro all have a function akin to that of the indigenous native maracas or the trap-kit's hi-hat, namely providing a complementary beat. Performers on the g√ºira are referred to as g√ºireros and in merengue t√≠pico ensembles they often co-lead percussion sections along with tambora-playing tamboreros, due to the significance of their African-derived interlocking rhythms in providing a basic musical foundation for the dance. Usage The g√ºira is most often found in merengue t√≠pico where it serves as one of multiple percussion instruments, most usually interlocking with the rhythm of the tambora, a fairly small horizontally mounted rustic drum normally played with one stick and one bare hand. Mastering its usual 'correct' playing techniques has been dubbed very challenging. G√ºireros may use a variety of playing techniques to play various rhythms, however nearly all playing is done with one hand only holding the instrument from its large rounded (to reduce hand fatigue) handle, while it is scraped with the other (dominant) hand holding the brush, which may be made for this purpose, but in practice is typically a metal-tined afro pick hair styling comb, although some players may use a cane- or plastic-toothed scraper. Normally a g√ºira consists of an open-ended tube with many sound-producing nodules protruding its outer (usual) playing surface. The body of the g√ºira is generally some type of thin sheet steel. One commercial variant commonly called a torpedo is fully enclosed with tapered ends and is supplied with mineral or glass beads or metal shot inside to double as a shaker. Given its unwieldy shape and the additional weight of tapered ends and shaker fill, using a g√ºira as a shaker may be impractical. Regardless of how it is used, its traditional main function is to propel the tempo, not only to add its uniquely swishy metallic timbre's sabor (\\"flavor\\"). Another key aspect of the g√ºira is how much the (external) playing surface is (mostly internally, although flexibly using the holding hand and/or stuffing some light filler like felt or foam/fiber/excelsior inside) \\"dampened\\" (muted). This aspect influences how staccato or \\"dry\\" its sound will be, and advanced players may modulate muting while playing for additional timbral variation. While the player holds the g√ºira firmly with one hand while using the scraper with their dominant hand, the g√ºira is usually brushed (lightly scraped transversely) steadily on the downbeat with a preceding \\"and-a\\" in its characteristic galloping figure; it is also sometimes played in more soloistic complex patterns that still generally mark the tempo. Modern cumbia also sometimes features a (metal- sided) g√ºira instead of the traditional (gourd-bodied) guiro. Typical rhythmic patterns for cumbia include the golpe (\\"gallop\\"). Dances featuring the g√ºira range from the fast-paced merengue t√≠pico or cibae√±o (typical/traditional 2/2 time with accordion lead), perico ripiao (deriv. unclear; lit. \\"ripped parrot\\" or quick, bird-like) or merengue derecho (\\"straight-ahead merengue\\") to the slower pambiche or merengue pambichao (translit. Engl. \\"Palm Beach-esque\\" merengue), with tempos of 88-180 bpm. While its use in the more-romantic bachata (lit. \\"pierced\\" implying festooned with flowers) styles is applied at various medium to very fast tempos, modern g√ºira has been used in a wide variety of dance styles, as its versatility and ability to \\"cut through\\" a dense sonic mix and thereby maintain a consistent dance tempo is similar to that of how hi-hat or shakers like maracas are employed. Craft According to Francisco Javier Dur√°n Garc√≠a, New York City based instrument maker, the traditional art of g√ºira making involves a tree stump, hammer, nail, metal tube, and wood block. The instrument is hand fashioned from sheet metal into a (roughly 13\\") long cylindrical tube along with repeatedly-dimpled (not fully perforated) tubular (exterior) surface. Comparison to the g√ºiro The Dominican g√ºira is similar in usage to the Puerto Rican/Cuban g√ºiro though of distinct timbre. Whereas the g√ºiro is often a hollowed-out gourd, thus producing a more wooden tone, the metal construction of the g√ºira gives it a characteristic metallic timbre. Cultural significance The g√ºira as part of the merengue t√≠pico is emblematic of Dominican heritage. It is estimated to be the most widespread instrument in the country. When Rafael Trujillo came to power in 1930 he made the music the national emblem. The Dominican g√ºira has also become the instrument of choice for non dominican styles of music in other countries. In Colombia for example, the g√ºira has replaced the traditional wood ‚Äúguacharaca‚Äù in modern vallenato music, specially during large live performances. Likewise, many ‚Äútropical‚Äù dance orchestras and bands in Colombia use the Dominican g√ºira to play Cumbia and other local popular styles. Much like the Cuban Tumbadoras (Congas) which have become the general all purpose instrument for dance music in Colombia (being added to the vallenato ensemble or even replacing traditional local drums in some cases during live performances of Cumbia) the dominican g√ºira has also become a general all purpose scraped instrument for dance bands in Colombia.

The national team, the All Blacks, is currently ranked the second best international rugby team in the world, after South Africa. The sport has been known in New Zealand since 1870. The top domestic competitions are the semi-professional Mitre 10 Cup and amateur Heartland Championship, and above them Super Rugby, in which New Zealand has five franchises. The country co-hosted and won the first ever Rugby World Cup in 1987, and hosted and won the 2011 Rugby World Cup. They have won three World Cups, tied with South Africa, the most of any other country. They are also the current World Champions in 7s rugby for men and women. History Wellington RFU team of 1875 Before Europeans arrived in New Zealand, the MƒÅori were playing a ball game called ki-o-rahi which greatly resembled Australian Rules Football and rugby football. It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population.Shane Gilchrist, 'Game on, the \\"ki\\" is back in court', Otago Daily Times, 5 October 2007 Various codes of football were played in New Zealand in the years following white settlement. Christchurch Football Club, which is now the oldest rugby club in the country, was founded in 1863. It played by its own rules for many years. Rugby football was first introduced to New Zealand in 1870 by Charles John Monro, son of the then- Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Monro. He encountered the game while studying at Christ's College Finchley, in East Finchley, London, England, and on his return introduced the game to Nelson College, who played the first rugby union match against Nelson football club on 14 May. A visit to Wellington by Munro later that same year resulted in an organised match between Nelson and Wellington. By the following year, the game had been formalised in Wellington, and subsequently rugby was taken up in Wanganui and Auckland in 1873 and Hamilton in 1874. In 1875, the first representative team was formed, being a combined-clubs Auckland team which toured the South. It is thought that by the mid-1870s, the game had been taken up by the majority of the colony. The 1884 team that toured New South Wales, Australia The latter stages of the 1870s saw the emergence of a more formal structure, with Unions being formed in both Canterbury and Wellington during 1879.Gifford (2004) pg 27. In 1882, the first international rugby side toured New Zealand, a New South Wales side that visited both islands during the latter part of the year. Two years later, a New Zealand team visited New South Wales, wearing blue jerseys with a golden fern. The team won all their games. In 1888, the first ever British Isles rugby team tour took place, visiting New Zealand and Australia. The visitors won all their New Zealand games except for one, losing to Auckland. During 1888-89, the New Zealand Native team became the first from a colony to visit Britain. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU), now known as the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU), was established, to act as the national governing body of the sport. Following the establishment of the national governing body, the first NZRFU national sanctioned tour was undertaken in 1893, when a ten-game tour of Australia was played. The team was captained by Thomas Ellison. 1905 All Blacks, named The Originals In 1902, the governor of New Zealand, the fifth Earl of Ranfurly presented a trophy shield to the Auckland side, who were undefeated in provincial competition that year. The shield became known as the Ranfurly Shield. Three years later, a 1905 New Zealand team, who became known as the \\"Originals\\", toured the British Isles and France winning all of their games apart from controversially losing the test against Wales. As the team swept through Britain, some of the players took note of how rugby (league) was being played in the North of England. One player, Aucklander George Smith met with Sydney entrepreneur James J. Giltinan on his way home, and discussed the opportunities of such a game. Meanwhile, New Zealander Albert Henry Baskervill had contacted the Northern Union to arrange a New Zealand tour, as he had just read about the game in the Wellington Post. The NZRFU discouraged any involvement from its players and officials, nonetheless, a team departed a travelled to Sydney first, and were there labelled the All Golds, a play on All Blacks in reference to the player payments. The team went on to tour England. They played an import role in rugby league. Rugby jerseys drying, Wellington c. 1930s The 1930s saw a period of skill development for rugby in New Zealand. The 1940 All Black tour of South Africa was one of the first sporting events cancelled due to the Second World War. Rugby was however played in services sport, with games being played with South African allies during the North African desert campaign, also, most domestic competitions were suspended during this time. In 1976, the first ever season of the National Provincial Championship (succeeded in 2006 by the Air New Zealand Cup and Heartland Championship) went underway. In its inaugural format, Division One was made up of seven North Island teams and four South Island. The remaining provinces contested a split second division, though South and North teams did not meet each other, instead played their respective Island clubs. There was a separate relegation system in place for each the North and South, ensuring the number of teams from each island. The 1981 Springbok Tour, or \\"The Tour\\", went down as one of the most controversial rugby tours ever. From July to September, the Springboks toured New Zealand. Rugby fans filled the stadiums, yet equal numbers of fans protested the games outside the stadiums. Police were divided into Red and Blue riot squads for the tour, and in preparation for possible trouble, all spectators were told to assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kickoff. At a game at Rugby Park in Hamilton, around 350 protesters pulled down a fence and invaded the pitch. Police, already very worried, pulled the match when they found out a light plane piloted by a protester was headed to fly around the stadium. A protest turned violent in Wellington the following week, escalating the situation. During the final test match at Eden Park, a low flying plane dropped flour bombs over the pitch. A subsequent 1985 All Black tour was prevented by the High Court, but an unofficial tour took place the following year. The 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. In 1987, the NZRFU wrote to the International Rugby Football Board, later known as the International Rugby Board (IRB) and now as World Rugby, requesting the possibility of hosting an inaugural Rugby World Cup. The 1987 World Cup was eventually given to both New Zealand and Australia. The All Blacks made it to the final, where they would meet France. The All Blacks won and were crowned the first ever World Champions. In the 1980s, New Zealand provincial sides participated in the South Pacific Championship, along with teams from Australia and Fiji. In 1992 this type of competition was relaunched as the Super Sixes, and was expanded to the Super 10 later. As rugby entered the professional era in the mid-1990s, along with South Africa and Australia, New Zealand formed SANZAR, which would see them start a provincial rugby competition, the Super 12. The 1996 Super 12 season saw the Auckland Blues finish in second place, whilst the Waikato Chiefs 6th, the Otago Highlanders 8th, the Wellington Hurricanes 9th, and the Canterbury Crusaders 12th. The SANZAR agreement also saw the formation of the Tri Nations Series, a contest between the respective national sides, the All Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies. The All Blacks won the first series. Beginning in 2012, the Argentina Pumas entered the competition, which was renamed The Rugby Championship. New Zealand was supposed to jointly host the 2003 World Cup with Australia, but a disagreement with the IRB saw the tournament given to Australia in its entirety. In 2006, New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 World Cup. Culture In New Zealand there are 520 clubs, 141,726 registered players and 2309 referees. In colonial New Zealand, rugby football served to maintain loyalty to the Crown within the emigrant population, whilst introducing British culture to the MƒÅori population. It was the New Zealand Natives' Rugby Tour of 1888/89 showed that New Zealand could compete with other nations. Similarly, the 1905-06 tour, in which the All Blacks went very close to a clean sweep tour (with just one loss against Wales), helped to create a sense of national pride around the All Blacks, as they appeared physically superior and pulled off an admirable performance on their British tour. It is also thought that this saw the emergence of the Kiwi as a national symbol. Rugby dominates New Zealand's sports media. Being the unofficial national winter sport of New Zealand, rugby attracts large sporting attendances and viewership. As many as 5000 people have turned out to watch All Black training sessions, while the final of 2011 Rugby World Cup was the single most watched television event in New Zealand history. There is a pay TV channel dedicated to rugby in New Zealand. =Haka= All Blacks perform a haka before a match, 2006 The haka is a traditional MƒÅori challenge that has become closely associated with New Zealand rugby at an international level. There are thousands of variations of haka that are performed by various tribes and cultural groups throughout New Zealand; one of the best known is called Ka Mate. The All Blacks have performed a haka before matches since the late 19th century. Ethnicity Early forms of rugby had been played in New Zealand since the 1860s. While these were initially associated with the settler elite and the military, other colonists accustomed to hard physical labour also soon took part. In 1872, 'Wirihana' became the first recorded MƒÅori rugby player when he turned out for Wanganui 'Country' in a 20-a-side fixture against their urban counterparts. While some all-MƒÅori clubs were formed, such as Kiri Kiri near Thames, mixed teams were more common in areas like Poverty Bay which had substantial MƒÅori populations. MƒÅori living in areas that had supported the Crown during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s seem to have been the first to take up the sport. Jack Taiaroa and Joseph Warbrick were key members of the first representative New Zealand team, which toured New South Wales in 1884. Governance The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) is responsible for rugby in the country. The NZRU was formed in 1892 as the New Zealand Rugby Football Union with the original representation of seven unions though there was the original significant absence of Canterbury, Otago and Southland. The NZRFU joined the IRFB in 1949. There are 26 member unions within New Zealand. Every province also has its own union. In late 2005, New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 World Cup. National teams =All Blacks= The All Blacks playing the Wallabies. New Zealand, commonly referred to as the All Blacks, are the most successful team in international rugby. They have a positive winning record against all Test nations, and have a win record of over 74% The first All Blacks Test match was played against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 15 August 1903. New Zealand won 22 - 3, with The Sydney Morning Herald saying, 'The present New Zealand team have shown form so far in advance of every fifteen opposed to them that it seems almost impossible for Australia to put a side into the field with any hope of victory...'. The major rugby playing nations of Scotland, Italy and Argentina have yet to defeat the All Blacks in a test match. The All Blacks were winners of the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 and were runners-up in 1995. The All Blacks were the only team to have reached the semi-final stage at every World Cup until the 2007 World Cup where they were defeated 20-18 by France in the quarter-finals. New Zealand won its second Rugby World Cup on home soil in 2011. In 2015 New Zealand became the first country to win back to back Rugby World Cups beating Australia 34-17 in the final played at Twickenham on 31 October. New Zealand is the only country to have never lost a Rugby World Cup pool game. =Junior All Blacks= The Junior All Blacks are not an age grade side, but are the second national team behind the All Blacks. They were formerly known as New Zealand A, but the name was changed for marketing purposes. They competed in the Pacific Nations Cup competition alongside Australia A, Fiji, Japan, Samoa and Tonga. They won the inaugural IRB Pacific 5 Nations competition in 2006. In 2007 Australia A joined with the competition, changing its name to Pacific Nations Cup. The Junior All Blacks repeated their 2006 success in 2007 winning the competition with victories in all five of their matches including with a 50‚àí0 thumping of their Australian counterparts at Carisbrook Dunedin. The New Zealand MƒÅori played in the 2008 Pacific Nations Cup. No New Zealand team has played in Pacific Nations Cup since then. =MƒÅori All Blacks= The MƒÅori All Blacks, previously known as New Zealand MƒÅori, is a representative side that play at home and on tour. The Maori All Blacks team is a selection of the best of New Zealand‚Äôs Maori rugby players. All contracted players are able to nominate themselves as eligible for the Maori All Blacks and, in the event a player is considered for selection, the team‚Äôs kaumatua (cultural advisor) will trace the player‚Äôs whakapapa (genealogy) to confirm his heritage and eligibility. The primary objective of this team is to provide an aspirational pathway for young Maori rugby players. The team was formerly established in 1910, and has played many of the world's top Test teams, beating teams such as England, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions. =Heartland XV= Previously known as the New Zealand Divisional XV, this team was revamped in 2006. Only players who have participated in the previous season's Heartland Championship are eligible for selection; this makes it effectively a Heartland all-star team. This team traditionally goes on second-level tours; their first tour under the Heartland name was a 2006 end-of-year tour to Argentina, where they played two provincial teams and the Argentina A side, splitting the provincial matches and losing to Argentina A. Their second tour, in November 2008, was a two-match trip to the USA. The first match, in San Francisco, saw them defeat a Pacific Coast XV 39‚Äì12. They then travelled to Salt Lake City to take on a USA Select XV in one of the first events held in the new Rio Tinto Stadium, and came from behind to notch a 19‚Äì14 win. Shortly after the tour, the NZRU announced that the Heartland XV would not be assembled in 2009, and would in the future tour every two years. =Black Ferns= The Black Ferns are the top national women's team in New Zealand. They are the current Women's Rugby World Cup champions, being 3 time winners after they won the 1998 tournament then again in 2002 in Barcelona and again in 2006 in Canada. =Sevens= Sevens is a form of rugby union which involves 7 players per team rather than 15 in the regular game. The games are 7 minutes per half (10 minutes in a competition final) rather than 40 minutes per half in the 15-man game. The New Zealand Sevens team compete in the World Rugby Sevens Series, the Sevens World Cup, and the Commonwealth Games Sevens. The New Zealand Sevens team were undefeated in the Sevens events in the Commonwealth Games until 2014, when South Africa defeated them in the final. Since the inception of the Sevens Series in 1999‚Äì2000, the New Zealand Sevens team have dominated the series, winning the first six seasons of the competition (2000‚Äì2005) and 12 times in all, most recently in 2014. =Under 21s= The New Zealand Under 21s rugby union team is for players aged under 21. New Zealand Under 21 (formerly Colts) was first selected in 1955 and played annually until 2007. The Under 21s enjoyed great success on the world stage, winning world titles in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004. =Under 20s= New Zealand formed an Under 20 side for the first time in 2008. The catalyst for the creation of this side was World Rugby's decision to scrap its under-19 and under-21 world championships in favour of a single under-20 tournament, originally known as the IRB Junior World Championship and now known as the World Rugby Under 20 Championship. The side won the first four editions of the competition (2008‚Äì2011), and again in 2015 and 2017. =Under 19s= The New Zealand Under 19s rugby team is for players aged under 19. New Zealand Under 19 was selected for the first time in 1990, and played annually until 2007. They were strong contenders during their time, and won the IRB Under 19 World Championship in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2007 =Schoolboys= The New Zealand Schoolboys rugby union team is for secondary school students to help them aim for and achieve higher honors. New Zealand Schoolboys team is a great team to start out in and it brings you into the international scene early on. Famous past schoolboy players include Aaron Mauger, Mils Muliaina, and Joe Rokocoko. Domestic competitions =Super Rugby= While not domestic, Super Rugby is an international competition featuring teams from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. The competition, governed by SANZAR, was formed in 1996 as Super 12 after the game turned professional. It became Super 14 in 2006 with the addition of one team each from Australia and South Africa, and Super Rugby in 2011 when a fifth Australian team joined. The current format includes five teams from each participating country. With the expansion to 15 teams, the competition format was dramatically changed. The league phase, originally a single round-robin, was replaced by a three-conference format, with each conference consisting of teams in one of the participating countries. Each team plays home-and-away against the other teams in its conference, plus single games against four teams in each other conference. The finals series was also changed. In the Super 12 and Super 14 eras, this was a knockout series involving the top four finishers. The knockout format was retained for Super Rugby, but now involves the three conference winners plus the top three non-winners without regard to conference. Currently, five New Zealand teams participate in the competition, these being Crusaders, Blues, Hurricanes, Chiefs and Highlanders. The competition was further reorganised in 2016 with a permanent sixth team from South Africa and new entries based in Argentina (Jaguares) and Japan (Sunwolves). At that time, the competition was split into Australasian and African groups (with the latter including the Argentine and Japanese teams), each in turn being divided into two conferences.

Promotion and relegation was reintroduced to the top level of provincial rugby; the winner of the Championship replaces the bottom team of the Premiership; the winner of the Meads Cup replaces the bottom team of the Championship. =Heartland Championship= A map of NZRU provincial boundaries. The teams in teal are Air New Zealand Cup teams, whilst the teams in light blue are Heartland Championship teams. The Heartland Championship is an amateur competition contested among 12 teams from the former NPC Divisions Two and Three. It was also founded in 2006 as a result of the reorganisation of the NPC, and is directly run by the NZRU. Its teams compete for the Meads and Lochore Cups, named after famous All Blacks Colin Meads and Brian Lochore. The participating teams are: *Buller *East Coast *Horowhenua-Kapiti *King Country *Mid Canterbury *North Otago *Poverty Bay *South Canterbury *Thames Valley *Wairarapa Bush *Wanganui *West Coast =Ranfurly Shield= The Ranfurly Shield, also known as the Log o' Wood, has been competed for on a challenge basis by provincial teams since 1904. The current holders of the shield become \\"defenders\\" in every game played on their home ground, if the opposition or \\"challenger\\" defeats them, they become the new holder of the Shield. The Shield was first presented by the Governor of New Zealand, the Earl of Ranfurly. The current holders are Otago since 13 October 2018. =Club= Each ITM Cup and Heartland Championship region conducts local intra-provincial club competitions. The club level is often followed by the local media and has local support. Clubs often rely on the Pub Charity in order to survive. In total, 520 clubs are affiliated to the NZRU. International competition =World Cup= The Rugby World Cup is considered the ultimate rugby competition. The New Zealand All Blacks won the first World Cup in 1987, beating France in the final. Since then the All Blacks were favourites on several occasions, but did not win for another 24 years. New Zealand lost to Australia in the semi-final in 2003 and fell to the French team in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Intense lobbying by the NZRFU and the New Zealand Government helped New Zealand secure hosting rights to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks regained the World Cup on home soil in 2011. They went on to be the first country in history to win the Rugby World Cup two times consecutively, as they won the 2015 competition in England. =Women's Rugby World Cup= The Women's Rugby World Cup is considered the top rugby competition for women. The New Zealand Black Ferns first won the world cup in 1998, beating the United States in the final. Since then the Black Ferns have won in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2017. New Zealand lost to Ireland in Pool B in 2014. and didn't qualify in 1994. Intense lobbying by the New Zealand Government helped New Zealand secure hosting rights to the 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup by beating out neighbour Australia. It will be the first time the tournament will have been played in the southern hemisphere. =Tri Nations and The Rugby Championship= The Tri Nations, now known as The Rugby Championship, is an annual competition involving the strongest rugby nations from the Southern Hemisphere. When the competition was established in 1996, it featured New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Originally, this involved each country playing one home and one away game against both other countries. From 2006 the competition was expanded with each nation playing both the other nations three times (except in Rugby World Cup years, when it reverted to a home-and-away series). The All Blacks won the first series in 1996, as well as the subsequent 1997 series. They have been the most dominant team in the series; during the Tri Nations era (1996‚Äì2011), they won 10 titles to the Springboks' three and the Wallabies' two. In 2012, Argentina joined the competition, which became The Rugby Championship. With four nations now involved, the tournament returned to a straight home-and-away format except in World Cup years, when it is conducted in a single round-robin format. The All Blacks won the first three editions of the renamed competition (2012‚Äì2014), giving them a total of 13 Tri Nations and Rugby Championship titles. The Freedom Cup is contested between New Zealand and South Africa, first as part of the Tri Nations and now in The Rugby Championship. =Bledisloe Cup= The Bledisloe Cup reflects the rivalry between Australia and New Zealand and has been contested since the early 1930s. The Bledisloe Cup was irregularly contested between 1931 and 1981, usually during tours by the two nations. During this period, New Zealand won it 19 times and Australia four times. In 1982 it became an annual contest, being contested either as a single game or in a three-test series. Between 1982 and 1995 New Zealand won the Cup 11 times and Australia three times. Since 1996 the Bledisloe Cup has been contested as part of the Tri Nations/Rugby Championship. . =World Cup Sevens= The Rugby World Cup Sevens is World Rugby's equivalent to the (15-man) Rugby World Cup. It is also held every four years, and was originally scheduled in the odd-numbered years in which the 15-man RWC was not held. The competition was first held in 1993. New Zealand won in 2001, were losing finalists to Fiji in 2005, and won the most recent edition in 2013 in Moscow. The 2013 edition was originally intended to be the last because of the impending establishment of an Olympic sevens tournament in 2016. World Rugby (then known as the IRB) later decided to retain the World Cup Sevens, and established a new four-year cycle in which the World Cup would be held in even-numbered non-Olympic years. As such, the next edition was held in 2018 in the San Francisco Bay Area. =World Rugby Sevens Series= The World Rugby Sevens Series, held annually since 1999‚Äì2000, is a series of several international tournaments, expanding from nine to ten for the upcoming 2015‚Äì16 series, featuring full international sevens teams. New Zealand have been the dominant team throughout the series' history, winning the first six editions (2000‚Äì2005), and again in 2007, 2008, and 2010‚Äì2014. New Zealand hosts one leg, the New Zealand International Sevens, at Westpac Stadium in Wellington.

Ennen p√§iv√§nlaskua ei voi, United States: Troll - a love story) is a novel by Finnish writer Johanna Sinisalo in 2000. In the same year it won a Finlandia Prize for literature. Since then it has won several awards including The James Tiptree Jr. award in 2004 for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore our understanding of gender. Plot The story is about a homosexual photographer Mikael, who finds a young and injured troll from his home yard and takes it to his home. This troll is inspired by Finnish folklore and is an intelligent, almost human-like animal that in appearance resembles a cat and a monkey. In the world of the novel trolls are existing animals instead of mythical creatures, although quite rare. The book has multiple narrative levels, and each chapter is broken into short segments that alternate between viewpoints of different characters. Interspersed between the story are newspaper articles, old stories, novel segments, jokes and other slightly altered history that illustrates the long relationship between humans and trolls in the world of the novel. By concentrating on gay characters the story explores power structures in interpersonal relationships without the need to consider how gender roles affect them. Name The name of the book as well as the names of it chapters are taken from a Finnish song P√§iv√§ns√§de ja Mennink√§inen by Tapio Rautavaara and Reino Helismaa, which says \\"Kas, mennink√§inen ennen p√§iv√§nlaskua ei voi milloinkaan olla p√§√§ll√§ maan\\" (translated \\"A troll cannot ever stay above the ground before sundown\\").

About Bradley Bradley first appeared in Charnham in April 2004, as the former boyfriend of Melanie Costello. Bradley had taken a gap year in Australia the year previous, and returned to the UK to live with his mother, Sharon. Chrissy, Melanie's mother tried to get Bradley and Melanie back together, but ultimately failed as Melanie was engaged to Brendan Boulter. Bradley went on to date Lucy Day, one of Melanie's friends who lived locally and began working for Les Boulter at the corner cafe. Abuse Allegations Bradley settled into the Costello household as a lodger, frequently babysitting Chloe, Melanie's younger sister while her parents Gary and Chrissy went through a separation. Chloe began to look on Bradley as an older brother figure, as Melanie had recently married and moved in with Brendan. Everything seemed fine, until one day in October, Chloe revealed to Chrissy that Bradley had been touching her inappropriately. Chrissy then told Gary that the allegations were a lie, which put further strain on their marriage. After Chloe was analysed by a child psychologist, the finger of blame began to point towards Gary. However, Gary was vindicated following Chloe revealing to the social worker that Bradley was the one sexually abusing her. Bradley, after being attacked by Gary outside of the cafe, decided to flee Charnham and tried to convince Lucy to come with him. Kidnapping One afternoon, Gary arrived late to pick Chloe up and Bradley saw his chance and abducted her. Lucy, who arranged to meet Bradley, in secret persuaded him to bring Chloe home and give himself up. Bradley was then arrested, but released due to lack of evidence against him and the fact that Chloe had lied previously. Further Evidence During a search on Sharon's boyfriend, Conrad Williams' house, where Bradley was staying, the police found child pornography on Bradley's computer. Bradley denied all knowledge and accused Gary of planting images on the hard drive. The images were later revealed as being paid for prior to Bradley moving in with the Costellos. The evidence was not sufficient to sustain a conviction. Showdown with Gary On November 5, 2004, Gary received information from Alex Williams, Conrad's son about Bradley's whereabouts. Bradley, after being thrown out by his stepfather, Martin, had returned to Charnham and had been staying with the Williams Family. Gary, upon leaving the pub, smashed his way into the house and confronted Bradley. Bradley began goading Gary about Chloe seeking attention and not leaving him alone, prompting Gary to punch him, causing Bradley to fall and hit his head. Cellmates After Bradley had woken from his coma and had undergone a successful operation to reattach a loose retina, he was remanded in custody alongside Gary. Sharon's revelation During an emotional conversation with Chrissy, Sharon revealed that she did in fact believe that Bradley had molested Chloe as she had suspected her first husband, Bradley's father, had done to him. Trial In April 2005, Gary stood trial for his assault on Bradley. Bradley was convinced Gary would be sent down for the assault and decided to paint a damning picture of him in court. Sharon, while on the stand revealed the information about Bradley's past abuse, in order to aid Gary but the testimony was stricken from the record. The jury retired to deliberate over a verdict. When the jury returned, they rendered a verdict of Not Guilty. Bradley then left Charnham, with his relationship with Sharon in tatters.

Synopsis Morvern Callar (Samantha Morton) is a young woman in a small port town in Scotland. She wakes on Christmas morning to discover that her boyfriend has killed himself, leaving a suicide note, mix tape, and the manuscript of his unpublished novel behind. His novel is dedicated to her and she decides to erase his name and puts her own name on the novel and sends it to the publisher recommended by her boyfriend. Instead of arranging a funeral with the money on his account, as requested by him, she cuts his body up and buries it in the mountains. With the money she then escapes her work stacking fruit in the groceries section of the local supermarket and goes to Almer√≠a, Costa del Sol, with her best friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott). As they go out and party she feels she's in a different mood to Lanna and leaves her, so she can meet the publishers who have come to meet her in Spain. She plays the role of a writer and receives an advance on the novel for ¬£100,000. Back in Scotland she tries to convince Lanna to come with her to the big world, but Lanna refuses to leave (in Spain Lanna has met a guy from Leeds who plans to visit her in Scotland).

It housed military prisoners between 1851 and 1947. Construction on the prison began in 1847, when the former convent of the Daughters of the Good Shepherd was demolished on Rue du Cherche-Midi in Paris. The prison was modeled after the Auburn prison in Auburn, New York, and consisted of 200 solitary confinement cells. The prison population consisted of military personnel convicted of crimes by military tribunal, draft dodgers, deserters and occasional political prisoners. Prisoners were not permitted to talk to each other during the day and were kept isolated in their cells at night. On June 12, 1940, immediately prior to the German occupation of Paris, the prison was evacuated and prisoners sent to an internment camp near Mauzac. From 1940 to 1944, the prison was used to house political prisoners by the German occupation army. After the liberation of Paris, the prison was used to hold German prisoners of war. In 1947, all prisoners were transferred to other facilities and the prison was used as a military courthouse until 1950. In 1950, the building was placed under the control of the Ministry of Justice and abandoned. The dilapidated prison was razed in 1966, and in 1968 the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales opened on the site of the former prison.

The Waikino district lies at the base of the ecologically sensitive Coromandel Peninsula with its subtropical rainforests, steep ravines and fast moving rivers and streams. The cascades f the Owharoa Falls lie just to the north of the settlement. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"harmful waters\\" for . The population of Waikino was 213 people in 90 households in the 2013 New Zealand census.  History  Gold mining around Waikino has a history dating back to early colonisation of New Zealand. Waikino was the focal point of gold mining in the Waikato-Bay of Plenty district with the 1897 construction of the Victoria Battery on the edge of what was a busy town supporting the extensive local mining industry. Waikino's Victoria Battery processed ore from the large Martha Mine in Waihi. The Victoria Battery was then New Zealand's largest industrial complex. Besides processing ore, it supported carpenters' shops, a sawmill and a foundry. With 200 stamps, the battery was the largest quartz crushing plant for gold extraction in Australasia, and was capable of crushing over 812 tonnes of ore each day to the consistency of sand. The loud thumping sounds of crushing rock could be heard 10 kilometres away. The Waikino Express 1889 Up the scenic Waitekauri road 5 km behind Waikino, once existed the mining town of Waitekauri, near Golden Cross. Waitekauri is no longer there today, because the town was demolished at the end of that era's gold rush, consequently the village reverted to farmland. The local Waitekauri pub, the historic two storeyed \\"Golden Cross Hotel\\", was literally transported to Waihi where it stands proud today as a reminder of days gone by. On 19 October 1923, the Waikino school shooting occurred at Waikino School, claiming the lives of two students, Kelvin McLean, aged 13, and Charles Stewart, aged 9. This remains New Zealand's only school shooting. The gunman, John Christopher Higgins, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Higgins later had his conviction quashed, on the grounds of insanity.\\"Madman Runs Amok\\", The Te Puke Times, 23 October 1923. When gold became uneconomic to mine after World War II, Waikino residents lost their economic base and the town reverted into a sleepy little village predominantly inhabited by retirees from the old era. However, the small retail business community in Waikino's main street endured till the late 1950s. When Tom and Nell Buchanan finally closed the doors to the local general store and haberdashery and retired up on the hill behind the village, this signalled the end of an era. The 1970s heralded an influx of new people to Waikino, drawn by cheap housing and magnificent scenery. The counterculture had arrived in town and set about transforming Waikino into a bustling centre for hippies and crafts people to gravitate towards. These counterculture folks purchased many of the old houses in the village which had been neglected over time, even converting some of them into small craft workshops and outlets from where they sold their wares locally and around the nation. Waikinos main highway retail shops were back in business. Waikino Village in the 1870s The main highway (State Highway 2) retail shops which traversed the beautiful Ohinemuri river before it plunged into the Karangahake Gorge had its old shops and Lodge Hall refurbished and reopened from this influx of young alternative lifestyle people moving in their droves away from the big city chaos. Social revolution was in the air, this was the roaring seventies, and for many young people the flow from big city living towards a more country-oriented sustainable lifestyle in rural New Zealand was the name of the game. Overnight, flourishing cottage industry crafts and health food outlets grew around Waikino, servicing the local village and Coromandel. Once again, the former ghost town, having been closed down for some time, became the focal meeting point of the community. The business strip reinvigorated, people returned to town to do business. Hundreds of tourists, drawn by the quirky hippie atmosphere, stopped at Waikino's main highway retail outlets every week to try out healthy homemade foods at the tea rooms, and to purchase locally made Arts and crafts from the various hippy shops. Some stopped to simply chill out taking in the scenic atmosphere, watching the Ohinemuri river flow into the breathtaking Karangahake Gorge. January 1977 saw the community supporting the Waikino music festival of rock, blues and culture, held on Bicknels farm up the Waitawheta Valley. This festival event was run by the Nambassa group who were originally based in the Waikino village, prior to their move to Waihi. Proceeds from this event purchased a winter's supply of fuel for the aged residents of the village and towards the construction of a new post office after the 1981 flood. = 1981 flood = The great 1981 flood of Waikino 1981 Waikino flood aftermath The main highway shops came to a devastating end in the great Ohinemuri river floods of 1981. A huge torrent of water literally picked up the Waikino business district and many homes, and washed them downstream through the Karangahake Gorge. All that was salvageable was the Waikino Hotel and the local community hall, both of which remain operational today. 1981 Waikino craft town pre-flood A new post office was later built on higher ground with funds raised by the community. Initially the National Government deemed a new community post office uneconomical, and so decided not to replace one of the town's focal community services which was depended on by the large aged population to cash their weekly pension cheques. This unwelcome decision raised an uproar among the locals, many of whom became overnight activists. This heralded the establishment of the \\"Waikino Action committee\\", which lobbied Government and the wider community to have a new community post office constructed. After a bitter campaign the Government agreed to build a post office, conditional on the community footing much of the bill ‚Äì which it did. After the postal services were privatised under Rogernomics in the 1990s this postal service was terminated permanently. Waikino also has its own primary school which caters for children from as far as Waihi with a daily bus service. The school provides for Year 1 to 6 students, and boasts one computer per two students. Waikino Steam Train and Railway Cafe in 2005 Tourism and cottage industries are Waikino's primary revenue sources today. Numerous organised tours and walks around the old mining facilities and old rail tunnels, and around beautiful native bush which surround waterfalls and scenic valleys, are available. There is also a community sponsored heritage railway from the Waikino station caf√© to Waihi, the Goldfields Railway. This line used to be part of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway and opened in November 1905, but in 1978, a deviation to the south opened and made it redundant. The Goldfields Railway successfully saved the 6 km of track between Waihi and Waikino and is now a popular tourist attraction, running trains daily with preserved steam locomotives and diesel locomotives providing motive power.

Vladislavov was born in the town of Kotel in eastern Bulgaria in 1739 to the family of a cattle trader. His father, Vladislav died in 1750 in Istanbul of the plague. When Stoiko was 3 years old his mother, Maria, died and his father remarried.Mutafchieva, Vera (1983) page 7 ‚ÄòBook about Sophronius‚Äô Publisher ‚ÄúGeorgi Bakalov‚Äù Varna He attended a monastery school in his home town and studied Slavic and Greek books. He worked as a frieze weaver, but had an interest in religion and became a cleric in 1762. While working as a teacher and writer he met Paisius of Hilendar in Kotel in 1765. Paisius showed him his Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya, the primary work of the Bulgarian Revival, of which Vladislavov made the first copy, known as Sophronius' Copy (–°–æ—Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–µ–≤ –ø—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å, Sofroniev prepis). Vladislavov travelled to Mount Athos between 1770 and 1775 and left Kotel in 1795. He served in the Karnobat parish and went to a monastery in Arbanasi in 1794, becoming Bishop of Vratsa under the name of Sophronius on 17 September. There he was engaged in social activity and initiated the sending of a political delegation of Vratsa residents to Moscow according to some sources. Sophronius had close ties with the Phanariote circles. Cover of the book \\"Nedelnik\\" After the dislocations caused by Osman Pazvantoƒülu, the bishop's duties became more and more difficult for Vladislavov and he left Vratsa in 1797 to wander in northwestern Bulgaria. He spent three years in Vidin in a period that helped him determine his goals as a writer. He left for Bucharest in 1803 to serve the people as a high-standing clergyman, being released on his insistence from his bishop's post but continuing to sign under his bishop's name. Between 1806 and 1812 Sophronius of Vratsa was one of the most eminent representatives of the Bulgarian people in their communication with the Russian commanding of the Russo-Turkish War. He spent his last years in a monastery in Bucharest. His date of death is unknown, the last signed document being from 2 August 1813. Sophronius wrote his best and most popular works in his Bucharest period. These include Nedelnik (‚Äû–ù–µ–¥–µ–ª–Ω–∏–∫‚Äú)‚Äîhis only printed work‚Äîa collection of precepts and sermons for every holiday of the year based on Greek and Slavic sources. The collection had historical importance in initiating book printing in modern Bulgarian and establishing the Bulgarian vernacular as the language of literature.

In the Kalki Purana, he is portrayed as a male mortal demon and he is the source of all evil. In the Satya Yuga, he was a gandharva. In the Mahabharat, he created the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas in a game of Chausar. Mahabharata Damayanti speaking with a celestial swan. According to the Mahabharata, the gandharva Kali became jealous when he was late to Princess Damayanti's marriage ceremony and discovered she had overlooked the deities Indra, Agni, Varuna, and Yama (and ultimately himself) to choose Nala as her husband. In anger, Kali spoke to his companion Dvapara, the personification of Dvapara Yuga: Kali traveled to Nala's kingdom of Nishadhas and waited twelve long years for the right moment to strike. Because Nala had rendered himself impure by not washing his feet before his prayers, Kali was able to bewitch his soul. Kali then appeared before Pushkara and invited him to play a game of dice with his brother, guaranteeing Nala's downfall. Dwapara took the form of the Vrisha die that would be used in the fixed game. Kali forced Nala to lose and, each time, he would raise the stakes higher despite the protest of his advisors and wife. Finally, Nala lost his kingdom to Pushkara. Both he and Damayanti were exiled to the forest. Duryodhana as depicted in Yakshagana popular drama from Karnataka During their exile, Kali drove Nala to abandon Damayanti, who later enacted a curse against everyone that had caused the downfall of her husband. She eventually returned home after a short time as a handmaiden to the Princess of Chedi. Nala, meanwhile, saved the Naga Karkotaka from fire (where he was cursed to suffer by sage Narada). Intending to exorcise the devil within him, the serpent bit Nala, injecting him with deadly poisons that forever tortured Kali. The venom also changed Nala into an ugly dwarf named Bahuka. He later became the charioteer of the Ayodhya King Rituparna, who was a master mathematician and dice player. Years later, King Rituparna revealed to Bahuka the supreme skill of controlling the dice in exchange for horsemanship lessons. This skill awakened Nala from Kali's control and allowed him (with the help of Damayanti's curse and Karkotaka's venom) to exorcise the demon; vomiting him in the form of poison from his mouth. Nala forced the Kali's trembling spirit into a Vibhitaka tree. He then counted the fruits of the tree and left in search of his wife and later regained his true form. Kali returned to his abode as well. Kali was later incarnated as king Duryodhana, eldest of the one hundred Kaurava brothers. His companion Dvapara became his uncle Shakuni. The day Duryodhana was born, he unleashed a donkey-like scream which the donkeys outside the home replied to. Despite the advice from Vidura to discard the evil baby, Duryodhana's father Dhritarashtra kept the child because of his blind love for his son and overlooked his responsibility as the King. At the onset of Kali Yuga, once king Parikshit went hunting in the forest. Just then in the middle of the way, Kali, appeared before him and asked permission to enter his kingdom, which the king denied. Upon insisting, Parikshit allowed him five places to reside: where there is gambling, alcohol consumption, prostitution, animal slaughter and gold. Kali smartly entered into Parikshit's golden crown and spoiled his thoughts. Parikshit entered the hut of a sage named Shamika as he was thirsty. He found the sage in deep meditation. He bowed to him several times but there was no response. In anger, he took a dead snake and threw it around the sage's neck. Later when the sage's son, Shringin, heard of this incident he cursed the king to die of snake bite on the seventh day. On hearing this, the king forswore the throne for his son Janamejaya and spent his last seven days listening to the discourses of sage Shuka, compiled as the Bhagavata Purana under the banyan tree of Shukratal. As prophesied, the snake king Takshaka bit Parikshita, who left his mortal remains behind and attained Moksha. Puranic accounts The Kalki Purana describes him as a huge being, the color of soot, with a large tongue, and a terrible stench. From his birth, he carried an Upasthi (worship) bone. The Kalki Purana says that this demon chose gambling, liquor, prostitution, slaughter and gold as his permanent abodes.\\" The Sanskrit-English Dictionary states Kali is \\"of a class of mythic beings (related to the Gandharvas, and supposed by some to be fond of gambling)\\".Monier-Williams, Monier, Sir.Sanskrit-English Dictionary The Bhagavata Purana describes Kali as a 'sudra wearing the garments of a king' and portrays him as a brownish-skinned demon with a dog-like face, protruding fangs, pointed ears and long green bushy hair, wearing a red loin cloth and golden jewelry. It is believed that the names of the four yugas of time‚ÄîSatya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali‚Äîare named after \\"dice throws\\" from a game of dice popular during the Vedic period. Their order coincides with the favorability of each throw: Satya is the best throw, whereas Kali is considered the worst.CYCLICAL TIME AND ASTRONOMY IN HINDUISM (See page. 3)Glass, Marty. YUGA: An Anatomy of Our Fate. Sophia Perennis, 2004 () During the Mahabharata, king Nala exorcises the disembodied spirit of Kali to a vibhƒ´daka tree (Terminalia belerica), whose fruits contain nuts which were used as the dice for the vedic dice game.Smith, Frederick M. The Self Possessed: Deity And Spirit Possession in South Asian Literature And Civilization. Columbia University Press, 2006 () Therefore, not only Kali's name, but his penchant for gambling and reputation as being evil comes from this dice game. The Hindu texts never mention that the yuga names come from a dice game. The Manusmriti (1.69) indicates some ancient Sages named the yugas, although there is no mention of a dice game. =Churning of the ocean of milk= According to a lesser known Madhva version of the legend, during the churning of the ocean of milk, a great poison known as halahala was produced, which Vayu, the god of wind, rubbed in his hands to reduce its potency. Then a small portion was given to god Shiva, turning his throat blue. The rest was collected in a golden vessel and digested by Vayu. (One source states he drank the Kalakuta poison of Vasuki nƒÅga.Mutalik, Keshav M. Jagannath Dasa's Harikathamrutasara (Quintessence of Hari's Saga). Bombay: Focus () Still others more commonly state that Shiva drank alone.In another version given by Shaivites, Shiva alone drank the deadly poison, but his consort Parvati squeezed his neck to keep it from reaching his stomach. Still, some traditions state Vayu drank first and Shiva last and that Vayu himself is an aspect of Shiva.) A little portion of poison that wasn't swallowed by Shiva became the body of Kali. From this poison also came, \\"cruel objects like snakes, wolves, and tigers.\\"Chapter X Samudra mathana Later, when the asura Rahu was decapitated by Vishnu's Mohini Avatar, the demon's allies attacked her and all except Kali were killed. Having the power to possess the bodies of immortal and mortal beings, he entered the hearts of man and escaped . Because Kali was \\"invisible, unimaginable, and present in all\\" the only way to correct the chaos born from the miswritten texts was to completely renew the sacred scriptures entirely. Thus Vishnu descended to earth as Vedavyasa, the compiler of the sacred scriptures Vedas and the writer of the Puranas. =Markandeya Purana= According to Markandeya Purana, the Brahmin Pravara was given a magical ointment that allowed him to fly. But when he flew to the Himalayas, the ointment was washed away from the bottoms of his feet keeping him from returning home to his wife. During this time, the nymph Varuthini fell madly in love with him and begged the Brahmin to stay with her forever. But eventually, he rejected her. He prayed to Agni who returned him home safely. The gandharva Kali was in love with Varuthini and had been rejected by her in the past. He saw how she hungered for the Brahmin, so he took on the appearance of Pravara and came before the courtesan. He led her into the bedchamber and told her to close her eyes during their sex [sambhoga]. As they made love, Varuthini noticed that his body became flaming hot and believed it was because his Brahmin spirit was infused with the sacrificial fire. After climax, Kali, still-as-Pravara, left the apsara and returned to his abode. Varuthini soon became pregnant and nine months later gave birth to a human child that not only looked like the Brahmin but possessed his soul as well.Doniger, Wendy. The Bedtrick: Tales of Sex and Masquerade. University Of Chicago Press, 2000 () The authors of the book Science in Culture comment this was an example of the Sanskrit phrase \\"from his semen and from her thinking,\\" meaning the child was indeed Pravara's child because she believed it was his.Graubard, Stephen R. and Everett Mendelsohn. Science in Culture. Ed. Peter Galison and Stephen Graubard. Transaction Publishers, 2001 () In another version, Kali stipulates he will only marry the apsara if she keeps her eyes closed while they are in the forest (presumably making love). However, Kali leaves after their marriage and the birth of their son Svarocisa. Svarocisa grows up to become a very learned scholar of the Vedas and learns to speak the languages of all creatures from one of his three wives. He later marries a goddess and fathers Svarocisa Manu, one of the progenitors of mankind.Prasad, Ramanuj. Know The Puranas. Pustak Mahal, 2005 () (See Progeny) =Bhagavata Purana= The Bhagavata Purana states the very day and moment avatar Krishna left this earth, Kali, \\"who promotes all kinds of irreligious activities\\", came into this world.Canto 1: Creation, Chapter 18, Verse 6 After setting off to wage war against the evils of the world with his armies, Emperor Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna, came across a Sudra dressed as a king who was beating a cow and an ox with a club. Parikshit immediately lead his chariot over to the scene and angrily berated the sudra for abusing the sacred cow and her mate. However, this was no ordinary sudra and these were no ordinary bovine, for the sudra was Kali and the cow and ox were embodiments of the earth goddess and Dharma. The Emperor noticed the ox was standing on one of his legs because the other three had been broken by Kali. Dharma explained his four legs represented \\"austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness\\", but he had only the leg of \\"truth\\" to stand on since the other three had been broken by kali over the preceding yugas.Canto 1: Creation, Chapter 17 Kali was intent on breaking all the legs that supported the reign of dharma so he could effect the expansion of his own dark reign on earth. The earth goddess cried for she had once been plentiful, but when Krishna ascended to heaven, she was forsaken and all of the prosperity left from the world. She feared evil kings like Kali would continue to lay waste to the earth. When Parikshit raised his sword to kill Kali, the sudra stripped himself of his royal garments and prostrated himself at the emperor's feet. The emperor knew Kali tainted the world with his evil and so had no place in it and raised his sword once more. But Kali interceded again and begged the emperor to spare his life and allow him a place to live within his empire. Parikshit decided that Kali would live in \\"gambling houses, in taverns, in women and men of unchaste lives, in slaughtering places and in gold\\".Sastri, Natesa S. M. Hindu Feasts: Fasts And Ceremonies: Fasts and Ceremonies. Laurier Books Ltd., 2003 () And as long as Parikshit ruled India, Kali stayed within the confines of these five places. This act allowed Dharma to regain his legs and the earth to be relieved of much burden. However, Parikshit was later cursed to die by snake bite after hunting in the forest and throwing a dead snake on an unresponsive sage practicing austerities. Upon the emperor's death, \\"Kali made his way to other places like wild fire and established his power throughout the length and breadth of the whole world.\\"See chapters 16, 17, and 18 In another version of the tale, Kali enters into the Emperor's crown when Parikshit gives him permission to reside wherever there is gold. Upon returning home after offending the sage, Parikshit says to himself, Kali Yuga's abode is in gold; this was on my head; hence I had so evil a thought that, having taken a dead snake cast it on the sage‚Äôs neck. Therefore, I now understand that Kali Yuga has taken his revenge on me. How shall I escape this grievous sin?\\"The Prema- Sagara: Or the Ocean of Love (PDF ONLY)Bahadur, S.P. Gitavali: Complete Works of Goswami Tulsidas (Volume III). India: Prachya Prakashan, 1979 () =Kalki Purana= Kalki The beginning of the Kalki Purana describes Kali's lineage starting with the Brahma, his great-great-grandfather, and ending with the birth of his children's children. Instead of being born of poison from the churning of the ocean of milk, he is the product of a long line of incestuous monsters born from Brahma's back. (See Family Lineage below) Kali and his family were created by Brahma to hurry the dissolution of the cosmos after the pralaya period was over. When his family takes human form on earth, they further taint the hearts and minds of mankind to bring about the end of Dvapara Yuga and the beginning of Kali Yuga. During the first stage of Kali Yuga, the varnashrama breaks down and God-worship is forsaken by man. All through the second, third, and fourth stages, man forgets the name of god and no longer offers Yajna (offerings) to the Devas. It is at this point when God Vishnu reincarnates as Kalki in the name of the Devas and all of mankind to rid the cosmos of Kali's dark influence. The remainder of the tale describes Kalki's childhood, military training under the immortal Parashurama and assisting, training and teaching Kalki on Dharma, Karma, Artha and knowledge of most ancient and necessary Wisdom with military and social perspective but also help, support and join him fight against evils as greater guidance, his marriage, his preparation for war against Kali demon, and the decisive war between the two. Kalki kicks off his campaign by performing the Ashvamedha sacrifice and leading his armies behind the horse as it runs freely from kingdom to kingdom. If any evil king tries to stop the horse, Kalki engages them in combat. After defeating them, he continues to follow the horse until all evil kingdoms are vanquished. When Kali finally faces Kalki's forces, his entire family blood line is wiped out by the avatar's generals and he presumably dies from wounds inflicted by Dharma and Satya Yuga personified. Kalki, meanwhile, battles and simultaneously kills the demon's most powerful generals, Koka and Vikoka, twin devils adept in the dark arts.Chaturvedi, B.K. Kalki Purana. New Delhi: Diamond Books, 2004 () =Death= Kali dies one- third of the way through the Kalki Purana. During the decisive battle between Kali and Kalki's armies, Kali tried to face both Dharma and Satya Yuga personified, but was overwhelmed and fled on his donkey because his chariot had been destroyed, leaving his owl-charged war flag to be trampled on the battlefield. Kali retreated to the citadel of his capital city of Vishasha where he discovered his body had been mortally stabbed and burned during his battle with the two devas. The stench of his blood billowed out and filled the atmosphere with a foul odor. When Dharma and Satya burst into the city, Kali tried to run away, but, knowing his family had been destroyed, coupled with his grievous wounds, he \\"entered his unmanifested years\\". This might lead some to believe he died, but one version of the Kalki Purana in the book The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology states Kali does not die but, instead, escapes through time and space to live in the Kali Yuga of the next Kalpa. The author comments, \\"Unlike most battles between gods and demons, however, this apparent victory is immediately undercut, for Kali escapes to reappear in 'another age'‚Äîin our age, or the next Kali Age.\\"O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger. The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology. University of California Press, 1980 () Since he had the power to manifest himself in human form on earth, he was able to forsake his dying corporeal form to escape in spirit. =Family lineage= Kali is the great-great-grandson of Lord Brahma. He is the son of Krodha (Anger) and his sister-turned-wife Himsa (Violence). He is the grandson of Dambha (Vanity) and his sister Maya (Illusion). He is the great-grandson of Adharma (Impropriety) and his wife, Mithya (Falsehood). Adharma was originally created from Lord Brahma's back as a Maleen Pataka (a very dark and deadly sinful object). B. K. Chaturvedi, a modern translator of the Kalki Purana, states in a foot note that the growth of this dark sinful object into Adharma seems to, \\"convey the growth of Kali Yuga and its obnoxious offshoots.\\" Vishnu Purana Kali's family lineage is told differently in the Vishnu Purana, which is a father purana to the Kalki Purana: The wife of Adharma (vice) was Hims√° (violence), on whom he begot a son Anrita (falsehood), and a daughter Nikriti (immorality): they intermarried, and had two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Naraka (hell); and twins to them, two daughters, Maya (deceit) and Vedan√° (grief), who became their wives. The son of Bhaya and M√°y√° was the destroyer of living creatures, or Mrityu (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka and Vedan√°. The children of Mrityu were Vy√°dhi (disease), Jar√° (decay), Soka (sorrow), Trish≈Ña (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors of misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are all without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they are the terrible forms of Vish≈Ñu, and perpetually operate as causes of the destruction of this world. On the contrary, Daksha and the other Rishis, the elders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the Manus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in the path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation. In this version, Himsa is Adharma's wife instead of his granddaughter.CHAP. VII In Bhagavata Purana According to the Bhagavata Purana, Adharma is the husband of Mrish√° (falsehood), and the father of Dambha (hypocrisy) and M√°y√° (deceit), who were adopted by Nirritti (Hindu god/dess of misery). The series of their descendants is also somewhat varied from our text; being in each descent, however, twins which intermarry, or Lobha (covetousness) and Nikriti, who produce Krodha (wrath) and Hins√°: their children are, Kali (wickedness) and Durukti (evil speech): their progeny are, Mrityu and Bh√≠ (fear); whose offspring are, Niraya (hell) and Y√°tan√° (torment).See 55:14 In this version, Mrisha is the wife of Adharma and not Himsa or Mithya. Linga Purana The Linga Purana enumerates Adharma among the Prajapatis (Lords of Creatures). Dharma personified Since Dharma is one of the major antagonists of Kali, it is important to note this personified deity has his own line of offspring that work against the demon and his family to bring balance to the world. The following comes from the Vishnu Purana: The progeny of Dharma by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by Sraddha he had Kama (desire); by Lakshmi, Darpa (pride); by Dhriti, Niyama (precept); by Tushti, Santosha (content); by Pushti, Lobha (cupidity); by Medh√°, Sruta (sacred tradition); by Kriya, Danda, Naya, and Vinaya (correction, polity, and prudence); by Buddhi, Bodha (understanding); by Lajj, Vinaya (good behaviour); by Vapu, Vyavasaya (perseverance). Santi gave birth to Kshema (prosperity); Siddhi to Sukha (enjoyment); and K√≠rtti to Yasas. These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, Kama, had Hersha (joy) by his wife Nandi (delight). Again, the Bhagavata Purana gives a different account of his children's names.See 55:13 It is described in Mahabharata as the eldest Pandava brother, Yudhishthira was the son of Dharma. Progeny Kali's sister-turned-wife, Durukti (Calumny), gave him two offspring: a son named Bhayanak (Fear) and a daughter named Mrityu (Death). His son and daughter gave him two grandchildren: a boy named Naraka (Hell) and a girl named Yatana (Torture). Again, there are some discrepancies here. The Vishnu Purana says Mrityu and Bhayanak are his brother and sister. Mrityu is even represented as male instead of female. Kali is the grandfather of Svarocisa Manu, one of the progenitors of mankind. As previously mentioned, Kali had a son named Svarocisa with the Apsara Varuthini. Svarocisa once traveld to Mt. Mandara and was met by Manorama, a cursed-woman being chased by a demon. In the past, she had made fun of a sage practicing Tapasya austerities on Mt. Kailas and was cursed to be captured by a demon. When her friends Vibhavari and Kalavati berated the sage for enacting a curse for such a minor offence, he cursed one to be a leper and the other a carrier of diseases. Manorama had knowledge of a powerful spiritual weapon, but did not know how to wield it, so she taught it to Svarocisa. When the demon leaped out of the forest and grabbed a hold of the woman, Svarocis called forth the weapon. But the demon stayed his hand and explained he was actually Manorama's father, Indivara. He had also been cursed to become a demon by the sage Brahmamitra because he tried to covertly obtain the secrets of Ayurveda medicine without the sage's knowledge. The sage told him that the curse would end when he was about to eat his own daughter. Once he regained his true form, Indivara taught Svarocisa the Ayurveda medication, which he used to cure Manorama's friends. He later married the three and had three sons with them. He learned the languages of all creatures from Vibhavari and the Padmini vidya from Kalavati. Despite his prosperity, Svarocis was unhappy in his life and could hear the ducks and deer talking about him behind his back. One day he went hunting and took aim at a boar, but a deer came through the clearing and asked to be shot in its place. When he enquired why, the deer told him that she was really the goddess of the forest and wished to marry Svarocisa. So he embraced the deer and she turned into a beautiful woman. Together, they had a son named Dyutiman, who later became the Svarocisa Manu. One source states, \\"Kali's wife Alakshmi and her sons who supervise evil also came from Kshirasagara [the ocean of milk].\\" Alakshmi is the elder sister of the Goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Since the Kalki Purana states his wife Durukti is his sister, Alakshmi would be a second wife because she is not directly related to him. There are a number of connections and similarities between Kali and Alakshmi. First and foremost, Alakshmi's sister is the consort of Lord Vishnu, who sent his Kalki avatar to earth to defeat Kali.Pattanaik, Devdutt. Lakshmi: The Goddess of Wealth and Fortune-An Introduction. Vakils Feffer & Simons Ltd, 2003 () Second, legends say she was born either from the churning of the ocean of milk, the poison from Vasuki (who helped churn the ocean) or the back of Prajapati.Krishna, Nanditha. The Book of Vishnu. Penguin Global, 2001 () As previously mentioned, Kali is said to have been born from the halahala poison created from churning the ocean or from a lineage created from Lord Brahma‚Äôs back. Third, Alakshmi takes the form of an owl. Kali's emblem on his war flag is of an owl. Fourth, whenever Alakshmi enters a house, families fight and turn on one another.Chakrabarty, Dipesh. Provincializing Europe. Princeton University Press, 2000 () The presence of Kali and his family on earth causes mankind to fight and turn on one another. Finally, Alakshmi is said to ride a donkey. Kali also rides a donkey in the Kalki Purana. Role in modern communalism Anti-beef eating pamphlet (1890 CE) showing Kali (far right) attempting to slaughter a sacred cow. Ravi Varma Press (c. 1912).

Photos of the Gods: The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India. Reaktion Books, 2004 ()Gupta, Charu. Sexuality, Obscenity, And Community: Women, Muslims, and the Hindu Public in Colonial India. Palgrave Macmillan, 2006 () These pamphlets were produced in a time when Hindu-Muslim riots over cow slaughter occurred in several areas of India; including Azamgarh district (1893), when a total of 100 people died in similar conflagrations throughout the empire; Ayodhya (1912‚Äì1913); and Shahabad (1917).Paradox of the Indian Cow: Attitudes to Beef Eating in Early India One such pamphlet entitled \\"The Present State\\" showed a cow being slaughtered by a trio of \\"Muhammadan\\" butchers. Another portrayed Kali raising a sword above the head of a sacred cow, whose body was illustrated to be a microcosmic paradise in which all the Hindu gods resided. There were many different editions of this version. For instance, one showed a woman labeled \\"The Hindu\\" waiting with bowl-in-hand for the cow's calf to finish suckling before she could get milk. A form of Krishna labeled Darmaraj (\\"Ruler of Dharma\\") stood behind the cow and Kali was, again, harassing her with his sword. Still, a different one deleted the woman and calf and instead portrayed Dharmaraj in front of the cow pleading mat maro gay sarv ka jivan hai (\\"don't kill the cow, everyone is dependent on it\\"), while Kali rebuts he manusyaho! Kaliyugi Mansahari jivom ko dekho (\\"mankind, look at the meat-eating souls of the Kali Yuga\\"). Some Hindus considered Kali's presence in the picture to be a representation of the Muslim community. When one of the versions of these pamphlets came into the possession of a state official in 1893, he commented that the image \\"contained a representation of a Musalman [Muslim] advancing to slay the cow ...\\". One book states, \\"The Magistrate [at Deoria] found Muhammadans excited because they heard a picture was in circulation representing a Muhammadan with a sword drawn sacrificing a cow, and this they considered an insult.\\" In 1915, a color version of this picture ran by the Ravi Varma PressA lithograph press founded by Indian artist Ravi Varma in 1894. caught the attention of the colonial censors and was presumably censored in some way.

In it, Horace the Elephant holds a party for his eleventh birthday, to which he invites his ten best friends (various animals) to play eleven games and share in a feast that he has prepared. However, at the time they are to eat‚Äî11:00‚Äîthey are startled to find that someone has already eaten all the food. They accuse each other until, finally, they're left puzzled as to who could have eaten it all. It is left up to the reader to solve the mystery, through careful analysis of the pictures on each page and the words in the story. The book was a joint-winner of the \\"Picture Book of the Year\\" award from The Children's Book Council of Australia. History Base was inspired to write the book by reading Agatha Christie novels. He travelled to Kenya and Tanzania in 1987 observing animals in game parks and collecting ideas for the book.Graeme Base - Penguin Group (USA) Style Written in rhyme, the book includes large and lavish full-page illustrations of Horace's opulent house and the events of the party, packed with hidden details. The author invites the reader to deduce the identity of the thief by examining the illustrations and making deductions and observations. Also among the details in the illustrations are hidden messages, ciphers, and codes for amateur cryptographers (for example, one page's border consists of Morse code while another page set in the ballroom contains musical clues as to which guest is guilty). The biggest and most noticeable clue lies in a paragraph of ciphertext at the end of the book, which is to be decrypted, once the reader has discovered the identity of the thief, by means of a Caesar cipher mapping A to the first letter of the guilty animal's name. The solution to the cipher confirms the answer to the puzzle and offers an additional challenge to the reader. The final portion of the book contains the answers to almost all of the clues in the book (including the cipher), and how to solve them. These last pages are sealed together, as the reader is encouraged to try to solve the puzzles themselves first. This sealed section was absent from earlier prints of the book - but was available by mail. Readers are able to solve the mystery either by the coded messages, analysis of the illustrations, or through the text itself.

Due to his family's background, he was also known as B√§r, Latinized to Ursus (\\"bear\\"). Reimers was born in Hennstedt and received hardly any education in his youth, herding pigs until the age of 18. Yet, Heinrich Rantzau discovered his talents and employed him from 1574 to 1584 as geometer. Accordingly, Reimers in 1580 published a Latin Grammar and in 1583 his Geodaesia Ranzoviana. Rantzau also arranged a meeting with Tycho Brahe. From 1585 to 1586 he was employed as a private tutor in Pomerania and from 1586 to 1587, Reimers stayed at the court of William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel in Kassel, where he met Swiss instrument maker Jost B√ºrgi (1552‚Äì1632). Both were autodidacts and thus had a similar background. As B√ºrgi did not understand Latin, Reimers translated Copernicus' De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium into German for B√ºrgi. A copy of the translation survived in Graz, it is thus called \\"Grazer Handschrift\\".UB-Graz / Handschriftenkatalog / Katalogisat Nr.:560 Nicolaus Copernicus Gesamtausgabe: De revolutionibus: die erste deutsche √úbersetzung in der Grazer Handschrift M1J√ºrgen Hamel: Die astronomischen Forschungen in Kassel unter Wilhelm IV.

Inhalt: HTML PDF Reimers was a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe (his successor as imperial mathematician) after he tried to claim the Tychonic system as his own. Tycho complained that Ursus had plagiarized both his system of the world, as well as the publication of the mathematical model of prosthaphaeresis. History has sided with Ursus on the later issue, and he had stated that the technique was the invention of Paul Wittich and Jost B√ºrgi. In 1588 he claimed to have devised a model of the solar system where the planets revolved around the Sun, while the Earth only spun around on its axis. In this he differed from Copernicus, who had postulated also that the Earth orbited the Sun. Ursus objected to the Copernican model as it violated the Aristotelian principle of not allowing more than one natural movement by a body. Johannes Kepler committed a faux pas early in his career by sending a laudatory letter to Reimers while seeking the patronage of Tycho. Ursus published the letter in the preface to his work claiming priority for Tycho's cosmological ideas.Max Caspar, Kepler, Translated and edited by C. Doris Hellman, New York, Abelard- Schuman, 1959 But unlike Tycho's geoheliocentric system in which the Earth does not rotate and the Martian and Solar orbits intersect, in that of Ursus and his follower Roslin the Earth had a daily rotation and also the Martian and Solar orbits do not intersect, thus avoiding the Tychonic conclusion in respect of the Martian orbit that there are no solid celestial spheres on the ground that they cannot possibly interpenetrate.See pp34 & 36 of Christine Schofield's 'The Tychonic and semi-Tychonic world systems' in Wilson & Taton 1989 'Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics Part A: Tycho Brahe to Newton' CUP But on the other hand the orbits of Mercury and Venus would obviously intersect the Martian orbit in Reimers' illustration of his model, and indeed also intersect Jupiter's orbit. However Kepler discovered Tycho had posited intersecting Martian and Solar orbits because he had mistakenly concluded from his data that at opposition Mars was closer to the Earth than the Sun was. The source of the error was a research assistants' mistaken calculation of Mars's daily parallax from observations during its 1582-3 opposition as greater than that of the Sun's presumed 3' parallax.See p178-80 of Dreyer's 1890 'Tycho Brahe' Kepler discovered Tycho‚Äôs observations revealed little or no Martian parallax, implying it was further than the Sun at opposition. This would have refuted Tycho's system in favour of Ursus's and Roslin's. It seems it has yet to be determined whether the dominant astronomical system of the 17th century was the geoheliocentric system of Tycho or that of Ursus and Roslin at least in respect of non-intersecting Solar and Martian orbits, and also in that of the Earth's rotation or not.

Examples include input buffered network switches, out-of-order delivery and multiple requests in HTTP pipelining. Switches Head-of-line blocking example: The 1st and 3rd input flows are competing to send packets to the same output interface. In this case if the switching fabric decides to transfer the packet from the 3rd input flow, the 1st input flow cannot be processed in the same clock cycle. Note that the 1st input flow is blocking a packet for output interface 3, which is available for processing. A switch may be composed of buffered input ports, a switch fabric and buffered output ports. If first-in first-out (FIFO) input buffers are used, only the oldest packet is available for forwarding. More recent arrivals cannot be forwarded if the oldest packet cannot be forwarded because its destination output is busy. The output may be busy if there is output contention (see diagram) or when the output buffer is full due to congestion (for example the combined rate of multiple inputs exceeds the output rate). Without HOL blocking, the new arrivals could potentially be forwarded around the stuck oldest packet to their respective destinations. HOL blocking can have severe performance- degrading effects in input-buffered systems. This phenomenon limits the throughput of switches. For FIFO input buffers, a simple model of fixed-sized cells to uniformly distributed destinations, causes the throughput to be limited to 58.6% of the total as the number of links becomes large. One way to overcome this limitation is by using virtual output queues. Only switches with input buffering can suffer HOL blocking. With sufficient internal bandwidth, input buffering is unnecessary; all buffering is handled at outputs and HOL blocking is avoided. This no-input-buffering architecture is common in small to medium-sized ethernet switches. Out-of-order delivery Out-of-order delivery occurs when sequenced packets arrive out of order. This may happen due to different paths taken by the packets or from packets being dropped and resent. HOL blocking can significantly increase packet reordering. Reliably broadcasting messages across a lossy network among a large number of peers is a difficult problem. While atomic broadcast algorithms solve the single point of failure problem of centralized servers, those algorithms introduce a head- of-line blocking problem. The Bimodal Multicast algorithm, a randomized algorithm that uses a gossip protocol, avoids head-of-line blocking by allowing some messages to be received out-of-order.Tyler McMullen. \\"It Probably Works\\". acmqueue 2015. In HTTP One form of HOL blocking in HTTP/1.1 is when the number of allowed parallel requests in the browser is used up, and subsequent requests need to wait for the former ones to complete.

It was created in 1778 and disbanded in 1783, shortly after the war ended. History =Formation= In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, Mr James Finlay, a Glasgow merchant, founder of James Finlay & Co., together with Mr Ingram the former Provost and Mr Gray of Carntyne, resolved to raise an infantry regiment in the service of King George III. Finlay's motives appear to have been a mixture of patriotism and commercial interests - the War was having a detrimental effect on Glasgow's trade with Virginia. Consequently, at noon on 26 January 1778, a procession of the city's civic dignitaries met at the Town Hall, and marched through the streets of Glasgow in search of recruits. At the head of the procession were the city's Halbardiers led by Mr Gray bearing an enormous sword and acting as Sergeant. The Provost, a Mr Donald, followed, with the Town Council, Deacon-Convener, the fourteen Deacons, assorted dignitaries, and the colours of the regiment, and a large following of gentlemen wearing cockades in their hats. Ingram brought up the rear. Two fifers and two drummers provided music with James Finlay in the centre of the party on the bagpipes. Initially there was little success - at the end of the first day Ingram observed that they had a piper and a sergeant, but otherwise he was the regiment. Over the next few days, however, the recruits started to come in and the regiment soon reached full strength of one thousand men, including a large number of Irishmen. The attraction of the Regiment was no doubt helped by the ¬£30 bounty offered to recruits - the equivalent of about two and a half year's pay for a private. It was then common practice to draft experienced soldiers into newly raised regiments to give it 'backbone', and members of the 42nd (Black Watch) Highlanders were duly transferred to the 83rd. However, on discovering that they would no longer be allowed to wear the kilt, they mutinied. Once the regiment was raised, it received the name of 'Royal Glasgow Volunteers' and was numbered 83rd in the Line. =Jersey and New York= Fort Henry in Grouville, Jersey Raised in early 1778, the regiment spent some time in training before being sent to the Channel Islands, where it established its headquarters at Fort Conway (now Fort Henry) in the east of Jersey, in the Parish of Grouville. Half the regiment were based here, the other half in the neighbouring Island of Guernsey, the total strength of the regiment at this date being 781. On 6 January 1781 Baron Philippe de Rullecourt landed with a force of French infantry in a bid to capture Jersey. Leaving a detachment of troops at the landing point of La Rocque, Jersey, he proceeded to advance on Saint Helier, where he was eventually defeated at the hands of the 95th Regiment of Foot and 78th (Highland) Regiment of Foot, together with elements of the Jersey Militia, under the command of Major Francis Peirson in an action known as the Battle of Jersey. Meanwhile, the Grenadier Company of the 83rd, led by Captain Campbell, stormed La Rocque Battery and recaptured it from the French. Seven grenadiers were killed during this action. Later that year the 83rd was transferred to New York, where it remained as part of the garrison of the city until the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783. It then returned to Glasgow, where it was disbanded. Uniform and equipment The regiment wore the standard 1768 uniform of close fitting, long tailed red coat, white waistcoat, white breeches and stockings with black gaiters, black shoes with buckles and a black cocked hat. The grenadier company wore tall black bearskin caps, whilst the Light infantry company would have worn some form of light cap and short spatterdashes rather than gaiters. It was common practice for Grenadiers in the field to abandon their bearskin caps in favour of the more practical cocked hat. Because the 83rd was a Royal Regiment it was entitled to have royal blue 'facings' (collars, cuffs and lapels) augmented by white lace on the button holes. Officers wore an identical uniform, except that the coat was made of a superior scarlet cloth and the lace was gold. However this was usually only worn on formal occasions, and for everyday wear it was usual practice to wear a cheaper cloth, unlaced coat. Two types are button are known to have been used. One was a circular, flat gilt metal button 22mm in diameter, with a simple scroll and dot design surrounding the number '83'. On the back was born the inscription 'S. FIRMIN - STRAND 1771-1780'. The other type was circular, pewter and 24mm in diameter. The inscriptions on the front and back were identical to the gilt version, except without the scroll and dot decoration.

Biography Ehud Ya'ari was born in 1945 during the Mandate era. He holds a BA in Middle Eastern Studies from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and an MA in Middle Eastern Studies from Tel Aviv University. In 1968, he was an assistant to Shlomo Gazit, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. From 1969 to 1975, he was the Arab affairs correspondent for the newspaper Davar and Israel Army Radio. From 1975 to 2000, he was a commentator on Middle Eastern affairs on Channel 1. In 1987, he became a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and in 1990, he became a columnist for The Jerusalem Report. He became a commentator on Arab affairs on Channel 2 in 2000. In 2008, he joined the Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies of the Shalem Center. Yaari has reported from Egypt and Lebanon, and in 1997, reported from Washington. He interviewed many Arab statesmen and leaders, and also conducted an interview with US President Bill Clinton. He was married to Hava Yaari, who worked as a foreign securities adviser at a bank, and they had a son and a daughter, Tzahi and Ephrat. In 1985 Hava and her friend, pharmacy owner Aviva Granot, embezzled funds from Mala Malavsky, a Jewish-American tourist and Holocaust survivor, and later murdered her by striking her over the head with a rolling pin and running her over with a car. Their trial was conducted amid heavy publicity and media attention, and was considered the most highly sensational murder case in Israel's history at the time. In 1987, they were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, but their sentences were later reduced for good behavior, and they were released in 2000. Ehud Yaari divorced his wife following her conviction.Son of TV news analyst suspected of harassing TV presenter His brother Yehuda Yaari is a journalist and lecturer at Ariel University. His son Tzahi gained attention in the Israeli media for his conversion to Christianity. In 2005, Tzahi was investigated for harassing Israeli news anchor Miki Haimovich. The case was dropped after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. Ehud later married Dagmar Strauss, who now goes by the name of Dagmar Strauss Yaari.

It was established in 1972.  History  Lunchtime in Newpark, in front of the main block. Newpark had a Christian tradition, reflecting its origins within the Protestant tradition, and is under the patronage of the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin. The school was established in 1972, when the Department of Education purchased Avoca & Kingstown School, an amalgamation of two small private schools. Avoca School in Blackrock was founded in 1892 by A.A.[Albert Augustus] MacDonagh M.A. (1869-1934) who served for a long time as its headmaster, and Kingstown Grammar School in 1894 by the Rev. Matthew Edward Devlin (whose son John Edward Devlin also served as Kingstown's headmaster). The two founding schools catered primarily for Protestant children in the Blackrock/D√∫n Laoghaire area, but the schools also welcomed pupils from other religious faiths, and from none. In 1968 the original schools amalgamated as Avoca & Kingstown School at Newtownpark Avenue. Four years later it became Newpark, one of the four Comprehensive Schools established by the Government to: *make free second-level education accessible to the Protestant community within an appropriate ethos. *provide educational and recreational facilities for the local community. *act as centres for educational innovation. Newpark has a specific obligation to the Protestant community of south Dublin/north Wicklow, and this is reflected in its special recognition of the National Schools under Protestant management in the catchment area and by the priority given to those enrolling from the Protestant community. Newpark also considers itself a pluralist community; it embraces inclusion in terms of social, cultural, religious and ethnic diversity.http://newparkschool.ie/wp- content/uploads/2011/10/Admissions-Policy-revised-April-2010.pdf  Sports  The school offers a range of sports including field hockey, rugby and basketball. Its rugby senior team has held the McMullen Cup since 2007.\\"Kelly holds his nerve for Newpark\\", The Irish Times, 11 December 2008; accessed 2 July 2014. Avoca Hockey Club is based on the campus.  Campus  The Newpark campus covers 100,543m¬≤ (25 acres). The school was centred on a purpose-built prefab-style block, opened in 1974, but also used two large houses, \\"Melfield\\" and \\"Belfort\\" (Referred to as the Red-Brick by students), a purpose-built extension to Belfort (The D/F Building), a gate lodge and other ancillary rooms. . In 2015 a new school building was opened to students and many of the ancillary rooms were demolished leaving only Belfort and Melfield standing from the original plan.  Facilities  = Newpark Music Centre = Founded in 1978 to provide much needed music school facilities in south Dublin, Newpark Music Centre now caters for over 1000 students and is one of the largest public music schools in Dublin. While the emphasis is on learning music for enjoyment, students and choirs from the Music Centre have been successful in competitions throughout the country. All exam syllabi are covered up to and including diploma level and several specialised courses not available in other music schools are offered. As a founder member of the International Association of Schools of Jazz (IASJ), Newpark Music Centre established its Jazz and Contemporary Music Department in 1986 and is now recognised as the primary centre for jazz and jazz related music education in the country. The staff is drawn from the greatest performers and teachers from Ireland and abroad, ensuring that students are kept up to date with the latest musical techniques, concepts and trends. = Newpark Sports Centre = Newpark Sports Centre was built in 1973 with the sole purpose of providing a modern Physical Education facility for the school. Since then, the centre has developed into a multi-purpose facility providing a range of activities for the local community. Its sports facilities include: * Water-based artificial grass hockey pitch * Basketball courts * 25m swimming pool * Health suite * Fitness centre * Multi-use sports hall * 500m running track * Rugby pitches (off school grounds) = Newpark Adult Education Centre = Newpark Adult Education Centre offers evening and night classes in a wide range of subjects for leisure and personal development.

They are also known as Purkinje reflexes and as Purkinje‚ÄìSanson images. At least four Purkinje images are usually visible. The first Purkinje image (P1) is the reflection from the outer surface of the cornea. The second Purkinje image (P2) is the reflection from the inner surface of the cornea. The third Purkinje image (P3) is the reflection from the outer (anterior) surface of the lens. The fourth Purkinje image (P4) is the reflection from the inner (posterior) surface of the lens. Unlike the others, P4 is an inverted image. Purkinje‚ÄìSanson images are named after Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ (1787‚Äì1869) and after French physician Louis Joseph Sanson (1790‚Äì1841). The third and fourth Purkinje images can be visible from within the eye itself. Light reflected away from the surfaces of the lens can in turn reflect back into the eye from the rear surface of the cornea. The first and fourth Purkinje images are used by some eye trackers, devices to measure the position of an eye. The cornea reflection (P1 image) used in this measurement is generally known as glint.  Brightness  The brightness of the Purkinje images can be determined using Fresnel's equation: \\\\text{Intensity (brightness)} = (n'-n)^2/(n'+n)^2, where n and n' are the refractive indices before and after the reflecting surface. Purkinje image P1 is the brightest of the four, then P3 and P4 (P3 and P4 have about the same brightness), then P2.

Theme and music  The piece in D minor and time is marked Con moto (quasi marcia). A synopsis of scenes by the composer mentions that first native soldiers pass through a village, followed by a soft song from a boat on the Nile. An Arab plays on a pipe, then the song is repeated by the orchestra, finally also by the returning soldiers. The composer scored the work for a tenor or high baritone to perform the song, a male choir (or quartet) of soldiers, and a \\"colourful\\" orchestra including saxophones, banjos, mandolins, and marimba. In performance, the voices are often replaced by instruments. A motif of a descending chromatic scale is introduced in the beginning, repeated throughout the piece in both the melody as the harmony, in the end inverted.

The piece was published by Bosworth in 1923, also in versions with piano and violin.  Theme and music  The piece in E minor and common time is marked Andante moderato. A synopsis of scenes by the composer mentions that after a short introduction, \\"The Incantation of the Priests in the Temple\\" is followed by \\"The Perfume of Incence Floats on the Air\\". Two lovers are illustrated by a melody for cello, viola and oboe accompanied by pizzicato, followed by a noisy Manchu wedding procession. An argument of coolies is based on a Chinese scale.

Subtitled Intermezzo Scene, it was published by Bosworth in 1921. It evokes exotic images of camel-drivers, jugglers, and snake-charmers. When it was first published in a version for piano, it was advertised as an \\"educational novelty\\".  Theme and music  A synopsis of scenes by the composer mentions a caravan arriving, beggars, a princess carried by servants, jugglers, snake- charmers, and a caliph. After the princess and the caliph have left, a muezzin calls to prayer from a minaret. The caravan continues its journey, and the market becomes silent. The duration is around six minutes. An opening march shares \\"exotic\\" intervals, A ‚Äì B-flat ‚Äì E, with the composer's oriental intermezzo Wonga, used for the play Ye Gods in 1916. A chorus of beggars sings: \\"Baksheesh, baksheesh Allah\\"; passers-by sing \\"Empshi\\" (\\"get away\\"). A romantic theme portrays the princess, similar to Stravinsky's Firebird. Trumpets announce the caliph. The concluding section \\"Call to prayer\\" of 22 measures was added later.  Publishing and reception  The music was first announced in Musical Opinion in January 1921 as a piano piece, in a section \\"Educational novelties‚Äù.

This image seemingly captured the public imagination, and the BBC received many requests for it to be shown again, which it frequently was. The clip also appeared on other TV stations around the world, many of which also produced their own variations on the theme. There was also renewed interest in the clip in 1983 after the death of Herbie was announced and it has been repeated many times since on other TV programmes.

It is currently used mostly for football matches, but also hosts the annual Gibraltar Music Festival. It is located close to Gibraltar Airport just off Winston Churchill Avenue. It was named after the wife of Gibraltarian philanthropist John Mackintosh. Despite initial plans to replace the stadium in the 2010s, the Gibraltar Football Association purchased the stadium from the Government of Gibraltar in April 2017 in order to improve and renovate it. History View of the Victoria Stadium's West stand Victoria Stadium was constructed at the foot of the Rock of Gibraltar and next to Gibraltar Airport in the North District. It was first opened in 1926 as a British military sports ground. In 1970, the stadium was rebuilt by the Royal Engineers as a sports ground for use by both the military forces and the civilian population of Gibraltar. In 1991, the Government of Gibraltar financed improvements of Victoria Stadium's pitch and athletics track. The construction of the stadium was controversial as it was built on the disputed isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain. When the Gibraltar Football Association applied for membership of UEFA in 2007, Spanish-led opposition caused FIFA officials to look at the wording of the Treaty of Utrecht which ceded Gibraltar to the United Kingdom in 1713. In it, they claimed that there was a loophole in the treaty which they claimed violated FIFA regulations in that the national stadium had to be built on undisputed land. As Victoria Stadium was built on the isthmus which was not mentioned in the Treaty of Utrecht but ceded later and this fact was pointed out to UEFA members, Gibraltar's application was voted by UEFA's member associations to be rejected. Only the Home Nations of England, Wales and Scotland voted in favour of them joining. Football Victoria Stadium during the 2014 Rock Cup Final Victoria Stadium is mostly used for association football matches. All clubs in the Gibraltar Football League play their matches at Victoria Stadium. As such it is also used to host the final of the Rock Cup. Prior to membership of FIFA, it has been used as the Gibraltar national football team's home ground for unofficial internationals. Following the Gibraltar Football Association's admittance as a full member of UEFA in May 2013, UEFA vetoed Gibraltar using Victoria Stadium as their home ground as it did not meet UEFA standards and as the Government of Gibraltar owned it. As a result of this lack of ownership, the Gibraltar Football Association did not have the power to improve it. This was owing to the fact that Victoria Stadium did not meet UEFA standards for international matches, which meant that the Gibraltar national football team was obliged to play their \\"home\\" matches in UEFA and FIFA qualifying tournaments at Est√°dio Algarve in Faro, Portugal however they were permitted to play friendly matches there. The Government of Gibraltar and the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo stated that they were not going to spend Gibraltarian taxpayer's money on renovating the stadium without the site having UEFA approval stating \\"It would have been the worst possible bargain for the people of Gibraltar to have pursued the GSD‚Äôs approach of putting taxpayer‚Äôs money into Victoria against the wishes of UEFA at the time\\". Victoria Stadium did meet the UEFA criteria as a Category 2 Stadium for UEFA intercontinental club matches such as UEFA Champions League games with an example of this being when Lincoln Red Imps used it to host their 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Champions League match against Scottish team Celtic. However, in 2017, UEFA stated that Victoria Stadium could not be used for all of Gibraltar's representatives in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League during the 2017‚Äì18 season. This was owing to an increase in the number of Gibraltarian representatives in the competitions and due to failing a UEFA pitch inspection. The Gibraltar Football Association proposed to build the Europa Point Stadium to replace the Victoria Stadium as Gibraltar's national stadium. Owing to opposition, the Europa Point Stadium plans were scrapped by the local government of Gibraltar. An alternative plan for replacement of Victoria Stadium was put forward for a new stadium to be built at Lathbury Barracks however the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society opposed this citing that the Ministry of Defence would have to give up land that had been designated by the European Union Habitats Directive as a Special Area of Conservation for the proposed site. In April 2017, the Gibraltar Football Association announced its purchase of the stadium in order to redevelop it into a UEFA Category 4 stadium at a cost of ¬£16.5 million given to the GFA by UEFA and FIFA. The proposed new stadium sites at Lathbury and Europa Point would be developed into multi-sports facilities by the Government of Gibraltar. The GFA announced it would invest ¬£15 million into the stadium after purchasing it owing to grants from UEFA and FIFA. As a result of the GFA's purchase of Victoria Stadium, UEFA dropped their objections to the stadium providing works to expand the stadium to 8,000 capacity were complete by 2018 then they would be permitted to use the stadium for their home games in UEFA sanctioned international competition matches. In January 2018, it was announced that due to the Gibraltar Music Festival being held at the stadium that year, football games in August and September would be played at Lathbury Barracks. Other sports The ground has also hosted cricket matches since 1993. Victoria Stadium hosted its first cricket match when Marylebone Cricket Club visited Gibraltar in 1993 between Gibraltar and the MCC. It has also been used by the Gibraltar national rugby union team. Victoria Stadium has an Olympic standard 400 metre-six lane athletics track surrounding it and is used to host athletics meets. In 2019, following the redevelopments, Victoria Stadium will be used as the main stadium as Gibraltar host the 2019 Island Games.. Since 2013, the stadium has annually hosted the Gibraltar Darts Trophy as part of the PDC's European Tour.

History Built by French engineer Gustave Eiffel for the Caen to Saint-L√¥ and Vire line, the Viaduc de la Souleuvre opened November 12, 1893\\\\. The total length of the viaduct was 364.20 m (1,200 ft), had a maximum height of 62.50 m (210 ft) and was set on five stone pillars. The height of these pillars varies between 26 m and 60 m, their bases are 18 m by 8 m and their tops are 7 m by 4 m. They were built with granite blocks from the Vire region quarries, each of a weight of 350 kg, and with mortar sand from the Chausey Islands, totaling 14000 m¬≥. Before World War II, about 15 trains a day crossed the viaduct. It was used by the Germans during the War. The Allied Forces tried to destroy the viaduct in 1944, but only managed to partially damage it. More than 500 bombs were dropped around it without hitting it. In August 1944, the viaduct was repaired by the Americans. When the rail line closed in 1960, the viaduct went into disrepair. Despite large local preservationist opinion campaigns, the railway platform was demolished in 1970\\\\. Only the five large stone pillars remain. Bungee jumping Le viaduc de la Souleuvre In 1990, a permanent platform for bungee jumping was established by A. J. Hackett atop the highest pillar. A light gangway was established where the railway platform used to be, allowing access to the platform from the side of the bridge.

Frazer claimed to represent those who feel marginalised by concessions granted to Irish republicans during the Northern Ireland peace process and by the inclusion of Sinn F√©in in its government; a party regarded by many as the political wing of the Provisional IRA. Political action FAIR opposed the early conditional release of republican militants following the 1998 Belfast Agreement and has called for full public inquiries into alleged collusion between Irish authorities and republicans in the deaths of Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers, loyalist paramilitaries and Northern Protestant civilians.\\"British Intelligence / Gardai / I.R.A.

Frazer also stated that loyalist paramilitaries ‚Äì who were also released ‚Äì \\"should never have been locked up in the first place.\\" =Marches in Dublin= In February 2006, FAIR (as part of the Love Ulster organisation) attempted to hold a protest march in Dublin, the capital city of the Republic of Ireland. Their expressed goal was to bring attention to their view of the plight of unionist victims of IRA violence. A riot by protesters against the march resulted in violence between them and the Garda√≠, as well as damage to property, and the march did not take place. The Love Ulster supporters withdrew under police cover and were ferried by bus to meet with Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell. Although Republican Sinn F√©in and others were initially accused of orchestrating the riot, these allegations were later dismissed after investigation. In 2007, FAIR and Love Ulster announced their intention to hold another march in Dublin. These plans were subsequently cancelled after a meeting with Irish government officials was offered. Controversies Critics have noted that FAIR has named Robert McConnell, a member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, as a victim of IRA violence. McConnell was implicated in both the killing of the brothers of Eugene Reavey on 4 January 1976, and in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974.\\"Collusion Part One: Secret Documents Reveal the Downing St Link,\\" Irish News, 9 August 2007 FAIR has also been criticised for supporting Ian Paisley's 1999 allegation that Eugene Reavey was involved in the killing of ten Protestant civilians in the Kingsmill massacre on 5 January 1976.McKay, Susan. \\"Disgusting justification for sectarian murders,\\" Irish News, 30 January 2007. FAIR rejected the dismissal of the allegation against Reavey by Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan. In 2007 Peter Robinson, then deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), wrote to Frazer, telling him he \\"might find it much easier to get co-operation with political representatives if you were genuinely involved in Victim Support rather than opposition politics\\".

In the 2011 general election, the SMC and Hong Kah Group Representation Constituency (GRC) were absorbed into Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Its population in 2007 was estimated at 20,238 inhabitants. Its area is 336,189 km¬≤. Located 237 km south of Rio Branco on the border with Bolivia, has its limits with the municipalities Epitaciol√¢ndia, Brazil Assisi, and Sena Madureira Xapuri. Although established as a free trade area, it is still not regulated. Currently, it depends on trade with the neighboring municipality of Cobija, contrary to what happened in decades past, when the reverse was the case. History Brasil√©ia originated from a small strip of land from an old rubber plantation called Carmen, on July 3, 1910, using the name of Brasilia. In 1943 the town's name was changed since it had the same name as the new federal capital. The current name is derived from a portmanteau of Brazil and hil√©ia (forest). In 1992 the town divided its area, with the entire area and population located on the right bank of the Rio Acre originating the city of Epitaciol√¢ndia. Geography The Xapuri and Acre rivers cross the municipality territory, with the Xapuri river marking the border with the Republic of Bolivia. In the early decades of the twentieth century the region experienced the boom of Brazilian nuts and rubber extraction, which were transported on the river Acre on cargo ships known as \\"chata\\". Today goods are transported on the fully paved highway BR-317 linking with the state capital, Rio Branco. The municipality contains part of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, a sustainable use environmental unit created in 1990. Population The county ranks sixth in the Acre state population, with 20,237 inhabitants at the rate of 64.22% urban (12 243 inhabitants) and 35.78% rural (6,822 inhabitants). Among the rural population 1,060 are denominated ribeirinhos, characterized as communities living along the river Acre. =Economy= The city's economy has suffered a great loss, due to the lack of supervision and low prices in Bolivia compared with those of Brazil. Not only consumers are turning to the Bolivian economy, but entrepreneurs as well due to free trade zone of Cobija (the capital of Pando Department and Nicol√°s Su√°rez Province). Every day, new shops and businesses are built by Brazilians living in the neighboring towns of Epitaciol√¢ndia and even those who reside in Rio Branco, are investing in counties within Bolivia. The unprotected border of both countries is also affected by trafficking of drugs, weapons, fuel and goods. Economic activities are virtually paralyzed, agriculture is traditional, industry gives signs of slow recovery, with the installation of a milk processing facility, which will supply the markets of Epitaciol√¢ndia and Cobija (Bolivia). Some sawmills and furniture factories, in the service sector, are completely paralyzed. Cattle ranching has a considerable workforce, especially for beef cattle. There is great potential for ecotourism, but it lacks exposure and investment. Currently the city of Brasileia does not have an infrastructure of hotels and restaurants able to cater to the influx of tourists who shop in the zone of Cobija, especially on weekends.

Zahari Zograf was born in the town of Samokov in 1810 and was taught by his brother Dimitar Zograf, with whom he later worked together, as his father died early. A spiritual student of Neophyte of Rila since 1827, he became an equal partner of his brother at the age of 21 in 1831, i.e. he was proclaimed a master. His best known icons are those of the SS Constantine and Helen Church in Plovdiv, the Church of the Theotokos in Koprivshtitsa, as well as a number of monasteries. Zahari Zograf's best known frescoes are those in the main church of the Rila Monastery, in the chapel and the St Nicholas church of the Bachkovo Monastery, the Troyan Monastery and the Monastery of the Transfiguration. He painted three mural portraits of himself in the latter three, a move that was regarded as controversial during the time. Zahari Zograf lived and worked on Mount Athos between 1851 and 1852, where he decorated the outer narthex of the Great Lavra.

He was integral to the founding of the Lutheran church body known as the General Synod, as well as the oldest continuously-operating Lutheran seminary (Gettysburg Seminary) and college in North America (Gettysburg College). Later in his career, Schmucker became a controversial figure because of his theological positions, in particular his approach to the Lutheran Confessions. Outside of the church, Schmucker was a noted abolitionist. Early life Samuel Simon Schmucker was born in 1799 in Hagerstown, Maryland. His father, Johann Georg Schmucker, was a German immigrant and an ordained pastor in the Pennsylvania Ministerium. Samuel Schmucker showed a promising intellect at a young age, and entered the University of Pennsylvania at age 15. After teaching briefly at the York Academy, Schmucker went on a missionary journey to the western frontier of Kentucky and Ohio. On his return he studied at Princeton Theological Seminary, and was ordained a Lutheran minister (1820). In 1820 he helped to establish the General Synod of the Lutheran Church in America, one of the first organizations of the American Lutheran church. From 1826 to 1864 he served as professor of didactic theology and chairman of the faculty in Gettysburg Seminary, of which he was one of the founders. Schmucker Hall on the campus was named in his honor. During the Battle of Gettysburg, Schmucker's house was used as a field hospital for soldiers of both armies. He was never compensated for the damages incurred. His publication of 1838 prepared the way for the formation of the Evangelical Alliance, which was formed in Freemason's Hall, London, August 19‚Äì23, 1846. The American branch was organized in 1867. He was the leader of the low-church Lutheran party who were connected with the General Synod and was better known outside of his communion than any other Lutheran minister. Schmucker had fervent anti-war convictions. In 1846 he was one of the few Lutheran leaders in America to publicly oppose the war with Mexico. Schumcker's son Samuel Mosheim Schmucker (or Smucker) was a writer of popular biographies. His son Beale Melanchthon Schmucker was also a noted Lutheran clergyman. Schmucker is buried in Evergreen Cemetery (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania). Another son, Samuel D. Schmucker, enlisted in the 26th Pennsylvania Emergency Militia in the days prior to the Battle of Gettysburg, and was engaged in a brief skirmish against Confederates west of Gettysburg on June 26, 1863. Schumcker was an advocate of theistic evolution.Balmer, Randall Herbert. (2004). Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism. Baylor University Press. p. 605. Objections to Samuel Simon Schmucker Samuel Simon Schmucker Schmucker was a controversial theologian whom Confessional Lutherans viewed as a threat to American Lutheranism. They did not believe he was actually a Lutheran, but rather, a Reformed theologian working to form a union of American Lutheranism with non-Lutheran American Protestants. His plan to discard the Augsburg Confession as a declaration of Lutheran belief in favor of a confession compatible with Reformed theology alienated him from former allies. He published this altered confession anonymously, but it failed to pass even within his own church body. Because Schmucker denied the Real Presence in the Lord's Supper, he is categorically placed in the \\"Un-Lutheran\\" camp by Charles Porterfield Krauth. Schmucker wrote, \\"worthy communicants, in this ordinance, by faith spiritually feed on the body and blood of the Redeemer, thus holding communion or fellowship with Him.\\" This demonstrates Schmucker held to the Calvinist spiritual explanation of the Lord's Supper rather than the Lutheran teaching of Sacramental Union. Wilhelm Sihler of the Missouri Synod criticized Samuel Simon Schmucker, terming him \\"apostate,\\" and asserting that Schmucker and other like-minded leaders of the General Synod were \\"open counterfeiters, Calvinists, Methodists, and Unionists...traitors and destroyers of the Lutheran Church\\". The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge states his theological position was a mix of \\"Puritanism, Pietism, and shallow Rationalism\\" rather than Lutheranism. Publications His published works number more than one hundred. Among them are: * Biblical Theology of Storr and Flatt, translated from the German (2 vols., Andover, 1826; reprinted in England, 1845) * Elements of Popular Theology (1834) * Kurzgefasste Geschichte der Christlichen Kirche, auf der Grundlage der Busch'en Werke (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 1834) * Fraternal Appeal to the American Churches on Christian Union (Andover, 1838) * Portraiture of Lutheranism (Baltimore, 1840) * Retrospect of Lutheranism (1841) * Psychology, or Elements of Mental Philosophy (New York, 1842) * Dissertation on Capital Punishment (Philadelphia, 1845) * The American Lutheran Church, Historically, Doctrinally, and Practically Delineated (1851) * Lutheran Manual (1855) * American Lutheranism Vindicated (Baltimore, 1856) * The Lutheran Symbols (1856) * Appeal on Behalf of the Christian Sabbath (Philadelphia, 1857) * Evangelical Lutheran Catechism (Baltimore, 1859) * The Church of the Redeemer as developed within the General Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church (1870) * The Unity of Christ's Church (New York, 1870) He wrote a large number of discourses and addresses, and articles in the Evangelical Review and other periodicals.

Wards in grey were not contested in 2006. The City Council elections for the City of Preston, Lancashire were held on 4 May 2006 on the same day as other 2006 United Kingdom local elections. Nineteen electoral wards were fought. The only change was that Labour gained one seat from the Liberal Democrats, continuing to be the largest party, but the Council remained under no overall control Candidates The number of candidates fielded, by party, were: * Labour - 19 * Conservative - 19 * Liberal Democrats - 18 * BNP - 1 * Respect Party - 5 * Green Party - 3 Summary results New composition As of May 2006, Labour have 24 councillors, Conservative 17, LibDems 12, Respect 2 and there are two Independent councillors. Preston City Council remains under no overall control. Ward results Preston Council is elected in thirds, which means there is an all out election in one year followed by single-member elections in all three-member wards and selected two-member wards. All changes in percentage share of the vote are from the corresponding 2003 or 2004 elections in the respective wards. Any \\"gain\\" or \\"loss\\" compares this year's elections with the 2002 \\"all out\\" vote because the councilors in this election are defending that year's result. Brookfield In the north east of the city, the predominantly low income housing of Brookfield is a three-member ward. Buttressed up against Ribbleton and the rural east, and wedge-shaped to the south of Fulwood, the ward has been troubled by increasing levels of crime in recent years. Parts of the ward were formerly within the Fulwood district council and maintain the look of the affluent northern quarters of the city. Cadley The central ward of Cadley is positioned between Fulwood and Preston, with the main Lytham Road and Cadley Causeway used as the boundary between it and the nearby College and Ashton wards. Cadley is almost entirely suburban housing with a heavy commuter population. College Created in the last round of local boundary reviews, the two-member College ward centres on two Fulwood employers. Preston College has a catchment area far beyond the city itself, whilst the recently closed Sharoe Green hospital has had many of its services re-directed to the Royal Preston Hospital. There are a mix of commuter and student housing and an increasing Muslim population. The last election for a councillor in College ward was in 2003; the change of vote in this table is based on the 2003 figures. Fishwick Fishwick is a ward in the southwest of the city, at the border with South Ribble, spreading north into Ribbleton. The ward has a sizable percentage of comfortable housing but has in recent years been more infamous for the troubled Callon housing estate. The ward has higher than average unemployment and continuing issues with crime and drugs. In the 2004 elections, for the first time since local government restructuring in the 1970s, Fishwick elected a Conservative candidate to Town Hall. This accounts for the large changes in vote in this results table. Councillor Harold Parker resigned due to health issues in August 2009 triggering a by-election on 1 October which was won by the Labour Party's Jennifer Mein. Garrison Centred on Fulwood Barracks, this is a three- member ward created by the last round of boundary reviews. It is set in a heavily small \\"c\\" conservative part of Preston with a number of schools and small employment centres. In April 2006 Marie Milne changed party from Conservative to Liberal Democrat. Greyfriars Its name coming from a large private estate within its boundaries, Greyfriars is one of the oldest names connected to Preston's history. It includes the Pius X Preparatory school and Fulwood's leisure centre. An increasing number of comfortable suburban houses has been built on the fringes of the ward, which also borders Ingol Golf Course. Ingol Ingol ward is in the north west of the city, bordered by Greyfriars and to the south of the M55 motorway. The ward contains two main population areas, Ingol and Tanterton. The latter has had problems with drugs and crime over recent years but this is beginning to improve. Parts of the ward are comfortable with some commuter areas and houses neighbouring the Lancaster canal. There are still pockets of troubled communities. Ingol is a three-member ward. Two councillors were elected in 2003 following the expulsion from Town Hall of a Liberal Democrat councillor. Larches In the west of the city, around 30 minutes from the city centre, Larches is a box- shaped ward from the Riversway dual-carriageway into Blackpool to Haslam Park. It contains two post-war housing estates, Larches and Savick, and an area of suburban sprawl moved in from Ashton following boundary changes. The ward contains the whole of Ashton Park. Lea The three member ward of Lea contains the small Fylde border town of Lea Town, the urban Lea community and the sprawling green-belt community of Cottam. The ward mirrors the parish council boundary of Lea and Cottam Parish Council. Cottam has grown from a small farming community to a large private housing development populated by young families and business people. Moor Park Based on the Plungington community and bordering both the neat suburban terraces of southern Fulwood and the University of Central Lancashire campus, the Moor Park ward has a high number of student housing in converted Victorian housing and neater family houses. The Plungington area is split between this ward and neighbouring Tulketh. Moor Park itself is included in this ward, in the shadow of Deepdale football stadium. Preston Rural North Over reaching across the city of Preston is the large Preston Rural North ward, which includes the M6 and M55 motorways and acres of market towns, farming communities and rural areas. The boroughs of Fylde and Wyre border this northern ward, which is a three-member ward. In 2003, there was no election in this ward as the sitting councillor was unopposed. Ribbleton Ribbleton, in the east of the city, grew massively in population as council housing was built around former mill worker terraces; now the ward is one of the largest in population and shows all the usual issues of high level crime and deprivation. Ribbleton, in common with the neighbouring Brookfield ward, is overwhelmingly white working class. Riversway The Riversway ward has three distinct elements. Broadgate, a comfortable estate of Victorian housing with a high percentage of student housing; new build housing on the former British Aerospace site; and the redeveloped marina. The former Preston Port, one of the largest in its time, has been redeveloped to feature shopping units and new build housing of some considerable expense. The Preston Docks and surrounding area has a sizable area of Development including new Supermarkets, Car dealers and trade outlets. A Hindu temple, Lancashire County Council's headquarters and Preston's railway station are in the Riversway ward. Sharoe Green Lodged in the south- central area of Fulwood, the Sharoe Green ward is based on the former hospital and surrounding commuter belt environs. St George's The St George's ward is a rectangle-shaped ward in between Deepdale and the city centre. The largest area of population are rows of old-style terraces with streets named after various saints - David, Barnabus, Anne, Martin, Michael and George to name a few. The ward has one of the largest percentage of Hindu and Muslim population in the city and has an increasing student population. St Matthew's A wedge-shaped ward in between the streets of Ribbleton and the city centre, this ward contains some deprived housing in the process of renewal, and in the recent months expensive new-build conversions. Town Centre Formed by boundary changes prior to Preston being awarded city status, Town Centre is the largest non-rural ward in the borough. There are three distinct parts to this central seat, namely Avenham, Frenchwood and the city centre itself. The ward includes student developments and converted student homes in Avenham; expensive new build developments around the historic Winckley Square; and the Frenchwood area on the banks of the River Ribble. Avenham was notorious for high levels of crime and deprivation, but this is turning around with the establishment of community groups and private housing associations funding renewal. There is a sizable Muslim population in Avenham and Frenchwood. Tulketh Tulketh ward is a central and entirely urban ward north of the University complex, and to the east of Ashton. Its main population areas are traditional terrace housing, which mixes families with small shops including the Lane Ends shopping village and student housing. Cllr Al-Serraj died in 2007. The resulting by-election was held the following year, resulting in a hold for the defending Labour Party. University Shaped around the outskirts of the city centre, this butterfly-wing shaped ward was formed following the recent boundary changes. It took from the oversized Riversway ward electors from the St Pauls and Maudland areas as well as the University campus itself. It is a two-member ward. The last election for University ward was held in 2003. The changes in vote are from the election in this year.

This was built at a cost of ¬£100,000 which was promised after a presentation to Lord Nuffield by Whetnall. As hearing problems became diagnosed earlier through better and more sensitive screening methods the unit's speciality or expertise expanded to include disorders of speech and language. So as not to hold the children back educationally from their peers who could attend normal schools the unit then included an educational curriculum so as to ease the children's eventual transition into mainstream education.

Although the campus is located within the suburb of Curl Curl, the school takes the name from the nearby suburb of Freshwater. The site began life as Manly Girls High School, as a single-sex sister school for girls only to Manly Boys High School, a single-sex school for boys only, now re- constituted as the co-educational selective Manly Selective Campus. In 1983 Freshwater High School was formed as a co-educational school catering for students from Year 7 to Year 12. During 2002 and 2003 Freshwater High School was re-constituted as the Freshwater Senior Campus of Northern Beaches Secondary College. The campus was first used in its current role in Term 2 of 2003, while still under construction. At that time students of the newly formed campus moved from the previous Beacon Hill High School site. Freshwater has an enrolment of approximately 550 students and has approximately 50 teaching staff. Students enroll at Freshwater for the final two years of high school. Typically, Freshwater takes its students from the Cromer Campus and other campuses of the Northern Beaches Secondary College.

It also arises when one partner tries to maintain power and control over the other through abuse or violence, for example when a relationship has broken down. This abuse or violence can take a number of forms, such as sexual assault, sexual harassment, threats, physical violence, verbal, mental, or emotional abuse, social sabotage, and stalking. In extreme cases it may manifest in date rape. It can include psychological abuse, emotional blackmail, sexual abuse, physical abuse and psychological manipulation. Though most frequently the perpetrator of abuse is a male partner against a female partner, abuse by a female partner against a male also takes place. Dating violence crosses all racial, age, economic and social lines. The Center for Relationship Abuse Awareness describes dating abuse as a \\"pattern of abusive and coercive behaviors used to maintain power and control over a former or current intimate partner.\\"Warning Signs of Abuse Profiles of abuser and victim Individuals of all walks of life can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Abuse can occur regardless of the couple's age, race, income, or other demographic traits. There are, however, many traits that abusers and victims share in common. The Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence describes abusers as being obsessively jealous and possessive, overly confident, having mood swings or a history of violence or temper, seeking to isolate their partner from family, friends and colleagues, and having a tendency to blame external stressors.Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence Meanwhile, victims of relationship abuse share many traits as well, including: physical signs of injury, missing time at work or school, slipping performance at work or school, changes in mood or personality, increased use of drugs or alcohol, and increasing isolation from friends and family.Common Myths and Facts Alabama Public Health Training Center. pp. 3-4. Victims may blame themselves for any abuse that occurs or may minimize the severity of the crime. This often leads to victims choosing to stay in abusive relationships. Strauss (2005)Strauss, Murray A. (2005) \\"Women's Violence Towards Men Is A Serious Social Problem.\\" In D.R. Loeske, et al., eds. Current controversies in family violence. Newbery Park: Sage Publications. argues that while men inflict the greater share of injuries in domestic violence, researchers and society at large must not overlook the substantial minority of injuries inflicted by women. Additionally, Strauss notes that even relatively minor acts of physical aggression by women are a serious concern: :'Minor' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men. [...] It will be argued that in order to end 'wife beating,' it is essential for women also to end what many regard as a 'harmless' pattern of slapping, kicking, or throwing something at a male partner who persists in some outrageous behavior and 'won't listen to reason.' Similarly, Deborah Capaldi \\"quoted in Sacks, Glenn. (2009) Researcher Says Women's Initiation of Domestic Violence Predicts Risk to Women.\\" on HuffPost, 6 July 2009. Retrieved 9 January 2019. reports that a 13-year longitudinal study found that a woman's aggression towards a man was equally important as the man's tendency towards violence in predicting the likelihood of overall violence: \\"Since much IPV [Intimate Partner Violence] is mutual and women as well as men initiate IPV, prevention and treatment approaches should attempt to reduce women's violence as well as men's violence. Such an approach has a much higher chance of increasing women's safety.\\" However, Capaldi's research only focused on at- risk youth, not women in general, and, therefore, may not apply to the entire population.

Besides the village of Brienzwiler, the municipality also includes the settlement of Balmhof. History A traditional house from the Canton of Valais at the Ballenberg Museum Brienzwiler is first mentioned in 1347 as Wiler am Br√ºnig. During the Middle Ages Brienzwiler was held by the Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family of Rudenz. They held the city for the Lords of Ringgenberg. The Rudenz family held the village until 1361 when they sold it to a citizen of Bern. Over the following years it passed from owner to owner and was subdivided until the city of Bern acquired the entire village in 1522. When Bern adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1528, they secularized and annexed the lands of the nearby Interlaken Abbey, including some land near Brienzwiler. Bern assigned Brienzwiler to the newly created, secular bailiwick of Interlaken. Brienzwiler belongs to the large parish of Brienz. However, since the early 20th century they have their own filial church and cemetery. Traditionally, the village's economy was based on farming in the Aare river valley and seasonal alpine herding in the alpine valleys. They also received some income from travelers over the Br√ºnig Pass. Beginning in the 19th century, there was a small tourist industry in the municipality and in 1888 a rail station of the Br√ºnig railway line allowed more tourists to visit. Today the local economy is based on wood carving, government jobs, hotel and tourism related work and the Ballenberg Open Air Museum.

Projects In the 1960s, he shot to prominence through his work with singer-songwriter Michael Chapman, and had a reputation within the music industry as a rock and blues session bassist, before his transition into British folk rock. Kemp joined Steeleye Span in 1972, left in 1986, rejoined in 2000, and left again at the end of 2016. In 1971 Kemp played with King Crimson, shortly before the band recorded their album Islands. However, he turned down the opportunity to join them on a full-time basis, and reportedly departed the band after just two weeks.[ King Crimson biography], AllMusic Kemp has played bass on a number of Maddy Prior recordings, and was a member of the Maddy Prior Band in the 1980s. The 1990 album Happy Families was officially credited to \\"Maddy Prior and Rick Kemp\\". He also played on solo albums by former Steeleye Span member Tim Hart in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 Kemp co-founded the record label Plant Life with Steeleye Span drummer Nigel Pegrum. The label was discontinued in 1984. He has released five solo albums: Escape (1996), Spies (1998), Codes (2004), Fanfare (2009) and Perfect Blue (2018). The line-up for his first two solo albums consisted primarily of a traditional Blues three-piece, with Kemp working alongside Spud Sinclair on guitar and Charlie Carruthers on drums. His more recent albums have seen Kemp himself playing most of the instruments, with various guest musicians. From 1997 to around 2009, Kemp was the producer for the ceilidh dance band, Whapweasel. He also occasionally played guitar (as opposed to bass) with them. Personal life Kemp lives in Carlisle, Cumbria and was a Music Tutor at Cumbria College of Art and Design in Carlisle in 1989.

It is a Grade II* listed building in the National Heritage List for England, and retains at least 24 pieces of medieval figurative carving. A notice outside of the church reads: \\"St Leonard's with St Mary's. Founded in the 12th century as a Chapel of Ease to the Gilbertine Priory at Old Malton. This Church was transferred by way of gift as an ecumenical gesture of goodwill from the Church of England to the Roman Catholic Church in 1971.\\" Dating as it does from the mid- to late-1100s, this church is the oldest currently held by Catholics in England, a distinction formerly belonging to St Etheldreda's, London, which was built some time between 1250 and 1290. St Leonard's is the first English parish church to be returned to Roman Catholic use following the Reformation. History The first known mention of St. Leonard's is around 1150, when it was given, together with St Michael‚Äôs, to the Gilbertine order as a chapel of ease for the Malton Priory, about a mile distant in \\"old\\" Malton. The church's tower was built in the 15th century. It originally had a stone spire, which was later later replaced by one of timber and slate. The church passed into the hands of the Church of England around December 1539, when the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII closed the Malton Priory. In 1768 a peal of 8 bells was added to the tower, cast by Lester and Pack (later the Whitechapel Bell Foundry). A tower clock was installed in 1897, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Over the centuries there were considerable changes to the building. In 1907 a restoration attempt was undertaken by the architect Charles Hodgson Fowler. This included a refenestration of the north elevation and a rebuilding of the south walls of the nave and chancel. In 1969, the Church of England closed St Leonard‚Äôs and, in 1971, presented it to the Roman Catholic Church. At that time, the dedication of the church to St Leonard was extended to include St Mary: it was from the Catholic chapel to St Mary in Wells Street, Malton, that the congregation transferred. A stained glass window from that chapel was conveyed as a physical marker of this move. In 1988-9 there was a major reordering of the floor plan: a dais with an altar was placed in the middle of the nave on the south side and the seating arranged around that. The old chancel was retained as the Blessed Sacrament chapel, separated from the nave by an open screen.

The use of astrology in any context is not empirically based and its use in predicting financial markets is at plain odds with standard economic and financial theory. As with astrology in general, predictions are vague and hard dates are rarely given. Critics have pointed out that some astrological events that have been used in predictions occur so rarely that they may have never happened before within a human lifetime, thus having no precedent on which to predict results.  History  In 1992, 1994 and 2008, a magazine by the name of Wall Street Forecaster was named as one of the top forecasters on Wall Street, as the superstition was being leaned on for luck. It was also rated the second best performing forecaster in 2002. It was reported that some clients asked for their copies to be delivered in 'brown paper' to avoid mockery . As of 2001 the Astro fund trading company, which handled $3.5-5 million worth of investor assets, claimed 10-15% of fund managers were using their service or a similar company. The majority of the market demand for this service has come from the US and Japan respectively. In 2000, Bloomberg News was host to a weekly show dedicated to financial astrology. The 2000 financial crash led to a surge in companies and investment bankers using the services of financial astrologers.  Criticism  Large financial firms tend to ignore financial astrology. The practice was used by Goldman Sachs in a paper released in 1999, focusing specifically on the correlation between eclipses and the state of the financial market at that time. Though floated as an idea by the company at the time, analysis showed that random data produced similar results. A 2007 study by The British Association for the Advancement of Science conducted an experiment wherein a financial astrologer, professional investor, and five- year-old child, were asked to invest ¬£5,000 on the FTSE100.

Left to right: alt= Russian Futurism is the broad term for a movement of Russian poets and artists who adopted the principles of Filippo Marinetti's \\"Manifesto of Futurism,\\" which espoused the rejection of the past, and a celebration of speed, machinery, violence, youth, industry, destruction of academies, museums, and urbanism; it also advocated the modernization and cultural rejuvenation. Russian Futurism began roughly in the early 1910s; in 1912, a year after Ego-Futurism began, the literary group \\"Hylea\\" - also spelt \\"Guil√©e\\" and \\"Gylea\\" - issued the manifesto A Slap in the Face of Public Taste. The 1912 movement was originally called Cubo-Futurism, but this term is now used to refer to the style of art produced. Russian Futurism ended shortly after the Russian Revolution of 1917, after which former Russian Futurists either left the country, or participated in the new art movements. Notable Russian Futurists included Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov, David Burliuk, Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Velimir Khlebnikov. Style The Manifesto celebrated the ‚Äúbeauty of speed‚Äù and the machine as the new aesthetic. Marinetti explained the ‚Äúbeauty of speed‚Äù as ‚Äúa roaring automobile is more beautiful than the Winged Victory‚Äù further asserting the movement towards the future. Artforms were greatly affected by the Russian Futurism movement within Russia, with its influences being seen in cinema, literature, typography, politics, and propaganda. The Russian Futuristic movement saw its demise in the early 1920s. Origins The Knifegrinder (1912-13), by Kazimir Malevich, is an example how Cubism and Futurism crossed over to create Cubo-Futurism, a combined art form. Khlebnikov and Kruchenykh's poems with Goncharova's bold imagery. The first Futurist group in Russia was Ego-Futurism, which was launched in 1911 by the poet Igor Severyanin. A larger group of Russian Futurism may be said to have been born in December 1912, when the Moscow-based literary group Hylaea ( [Gileya]) (initiated in 1910 by David Burlyuk and his brothers at their estate near Kherson, and quickly joined by Vasily Kamensky and Velimir Khlebnikov, with Aleksey Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1911)Victor Terras, Handbook of Russian Literature (Yale University Press, 1990), s.v. \\"Hylaea\\", p. 197. issued a manifesto entitled A Slap in the Face of Public Taste (Russian: –ü–æ—â—ë—á–∏–Ω–∞ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É –≤–∫—É—Å—É). The Russian Futurist Manifesto shared similar ideas to Marinetti‚Äôs Manifesto, such as the rejection of old literature for the new and unexpected. In addition to the forenamed authors, the group included artists Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova, Kazimir Malevich, and Olga Rozanova.Gurianova, Nina \\"Game in Hell, Hard Work in Heaven: Deconstructing the Canon in Russian Futurist Books\\" The Russian avant-garde book, 1910-1934 Ed. Margit Rowell and Deborah Wye. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2002. Although Hylaea is generally considered to be the most influential group of Russian Futurism, other groups were formed in St. Petersburg (Igor Severyanin's Ego-Futurists), Moscow (Tsentrifuga, with Boris Pasternak among its members), Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa. While many artforms and artists converged to create ‚ÄúRussian Futurism‚Äù, David Burlyuk (born 1882, Ukraine) is credited with publicizing the avant-garde movement and increasing its renown within Europe and the United States. Burlyuk was a Russian poet, critic, and publisher who centralized the Russian movement. While his contribution to the arts were lesser than his peers, he was the first to discover many of talented poets and artists associated with the movement. Burlyuk was the first to publish Velimir Khlebnikov and to celebrate the Futurist poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky. Russian futurism also adopted ideas from ‚ÄúFrench Cubism‚Äù which coined the name ‚ÄúCubo-Futurists‚Äù given by an art critic in 1913. Cubo-futurism adopted ideas from ‚ÄúItalian Futurism‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrench Cubism‚Äù to create its own blended style of visual art. It emphasized the breakdown of forms, the use of various viewpoints, the intersection of spatial planes, and the contrast of colour and texture. The focus was to show the intrinsic value of a painting, without it being dependent on a narrative. Modernity Like their Italian counterparts, the Russian Futurists were fascinated with the dynamism, speed, and restlessness of modern machines and urban life. They purposely sought to arouse controversy and to gain publicity by repudiating the static art of the past. The likes of Pushkin and Dostoevsky, according to A Slap in the Face of Public taste, should be \\"heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity\\". They acknowledged no authorities whatsoever; even Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, when he arrived in Russia on a proselytizing visit in 1914, was obstructed by most Russian Futurists, who did not profess to owe him anything.  Cinema  Russian Futurist cinema refers to the futurist movement in Soviet cinema. Russian Futurist cinema was deeply influenced by the films of Italian futurism (1916-1919) most of which are lost today. Some of the film directors identified as part of this movement are Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin and Aleksandr Dovzhenko. Sergei Eisenstein's film Strike was seen as \\"the mordern Futurist art form par excellence.\\" by Olga Bulgakowa. Bulgakowa theorized how the camera could change one's perceptions of reality and how it could make it seem like time was speeding up or slowing down during the film. Literature and Typography In contrast to Marinetti's circle, Russian Futurism was primarily a literary rather than a plastic philosophy. Although many poets (Mayakovsky, Burlyuk) dabbled with painting, their interests were primarily literary. However, such well-established artists as Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova, and Kazimir Malevich found inspiration in the refreshing imagery of Futurist poems and experimented with versification themselves. The poets and painters collaborated on such innovative productions as the Futurist opera Victory Over the Sun, with music by Mikhail Matyushin, texts by Kruchenykh and sets contributed by Malevich. Cyclist (1913) by Natalia Goncharova. This painting is an example of how Russian Futurism affected her later works. Members of Hylaea elaborated the doctrine of Cubo-Futurism and assumed the name of budetlyane (from the Russian word budet 'will be'). They found significance in the shape of letters, in the arrangement of text around the page, in the details of typography. They considered that there is no substantial difference between words and material things, hence the poet should arrange words in his poems like the artist arranges colors and lines on his canvas. Grammar, syntax, and logic were often discarded; many neologisms and profane words were introduced; onomatopoeia was declared a universal texture of verse. Khlebnikov, in particular, developed \\"an incoherent and anarchic blend of words stripped of their meaning and used for their sound alone\\", known as zaum. Politics With all this emphasis on formal experimentation, some Futurists were not indifferent to politics. In particular, Mayakovsky's poems, with their lyrical sensibility, appealed to a broad range of readers. He vehemently opposed the meaningless slaughter of World War I and hailed the Russian Revolution as the end of that traditional mode of life which he and other Futurists ridiculed so zealously. Although never a member of the Russian Communist Party (RKP(b)), he was active in early 1919 in the attempt to set up Komfut as an organisation promoting Futurism affiliated to the Viborg District Branch of the Party.  The Bolshevik Agit- trains  War correspondent Arthur Ransome and five other foreigners were taken to see two of the Bolshevik propaganda trains in 1919 by their organiser, Burov. The organiser first showed them the \\"Lenin\\",Jonathan Smele, The \\"Russian\\" Civil Wars, 1916‚Äì1926: Ten Years that Shook the World. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015; pg. 248. which had been painted a year and a half ago The \\"Red Cossack\\" was quite different. As Burov put it with deep satisfaction, \\"At first we were in the artists‚Äô hands, and now the artists are in our hands\\". Initially the artists were so revolutionary that at one point Burov had delivered the Department of Proletarian Culture some Futurists \\"bound hand and foot\\", but now \\"the artists had been brought under proper control\\". The other three trains were the \\"Sverdlov\\", the \\"October Revolution\\", and the \\"Red East\\". Demise Black Square (1915), by Kazimir Malevich, was featured at the 0,10 Exhibition, the last exhibition of Russian Futurist paintings. The exhibition was held from December 19, 1915 to January 17, 1916. After the Bolsheviks gained power, Mayakovsky's group‚Äîpatronized by Anatoly Lunacharsky, Bolshevik Commissar for Education‚Äîaspired to dominate Soviet culture. Their influence was paramount during the first years after the revolution, until their program‚Äîor rather lack thereof‚Äîwas subjected to scathing criticism by the authorities. By the time OBERIU attempted to revive some of the Futurist tenets during the late 1920s, the Futurist movement in Russia had already ended. The most militant Futurist poets either died (Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky) or preferred to adjust their very individual style to more conventional requirements and trends (Aseyev, Pasternak). The decline of futurism can also be seen in Russia when Kruchenykh attempted to publish Fifteen Years of Russian Futurism 1912-1927 in 1928 and the Communist Party made it clear they did not want any futurist influence in Soviet literature. This marked the an abrupt fall from grace for Kruchenykh's writing and futurism as a literary movement.

Motto over door reads: Fier coum Cyrus, mes viers gar√ßons, j'vos ouvre l'us, l'us d'ma caumine (Proud as Cyrus, my old boys, I open to you the door, the door of my cottage) The Soci√©t√© Jersiaise is a learned society in Jersey which was founded in 1873, in the manner of similar county societies in the United Kingdom and Soci√©t√©s Savantes in France for the purposes of: *\\"The Publication of Local History, *The encouragement of the use of French, the official language, *The study of the ancient local dialect, *To achieve, as far as possible, the conservation of all prehistoric and historical sites, *To found a library, mainly historical and archaeological, *To collaborate with other societies with similar aims\\" The Soci√©t√© continues to fulfill these objectives, with two important differences ‚Äì because it can no longer be said that French is the official language, the encouragement of its use has been dropped and, secondly, an important addition to the aims is the study of all branches of the natural history of the island and publication of the results of fieldwork in these subjects. By 1878 a museum had been formed. In 1893 the Soci√©t√© moved to No. 9 Pier Rd, which continues to house the museum. The Soci√©t√© is a registered charity funded through subscriptions, donations and legacies. History On 28 January 1873 a meeting of notables of the island took place to discuss the formation of a society for the preservation of the island's archaeological, historical and linguistic heritage, perceived to be threatened by the expansion of St Helier and coastal development. Those present were aware of the foundation of similar societies in mainland Normandy, such as Soci√©t√© des Antiquaires de Normandie (founded 1824) and similar county societies in the United Kingdom. In 1893 the Soci√©t√© was given a large townhouse in Saint Helier which became the base for its operations including its library and museum. In 1913 the various branches of activity were formalised into 'sections', amongst the first being Archaeology and History. The Section structure still exists and now comprise some 15 sections. From its inception the Soci√©t√© engaged in archaeological work at numerous sites around the island; most importantly beginning work at La Cotte de St Brelade in 1905, a Neanderthal site of international importance. In 1919 the Soci√©t√© purchased the important Neolithic site of La Hougue Bie, excavating it in 1924 revealing a Neolithic chambered passage grave c.4000BC. The site was then restored and opened as a museum. The Soci√©te flourished throughout the 20th century, notwithstanding the difficult years of the German military occupation of the Channel Islands between 1940‚Äì1945. Despite the severe hardships and lack of resources suffered by the island, the museum at Pier Rd remained open throughout the Occupation, but despite protestations La Hougue Bie museum was requisitioned for military purposes by the Nazi occupiers. Post-war the Soci√©t√© continued to grow and add to its collections to the extent that during the 1970s a new headquarters was built adjoining the Pier Road Museum. In 1987 the Soci√©t√© entered into an agreement with the States of Jersey for its museums to be run by the Jersey Heritage Trust, whilst retaining ownership of its collections. This enabled the Soci√©t√© to concentrate on its core activities of research and publication. In 1990 the Soci√©t√© also entered into a working partnership with the National Trust for Jersey which its members had helped to found in 1937, to develop a country life museum at Hamptonne, St Lawrence, a late medieval farm with manorial pretensions, the National Trust purchasing the property, the Soci√©t√© financing the restoration. Presently, the Soci√©t√© has approximately 2,000 members. Library The Soci√©t√© library contains much unique and important material about Jersey and comparative academic literature in the form of published works and manuscript documents including maps. The Soci√©t√© employs a professional librarian. Photographic archive The Soci√©t√© Jersiaise Photographic Archive contains, as a result of the foresight of early members, by far the most important collection of historic photographic images of the island. A professional photographic archivist is employed by the Soci√©t√© to manage the collection of approximately 100,000 images dating from the mid-1840s to the present day. Museum collections Now curated by Jersey Heritage the Soci√©t√©'s extensive museum collections contain items on all aspects of Jersey life, in particular Jersey's archaeological heritage. This remains the only substantial collection of Jersey material and is continually expanded by purchase and donation of new pieces, most recently (as of August 2012) a complete Neolithic jadeite ring (anneau-disque) which had been discovered in Jersey in the late 1980s but sold by the finder to a private collector in the USA. Publications Much of the work of the Soci√©t√© is published in its Bulletin Annuel commenced in 1875. In addition, the Soci√©t√© has published many works of its members and other scholars. In its early years the Soci√©t√© published many primary sources, such as the Cartulaire des √éles and Actes des √âtats de Jersey to enable its members and others to carry out primary research. Latterly, it has published many secondary works produced by its members and other scholars, many of which remain in print. The Bulletin has been digitised and is available to view on their website.

The team was owned by long-time engine builder Bob Rahilly and Butch Mock. Mock left Rahmoc in 1993 to form his own team. Rahmoc Enterprises is still operating today, with Dick and Bob Rahilly still turning the wrenches, as an engine builder and supplier for many NASCAR teams. They also build racecars and manage several smaller race teams.  Beginnings  Rahmoc's debut in NASCAR came in 1978 competing in two events, at the NAPA National 500. Mock drove the No. 75 Chevrolet to a 26th-place finish. He also ran the Dixie 500at Atlanta, finishing 24th. Mock ran the 1979 Daytona 500 the next year, but finished 35th when he was involved in a wreck not of his making early in the race. After the Daytona wreck, Mock ceased driving and Rahmoc had several different drivers. Some were, Lennie Pond at Atlanta & Daytona, Bobby Brack at Charlotte, and Bill Elswick for numerous races, his best finish being 16th at Richmond. Harry Gant drove in 1980 for the team at Riverside International Raceway, finishing seventh and Texas world Speedway, finishing eighth. Elswick returned over the next eleven races, and the team also picked up sponsorship from his Performer Boats Company. John Anderson, Chuck Bown, Joe Millikan, and Elswick finished out the year. Millikan came back in 1981, but was replaced after the Gabriel 400 by Tim Richmond. Richmond got his first top 10 finish in that event at Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway. Gary Balough drove for the rest of the 1981 season. Balough returned in 1982, posting a top-ten at the Coca-Cola 500, but was released after his legal issues just five races into the season. Joe Ruttman took over for the rest of the season, Except for the Riverside Event, posting four top-fives, and numerous top tens.Jimmy Insolo filled in for the team at Riverside.  1983‚Äì1992  In 1983, Rahmoc signed a one-year driver/sponsor agreement for Neil Bonnett to drive their first time for the team, full-time sponsored Hodgdon Chevy. Bonnett picked up wins in the Busch Clash and the UNO 125 at Daytona, the World 600 at Charlotte and the Atlanta Journal 500. He finished sixth in points that year. For the 1984 season, and again without any sponsorship, long-time independent Dave Marcis was named driver, and had nine top-tens and a thirteenth place in points. Lake Speed took over in 1985, finishing second in The Daytona 500 in his first start with the team. This result brought full- time sponsor Nationwize Auto Parts to them and they finished 10th in the points. Speed had two tenth-place finishes in 1986, but was released after four races by the sponsor. Jody Ridley stepped in as an interim driver and had one top-ten before moving on after 10 races. Jim Sauter had four starts, before Morgan Shepherd took over for the balance of the season, posting two top-tens. Rahmoc's 1989 racecar. In 1987, Bonnett returned with Valvoline as the sponsor of Rahmoc's Pontiacs. Bonnett had fifteen top-tens and was on his way to a top-ten points run, when he broke his hip in a crash at the Oakwood Homes 500. Morgan Shepard returned to the team to finish the season for the team, nearly winning the Rockingham Event. Bonnett returned in 1988, finished 4th in the Daytona 500 and won at Richmond and Rockingham and at a special race at Calder Park in Australia, all in the first four races of the season. But eventually, he began to have health issues, fell off the pace, missing several races. Due to Neil's health, sponsor Valvoline called for a new driver going into the 1989 season. Shepherd, who had filled in for Bonnett twice in 1988, was named as the full-time driver in 1989 with Valvoline again as the sponsor, the final of their 3-year agreement with Rahmoc. He garnered one pole and thirteen top-tens. Valvoline indicated they would return as a sponsor in 1990 if a younger driver could be had. So for 1990, Rick Wilson joined the team, which switched to Oldsmobile and with a late partial limited sponsorship from Food Lion/Dinner Bell Foods since Valvoline had ultimately decided instead to sit out the 1990 season. Wilson struggled heavily in his tenure, and mutually agreed to split with the team at season end. In 1991, Joe Ruttman, and with full sponsorship from Dinner Bell joined Rahmoc for the second time in his career. He finished third in The Daytona 500 and had four top-ten finishes and finished 20th in points. Without a sponsor for 1992, Dick Trickle drove the car for Rahmoc in the Daytona 500, finishing fifth. After that event, team co-owner Bob Rahilly elected to retire from Winston Cup Racing, and return to his roots as an engine builder/supplier. Mock went on to form his own new team, Butch Mock Motorsports.  Final years  After the 1992 Daytona 500, Bob Rahilly and Butch Mock split. Bob & Dick Rahilly continue building engines and race cars under the name \\"RAHMOC Racing Engines\\". Bob Rahilly had no more involvement in Winston Cup Racing after 1992. Butch Mock was the sole owner of a new team he formed, Butch Mock Motorsports. Bob and Dick Rahilly still continue to build Championship Winning Race Engines and Race Cars at the original Rahmoc facility on Flowes Store Rd. in Concord, NC to this day. 2018 Driver history RahMoc Enterprises *Butch Mock (1978‚Äì79) *Bill Elswick (1979‚Äì81) *Bobby Brack (1979) *Harry Gant (1980) *Lennie Pond (1980) *John Anderson (1980) *Chuck Bown (1980) *Kyle Petty (1980) *Jim Sauter (1980, 1986) *Joe Millikan (1980‚Äì81) *Dick May (1981) *Tim Richmond (1981) *Gary Balough (1981‚Äì82) *Joe Ruttman (1982, 1987, 1991) *Jimmy Insolo (1982) *Neil Bonnett (1983, 1987‚Äì88) *Dave Marcis (1984) *Lake Speed (1985‚Äì86) *Jody Ridley (1986) *Morgan Shepherd (1986, 1988‚Äì89, 1996) *Rick Wilson (1990) *Dick Trickle (1992 Daytona 500, suspended operations; returned in 1993 with Butch Mock Motorsports)  External links  *RahMoc Enterprises Winston Cup Owner Statistics (1978‚Äì1992) 1978 establishments in the United Kingdom American auto racing teams Defunct NASCAR teams 2001 disestablishments in North Carolina ","title":"RahMoc Enterprises"},{"id":"5031854","text":"Kubrat (; ) is a town in Razgrad Province, Northeastern Bulgaria, part of the Ludogorie region.

The illicit use of this drug combination has been widespread, particularly in South and Southeast Asian countries. Alternative names From ya khayan ('hard-working pill') in its early days to ya maa ('horse medicine'), the drug was named ya ba ('crazy pill') in 1996. It was given to horses when pulling carts up steep hills and for other strenuous work in Shan State in Burma (now Myanmar). The slang terms for ya ba in Burma are kyethi (literally, 'button'), athi, and palarkar. In Malaysia, ya ba is known in Malay as pil kuda (literally, 'horse pill'). It is commonly found in the state of Kelantan, on the border with Thailand. The name commonly used for it in the Philippines and Indonesia is shab√∫. In north Thailand it is often referred to as chocalee due to the somewhat sweet taste ya ba leaves in the mouth and its strong chocolate smell.\\"Drugs Inc. Bangkok Ice\\" S7/Ep19 (2015) The name commonly used for it in China is ma-goo or ma-guo. In Bangladesh, it's colloquially known as baba, guti, laal, khawon, chodon, stuff, maal, or bichi. Ya ba is sometimes called bhul bhuliya in India. Appearance and use Ya ba is typically produced in a round pill form. There are many different versions of ya ba, and the most common are red, pink, orange, or lime green in color and carry logos such as \\"R\\" or \\"WY\\". They are small and round, roughly in diameter, which means they can be packed inside a plastic soda straw for easy transportation or in a reusable \\"mint\\" container. Ya ba tablets typically are consumed orally. Users also place the ya ba tablet on aluminum foil and heat it from below. As the tablet melts, vapors rise and are inhaled (\\"chasing the dragon\\"). The drug also may be administered by crushing the tablets into powder, which is then snorted or mixed with a solvent and injected. When swallowed in pill form the duration of the drug's effect is between 8‚Äì16 hours, as compared to 1‚Äì3 hours when smoked, while the intensity is considerably reduced. The peak of the drug's effect is followed by a comedown period lasting 6‚Äì10 hours, during which the user may have difficulty sleeping or eating. Many users report that it takes them up to 24 hours after consumption to be able to fall asleep. Ya ba is not commonly injected as many intravenous users prefer the pure product instead (methamphetamine, called \\"ice\\" in Southeast Asia). This illegal drug is especially popular in Thailand, where it is imported from Burma or Laos even though it is sometimes manufactured locally in Thailand. Typical ya ba users are working males, aged 16‚Äì40 years old, and its use is not uncommon among both female and male sex workers in Thailand and Cambodia. Suppliers Burma (Myanmar) is the largest producer of methamphetamine in the world, with the majority of ya ba found in Thailand being produced in Burma, particularly in the Golden Triangle and northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos, and China. In 2010, Burma trafficked 1 billion tablets to neighbouring Thailand. Ethnic militias and rebel groups (in particular the United Wa State Army) are responsible for much of this production; however, the Burmese military units are believed to be heavily involved in the trafficking of the drugs. Ya ba use around the world =Rise and fall in popularity in Thailand= Ya ba tablets were formerly sold at gas stations and were commonly used by long-haul drivers to stay awake. After many horrific long-distance bus accidents, they were outlawed by the Thai government in 1970. The deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's campaign from 2003 to eliminate drug- trafficking further helped to curtail widespread use. In particular, use of the drug by bus drivers and truckers is not as widespread as it was in the 1980s. As a result of the Thai government crackdown, restricted supply has had an effect on prices, further curtailing the popular use of ya ba. In 1999‚Äì2000, when buying a straw-full (around 20 pills) in Chiang Rai Province, north Thailand, ya ba was sold for around 10 baht per pill and commonly used on the go-go circuit and by young \\"MTV\\" clubbers. Retail prices have risen from 100‚Äì150 baht (US$3‚Äì4) to 250‚Äì450 baht per pill as a result of the crackdown, though it remains a popular party drug. In 2000, ya ba was smuggled across the porous border with Myanmar and from the neighbouring Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai Provinces of Thailand. Illegal traffickers often marketed or promoted their product by claiming that the pills contained up to six percent heroin. Rumour suggested it was produced by corrupt personnel of Wa State Army in Burma. In 2014, it was reported that Thailand's northeast provinces have seen a 700 percent increase in the number of people arrested for meth since 2008, according to data from the Narcotics Suppression Bureau. In 2013, authorities counted more than 33,000 meth-related arrests in the northeast. The rapid growth of ya ba use in Isan mirrors that which is occurring across Asia, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of global amphetamine-type stimulant users. On 16 June 2016, the National Council for Peace and Order, the military junta ruling Thailand, stated that it was planning to decriminalise ya ba. =Bangladesh= In 2006, ya ba consumption became common for the poor. Although the extent of ya ba abuse in Bangladesh is not precisely known, seizures of the drug by authorities are frequent. It is also believed those who use it on a regular basis are frequently involved in the distribution of the drug, either directly or indirectly. Some Burmese Rohingya refugees are hired by drug dealers to smuggle ya ba from Myanmar into Bangladesh. In 2016, 359 illegal Burmese were arrested on ya ba-smuggling charges, and up to US$29 million worth of ya ba was seized by the Bangladeshi authorities. In October 2018 Bangladesh government drafted a law which punishes a person up to capital punishment who carries a minimum 200 grams of ya ba. =Other countries= In February 2010 it was reported that increasingly large quantities of ya ba were being smuggled into Israel by Thai migrant workers, leading to fears that its use would spread to the Israeli club scene, where ecstasy use is already common. In recent years, in the United States it is occasionally also used as a club drug replacing ecstasy. References Further reading * External links * New Drug Seeping into California Communities.

It is a non-profit liberal-conservative organisation with strong links to the Popular Party (PP); it is even known informally as the \\"People's Party think-tank\\". Its headquarters are in Madrid. Each year, the FAES publishes a Report on Activities, which can be downloaded from its website. Origin The organisation was founded on November 11, 2002. Prior to the creation of the FAES, there were five separate foundations, all linked to the PP. These were: Fundaci√≥n C√°novas del Castillo, Popular Iberoamericana, Popular Iberoamericana de An√°lisis y Estudios Sociales, Popular Iberoamericana de Estudios Europeos y el Instituto de Formaci√≥n Pol√≠tica. These five foundations merged, becoming FAES. Founding principles The FAES seeks to reinforce values such as Western freedom, democracy and humanism. Some of its founding principles include: * liberal and representative democracy * market economy * defense of the idea of Europe as a union of nations bound by similar values * alliance with Europe and the United States It specifically advocates liberal and representative democracy because it allows the best ‚Äúpossible coordination between the nation's democratic exercise of power and the defense of individual rights.‚Äù FAES supports a market economy because it is most suited to allow ‚Äúefficient allocation of resources, the boosting of reform, the strengthening of the middle class and the promotion of individual liberty.‚Äù The link between the US and Europe is essential to defend against threats such as terrorism and fundamentalism and will benefit the creation of a free trade area. Goals FAES aims to create, promote and spread ideas based on political, intellectual and economic freedom. Many of these ideas provide political alternatives to socialism. The purpose is to transform these ideas into programs of political action to better the future of Spain. Instruments used to achieve these goals include discussion groups, seminars, lectures, summer conferences, and training courses. FAES‚Äô ideas and political proposals are also disseminated through electronic publications such as a journal (known as Cuadernos de pensamiento pol√≠tico), reports (known as FAES Papers) and books. Organization The president of the association is former prime minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar. The vice president since 2106 is Manuel Pizarro. The Secretary-General is Javier Zarzalejos. A board of trustees also governs the organization. Their responsibilities include deciding on a plan of activities and a budget as well as outlining areas of interest. FAES is organized in several departments: * Economy and Public Policies * Constitution and Institutions * International Department * Publishing Department * Communications Department * Management Department * Organization Department FAES has four specialized units: * Instituto C√°novas del Castillo: researches and disseminates the history of Spanish liberal-conservative thinking * Instituto Manuel Fraga: studies Spanish political affairs after the democratic transition * Instituto Popular Iberoamericano: develops and strengthens ties between Spain and Latin America * Institut Catalunya Futur: organizes seminars based on the interests of Catalunya In the news =Rankings = In the ‚Äò2012 Global Go To Think Tanks Report and Policy Advice‚Äô FAES was the best ranked Spanish think tank out of the top 150 think tanks worldwide. It was ranked number 60 in this classification, ahead of other Spanish institutions such as CIDOB, FRIDE, Real Instituto Elcano and Instituci√≥n Futuro. In the report ‚ÄòTransparencia, el mejor eslogan 2012‚Äô FAES was first in the political foundations transparency ranking. The report ranked the transparency of many foundations linked to political parties and emphasized that FAES is the only foundation out of the 26 analyzed that provides financial information on its website. =Publications= FAES has published Spanish editions of books on global warming by V√°clav Klaus and Nigel Lawson, both politicians who deny climate science.Klaus's book was originally published in 2007 in Czech as Modr√°, nikoli zelen√° planeta: the Spanish title is Planeta azul (no verde) Lawson's book was originally published in 2008 in English as An Appeal to Reason, A Cool Look at Global Warming : the Spanish title is Una mirada fr√≠a al calentamiento global. May 2013 marked the launch of a new book series called ‚ÄúBiograf√≠as Pol√≠ticas,‚Äù which contains the biographies of important figures in the liberal-conservative tradition of contemporary Spain. =Recent proposals= In October 2013, FAES presented a proposal for a new national energy strategy. It offers recommendations to increase efficiency and market competitiveness. In July 2013, FAES presented a report for an ambitious tax reform entitled ‚ÄúUna reforma fiscal para el crecimiento y el empleo.‚Äù In English, this translates to ‚ÄúA fiscal reform for growth and employment.‚Äù This tax reform seeks to lower taxes in order to promote factors such as economic growth and job creation. At the launch of this the report, which took place on the 2013 FAES campus, Mr. Aznar (president of FAES) advocated such a reform, citing the success that other similarly ambitious tax reforms have had in the past. These include tax reforms undertaken by the Spanish government in 1999 and 2003. Controversies In March 2005, FAES presented a video that directly attacked the political left. The video claimed that the bomb attack of March 11, 2004 was a political ploy to influence the general election, which took place three days later. The video alleges that the PSOE leaders, especially Zapatero, skillfully used the attack to blame the PP party, divide the Spanish public opinion and politically coerce voters to support the left. Some leftist authors consider FAES a hotbed of historical revisionism.

Historia contempor√°nea 32 (2014), p. 79 International relations FAES works internationally with foundations in Latin America, the United States, and throughout Europe. For example, in 2009, FAES established a formal collaborative relationship with CHLI, the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute, which is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that advances the diversity of thought in the US Hispanic community. FAES also works closely with UPLA (an association of center-right parties in Latin America) to defend freedom and democracy in Latin America.

The extant text is dated to the final centuries BCE,Michael Witzel, \\"Autochthonous Aryans? The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts\\" but it may be based on a tradition reaching back to about 700-600 BCE. The text is foundational to Jyotisha (astronomy), one of the six Vedanga disciplines. Its author is traditionally named as Lagadha.Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, History of Science and Technology in Ancient India, Firma K.L Mukhopadhyaya (1986), pp. 486-494Helaine Selin, Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1997), p.977  Textual history  The dating of the Vedanga Jyotisha is relevant for the dating of the Vedic texts. The Vedanga Jyotisha describes the winter solstice for the period of ca. 1400 BCE. This description has been used to date the Vedanga Jyotisha. According to Michael Witzel, the question is \\"whether the description as given in the Jyotisha is also the date of the text in which it is transmitted. It is written in two recensions ‚Äì Rigveda recensions and Yajurveda recensions. Rigveda recensions and Yajurveda recensions have same verses except for eight additional verses in the Yajurveda's one\\". T. K. S. Sastry and R. Kochhar suppose that the Vedanga Jyotisha was written in the period that it describes, and therefore propose an early date, between 1370 and 1150 BCE. David Pingree dates the described solstice as about 1180 BCE, but notes that the relevance of this computation to the date of the Vedanga Jyotisha is not evident. The estimation of 1400-1200 BCE has been followed by others, with Subbarayappa adding that the extant form can possibly be from 700-600 BCE. Other authors propose a later composition. Santanu Chakraverti writes that it has been composed after 700 BCE, while Michael Witzel dates it to the last centuries BCE, based on the style of composing. According to Chakraverti, its description of the winter solstice is correct for ca. 1400 BCE, but not for the time of its composition after 700 BCE. This may be due to the incorporation of late Harappan astronomical knowledge into the Vedic fold, an idea which is also proposed by Subbarayappa. Michael Witzel notes: Subhash Kak disputes the late chronology for the text and argues that it belongs to the second millennium BCE, which is consistent with its internal date. He argues that astronomy in India goes back to an earlier time than is taken by the votaries of the later dateS. Kak, Knowledge of Planets in the Third Millennium BC.\\" Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 37, 1996 and, therefore, the internal date should not be set aside.

Wood or coal embers could be banked in the small stoves overnight so a fire could be easily started early in the morning. A gas cooking surface was often just a grate with jets.

He has been described as Britain's foremost scholar of criminal law. Early life and education Williams was born on 15 February 1911 in Bridgend, Wales. He obtained a First in law at University College of Wales. He was called to the Bar and became a member of Middle Temple in 1935. He was a Research Fellow from 1936 to 1942 and completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in law at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was examined by the Vinerian Professor of English Law at Oxford, Sir William Searle Holdsworth, who was at the time, a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford. Holdsworth famously asked whether it had been submitted for an LLD as opposed to a DPhil, as the quality and rigour of the thesis was so great. Throughout his lifetime he also served as an Honorary and Emeritus Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and Honorary Bencher of Middle Temple; and served as the Professor of Public Law and Quain Professor of Jurisprudence at University College, London, from 1945 to 1955. Legal career Williams' Textbook of Criminal Law (London: Steven & Sons, 1983) is on a United States list of the most cited legal books. The Textbook of Criminal Law, was arguably his best work, as he drew on 50 years of expertise in the area. Williams was well into his seventies when he wrote the 1983 volume. It is a magisterial book written in Socratic style. Williams published article after article in top refereed journals, even in his eighties. He was arguably the greatest legal thinker of the twentieth century. His groundbreaking Criminal Law: The General Part (Steven & Sons, London, 1961) is a classic still widely read and cited. Similarly, his Textbook of Criminal Law, remains a standard textbook for judges, barristers, professors and students. Williams' influence in the highest courts was sustained and significant. One notable example is in R v Shivpuri [1986] A.C. 1, where the defendant imported harmless vegetable material akin to snuff believing he was importing drugs. The House of Lords held: \\"it was immaterial that the appellant was unsure of the exact nature of the substance in his possession in that in any event he believed that he was dealing with either heroin or cannabis the importation of which was prohibited.\\" Lord Bridge of Harwich stated: John Spencer, summed up his massive contribution in 1997: \\"Nowadays Williams is best known as a writer on criminal law, where his fame rests on four books, the influence of which has been enormous. First among these stands his Criminal Law: the General Part (1953), a 900-page text concerned, as he explained in the preface, \\"to search out the general rules of the criminal law, i.e. those applying to more than one crime\\". The Proof of Guilt (1955) is a comparative account of the rules by which criminal cases are tried in England and Wales, penetrating in its analysis of the merits of our system as well as its defects. The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law (1958) examines the philosophical basis for laws against contraception, sterilisation, artificial insemination, abortion, suicide and euthanasia; when it appeared it was very controversial. The fourth book is his 1,000-page Textbook of Criminal Law (1978). This was a successful student textbook, and would be one still if he had ever managed to finish the third edition, on which he had been labouring for 14 years at the time of his death. In 2012, Dennis Baker edited a new third edition of this textbook, continuing the socratic style of the originals. In The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law (1957), Williams criticised Christian, especially Roman Catholic, opposition to contraception, artificial insemination, sterilisation, abortion, suicide and euthanasia. His influential law book Learning the Law, now in its fifteenth edition, is a critically acclaimed and popular introductory text for legal undergraduates. Dubbed \\"Guide, Philosopher and Friend\\", the book is published by London: Sweet & Maxwell. In fact, his range as a writer went far beyond the criminal law. Before turning to the criminal law, Williams had already written what are still the definitive books on a range of other important legal subjects: Liability for Animals (1939), The Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Acts (1943) (1945), Crown Proceedings (1948), Joint Obligations (1949), and Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence (1950). In 1947 he had edited Salmond's Jurisprudence. Academic career Williams was a Reader in English Law then Professor of Public Law and Quain Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of London from 1945 to 1955. He then moved to the University of Cambridge and was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, and a Reader in Law from 1957 to 1965, then Professor of English Law from 1966 to 1968. He then became the Rouse Ball Professor of English Law from 1968 to 1978. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1957. He covered an even wider range of topics in the huge number of articles which, astonishingly, he also found the time to write. It is difficult, indeed, to think of any important legal subject on which at some time he did not have something original and interesting to say. Nor is this all. For taking notes, he invented and patented a new form of shorthand (Speedhand Shorthand, 1952). And with Learning the Law (1945), now in its 11th edition, he wrote a little introductory book about law studies which was, and still remains, indispensable reading for any would-be law student. Williams's voluminous and sometimes complicated writings are inspired by two big and simple notions. The first is that the law should be clear, consistent and accessible. The second is that law should be humane. He was a convinced utilitarian, who held that punishment was an evil to be avoided unless there was a good reason for imposing it, and for whom \\"good reasons\\" meant the well-being of society, not the tenets of religious belief. Hence Leon Radzinowicz's celebrated bon mot about him: \\"Glanville Williams is the illegitimate child of Jeremy Bentham\\". These utilitarian beliefs also underlay Williams's efforts as a law reformer, an activity in which he managed to play two roles at once. The first was the \\"establishment man\\". He devoted many hours over several decades to serving on a range of official committees, in particular the Criminal Law Revision Committee, of which he was a member from 1959 to 1980. In this capacity he shares the credit for a number of reports which led, among other things, to the decriminalisation of suicide in 1961 and the radical reform and codification of the law of theft in 1968. His second role was that of \\"radical outsider\\". Working sometimes with others, sometimes on his own, he was adept at stirring up public opinion over matters where official interest in reform was lacking. He took a major part in the campaign to liberalise the law on abortion, which largely succeeded with the Abortion Act 1967. He was also very active in the campaign to legalise voluntary euthanasia, which has so far largely failed. He was both president of the Abortion Law Reform Association, and a vice-president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. In the 1950s he was among the first to draw public attention to the problems children face when giving evidence in sex cases ‚Äì and was still campaigning on the subject in the 1980s. In 1960 he was the first person publicly to advocate the tape-recording of interviews with suspects in police stations; initially condemned as a silly and impractical idea, 25 years later this became almost universal practice. Perhaps his greatest triumph was in 1986, when a well-timed article persuaded the House of Lords to rule that a person can be guilty of attempt even where the crime in question was impossible of completion: so over-ruling their decision the other way the year before, and expressly over-ruling, for the first time ever, their previous decision in a criminal case. Glanville Williams was a respected and innovative teacher. He was also very supportive throughout their careers to a number of his junior colleagues. Although a kind man, however, he was rather shy, and not a great socialiser outside the circle of his family. He was brought up in a pious Congregationalist family in South Wales, and much of his background stayed with him. Notwithstanding his great eminence, he remained to the end of his days a quiet-spoken, modest, gentle, serious-minded Welshman. Although an agnostic for most of his life he knew his Bible, and the use of biblical phrases was instinctive to him. \\"He smote him hip and thigh\\", he once said, describing an article an American had written criticising Sigmund Freud. Honours Academic honours were heaped upon him, culminating in 1995 in a Doctorate of Letters honoris causa from Cambridge. During his lifetime it was widely rumoured that he had never been offered a knighthood because he had been staunchly pacifist before the Second World War, and during it a conscientious objector. The truth, however, is that he was offered one and declined it; partly from modesty, and partly because he thought it incongruous that a man who had refused to wield a bayonet should theoretically bear a sword. The Jesus College, University of Cambridge Glanville Williams Society meets each year and is attended by over 600 leading English lawyers. In 1976, he was famously impersonated by Campbell McComas, an Australian comedian, at a hoax lecture at Monash University, Melbourne. Many people who knew Williams personally were reportedly fooled by the hoax. Hundreds and hundreds attended, and the lecture ended with the words: \\"thank you for having me, but you have been had.\\" Selected works Books * Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part, (London: Stevens & Sons, 1953, 2nd edition published 1961). * Glanville Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (London: Stevens & Sons,1978, 2nd edition published 1983). * Glanville Williams, Crown proceedings: 1947(London: Stevens & Sons, 1948). * Glanville Williams, Joint obligations.

Appeasement is promptly dismissed as archane. Justice is interwoven within Deterrence and Compensation. Williams concludes that the purpose of actions for torts of intention is Deterrence and Compensatory for other torts. In this essay, Williams also pre-emptively advocates mandatory third-party motor insurance and 'workmen insurance' (legislated as National Insurance). * Granted that crimes are treated differently than other legal wrongs, Williams attempts to distinguish the crime from the non-criminal wrong (breach of contract, tort, etc.). He dismantles arguments based upon severity of court order (damages or punishment), social attitude or sense of morality and public vs private damages. Williams finally begrudgingly concludes that only the legal definition can consist: a crime is an act that is legally prosecuted by criminal proceedings. A discussion of the merits of imposing criminal intention whereby a defendant knows that an offence (the acts of which are criminalised) will ensue but has no purpose as to that offence. E.g. a strategic bomber may propose to destroy an airbase knowing that the airbase is situated next to a school. The purpose is not the killing of children, it is recognised that children will die, it is fair to assume that if the strategic bomber could avoid killing children he would, but he goes ahead anyway. This infanticide is of oblique intent.The example is taken from .

June 23, 2005. A TechTV story he saw in August 2004 got him interested in podcasting. The first Coverville podcast was launched on September 28, 2004. Coverville passed episode #300 on March 4, 2007 Coverville's 300th episode coverville.com. and episode #500 on August 26, 2008,Coverville's 500th episode coverville.com. which was celebrated with a \\"gala\\" in Las Vegas where fans could meet with artists featured on the show. (Full interview) As one of the early music-based podcasts, Coverville contributed to the legal podcasting of copyrighted music in the US. One month after beginning the podcase, Ibbott contacted major performance rights organisations (initially ASCAP and BMI) to explain the technology and delivery methods behind podcasting and to license music for Coverville. The licensing organizations adapted their non-interactive license to include podcast licensing shortly thereafter. Ibbott was active in publicizing this information among other podcasters.

Features A typical episode of Coverville has about six cover songs, and they are generally released on a three-per-week schedule. Weekly features typically include a Sunday all-request show, trivia challenges (where Brian, with help from his wife, try to solve various name-that-tune type challenges), and the Uncovered Gem Of The Week, a track that isn't a cover, but that the host likes. It is common for an episode of Coverville to have a theme. Frequent themes include: * Cover Story ‚Äì An episode devoted to a single prominent artist, with a number of different covers of songs all originally by the same artist, sometimes also including the artist covering someone else in return. For example, the Depeche Mode Cover Story included six other artists covering Depeche Mode, but also included Depeche Mode lead singer David Gahan covering Roxy Music. * Originalville ‚Äì An episode dedicated to playing the original versions of songs whose covers became famous, but whose original versions are relatively poorly known. * A Cappella ‚Äì An entire show dedicated to a cappella cover songs. * Lost In Translation ‚Äì An entire episode based on cover songs performed in a different language than the original. * Cover To Cover Interview ‚Äì A show-length interview with someone, interspersed with their favorite covers or cover songs they have performed. * Coverville Idol ‚Äì In the style of American Idol, contestants create and submit cover tracks based on a given theme. For 2006, the winner was \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\" covered by the a cappella group No Strings Attached. * Degrees of Coveration ‚Äì connections between various musicians.

Examples of virtual power plants exist in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Power generation A virtual power plant is a system that integrates several types of power sources to give a reliable overall power supply.Feasibility, beneficiality, and institutional compatibility of a micro-CHP virtual power plant in the Netherlands The sources often form a cluster of different types of dispatchable and non- dispatchable, controllable or flexible load (CL or FL) distributed generation (DG) systems that are controlled by a central authority and can include microCHPs, natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, small-scale wind power plants (WPP)s, photovoltaics (PVs), run-of-river hydroelectricity plants, small hydro, biomass, backup generators, and energy storage systems (ESS). This system has benefits such as the ability to deliver peak load electricity or load-following power generation on short notice. Such a VPP can replace a conventional power plant while providing higher efficiency and more flexibility. More flexibility allows the system to react better to fluctuations, but whose complexity requires complicated optimization, control, and secure communications.Smart Grid - The New and Improved Power Grid: A Survey; IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials 2011; X. Fang, S. Misra, G. Xue, and D. Yang; . An interactive simulation on the website of the VPP operator Next Kraftwerke illustrates how the technology works. According to a 2012 report by Pike Research, VPP capacity would, from 2011 to 2017, increase by 65%, from 55.6 gigawatts (GW) to 91.7 GW worldwide, generating from $5.3 billion to $6.5 billion in worldwide revenue in 2017. In a more aggressive forecast scenario, the clean-tech market intelligence firm forecasts that global VPP revenues could reach as high as $12.7 billion during the same period. > Virtual power plants represent an 'Internet of Energy, said senior analyst > Peter Asmus of Pike Research. \\"These systems tap existing grid networks to > tailor electricity supply and demand services for a customer. VPPs maximize > value for both the end user and the distribution utility using a > sophisticated set of software-based systems. They are dynamic, deliver value > in real time, and can react quickly to changing customer load conditions. Ancillary services Virtual power plants can also be used to provide ancillary services to grid operators in order to help maintain grid stability. Ancillary services include frequency regulation, load following, and providing operating reserve. These services are primarily used to maintain the instantaneous balance of electrical supply and demand. Power plants providing ancillary services must respond to signals from grid operators to increase or decrease load on the order of seconds to minutes in response to varying levels of consumer demand. Since ancillary services are typically provided by controllable fossil-fuel generators, future carbon-free electrical grids that contain high percentages of solar and wind must rely on other forms of controllable power generation or consumption. One of the most well-known examples of this is Vehicle to Grid technology. In this case, distributed electrical vehicles connected to the grid can be controlled together to act as a single virtual power plant. By selectively controlling the rate at which each individual vehicle charges, the grid sees a net injection or consumption of energy as if a large scale battery was providing this service. Similarly, flexible demand in the form of heat pumps or air conditioners has also been explored to provide ancillary services to the grid. As long as indoor thermal comfort is maintained, an aggregation of distributed heat pumps can be selectively turned off and on in order to vary their aggregate power consumption and follow an ancillary service signal. Again, the effect on the grid is the same as if a large scale power plant was providing the service. Since they operate in parallel, virtual power plants can have the advantage of higher ramp rates than thermal generators, which is especially important in grids that experience a duck curve and have high ramping requirements in the morning and evening. However, the distributed nature generates communication and latency issues, which could be problematic for providing fast services like frequency regulation. Energy trading A virtual power plant is also a cloud-based central or distributed control center that takes advantage of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and Internet of things (IoT) devices to aggregate the capacities of heterogeneous Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to form \\"a coalition of heterogeneous DERs\\" for the purpose of energy trading on the wholesale electricity markets or providing ancillary services for system operators on behalf of non-eligible individual DERs. A VPP acts as an intermediary between DERs and the wholesale electricity market and trades energy on behalf of DER owners who by themselves are unable to participate in that market. The VPP behaves as a conventional dispatchable power plant from the point of view of other market participants, although it is indeed a cluster of many diverse DERs. Also, in the competitive electricity markets, a virtual power plant acts as an arbitrageur between diverse energy trading floors (i.e., bilateral and PPA contracts, forward and futures markets, and the pool). So far, for risk management purposes, five different risk-hedging strategies (i.e., IGDT, RO, CVaR, FSD, and SSD) have been applied to the decision-making problems of VPPs in the research articles to measure the level of conservatism of VPPs' decisions in diverse energy trading floors (e.g., day-ahead electricity market, derivatives exchange market, and bilateral contracts): # IGDT : Information Gap Decision Theory # RO : Robust optimization # CVaR : Conditional Value at Risk # FSD : First-order Stochastic Dominance # SSD : Second-order Stochastic Dominance United States Energy markets are those commodity markets that deal specifically with the trade and supply of energy. In the United States, virtual power plants not only deal with the supply side, but also help manage demand, and ensure reliability of grid functions through demand response (DR) and other load-shifting approaches, in real time. An often-reported energy crisis in America has opened the door for government-subsidized companies to enter an arena that has only been available to utilities and multinational billion-dollar companies until now. With the deregulation of markets around the United States, the wholesale market pricing became the exclusive domain of large retail suppliers; however local and federal legislation along with large end-users are beginning to recognize the advantages of wholesale activities. California is the leader in green technology, with governmental bodies subsidizing and pushing an agenda that is not shared by much of the rest of the United States. In California there are two electrical markets: private retail and wholesale. California Senate Bill 2X‚Äîwhich passed the California legislature on March 30, 2011‚Äîmandates 33% renewables by 2020 without mandating any particular method to reach that goal. Europe The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel in Germany pilot-tested a combined power plant that linked solar, wind, biogas, and pumped-storage hydroelectricity to provide load-following power around the clock, completely from renewable sources. Virtual power station operators are also commonly referred to as aggregators. To test the effects of micro combined heat and power on a smart grid, 45 natural gas SOFC units (each generating 1.5kW) from Republiq Power (Ceramic Fuel Cells) will be placed in 2013 on Ameland to function as a virtual power plant. An example of a real-world virtual power plant can be found on the Scottish Inner Hebrides island of Eigg.BBC Radio 4. Costing the Earth- Electric Island Next Kraftwerke from Cologne, Germany operates a virtual power plant in seven European countries providing peak-load operation, power trading and grid balancing services. The company aggregates distributed energy resources from biogas, solar and wind as well as large- scale power consumers. Australia In August 2016, AGL Energy announced a 5MW virtual-power-plant scheme for Adelaide, Australia. The company will supply battery and photovoltaic systems from Sunverge Energy, of San Francisco, to 1000 households and businesses. The systems will cost consumers AUD $3500 and are expected to recoup the expense in savings in 7years under current distribution network tariffs. The scheme is worth AUD $20million and is being billed as the largest in the world.

The channel was established on 16 December 2004 by Mahee Ferdous Jalil, a Bangladeshi businessman in London. On Sky it at first had a timesharing deal with ATN Global, and then in 2005 began to broadcast for 24 hours, 7 days a week; it is currently available on Sky channel 777. Its shows such as Channel S News tend to copy sounds from other companies such as the BBC. The channel claims to be the \\"Voice of British Bangladeshis across the world\\", showing programmes suiting community needs. Its slogan is \\"Working for the community\\". The television station is based at Prestige House in Walthamstow, north-east London. It broadcasts programmes in Bengali, Sylheti and a few in English. It is the first Bangladeshi channel to broadcast content in the Sylheti dialect, and has built up a loyal following among Bangladeshis in the United Kingdom, of whom the majority come from Sylhet. Since the launch of the channel in 2004 there has been bitter rivalry between Channel S and Bangla TV, with Channel S gaining rights to broadcast the Baishakhi Mela. A survey in the UK found Channel S was the most viewed Bengali TV channel in the UK. History Channel S cameras broadcasting the Baishakhi Mela in 2009 at Weavers Field, east London On 16 December 2004, Channel S started to broadcast on Sky with a timesharing deal with ATN Global on channel 827. It was founded by a Bangladeshi businessmen based in London, Mahee Ferdous Jalil, who is also the owner of the car insurance company Prestige Auto Group. In March 2005, it moved to its own EPG channel 837 and started broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and then moved to channel 814. From 15 January 2006, it aired its programmes in Bangladesh and other countries of South Asia, South East Asia and the Middle East. From August 2006, Channel S acquired the rights to broadcast two of Bangladesh's prominent satellite channels, NTV (Bangladesh) and ATN Bangla. These are also available on Sky channels 826 and 827 respectively (a few months later it had stopped broadcasting NTV, which became independent from Channel S). On October 2008, it acquired the rights to broadcast a popular Bangladeshi channel called, Channel i on channel 826. In May 2007, Channel S launch Islam4U ‚Äì a channel dedicated to Islamic programmes (has stopped broadcasting since). Programmes Channel S provides viewers with a combination of cultural, political and religious programmes for the viewers, including shows which help the community with legal or community issues. News is broadcast daily, with news coverage of national news and international news, the main headline and political situation in Bangladesh and the latest news headlines in Britain. Local and community news are also broadcast from correspondents throughout the UK, including a news programme dedicated to news coverage from Sylhet; there is a live bulletin at 7:00pm, and full news broadcasts at 10:30pm and 1:00am. =Talk shows= Talk show programmes include Obhimoth (English: Opinion), focusing on events of politics in Bangladesh; during the 2008 Bangladesh election it covered the electoral process by broadcasting opinions of voters and communities in the electoral constituencies of Sylhet, Habiganj, Maulvi Bazar and Sunamganj (Voter Matthe). Let's Talk ‚Äì hosted by Ajmal Masroor is a programme debating about current and religious affairs. =Entertainment= There are many Bengali entertainment programmes with Bengali music, drama and shows, including Sylheti drama which are produced in Sylhet and some from East London. Popular entertainment shows include iRonniee (a programme interviewing notable music-songwriters), and music shows of folk, poetry by leading artists in the UK or Bangladesh; these include Sure Sure Alap, Shudhu Binodan, Sur Jolsha and Matir Sur. A new game show launched in February 2008, titled Win A Car, offers people to win a Mercedes C-class, which 'specifically targets the British Bangladeshi community', and has been described as the first entertainment programme in a 'Sylheti Bangla way'. Since 2005, it has gained the rights to broadcast the Baishakhi Mela annually. Previously the rights were held by Bangla TV, however its commitment to the community has attracted many local business and advertisement to Channel S. In 2009, it was the joint media partner with BBC Asian Network, alongside the Tower Hamlets council.Mela Magic Tower Hamlets Council. Retrieved on 22 May 2009. =Islamic= Channel S is one of the first Bengali channels which are committed to broadcasting Islamic-oriented programmes. Islamic programmes are shown quite frequently. These include programmes such as Islam Essentials ‚Äì a live religious talk show which provides viewers the opportunity to ask questions relating to Islam based on every day life which features Sheikh Abdur Rahman Madani and Quraner Alo (teaching on how to read the Qur'an). Nasheeds (religious songs) are shown daily. Channel S has planned to launch a channel called Islam4U, which is a 24-hour channel Islamic channel in Bengali, which however has not started broadcasting. Charity Department There are many charity events for Islamic institutes on Channel S. In 2006 and 2007 during Ramadan, the British Bangladeshi community donated millions of pounds on live appeals. It then led to Channel S in 2007 creating a fundraising initiative called, the \\"Ramadan Family Commitment\\", which was the channels first concept based scheme. It raised ¬£146,138 in 2007 and was distributed amongst 28 organisations, there were 30 charity appeals, one during each night of Ramadan, and \\"Qurbani Family Commitment\\", created to make the distribution of Qurbani during Eid more easier for the Muslim community in the UK, and for Bangladesh. Organisations which are affiliated with the organisations are Islamic Relief, Muslim Aid and Hefazothe Islam UK.Qurbani Family Commitment (QFC) qfcuk.org During Ramadan, Channel S has also raised fundraising events for mosques and madrassas across the UK (e.g. East London Mosque), and created its first Ramadan Guide in 2008 which was distributed in the communities.Ramadan Guide 2008 ‚Äì Channel S. Editor: Rizwan Hussain, Sub Editor: Abdul Awal Mamun As of 2008 Channel S has raised up to ¬£7.5 million for 65 mosques, 17 madrassas and 35 other charity events. It is organised by the Channel S Charity Department, and presented by Rizwan Hussain. Channel S also launched a new charity programme with Muslim Aid, called \\"Shahjalal & Shahporan Village\\", which is dedicated to raising money to build villages for victims of Cylone Cidr in Bangladesh. Muslim Aid has hosted live appeals on Channel S, alongside with Islam Channel. With Muslim Aid, it has managed to raise up to over ¬£200,000 from the community, in support of those who were affected by Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. A football tournament was part of the fundraising initiative called the SSV Charity Champions Cup 2008, consisting of 32 teams, aiming to bring Bangladeshi footballers together across different towns from London, Oldham and Birmingham. The event was held from 5 May to 6 July 2008, and was won by Bromley By Bow FC in the finals at Mile End Stadium, east London.Shahjalal & Shahporan Village (Charity Champions Cup 2008) Channel S The aim of the fundraising event is to build two villages which are called Shahjalal & Shahporan, with each receiving 360 built houses, including schools, medical centres and mosques, and aims to raise up to ¬£720,000. =Others= There are also other various shows available for all other viewers. Programme Bits n Bytes is an IT show specifically targeting people who use computers for business or home use. It is the only IT weekly programme within the South Asian Broadcasting Industry in the UK, presented in English and Sylheti. Viewers also have the opportunity to view their village or town in Bangladesh, by calling and requesting on programmes such as Amar Gao, there are many recorded videos of villages across the region of Sylhet. There are also shows available for women and children, for example Mojar Ranna (a cooking show) and It's Our Day (entertainment for children). Controversy In June 2007, First Solution Money Transfer, a financial services company run by at least one the managing directors of Channel S went into liquidation owing the public hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mahee Ferdous Jalil, the chairman of Channel S, filed for an injunction against Bangla TV to prevent allegations of impropriety by Channel S or its chairman from being broadcast as well as defamations cases against a number of prominent businessmen who had made the allegations.Press Conference by Jalil (Chairman of Channel S) refuting allegations linking him to First Solution (Language: Bengali, Sylheti) As of April 2008, Channel S (including other Bengali channels) was under investigation by Ofcom for a breach of the Communications Act 2003, after airing election adverts for the Liberal Democrats during the 2008 London mayoral election. The channel accepted adverts from the local Liberal Democrats candidate, Jalal Rajonuddin. Ofcom found Channel S guilty of breaching the TV Advertising Code. On 4 August 2008, according to the City of London police, Mahee Ferdous Jalil (Mohammed Ferdhaus) founder of the channel (along with many others) was found guilty, at Croydon Crown Court, of car insurance fraud and sentenced to an 18 months prison term. The group were involved in a plot to make false car insurance claims and were ordered to pay compensation costs to the AXA insurance company. Since the arrest of Jalil, a media war broke out with Channel S and Bangla TV. It was noted that Bangla TV broadcast negative news coverage against Jalil and Channel S, leading to propaganda and different speculations of the event.

Little is known of Florence's early life, except that she was born 1890 in Nelson. She spent her formative years in New Zealand and showed special prowess in athletics, becoming both a champion swimmer and skater during her teen years. By 1913 she had married Joe Gardiner, an expatriate German who worked as a professional wrestler. Joe is believed to have coached Florence in the skills of jujutsu, which he may have learned while in England. The two then developed a theatrical performance in which Florence delivered a lecture on the benefits of jujitsu as a means of self defence and physical culture, especially for women and children, followed by a series of skits in which she demonstrated a variety of jujitsu techniques against Joe, who played the role of the attacker. Described as being \\"a refined Vaudeville novelty for all the family\\", the act toured music halls and variety stages throughout Australasia. In 1913 LeMar wrote a book entitled The Life and Adventures of Miss Florence LeMar, the World's Famous Ju-Jitsu Girl. Essentially similar to their stage act, the book consisted of a polemic essay on the benefits of jujitsu for women, an exposition of self-defence techniques and a series of tall tales about Florence's jujitsu victories against a selection of desperate characters in exotic locations including London and New York City Florence and Joe divorced by the early 1920s, after he abandoned Flo and their child, little Ronnie, \\"The World's Youngest Ju-Jitsu Exponent\\" . Florence appears to have continued to work in show-business for a time, and also served as a jujitsu instructor for the New Zealand police force. Much later in life, she sold confectionery in movie theatres. Popular culture Florence LeMar was the subject of the popular play The Hooligan and the Lady, which premiered during the 2011 New Zealand Fringe Festival. She is depicted as a member of a secret society of bodyguards protecting the leaders of the radical suffragettes in the graphic novel trilogy Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons (2015).

Plot summary The story takes place in Leningrad, USSR, apparently in the 1970s. The protagonist, Dmitry Alekseyevich Malyanov (–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –ú–∞–ª—è–Ω–æ–≤) is an astrophysicist who, while officially on vacation, continues to work on his thesis, \\"The Interaction of Stars with Diffused Galactic Matter\\". Just as he begins to realize that he is on the verge of a revolutionary discovery worthy of a Nobel Prize, his life becomes plagued by strange events. First, Malyanov is visited unexpectedly by an attractive woman claiming to be his wife's classmate and food and wine arrive for them mysteriously and already paid for. Then his neighbor dies of an apparent suicide and Malyanov becomes the murder suspect. Approaching the problem with a scientific mindset, Malyanov suspects that his discovery is in the way of someone (or something) intent on preventing the completion of his work. The same idea occurs to his friends and acquaintances, who find themselves in a similar impasse‚Äîsome powerful, mysterious, and very selective force impedes their work in fields ranging from biology to mathematical linguistics. An explanation is proposed by Malyanov's friend and neighbor, the mathematician Vecherovsky (–í–µ—á–µ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π). He posits that the mysterious force is the Universe's reaction to mankind's scientific pursuit, which threatens to destroy the very fabric of the universe in some distant future. His hypothesis is that of a Homeostatic Universe, meaning that the Universe tends to conserve both its total entropy (a measure of disorder) and the capacity of regeneration of reasoning performed into it. The equilibrium between the two measures determines the structure of the Universe at a given time. Thus, the Universe naturally resists attempts of rational beings of constructing supercivilizations. Vecherovsky proposes to treat this universal resistance to scientific progress as a natural phenomenon which can and should be investigated and even harnessed by Science. As the novel concludes, the other scientists, including Malyanov, have been forced to abandon their research, and Vecherovsky remains alone to battle the universe and continue their work. Derived works Aleksandr Sokurov's movie The Days of the Eclipse is loosely based on the novel. The Finnish film \\"Miljardi vuotta ennen maailmanloppua\\" (\\"One Billion Years Before the End of the World\\") was directed by Tapio Suominen in 1986 based on the novel.

Career Downs graduated from Cornell Medical College in medicine in 1938 after studying tropical parasitology with Pedro Kouri at the University of Havana, Cuba. He went to Trinidad and Tobago, B.W.I. in 1941 and studied malaria there until 1943 when he was inducted into the U.S. Army as a 1st Lieutenant. His epidemiological survey of malaria in Trinidad and Tobago in 1941-1943 is one of the classic works in the field. Downs served as Malaria Control Officer in the New Hebrides, Russell Islands and New Georgia. In 1944 he went to Bougainville and in 1945 became Acting Chief of Preventive Medicine on Okinawa, as well as spending time in Guam. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Presidential and military citations for his work with malaria and communicable tropical diseases. His interests were extremely wide-ranging and his curiosity insatiable. By the end of World War II he was one of the world's most experienced researchers in a wide range of tropical diseases including malaria, venereal diseases, dengue fever, leprosy, filariasis, scrub typhus, leprosy, intestinal parasites, fungal infections, tuberculosis, and more. Downs retired from the army in 1946 and was sent to Mexico by the Rockefeller Foundation to direct a malaria-control program from 1946-1952. While there, he set up an extensive public health and malaria investigation program, and was one of the first people to question the use of DDT and similar insecticides in the control of the disease. In 1952 the Rockefeller Foundation sent him back to Trinidad where he established the Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory, now part of the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (Carec) in Port of Spain. This laboratory became a renowned centre of excellence attracting top researchers and providing excellent training for young Trinidadians in a wide range of skills. While he was in charge some 35 viruses were isolated, many of them new to science, and information on the etiology and transmission of numerous virus diseases, including a major epidemic of yellow fever, were meticulously studied and recorded. Downs kept close contact with William Beebe who, at the time, was the Director of the New York Zoological Society's Tropical Research Centre at Simla in Trinidad and helped coordinate the activities of both organisations and sharing resources. He had a real interest in and supported research in many fields including entomology, ornithology, mammalogy, archaeology, epidemiology, and ecology. In 1961 he became Associate Director of the Medical and Natural Sciences Division in charge of the Rockefeller Foundation's arbovirus programme. From 1963 to 1971 he became Director of the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit and Professor of Epidemiology. In 1969 he worked on isolating the Lassa fever virus with Jordi Casals-Ariet and Sonja Buckley. He resigned from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1971 but continued at Yale as a lecturer. In 1973 he was appointed Clinical Professor of Epidemiology. The Downs Fellowship at Yale continues his legacy by sponsoring student research in global health. Over 600 students have participated in its 50 year history. He was the author or co-author of over 150 scientific articles and published a landmark reference work with Max Theiler, The Arthropod-Borne Viruses of Vertebrates in 1973. Private life David Snow.

In the 2009 general election, Shilowa was elected to parliament with COPE. Early life Shilowa was born at Olifantshoek in what is now called the Limpopo Province and completed his secondary education at Akani High School in 1978. The following year he moved to Johannesburg to seek employment and started working at John Weinberg Hardware in Germiston. He then moved to Anglo Alpha Cement in Roodepoort and later joined PSG Services in Johannesburg. Trade Unions In 1981, Shilowa joined the trade union movement and became a shop steward fighting for better working conditions and defending the rights of his fellow workers. He was elected Vice-President and later President of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union. Shilowa played a prominent role in the formation of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in 1985 and was elected Deputy Chairperson of COSATU‚Äôs Gauteng region. In 1991, he was elected Deputy General Secretary of COSATU and in 1993 became the General Secretary. Shilowa then played a huge role in the forming of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) which established close co-operation between government, organized labour and business. He was part of the African National Congress' negotiating team at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) negotiations in 1992 which led to the writing of South Africa‚Äôs democratic constitution. In 1997, Shilowa became a member of the African National Congress and on 15 June 1999 he was elected Premier of Gauteng Province and had to give up his post as General Secretary of COSATU.

At L'Enfant's request, Thomas Jefferson provided plans of cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Milan, which he had brought back from Europe in 1788. His design also envisioned a garden-lined \\"grand avenue\\" approximately in length and wide in the area that is now the National Mall. The City of Washington was bounded to the north by Boundary Street (now Florida Avenue) at the base of the escarpment of the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, to the southeast by the Anacostia River, to the southwest by the Potomac River and to the west by Rock Creek. President Washington dismissed L'Enfant in March 1792, due to his insistence on micromanaging the city's planning, which had resulted in conflicts with the three commissioners appointed by Washington to supervise the capital's construction. Andrew Ellicott, who had worked with L'Enfant surveying the city, was then commissioned to complete the plans. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans, including changes to some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans in \\"Washington, D.C., A National Register of Historic Places Travel Inventory\\" in official website of the U.S. National Park Service The U.S. National Archives holds a copy of \\"Ellicott's engraved Plan superimposed on the Plan of L'Enfant showing the changes made in the engraved Plan under the direction of President Washington\\".

The district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location, and house numbers are assigned based on the approximate number of blocks away from the Capitol. In most of the city, the streets are set out in a grid pattern with east‚Äìwest streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW) and north‚Äìsouth streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW). Most portions of the north-south axis and the eastern portion of the east-west axis are marked by streets with the common name of Capitol Street: North Capitol Street, South Capitol Street, and East Capitol Street. Since an axis runs down the middle of those streets, the addresses on each side are necessarily in different quadrants. The western portion of the east- west axis runs down the Mall. Two avenues, Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, line each side of the Mall. Many of the diagonal streets and avenues in Washington are named after states. Some of these streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House with the U.S. Capitol and Massachusetts Avenue, a section of which is informally known as Embassy Row from the number of foreign embassies located along the street. It is important to note that there is no J Street in any quadrant. The reason for this is that, until the mid-19th century, the letters \\"I\\" and \\"J\\" were indistinguishable when written. Following that same idea, \\"I\\" Street is often written as \\"Eye\\" Street, to distinguish it from the letter \\"L\\" and the numeral \\"1\\", and \\"Q\\" Street is often written \\"Que\\", \\"Cue\\", or \\"Queue\\". Urban legend had said that J Street was omitted deliberately by L'Enfant due to a dispute with John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court; however, this was later proven to be a myth. Jay Street NE runs through the Deanwood neighborhood; it does not belong to the series of lettered streets. There are also no X, Y, or Z streets in any quadrant, and most or all of A and B streets are called by other names in the Mall area. Expansion of the street-name system Map of Georgetown from 1899, showing old street names During most of the 19th century, each municipality within the federal district maintained its own separate government and street system. With the passage of the Organic Act of 1871, Congress created a new government for the entire federal district. This act combined the City of Washington, Georgetown, and the unincorporated area then known as Washington County into a single municipality for the whole District of Columbia. Through much of the 19th century, developers of land outside of the center city tended to build streets wherever they liked. An 1887 report of the commissioners of the District of Columbia, the three-member panel that governed the district, said that many of these streets \\"go nowhere and connect with nothing.\\" The Commissioners said that \\"If the configuration and architecture of a city has a moral influence upon its residents, the rectification of the irreclaimable obliquity of the... streets is manifestly desirable for more than physical reasons.\\" In 1888, Congress passed a law requiring that future subdivisions built outside of the City of Washington and Georgetown must have streets that conform to the general plan of the City of Washington. However, the law allowed existing streets to remain, contrary to the wishes of the commissioners of the District of Columbia. In 1893, Congress passed a law mandating that existing streets must be changed or moved in order to be in conformity with the district's street plan. Some property owners were upset that their private property would need to be seized without compensation in order to move streets in conformance with the street plan. The Supreme Court agreed, striking down the law as unconstitutional. In 1893, Congress mandated a new system of highways within the district that conformed to the City of Washington's street plan but left existing streets in place. A separate act of Congress in 1895 required that the street names in Georgetown be changed to conform to the street naming system used in the City of Washington. However, the old street names were shown on maps as late as 1899. The commissioners of the District of Columbia mandated a new system of naming streets in 1901. Streets running north and south would continue to be numbered. North of Florida Avenue, streets running east and west would be named after famous Americans. The streets would be given one-syllable names in alphabetical order. When the one-syllable series ended, two-syllable names would be used, and then three-syllable names. Only in the Northwest Quadrant was a \\"fourth alphabet\\" necessary. This fourth alphabet uses botanical names without regard to the number of syllables: Aspen, Butternut, Cedar, etc. Verbena Street NW is the last in this series before the Maryland state line. South of the center city, a similar system would be used with streets named after famous Americans or prominent geographical locations. In 1905, the streets east of Rock Creek Park, north of Florida Avenue, and west of North Capitol Street were renamed in conformity with the single street-naming system. Eventually all street names in the District of Columbia were made to conform to a single street- naming system. The boundaries of the District of Columbia with the State of Maryland are marked by Western Avenue, Eastern Avenue, and Southern Avenue. Address system The city's addressing system is best understood in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at the Capitol. While the system may appear complex, once learned it allows one to pinpoint not only where one is but also where and how far one may need to travel. For example, we can determine from the address that 633 A Street SE is southeast of the US Capitol, one block south of East Capitol Street, on the south side of A Street SE, between 6th and 7th Streets SE. Another example is the White House, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW: it is located at 16th Street NW (Lafayette Square) and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. This works both ways; an address at 514 19th St NW would be on 19th St west of the Capitol, and since E is the fifth letter of the alphabet, the 514 address would be between E and F Streets NW. Because J is omitted from the scheme, it is not counted in numbering. Thus, the 900 block is in between I and K Streets, and the 1000 block is in between K and L Streets (even though K is the 11th letter of the alphabet). For the first block of a street as counted from the relevant axis (that is, with house numbers from 1 to 99), the city posts the word \\"unit\\" on a plaque below the street name sign and labels the first block the unit block. This practice differs from most American cities, which post a number followed by an arrow. Subsequent blocks are marked in the conventional fashion as \\"100\\", \\"200\\", and so forth. Address numbers also correspond with a particular side of the street, with odd numbers on the right as one faces in the direction of increasing numbers. This works out by quadrant as shown below: { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - !scope = \\"col\\"  Quadrant !scope = \\"col\\"  East‚Äìwest streets !scope = \\"col\\"  North‚Äìsouth streets - !scope = \\"row\\"  Northwest  Odd numbers on north side  Odd numbers on east side - !scope = \\"row\\"  Southwest  Odd numbers on north side  Odd numbers on west side - !scope = \\"row\\"  Southeast  Odd numbers on south side  Odd numbers on west side - !scope = \\"row\\"  Northeast  Odd numbers on south side  Odd numbers on east side } Major roads A large system of freeways was planned in the district. Many, especially in the northern half, were canceled after freeway revolts. (Canceled freeways are shown in light blue.) =Interstate highways= Washington, D.C. metropolitan area road map Interstate 495, also known as the \\"Capital Beltway\\", creates an artificial boundary for the inner suburbs of Washington and is the root of the phrase \\"inside the Beltway\\". Almost completely circling Washington, D.C., it crosses a tiny portion of the district at its southernmost point at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. I-66 runs from the eastern edge of Georgetown, connects with the Beltway, and continues through Northern Virginia to I-81. I-295 comes up from the south starting at the eastern edge of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on the Beltway and ending at the 11th Street Bridges, where it intersects with I-695 (the Southeast Freeway) to cross the Anacostia River into downtown. Just south of the U.S. Capitol Building, I-695 links up with I-395 (the Southwest Freeway), a major commuter route extending from New York Avenue to the Beltway and Interstate 95 in Springfield, Virginia. The Inner Loop was a proposed network of freeways in the city center; however, only portions of it were ever built. Today, the \\"inner loop\\" is most frequently used to describe the inside lanes of 495‚Äîthat is, those that travel clockwise around Washington. I-66 in Washington, D.C. A convergence indexing based road traffic monitoring system was installed on Washington's highways in 2008. =Other expressways and parkways= The Anacostia Freeway (DC-295) continues in a northeasterly direction from the point where I-295 ends at its intersection with I-695 near the 11th Street Bridges on the south side of the Anacostia River and links with the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway, which eventually becomes Maryland Route 295, via a short section of Maryland Route 201. The Suitland Parkway connects the city with the southeastern suburbs in Prince George's County, Maryland. The Whitehurst Freeway, an elevated freeway over K Street in Georgetown, allows US 29 traffic to bypass congested Georgetown between the Key Bridge and K Street downtown. The E Street Expressway connects I-66 with the city's Foggy Bottom area and the areas immediately to the west of the White House. The Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway provides access to downtown from the northern and western ends of the city. =City streets= Among the major roads in the city are MacArthur Boulevard NW, 14th Street NW, 16th Street NW, 18th Street NW, 7th Street NW, Connecticut Avenue NW, K Street NW, H Street NW, Wisconsin Avenue, M Street NW, H Street NE, Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution Avenue, Independence Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, U Street NW, South Dakota Ave NE, North Capitol Street, South Capitol Street, East Capitol Street, Georgia Avenue, Minnesota Avenue, Benning Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, New York Avenue, and Rhode Island Avenue. While city streets generally do not have route numbers, U.S. Routes 1, 1 Alternate, 29, and 50 are routed predominantly or entirely over city surface streets.

A rooming house, also called a \\"multi-tenant house\\", is a \\"dwelling with multiple rooms rented out individually\\", in which the tenants share bathroom and kitchen facilities. Rooming houses are often used as housing for low-income people, as rooming houses (along with Single Room Occupancy units in hotels) are the least expensive housing for single adults, with rents in the $300-$425 CAD range. Rooming houses are usually owned and operated by private landlords. Rooming houses are better described as a \\"living arrangement\\" rather than a specially \\"built form\\" of housing; rooming houses involve people who are not related living together, often in an existing house, and sharing a kitchen, bathroom, and in some cases a living room or dining room. While there are purpose-built rooming houses, these are rare. Condition A study of rooming houses in Ottawa, Ontario in 2016 found that \\"many units are in very poor condition\\", with issues such as mould, cockroaches, bedbugs, and broken locks. An article about Montreal rooming houses stated that the units often contain bedbugs and \\"faulty plumbing\\". Residents In one Ottawa study, more than 50% of the occupants in rooming houses were found to have mental health diagnoses. A 1998 study of Toronto rooming house residents found that they had poorer health than the general population and low incomes. A study of 295 residents from 171 rooming houses in Toronto found that \\"residents aged 35 years and older had significantly poorer health status than their counterparts in the Canadian general population\\" and the residents had a \\"high prevalence of ill health\\", with the worst-off residents (from a health perspective) living in the poorest-maintained and most substandard rooming houses.Hwang SW, Martin RE, Tolomiczenko GS, Hulchanski JD. The relationship between housing conditions and health status of rooming house residents in Toronto. Can J Public Health. 2003 Nov-Dec;94(6):436-40. An article about rooming houses in Montreal stated that rooming houses are the \\"last stop before the street\\" for low-income people at risk of homelessness. Government intervention =Regulations= Not all rooming houses are legal, inspected units, as some landlords also rent out unlicensed rooms. In Winnipeg, four branches of city government regulate rooming houses: a licensing branch, a business branch, a \\"livability\\" living standards bylaw and the fire prevention branch. The livability standards bylaw requires at least one bathroom for 10 residents (some health researchers have called for one bathroom for every four tenants). Despite efforts by the city of Toronto to regulate rooming houses, there is an invisible, unregistered rooming house sector, which are advertised online or on bulletin boards, often in suburban basements which are subdivided into rooms. Increasing regulation of rooming houses can lead to a decline in the number of rooming houses that are available, as landlords may choose not to apply for and pay the fees for a city licence, and complete the needed safety requirements (sprinklers, fire escapes, etc.). In 2018, the city of Ottawa (Ontario) created rules to limit the number of bedrooms in newly built houses, to prevent the creation of houses with five to eight bedrooms, which can become illegal rooming houses, colloquially known as \\"bunkhouses\\". =Subsidies= In New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Manitoba, the provincial government have funding programs that provides financial assistance to owners and landlords of rooming houses that serve low-income people; the funding must be used to do repairs of a structural, electrical, plumbing, or fire safety nature. History The Liverpool House, a rooming house in Seattle, in 1909. Prior to the 1920s, commercial rooming houses were often former boardinghouses. After the US Civil War, boarding houses became less common, declining from 40% of rental listings in 1875 (in San Francisco) to 10% in 1900, and less than 1% by 1910.Groth, Paul. Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United States. Chapter Four‚ÄîRooming Houses and the Margins of Respectability. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1994 1994. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6j49p0wf/ One reason for this change was that in the decades after the 1880s, urban reformers began working on modernizing cities; their efforts to create \\"uniformity within areas, less mixture of social classes, maximum privacy for each family, much lower density for many activities, buildings set back from the street, and a permanently built order\\" all meant that housing for single people had to be cut back or eliminated. By the early 1930s, urban reformers were typically using codes and zoning to enforce \\"uniform and protected single-use residential district[s] of private houses\\", the reformers' preferred housing type. In 1936, the FHA Property Standards defined a dwelling as \\"any structure used principally for residential purposes\\", noting that \\"commercial rooming houses and tourist homes, sanitariums, tourist cabins, clubs, or fraternities would not be considered dwellings\\" as they did not have the \\"private kitchen and a private bath\\" that reformers viewed as essential in a \\"proper home\\". The FHA rules called the existence of stores, offices or rental housing as \\"adverse influences\\" and \\"undesirable community conditions\\", which reduced the investment and repair support provided in any neighbourhood that deviated from the preferred single family home use. Land use reformers also passed zoning rules that indirectly reduced rooming houses: banning mixed residential and commercial use in neighbourhoods, an approach which meant that any remaining rooming house residents would find it hard to eat at a local cafe or walk to a nearby corner grocery to buy food. Non-residential uses such as religious institutions (churches) and professional offices (doctors, lawyers) were still permitted under these new zoning rules, but working class people (plumbers, mechanics) were not allowed to operate their businesses. By 1910, commercial rooming houses began to resemble an \\"inexpensive hotel\\", with multi-story buildings, often 25 to 40 years old, with the owners using the house as an income property. The operators, typically former boarding house managers, were getting out of the business of providing meals. This enabled the owner to convert the shared dining room and parlour into additional rental rooms and stop paying for the preparation of meals. There were often sixteen to eighteen rooms, with either central heating or tiny in-room heating stoves.A single bathroom was usually provided, with hot water only available on certain days and limits to the number of baths allowed per week. Blacks were not allowed in most rooming houses, due to segregation, except in black rooming houses. Old run-down hotels were converted into rooming houses. Some entrepreneurs even converted empty warehouses into inexpensive rooming houses.Prior to 1900, elevators were rare, so rooming house residents had to climb stairs. The hasty conversion of old houses and warehouses into blocks of rooms typically meant that the walls were thin, so residents could hear each other. A picture of a rooming house and floor plan for Moore's Rooming House in Elko, Nevada. A study of San Francisco rooming houses in 1926 found rough living conditions: > \\"There were dark rooms where it was impossible to find the washstand without > first turning on electric light; dingy rooms where the carpets had a musty > smell, and the furniture was shabby and faded; sleeping rooms with lumpy > double beds and dirty lace curtains. . . . Most of the rooms had such dim > lights that no one could read in the evening.\\" Before the 1920s, the wages for women working as seamstresses or servers was often too low for them to afford their own room, so often women shared a room with another woman. Due to the sectors where rooming house residents lived, they often had to move, either due to seeking new jobs, because of seasonal work or due to layoffs, which meant that the tenants in a rooming house would change throughout a year. As such, rooming house residents tended to have only one or two bags or a single trunk of possessions. Another change between the 19th century and the turn of the 20th century was the separation of rooming houses according to religion (Catholic, Protestant), ethnic origin (Irish) or occupation (mechanics, cooks); while this was common in the 19th century, it became less common in the early 20th century. In rooming houses in the 20th century, homosexual couples of men or women could live together if they appeared to be friends sharing a room and unmarried heterosexual couples could share a room without disapproval. With the removal of the meal service of boarding houses, rooming houses needed to be near diners and other inexpensive food businesses. Rooming houses attracted criticism: in \\"1916, Walter Krumwilde, a Protestant minister, saw the rooming house or boardinghouse system [as] \\"spreading its web like a spider, stretching out its arms like an octopus to catch the unwary soul.\\" In the 1930s and 1940s, \\"rooming or boarding houses had been taken for granted as respectable places for students, single workers, immigrants, and newlyweds to live when they left home or came to the city\\". In Toronto, rooming houses were common in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, because \\"wealthy homeowners\\" who had guest houses would rent out empty rooms to be able to keep their homes. After WWII, the city ensured that rooming house spaces were available for returning soldiers. In 1949, a sociologist called a Los Angeles rooming house neighbourhood a \\"universe of anonymous transients.\\" Since traditional class roles were based around home and family, residents in rooming houses did not fit into working class, middle class or upper class patterns; instead, they were in a sort of \\"social and cultural limbo\\", with many hoping to rise. A rooming house in Frontier City in 1959. However, with the boom in housing in the 1950s, middle class newcomers could increasingly afford their own homes or apartments, which meant that rooming and boarding houses became used mainly by post-secondary \\"students, the working poor, or the unemployed\\". By the 1960s, rooming and boarding houses were deteriorating, as official city policies tended to ignore them. By the 1970s, investors started buying up city houses, turning them into temporary rooming houses to make rental income until the desired price in the housing market for selling off the properties was reached, a gentrification process called \\"blockbusting.\\" From 1977 to 1987, Montreal lost about 40% of its rooming houses, which has created a shortage in affordable housing for low-income people. By 2014, rooming houses were disappearing from Winnipeg due to a complicated regulatory framework involving multiple government departments and \\"market pressure\\" in the housing market. A 2014 report about Toronto rooming houses noted the increase in suburban rooming houses, often in basements; this change challenges the perception that rooming houses are just an inner city phenomenon.

Playing career =Newcastle United= McClen debuted for Newcastle in 1999 against Tottenham Hotspur under the management of Ruud Gullit. Gullit offered McClen a long-term deal which was promptly signed. He drifted out of the first-team picture for a few years, only to get a break in the team when injuries took their toll on Newcastle. McClen took his chance, including a goal against Peterborough United in the FA Cup, going on to make 10 more appearances in the 2001‚Äì02 season, including against Arsenal in the FA Cup. McClen's performances that season, in which Newcastle finished 4th, earned him another long-term deal which was promptly signed. However, McClen struggled to retain his place in the first team before eventually being released in 2005 to Carlisle United. =Later career= McClen's spell at Carlisle only lasted a few months before he was released. He then went to Blyth Spartans on a short- term basis. He returned to the Football League to join Shrewsbury Town, but he was released due to concerns over his fitness levels.

Born in Amanzimtoti, KwaZulu-Natal, Pooley was a keen ornithologist as a youth. He began his training as a game ranger for the (then) Natal Parks Board in Maputaland (now northern KwaZulu-Natal, also formerly known as Tongaland) in 1957, receiving much of his training as a naturalist from Zulu and Thonga game guards. The guards showed him a crocodile egg and asked him to identify which bird had laid it, to general amusement, which started his interest in crocodiles. His pioneering work on crocodile ecology and conservation is recorded, with his customary humour, in his first book, Discoveries of a Crocodile Man (Collins, 1982). Pooley published numerous papers and chapters in books on crocodile behaviour, made pioneering discoveries on crocodile maternal care, and croc-rearing techniques (see Further Reading, below). He assisted in drafting new regulations changing the status of Nile crocodiles from 'vermin' to 'protected', and was a founder member of the IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group. He travelled to Italy, Australia, America, Papua New Guinea, Zambia and Zimbabwe advising on crocodile conservation and farming. Several films were made about his work, including The Ndumu Story, and the BBC's award-winning Gently Smiling Jaws, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Pooley set up two crocodile research facilities, one at Ndumo Game Reserve, and the St Lucia Crocodile Research Centre, where he also set about educating visitors about crocodiles and their place in the ecosystem. He earned his MSc degree, on the \\"Ecology of the Nile Crocodile in Zululand\\", from the University of Natal in 1982, despite never having completed high school. After leaving the Natal Parks Board, he set up southern Africa's largest private crocodile farm, Crocworld, near Scottburgh on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal, which combined commercial farming with education. Thereafter he worked as a wildlife consultant and lectured at the Mangosuthu Technikon. As a consultant, Pooley worked with numerous film crews from the US, UK, France, Germany, South Africa and elsewhere, including the BBC Natural History Unit and the Discovery Channel. These programmes and films included special features on crocodiles, a film on the interaction of humans and vervet monkeys, and documentaries on conservation issues. His last film for the BBC was Missing - Presumed Eaten, documenting his successful defence of the reputation of the Nile crocodile against a life-insurance scam.Natural World (TV series) He also made and published records of wildlife sounds, and an album of Thonga music. Pooley is widely credited as being one of the leading defenders of the dunes at Lake St. Lucia, now part of the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Park.ISimangaliso Wetland Park He was chairman of the Campaign for St Lucia, which helped to defend the park against proposed open-cast dune mining and get it proclaimed as a heritage park, and later co-ordinated a campaign preventing the deproclamation of part of the Ndumo Game Reserve. This campaign is ongoing. Tony's efforts as a conservationist were recognised by awards from The Wildlife Society and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife (formerly the Natal Parks Board). Pooley's best-known publication is probably Mashesha - The Making of a Game Ranger, first published by Southern Book Publishers in 1992. \\"Mashesha\\" can be basically translated from Zulu as \\"He who hurries and takes\\", a reference to Pooley's work in pursuing poachers. Pooley died in late 2004. He is survived by three sons and his wife, Elsa, an artist who illustrated Mashesha and has published definitive guides on South African plant life.

Jonathan Backhouse succeeded his father as senior partner, and was in turn succeeded by his son, also named Jonathan (1779-1842), his grandson Edmund Backhouse, M.P. for Darlington, and his great-grandson Sir Jonathan Edmund Backhouse Bt.. Under Sir Jonathan's management Backhouse's Bank merged in 1896 with Gurney's Bank of Norwich and Barclays of London and others to form what is now Barclays Bank.Barclay's defiling their Quaker roots History Originally James Backhouse offered banking services as a sideline to the linen business, before he established a separate banking business. The bank was well placed to serve the increasing capital requirements of industrial development in the North of England. Though not related to the Southern Quaker banking families such as Barclay, Gurney and Bevan, their Quaker background still gave them a ready business alliance with Southern houses. In time these alliances were reinforced by marriage and Backhouse's became one of the strongest banks in the North of England. The 1790s and the first three decades of the nineteenth century saw a series of banking crises in England. Many banks saw runs on their banknotes and deposits, and many failed. The banknotes of the time were issued by private banks as a promise to redeem the note for coin on demand, but most banks relied on their notes being used as a de facto currency and issued more than they could redeem if everyone who held them demanded payment. At the same time, gold reserves in England were heavily depleted by government spending in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, so that even the Bank of England had to suspend redemption of its notes from 1797 to 1821. Backhouse's Bank used both their reserves and their relationships with London banks to honour their notes through these periods. However, their distance from London (the main market that could supply gold currency) caused difficulties. Supplies were obtained by partners travelling to London by post, but secrecy had to be preserved to maintain confidence in the bank's liquidity. In 1819, Lord Darlington, as part of a long-running dispute with the Backhouse family, began amassing their banknotes by requiring his tenants to pay their rent using them. He intended to present a large quantity of notes all at once, more than could be redeemed on the spot, and so break the bank. Jonathan Backhouse was warned of the plot and travelled quickly to London to obtain a large amount of gold. While returning to Darlington the wheel of his carriage broke, but rather than lose time, he stacked the gold so as to balance the carriage on its three wheels and continued on his way. Lord Darlington's notes were all redeemed for cash. Despite these challenges, Backhouse's was able to take advantage of the failures of other banks to expand into their former markets, for instance in Sunderland and Durham. By 1825, Backhouse's reliability through multiple crises made its notes the preferred currency for trade in County Durham, even over those of the Bank of England. The bank was heavily involved in the formation of the Stockton & Darlington Railway, the first railway in the world to use steam locomotives. In 1896, Backhouse's was the third largest (after Barclay of London and Gurney's of Norwich) of twelve houses that united to form the joint-stock bank Barclay & Co, which at its formation held around one quarter of deposits in English private banks. At the time, Backhouse's had 20 branches and managed ¬£3.3 million in deposits, with ¬£250,000 capital and reserves.

Asen's Fortress is above sea level.Asen's Fortress Elevation and Location History The earliest archaeological findings date from the time of the Thracians, the area of the fortress being also inhabited during the Ancient Roman and Early Byzantine period. The fortress gained importance in the Middle Ages, first mentioned in the statute of the Bachkovo Monastery as Petrich in the 11th century. The fortress was conquered by the armies of the Third Crusade. It was considerably renovated in the 13th century (more precisely 1231) during the rule of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Asen II to serve as a border fortification against Latin raids, as evidenced by an eight-line wall inscription. The foundations of fortified walls‚Äîthe outer ones being thick and preserved up to a height of , originally high‚Äîa feudal castle, 30 rooms and 3 water repositories have been excavated from this period. The best preserved and most notable feature of Asen's Fortress is the Church of the Holy Mother of God from the 12th-13th century. It is a two-storey cross-domed single-naved building with a wide narthex and a large rectangular tower, and features mural paintings from the 14th century. The conservation and partial restoration works on the church were finished in 1991 (the whole fortress was left to decay after the Ottoman conquest in the 14th century and only the church remained standing in its original appearance as it was used by the local Christians) and now it is in regular use as a Bulgarian Orthodox church. Taken by the Byzantines after Ivan Asen II's death, the fortress was once again in Bulgarian hands at the time of Ivan Alexander in 1344 only to be conquered and destroyed by the Ottomans during their rule of Bulgaria. The town of Asenovgrad took its modern name from the Tsar in 1934, formerly being named Stanimaka. File:  Gallery  File:Asens Fortress TB 9.jpgPart of the walls.

It is a pivot joint. The atlantoaxial joint is of a complicated nature. It consists of no fewer than four distinct joints. There is a pivot articulation between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the anterior arch and the transverse ligament of the atlas. Lateral and median joints There are three atlantoaxial joints: one median and two lateral: * The median atlantoaxial joint is sometimes considered a triple joint: ** one between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of atlas and the front of the odontoid process ** one between the anterior surface of the ligament and the back of the odontoid process * The lateral atlantoaxial joint involves the lateral mass of atlas and axis. Between the articular processes of the two bones there is on either side an arthrodial or gliding joint. Ligaments The ligaments connecting these bones are: * Articular capsules * Anterior atlantoaxial ligament * Posterior atlantoaxial ligament * Transverse ligament of the atlas  Pathology  The atlantoaxial joint in common terminology is actually a composition of three: two lateral and one median atlantoaxial joints. Because of its proximity to the brain stem and importance in stabilization, fracture or injury at this level can be catastrophic. Common trauma and pathologies include (but are not limited to): The Dens: significant depression on the skull can push the dens into the brainstem, causing death. The dens itself is vulnerable to fracture due to trauma or ossification. Transverse ligament: Should the transverse ligament of the atlas fail due to trauma or disease, the dens is no longer anchored and can travel up the cervical spine, causing paralysis. If it reaches the medulla death can result. Alar ligaments: stress or trauma can stretch the weaker alar ligaments, causing an increase in range of motion of approximately 30%. Posterior atlanto-occipital membrane: genetic traits can sometimes result in ossification, turning the groove into a foramen. Capsule The atlantoaxial articular capsules are thick and loose, and connect the margins of the lateral masses of the atlas with those of the posterior articular surfaces of the axis. Each is strengthened at its posterior and medial part by an accessory ligament, which is attached below to the body of the axis near the base of the odontoid process, and above to the lateral mass of the atlas near the transverse ligament. Abnormal widening Normal atlanto-dental joint on projectional radiography. A widening of the atlanto-axial joint, as measured between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of atlas and the front of the odontoid process, indicates an injury to the transverse atlantal ligament. Normally, this atlanto-dental distance is less than 2 mm, sometimes a maximum of 3 mm is accepted in men and 2.5 mm in women. References Bibliography *Dalley, Arthur F; Moore, Keith L.

Discovery and naming Neimongosaurus is a therizinosauroid which is known from the holotype LH V0001, consisting of a partially preserved braincase; the front of the right lower jaw; a nearly complete axial column compromising 15 cervical (including the axis), 4 dorsal and 22 caudal vertebrae; a furcula; both scapulocoracoids; both humeri; left radius; fragmented ilia; both femora; both tibiae; left tarsals and a virtually complete and articulated left pes. A second specimen, LH V0008, consisting of a sacrum composed by 6 sacral vertebrae and both ilia, was assigned as the paratype. The specimens were collected in 1999 at Sanhangobi in Inner Mongolia from the Iren Dabasu Formation, dating from the Cenomanian stage. Based on these remains, the type species, Neimongosaurus yangi, was formally named and described by Zhang Xiaohong, Xu Xing, Paul Sereno, Kwang Xuewen and Tan Lin in 2001. The generic name is derived from Nei Mongol, the Chinese name for Inner Mongolia. The specific name honours Yang Zhongjian. Description Life restoration Neimongosaurus is thought to have been a small-sized therizinosaur, from in length and weighing . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Neimongosaurus was bipedal and ponderous animal with well developed hindlimbs. The femur measured long, having a straight shaft, the femoral head points to the inner sides. Both tibiae are preserved, measuring ; shorter than the femur. Its lower jaw is U-shaped, preserving only a partial right dentary. There are 5 alveoli in which only one tooth was preserved. It is coarsely serrated, indicating a herbivorous diet like other therizinosaurs, such as Alxasaurus or Erlikosaurus. It had a relatively elongated neck composed by approximately 16 cervicals (if preserved atlas). Overall, the forelimbs are well preserved, missing the manus. Its scapula had a tapering end. Classification The original describers of the genus assigned Neimongosaurus to the Therizinosauroidea, in a basal position. Subsequent cladistic analyses have indicated a position in the more derived Therizinosauridae, but an analysis in 2010 by Lindsay Zanno recovered the original placement. However, Hartman et al. 2019 recovered Neimongosaurus as a therizinosaurid again. Below are the results: Paleobiology In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur Neimongosaurus and concluded the overall motion at the glenoid-humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards- and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods. This ability to extend their arms considerably forwards may have helped Neimongosaurus reach and grasp for foliage.

The idea was first conceived and the basic concepts invented in 1973 by Rick Coupland and John Moore, old friends and systems programmers who were working at Ramada Inns Micor division (Phoenix, AZ) at the time. The project lasted from 1973 until 1979, included two product version, but never reached commercial success due to inadequate funding. In 1975, Coupland left Micor to work full-time on creating the instrument, building the first, and 8-bit version. Micor subsequently funded the project and a team including a consulting professor of music and consulting physicist, along with the usual engineers. They designed and built a prototype of the 12-bit version. Due to funding constraints, the prototype was rushed to a showing at the NAMM conference where the fragile, wire-wrapped prototype failed to function, leading to significant embarrassment. However, the concept and design was solidly proven, and with continued funding would have been a commercial instrument representing a significant improvement in the state of the art. The performer used a frequency domain specification of the musical voice harmonics, and created an ADSR function to modify it. The instrument used a waveform buffer, now a widespread practice, but independently conceived by Moore and Coupland. This was driven with high precision phase generator, of which only the high order bits addressed the buffer. A subtle logarithmic algorithm (log eighth root of two) was invented to apply audio level and ADSR amplitude modulation to the signal generated for each voice. This avoided the cost and heat dissipation of available commercial multiplier modules. A Texas Instruments TI-990 minicomputer performed the non-real-time Fast Fourier transform processing necessary to convert from the frequency domain specification to the time domain waveform buffer format. It also handled user interaction such as specifying sound parameters. The second version used a TMS-9900 microprocessor for the same functions The first version used only 8 bit precision for its output digital-to-analog conversion (DAC). The instrument suffered from aliasing, which was not due to the typical cause of too low a sample rate or inadequate post-D/A filtering. Rather, it was an inherent effect of low precision calculations in the digital circuitry - round-off error produced digital non-linearity and extra harmonics resulting in digital mixing with the sample rate. The problem was solved by dithering, which did not noticeably affect the intended output, but through the natural characteristics of human hearing caused the narrow-band high frequency alias to become imperceptible. In general, in-depth study of psychoacoustics was used to solve such problems and provide some technical constraints. The 12 bit instrument was more advanced than the 8 bit prototype, and was enclosed in a stylishly modern plastic case with a futuristic touch-sensitive console above the keyboard. It was small and light enough to be a practical performance instrument. It is still in Coupland's possession.

Flexion is produced mainly by the action of the longi capitis and recti capitis anteriores; extension by the recti capitis posteriores major and minor, the obliquus capitis superior, the semispinalis capitis, splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoideus, and upper fibers of the trapezius. The recti laterales are concerned in the lateral movement, assisted by the trapezius, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, and the sternocleidomastoideus of the same side, all acting together.

Club career =Early career= Earlier in his career, Slavkovski was nicknamed \\"Ibrahimoviƒá II\\", because of his similar stature and style of play to the Swedish striker, and as he also played for FBK Balkan and Malm√∂ FF. =Internazionale= Slavkovski made his first team debut at the age of 17 years and one month on 7 May 2006 in a Serie A league match against Siena, taking the field at the 83rd minute, thus becoming the youngest footballer ever to play for Internazionale. This record has since been broken by Federico Bonazzoli. Previously, the record was held by Giuseppe Bergomi. He made his Coppa Italia debut against F.C. Messina Peloro, on 29 November 2006. =Sheffield United= On 30 January 2008 Inter reached a loan agreement with Middlesbrough which fell through after he failed a medical and would be unlikely to challenge for a first team place.Slavkovski Loan Move Off The next day Inter announced to have loaned Slavkovski to Sheffield United. On 18 March 2008, Sheffield United manager Kevin Blackwell claimed that he was still not ready to play in the first team stating that he would play in the reserve team where he could be assessed. Slavkovski returned to Italy at the end of the season without having made a first team appearance for the Blades. He did, however, make six appearances for the reserve team, scoring twice. =2008‚Äì09 season and beyond= On 27 June 2008, Slavkovski confirmed a 5-year deal with Hajduk Split. It was subsequently confirmed that he is in a very weak physical condition as a result of unsporting behavior and that it would have taken weeks for him to regain fitness.HNK Hajduk Split The announced transfer was later cancelled due to his condition, and Slavovski remained contracted with Inter. In October 2008, he started training with Malm√∂ FF, confirming he was still an Inter player and announcing that he will stay on in Sweden for the remainder of the year. His contract with Inter expired in June 2009, and was not extended; since then, he allegedly rejected a number of offers from Serie B and Lega Pro Prima Divisione clubs. On 22 January 2010, it was announced that VfL Bochum II had signed Slavkovski. The Macedonian and former Inter Milan forward signed a six-month contract with the option to renew the contract. Slavkovski also had a trial with Barnet.http://www.barnetfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10431~1373847,00.html He was however released by the end of the season, after failing to play a single game for the club's first team. Since then, his career has faded into obscurity and, in 2011, he returned to Sweden where he briefly joined third division amateurs IF Limhamn Bunkeflo. International career Recently the media reported a \\"war\\" going on between the Macedonian and Swedish football federations, in attempt to get him to join their national football teams. Slavkovski and his father have stated that it would be an honour to play for his country of origin, Macedonia. Slavkovski also met the Macedonian Prime Minister where they talked about his chances playing for the Macedonian national team. The Prime Minister handed him a football jersey with his name on the backside. On 11 June 2008 Slavkovski finally spoke out about his international career and decided to play for Macedonia. In August 2008 Slavkovski made his debut for the Macedonian under-21 team, in the qualification matches against Estonia and Norway.http://www.uefa.com/competitions/under21/fixturesresults/round=15084/match=300276/report=lu.html He has made three scoreless appearances hitherto.

The type and only species is S. gautieri.  History of discovery  In 1959, Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent excavated fossils near Oued Timmers√∂i, west of In Tedreft in the Agadez desert. Among the finds were the remains of a theropod. In 1960, de Lapparent, based on these, named a second species of the genus Elaphrosaurus, E. gautieri. The specific name honours Fran√ßois Gautier, the discoverer of the type locality.A-F. de Lapparent, 1960, \\"Les Dinosauriens du \\"Continental intercalaire\\" du Saharal central\\", M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France, nouvelle s√©rie 39(88A): 1-57 In 2004, Paul Sereno, John Wilson and John Conrad named a separate genus: Spinostropheus. The generic name is derived from Latin spina, \\"spine\\", and Greek œÉœÑœÅŒøœÜŒµœçœÇ, stropheus, \\"vertebra\\", and refers to the epipophyseal processes of the cervical vertebrae, which are prominent and dorso-ventrally flattened. The holotype, MNHN 1961-28, was found in a layer of the Tiouraren Formation dating from the Bathonian-Oxfordian. De Lapparent had presumed that the strata dated from the Early Cretaceous. It consists of a cervical vertebra, seven pieces of the dorsals, three pieces of the sacrum, five tail vertebrae, a humerus, the lower end of a pubic bone, the lower end of a thighbone, a piece of a shinbone, a piece of a fibula, a metatarsal, four additional pieces of the metatarsus and a phalanx of a toe. The paratypes were an ulna, a metatarsal and a second partial skeleton consisting of vertebrae and limb elements. In 2004, Sereno e.a. referred a third skeleton, specimen MNN TIG6 consisting of a series of cervical and dorsal vertebrae together with some ribs.  Description  Spinostropheus was a relatively small theropod. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 4 metres (13 feet), and its weight at 200 kg (441 lbs).Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 78 In 2012 Thomas R. Holtz Jr gave a length of 6.2 meters (20.3 feet). In 2016 Molina-P√©rez & Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 8.5 meters (28 feet) and 600 kg (1.323 lbs) for the MNHN specimen known from an ulna.  Phylogeny  In 2002, a cladistic analysis by Sereno et al found Spinostropheus to be the sister taxon of the Abelisauria. In this study only the data from specimen MNN TIG6 were considered. Subsequent studies have confirmed the original interpretation as a basal ceratosaur, outside of Neoceratosauria, more closely in the evolutionary tree to Elaphrosaurus.

Biography  Boott was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the brother of Kirk Boott, one of the founders of Lowell, Massachusetts. Kirk Boott's father (born in Derby, England, 1750-1817), was also called Kirk Boott. He had emigrated to the United States from England in 1783, and worked in Boston as a wholesale merchant. He was a friend of Joseph Wright of Derby and his family. Boott entered Harvard College in 1806, and graduated in 1810 with honors. At age 19, he moved to Derby in England apparently with the intention of becoming a merchant, where he spent three years, and became interested in botany. He returned to America, where in 1814 he studied botany. About 1820, he determined upon studying medicine, and placed himself under the tutelage of Dr. John Armstrong in London. Thence he removed to Edinburgh, where he took his doctor's degree in 1824. On his return to London in 1825 he commenced practice, and accepted the lectureship on botany in the Webb street school of medicine; this chair however, though admirably conducted, he did not long hold. At the dying request of his friend Dr. Armstrong he edited his life. This book bears the following title: Memorials of the Life and Medical Opinions of John Armstrong, M.D. To which is added an Enquir into the facts connected with those forms of devel' attributed to malaria or marsh eflluvium, by Francis Boott, M.D., 1833-34, two volumes. For seven years Boott practised very successfully in London, being especially noted for his treatment of fevers, in which he followed the practice of giving abundance of air to the patient, a course which at that time was vehemently objected to by the profession at large. In other respects, too, he was a judicious innovator, being one of the first to discard the black coat, white neckcloth, kneebreeches, and black silk stockings, for the ordinary costume of the day. This was then a blue coat with brass buttons, and yellow waistcoat, which he continued to wear to the last ; and thus by outliving the fashion, as he had forestalled it, he came to be as well known in 1860 as he had been in 1830. Boott was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1835. He retired from practice, and devoted himself for the last thirty-five years of his life to the cultivation of his literary, classical, and scientific tastes. He retained his interest in medicine, however, and wrote to The Lancet in 1846 when he heard from his friend Jacob Bigelow about the use of ether as an anaesthetic in America. The first use of ether as an anaesthetic in Britain (for a dental procedure) was in his house at 24 Gower Street on 19 December 1846. This is commemorated by a plaque on the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine which now stands on the site. A few days later a surgical operation under ether was carried out by Robert Liston at University College Hospital nearby. As far back as 1819 he had become a fellow of the Linnean Society, and his leisure now permitted him to accept the office of secretary, which he held from 1832 to 1839. He was appointed treasurer in November 1856, which place he resigned in May 1861, His botanical labours were entirely continued to the study of the great genus Carex. The results of his labours have seen the light in a large folio work entitled Illustrations of the Genus Carex, by F. Boott, M.D. In four parts London, 1858-67. It was produced at his own expense, and distributed amongst botanists. His close attention to study tended to enfeeble his never very vigorous frame; but the immediate cause of his death was disease of the right lung, induced by pneumonia at 24 Gower Street, London, on 25 December 1863. In connection with literature a most characteristic act of his was to erect in All Saints' Church, Cambridge, a tablet to the memory of Henry Kirke White, of whom he knew nothing personally, but whose life and poems he ardently admired. In addition to the works already mentioned Boott also published 'Two Lectures on Materia Medica' in 1837, and he prepared a monograph of 158 species of Carex, which was printed in Sir William Jackson Hooker's 'Flora Boreali- Americana'. Family His wife was a Miss Mary Hardcastle of Derby; they married in 1820. Her mother may have been an extramarital daughter of Erasmus Darwin.

The pound lock was built in 1789 by the Thames Navigation Commissioner. The lock is across the river from the small village of Little Wittenham and is overlooked from the south by the hills of Wittenham Clumps, with a particularly good view from Round Hill. The weir runs straight across the river from the other side of the lock island. Day's Lock is the main gauging station for the measurement of the water flow in the River Thames. The Thames Path crosses the river here. The World Poohsticks Championships, on behalf of the RNLI, have taken place annually here since 1983. History The name Day's Lock comes from the Day family, local Catholic yeomen since the 17th century. During the 16th century, there was a flash lock here. The pound lock was staked out in August 1788. It was judged best to build it on the Oxfordshire bank provided the existing weir owner would \\"remove his bucks\\"(eel traps). In 1865 it was reported to be in utter ruin and dangerous, but reconstruction did not take place until 1871. In 1882 a bell push to summon the keeper was installed, there being no lock keeper's house at that time.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles The lock house was not built until 1928 when it was erected on Lock House Island next to Little Wittenham Bridge. Access to the lock A short way downstream of the lock is Little Wittenham Bridge which spans the river in two sections with an island between. Using this, the lock is a short walk from Little Wittenham where is a car park near St Peter's Church. The lock is a little further to walk to from Dorchester. Reach above the lock View from Round Hill. Day's Lock and the River Thames curving along the tree line to the left On the eastern bank to the north-east is the historic town of Dorchester with its ancient Abbey. The river follows a long bend round to Clifton Hampden. Here it goes under Clifton Hampden Bridge and past the historic Barley Mow public house, as mentioned in the book, Three Men in a Boat. After the bridge and before Clifton lock, the river divides between the old river course, past Long Wittenham; with the navigation following the Clifton Cut. The river meander is now a weirstream and has almost no public footpath access. The Thames Path follows the western/southern bank to Clifton Hampden Bridge, where it crosses to the opposite northern bank to continue to Clifton Lock.

The arena was developed to host equestrian events, primarily the annual Dublin Horse Show, which was first held there in 1881. The site had been acquired in 1879 by the RDS. The primary tenants of the RDS Arena are Leinster Rugby who compete in the Pro14 and Champions Cup. The arena has also hosted soccer and wrestling events and concerts. It has a capacity of 18,500, 16,500 of which is seated. The demountable north and south stands are removed for equestrian events, with only the Grandstand and Angelsea Stand permanent. The Angelsea Stand was completed in 1927. History The Grandstand was rebuilt in 2006 for the 2006‚Äì07 rugby season, to replace the old wooden stand when Leinster first became permanent tenants. A roof was added during 2008-09. There are plans to redevelop the Arena, replacing the Angelsea Stand with another new permanent stand, which would incorporate the only terraced area of the stadium.http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/olsc/6278.php In July 2014, it was announced by the RDS and Leinster Rugby that a design competition was being held to develop the arena into a 25,000 capacity world class stadium, with work expected to commence on the redevelopment in April 2016.http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/news/12157.php#.U_xnJ2O9aFE The selling of naming rights to the arena will be a key component in funding the project, with a budget of at least ‚Ç¨20,000,000 being proposed.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/leinster-rugby- announces-winner-of-rds-arena-design-competition-1.2085414 A consortium of architect firms, Dublin-based Newenham Mulligan Architects and London-based Grimshaw Architects, won the international design competition for the multimillion-euro redevelopment of the RDS Arena.http://www.rds.ie/index.jsp?p=106&n;=697#sthash.DL9EMhKi.dpuf Sporting events =Association Football= The Stadium first hosted a football game (as in soccer) on 30 September 1990 when Shamrock Rovers used it as a home ground. For the next six seasons until April 1996 Rovers played their home games there. The Stadium held its first international match on 19 February 1992 when it played host to a home game between Ireland and Wales national football team. The stadium hosted some games of the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championships including the third-place playoff and the final. The final of the FAI Cup was held at the RDS in 2007 and 2008 during the construction of the Aviva Stadium. The 2009 final, however, was moved to Tallaght Stadium. The RDS hosted a game between St Patrick's Athletic and Hertha Berlin in the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup First round.StPatsFC.com ‚Äì Match Report St Patrick's Athletic also played Steaua Bucure≈üti in the Arena on 27 August 2009 in the Europa League. The RDS Arena hosted the Ireland team when they played Paraguay and Algeria in May 2010. =Show Jumping= RDS hosting the Dublin Horse Show The Arena was originally constructed to host show- jumping events, the Dublin Horse Show has been held by the RDS annually since 1864.http://dublinhorseshow.com/history/dublin-horse-show-history In 1881 the Show moved to ‚ÄòBall's Bridge', a greenfield site. The first continuous ‚Äòleaping' course was introduced at the Show. In the same year the first viewing stand was erected on the site of the present Grand Stand. It held 800 people. In 1925 Colonel Zeigler of the Swiss Army first suggested holding an international jumping event. The Aga Khan of the time heard of this proposal and offered a challenge trophy to the winner of the competition. In 1926 International Competitions were introduced to the show and was the first time the Nations' Cup for the Aga Khan Challenge trophy was held. Up until 1949 the Nations' Cup teams had to consist of military officers. Six countries competed in the first international teams competition for the Aga Khan Challenge trophy - Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Ireland. The Swiss team won the title on Irish bred horses. In 1976, after 50 years of international competition, the two grass banks in the Arena were removed so the Arena could be used for other events. The continental bank at the western end of the Main Arena was added later. The RDS also hosted the Show Jumping World Championships in 1982. =Rugby union= RDS Arena, home of Leinster Rugby The stadium first opened its doors to rugby union on Saturday 15 October 2005, hosting a game between Leinster Rugby and the Cardiff Blues, which Leinster won 34‚Äì15, the arena hosted four further games that season. The following season, the RDS was not used by Leinster due to redevelopment. The 2007‚Äì08 season saw the RDS become the official home of Leinster when the branch signed a 20-year lease on the ground, with all of the home games for the season to be hosted there. This change came about after it became apparent that the team's former home of Donnybrook Stadium no longer had a sufficient capacity. After renovation and expansion, the Grandstand and North and South Stands were expanded, boosting the capacity to 18,500 along with floodlights being installed and a new playing surface being laid, to withstand the demands of a full rugby season and show jumping events. The RDS had proven to be a very successful hunting ground for Leinster, as they won 11 of their 12 home games that season, culminating on Saturday 3 May 2008 in a 41‚Äì8 victory over Newport Gwent Dragons and lifting the Celtic League trophy that day. In all, Leinster had played 18 games in the RDS, losing only twice, to Bath and Scarlets. Between March 2008 and 2010, the final of the Leinster Schools Senior Cup was played in the RDS due to the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road, its traditional venue. The RDS hosted the autumn rugby international between Ireland and Fiji on 21 November 2009. Ireland were convincing winners on the day. The stadium also hosted the 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 Pro12 Grand Finals and the 2013 Challenge Cup Final between Leinster and Stade Fran√ßais, which saw a sell-out crowd of 20,396 people. =Wrestling= The Arena hosted a WWE event on 18 June 2005, part of the WWE Summerbash Tour, which featured Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, John Cena and Stone Cold Steve Austin.http://www.mopsquad.com/artman2/publish/WWE_Recaps_24/WWE_SmackDown_House_Show_- _June_18th_2005_2825.htm Concerts Prince played the venue on June 13, 1992 as part of his Diamonds and Pearls Tour Boyzone played at the arena in 1999 and once again in their reunion in 2008.

It is usually played with one hand, leaving the other one free to accompany oneself on a drum like the tinya. It is used in a variety of public festivals and other kinds of communal ceremonies.  Construction and materials  The pinkillu can measure in length up to 1 meter 20 cm, and has six finger holes. It is most commonly made out of cane, but can be made out of bamboo, bone, or tree branches as well. In Peru and Bolivia, sheep and llama nerves are used to tie the instrument together. Among the different kinds there are ch'aka pinkillu (bone flute), qina qina pinkillu (cane flute) and tupa pinkillu (made out of thicker tuquru cane).  Cultural uses and significance  The pinkillu has great cultural significance. In the Andes the instrument is played during the early rainy season to celebrate cattle and farming. The pinkillu is often played in pairs or ensembles during the rainy season and at festivals. In Bolivia it is believed that the pinkillu made from cane attracts rainfall.

It is on the north-east edge of the town straddling the A30 trunk road. The Chyandour Brook rises near Carfury and flows into Mount's Bay at Chyandour.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Before 1934 Chyandour was in the parish of Madron and was the site of a large tin smelting works. Industry In around 1660 John Tremenheere, in anticipation of Penzance becoming a Stannary town, set up a smelting works, just outside the Borough of Penzance's boundary at Chyandour. In 1760 when Thomas Bolitho arrived in Penzance from Penryn, the smelting works at Chyandour was run by the Praed family. By the time tin production was at its maximum the business was run by the Bolitho family who lived in Coombe House, and in 1867 bought the estate at Trengwainton, Madron. Still in use, the Bolitho Estate Office was built in 1860, and at that time the first floor was a bank with the vault under the caretaker's ground floor accommodation. Wagon drivers would stop at the bank to collect their money before driving up Chyandour Coombe to the smelting works. In 1883 the smelting works was the largest of nine in Cornwall covering to . It consisted of a number of long, one storey, slated buildings with several chimneys belching smoke and flames. There were four furnaces which were built of brick thick and clamped with iron bands. Each lasted five to six weeks, when it required rebuilding. Fifteen men worked twelve hour shifts, with nights every other week, for 19 shillings a week. The tin ore was stored between large wooden barriers (known as hutches) with each compartment storing differing qualities. The ore came straight from the mines, or from ‚Ä≥valuable‚Ä≥ Australian stream ore (containing 75% tin), or low quality ore from the ‚Ä≥Red River‚Ä≥. The ore was heated and the tin flowed into cast iron crucibles where it was re-heated to remove impurities. It was then ladled into bars, blocks, ingots, etc., which weighed from one pound to a hundredweight or more. A small iron slab with Messrs Bolitho's trade mark was laid on the molton tin to leave an impression and the tin was shipped within this country or exported to Russia, America, etc. Anthracite was brought in by sea, the ships landing on the beach near the mouth of the Chyandour Brook, which was outside the boundary of Penzance and hence they did not have to pay harbour dues. The cargo was carried through the three tunnels under the railway line and hauled up the slipway to the smelting works. The works closed in 1912 and was demolished in 1930; some of the walls and crucibles can still be seen. Legends The area between Marazion and Chyandour was mostly marsh and the Eastern Green was haunted by a white lady who would rise from the marsh, jump on the back of a traveller's horse and ride pillion-fashion as far as the Red River (Chyandour Brooke), just below the smelting works.

The company was founded by M.A. Razaq, an expatriate Pakistani who retired as Corporate Vice President of General Motors Corporation, 1999. Balubaid Establishment of Saudi Arabia, a diversified group involved in automotive, real estate, and other industrial businesses, was an investor in the assembly business of Nexus Automotive. The company was privately owned, with ownership distributed between Pakistani and Saudi families. Nexus used the idle capacity at the Ghandhara Nissan Limited plant at Port Qasim to assemble vehicles, under a contract assembly agreement. The project was estimated at 15 million US dollars and GM-Chevrolet provided support to ensure that the local components and the car assembly met GM quality standards. The company also planned to export its models to other countries in South Asia and Africa. The source of assembly kits and imported units is GM Daewoo, a GM subsidiary in South Korea that supplies Chevrolet, Opel, Suzuki, and Daewoo branded vehicles to markets including the United States, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Australia and Asia. GM Daewoo is also the \\"corporate center of excellence\\" for GM's global small car platform, code-named Gamma. Current products exported by GM Daewoo include Chevrolet Spark, Aveo, Optra, Captiva, and Epica.  Model lineup  Previously, Nexus imported the Chevrolet Optra and Chevrolet Joy vehicles and marketed them nationally through their franchised dealer network. From December 2005, the manufacturing of Chevrolet Joy started in Pakistan. Other GM products sourced from the global GM network were also planned for introduction to the Pakistani local market.  Competition  Pakistan's automotive sector has experienced significant growth. The small car segment remains partially monopolized by PakSuzuki and other brands. In past, Government policies have consistently favored Paksuzuki, Toyota, and Honda due to which further investment has been blocked in the country. But now new policies are inviting new producers to enter the market. When Nexus Automotive was operating Gandhara Nissan (Nissan), Deewan Mushtaq (Hyundai and Kia), and Adam Motors had assembling operations in Pakistan.  Reasons for Failure and revival  The company struggled to make substantial sales in the market dominated by Paksuzuki and used car imports. Despite being a new entrant, no incentive was granted to Nexus by the government similar to Adam motors. Eventually the sales dropped to the point where assembly became nonviable and the company exclusively focused on CBU (Completely Built Unit) imports during its final months. Nexus ceased operations in 2006. It has been reported by the media that General Motors along with Volkswagen and Renault-Nissan may consider entering the Pakistani market again. The 2016-21 Automotive Industry Development Policy approved in March 2016 includes incentives for new entrants and non-operational units (such as Nexus, Gandhara Nissan, and Deewan Farooq). The new policy has increased the chances of these units resuming their operations in Pakistan. http://tribune.com.pk/story/1068402/long-awaited-auto- policy-approved-door-wide-open-for-new-entrant/ References  External links  *Nexus Automotive This exists no more.

Their population may exceed 100,000. Most are Muslims. Culture =Communication= They speak Nyima languages, also known as Ama language of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Their language is named after the tribe. There is no written language, but some are trying to create a written language using Latin letters for the sounds. There are about fifty names for men and about fifty names for women, the names have no special meaning but are made because they have a pleasant sound.Idris, Mirghani Gabir. Personal interview. 28 Sept. 2009. =Social behavior= Not many games are played, but one significant exception is kordang. It is a game that is played with a bat that looks much like a cricket bat. The way people greet each other depends on their generation. For example, people from the same generation greet each other by sliding the palm over the back of the other person's hand. Youths shake each other's hands vigorously, which is how they display their strength to one another. when an adult greet a child, they place their hand on the top of their head. As for their daily schedule, the first meal is eaten at five to six in the morning. Then, the men tend to the fields until noon, while the women go later because they are preparing food. They have their lunch at noon and then they take care of other daily work. Dinner is held at sunset, and then they wait till about nine before going to sleep. The evening hours are dedicated to quality time with friends and family. Braids are considered stylish for women and teenagers. Once a boy matures he does not wear braids. Weddings happen very often, especially since a man has a minimum of two wives. A man goes to a girl's family and asks for her hand. Then, all the men that want to marry the girl have a competition and they are rated on their warrior traits and bravery. The father and the girl's brothers decide on the man for her. Once they decide who it should be, then they get the dowry and the man has to \\"kidnap\\" the woman. It is sort of a game they have. If the man does not kidnap the woman, then they will not live in the same house or be officially married. If the groom fails to kidnap the bride, then she stays at her father's house until she becomes the mother of at least three to four children.Idris, Mirghani Gabir. Personal interview. 04 Oct. 2009. =Art Forms= The Nyimang tribe has many different forms of art. They have dances and ceremonies for various events. They celebrate births, weddings, harvests, and the life of someone when they die. They even have a special dance for when they are about to go to war with enemy tribes. They believe it gives them special energy and scares the enemy. They are also fond of pottery and woodcarvings; they have mud plates with authentic designs that they favor. Their woodcarvings are shown in the form of a pillar with carved designs on them. They also have great music. Their instruments are not that different from Western instruments; they have string instruments, woodwind, and drums. their favorite instrument is a string instrument that quit resembles the guitar; it is called conyang. The Nyimang tribe tells many stories to amuse both grown men and children. There is a certain story of how they believe they came from the sky and landed on the Nuba Mountains. They believe this because they saw footprints on the mountains and thought it was the footprints of their ancestors when they first descended from the sky. Architecture The Nyimang live in attached villages very close to mountains, for defence and security reasons, houses are very close, mostly round huts with clay or wooden walls, another one of their architectural achievements. The walls of the house are made of mud and the roofs are made of hay or twigs and leaves. The kitchen or storage room is very big and spacious, they keep some calves in there and meat and vegetables. It is where they keep mostly everything, in their language it is called the \\"merdang\\", there is many huts in one family house 4 to 5, and some times more, surrounded with some plants hedging as a fence, the house is usually surrounded by a farm, besides animals small farm in the house for cows and goats Style/Fashion As for their clothing they wear fancy clothing with great embroidery to festivals and special events. Sometimes they wear animal skin. They also wear jewellery such as beads and necklaces; these necklaces are sometimes made of pumpkin skin while others are made of certain nuts. The preferable necklaces are made of certain metals and marbles (the public wears white and black marbles while the married women wear blue marbles in the form of belts). They also wear very, to their personal liking, flashy and colorful clothes. Symbols are used to separate generations rather than used for letters.Idris, Mirghani Gabir. Personal interview. 28 Sept. 2009. =Social structure= Nyimang have different views depending on the gender and the age of a person. The father/husband is supposed to lead the family. If the father has died or is away for some reason then the eldest son leads the family, but the women are never in charge. Adult men and women go to work on the farms early in the morning. When there is a wedding, the father and brother(s) of the girl chooses the husband. The bride has no say in who she wants to marry. Spouses are chosen according to the man's bravery, courage, and so on, because a brave man is at a high position. Women are supposed to cook and feed the family. They shall care for children who are still too young to work. They also care for small animals and tend to their small vegetable garden if they have one. Both boys and girls from the age of eight to twenty care for the cattle and other animals. When the rains come they all go to the high lands and camp with the cattle (and each other) for three months. A man can never marry a girl who he considers a friend. He can never touch the girl for fear of being disgraceful. If he does then he will need to be cleansed with a special ceremony led by the Kujur. Elders are the wise and the old of the village. Some choose to become priests. There are eight hills and each hill has a chief. The hills are called: Sallara, Tundia, Kallara, Kurmiti, Nitil, Kakara, Fus, and Hajar-Sultan (the hill of the sultan, where the sultan lives and the most important hill of all). A chief of a certain hill is responsible for that hill's residence. He is the one who will solve the problems of that hill. Higher above them is a chief who is the chief of all the hills.Idris, Mirghani Gabir. Personal interview. 04 Oct. 2009. =Institutions= In a family the women do not get much of a say in anything. It is always the men who make the decisions. The father/husband is in charge. If the father is away or is dead then his eldest son is in charge. He decides what is to happen when in crisis or when something is at hand. The Amma tribe's religion depends. About 90% are Muslim, 8% are Christian, and 2% are other African religions. Children's schooling is like normal government schooling. They wake up early morning and go to government school. They have no favorite subjects but learn all the same.Idris, Mirghani Gabir. Personal interview. 28 Sept. 2009. =Economic base= The preferable job that the Nyimang tribes like is agriculture. They like farming and building crops that they find quite valuable. If a member of their tribe goes to the city they prefer to be soldiers or join the police force, to become butchers, to become waiters, and some become bakers. The Nyimang like farming that's why they have numerous crops per person. They include cucumbers, nuts, corn, wheat, and sesame seeds. The Nyimang tribe measures wealth not by money or land, but by cattle and land. Someone who has more cattle than other is considered wealthier. Cattle and land for the Nymang is like a currency. Their tribe also has a balanced trading system: they trade cattle for seeds with other tribes. The seeds and the cattle must be balanced out. If the Amma tribe is short on cattle then the number of seeds they get while rise; it works in vice versa as well.Idris, Mirghani Gabir. Personal interview. 28 Sept. 2009. =History= No one knows where their beliefs originated from or when they came to the Nuba Mountains but as stated before the people believe they came from the sky because they saw footprints on the mountains and think that that was where their ancestors first landed on Earth. Politics Before 1917, during the war against the British, the current Sultan Agabna, led the Nymang against the colonial rulers. He lost the fight and was hanged in 1917. At that time the Nuba Mountains were ruled by Kujurs. All Kujurs were ruled by sultans but each hill had self-rule without too much interference from the sultan. In 1954, when Sudan prepared to gainindependence, Mekks (chiefs) were appointed for each hill. A Nazir was appointed as the ruler of the Mekks. The Sultan still kept his position, but was without power. :Notable Nazir include: *Kanda Krboos and Amina Dirdimma. :Notable Mekks include: *Tamor Dura-Mekk of Sallara *Sallam Darfur-First mekk of Kurmiti *Nasralla Sarmin-Second mekk of Kurmiti *Gaa Adin-Mekk of Tundia *Khalifa Nawy-Mekk of Nitil :Notable and politically involved Nyimang people include:Idris, Mirghani Gabir.

Johann Strauss II's walz \\"Fr√ºhlingsstimmen\\" by Alfred Gr√ºnfeld. Life Alfred Gr√ºnfeld was born as the second of eight children to Jewish leather merchant Moritz Gr√ºnfeld (born 1817 Kol√≠n nad Labem) and his wife Regina, nee Pick (born 1826 Osek), in Prague - New Town.National archives of the Czech Republic: N√°rodn√≠ archiv, Konskripƒçn√≠ seznamy - pobytov√© p≈ôihl√°≈°ky pra≈æsk√Ωch obyvatel z let 1850-1914 Moritz Gr√ºnfeld was a leather merchant, and Gr√ºnfeld grew up in a middle-class, musical Jewish family. His siblings included: the cellist Heinrich Gr√ºnfeld; Ludwig Gr√ºnfeld, who worked for Deutsche Grammophon, and Siegmund Gr√ºnfeld, r√©p√©titeur at the Vienna Hofoper. The family lived at Zeltnergasse 38. Gr√ºnfeld displayed musical talent at just four years old, and began his musical education with Julius Theodor Hoeger. He gave his first public concert on 12 April 1865 in the Konviktsaal in Prague. Gr√ºnfeld then studied under Josef Krejƒç√≠ and Bed≈ôich Smetana at the Prague Conservatory, and later at Theodor Kullak's Neue Akademie der Tonkunst in Berlin. In the winter of 1871, Gustav Mahler was sent by his father to school in Prague, and boarded with the Gr√ºnfeld family. This proved to be an unpleasant experience for the eleven- year-old Mahler, and his wife Alma Mahler reported that his \\"clothes and shoes were taken from him and worn by others and he had to go barefoot and hungry also\\". She also wrote that he was an \\"involuntary witness, when he was sitting in a dark room, of a brutal love-scene between the servant and the son of the house, and he never forgot the shock of disgust it caused him. He jumped up to go to the girl's help, but she did not thank him for his pains. He was soundly abused by both of them and sworn to secrecy. This episode left a deep mark. Just as one can be angry all day long with people who have annoyed one in a dream, so Gustav never forgave the young pianist who had given him this shock.\\" Erna Gr√ºnfeld, the daughter of Gr√ºnfeld's youngest brother, who taught the piano at the Prague Conservatory, said that \\"the Gr√ºnfeld children were real rascals, brimming over with good health: they could make nothing of Gustav, whose terrible shyness only exasperated them.\\" Gr√ºnfeld moved to Vienna in 1873 where he lived, with his sister Emma, for the rest of his life, first at Praterstra√üe 49 and then at Getreidemarkt 10 from 1888 until his death. The house is now marked with a memorial plaque by the sculptor Florian Josephu-Drouot. Gr√ºnfeld became the most popular salon pianist in Vienna, performing frequently in the salons of Viennese high society as well as the Gro√üe Musikvereinssaal, the Gro√üe Konzerthaussaal and the B√∂sendorfersaal. In addition to his solo performance, he often appeared with the Arnold Ros√© Quartet and the Hellmesberger Quartet as well as frequently performing and touring with his brother Heinrich Gr√ºnfeld. His concert tours took him around Austro-Hungary, to Paris, London, Germany, Scandinavia, Holland, Russia, Poland, Romania, Estonia, Constantinople, Belgrade and the USA. He received many honours and titles for his performances, including: k. k. Kammervirtuose in 1881; Order of Saint Stanislaus 3rd class in 1884; Knight's Cross 2nd class of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order, court pianist to the German crown prince and Officer's Cross of the Romanian Order of the Crown in 1887; Order of the Red Eagle 4th class in 1896; Knight's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph in 1897; Order of the Lion and the Sun 3rd class and Order of St. Sava 3rd class in 1900; Order of the Medjidie 3rd class in 1901; Officer's Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania in 1902; Prussian Order of the Crown 3rd class and Order of the Iron Crown in 1908; decoration for services to the Austrian Red Cross. He was appointed professor at the Vienna Conservatory in 1897. Gr√ºnfeld was valued not only for his performances but also for his sociable and witty personality, known for his anecdotes and jokes. He was close friends with Johann Strauss, who dedicated his Fr√ºhlingsstimmen Waltz to Gr√ºnfeld. He became famous for his transcriptions of Strauss waltzes, and particularly of the Fr√ºhlingsstimmen which he often played as an encore. Alfred Gr√ºnfeld died on 4 January 1924. He was granted an Ehrengrab in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna, where he was buried on 7 January. The grave memorial was created by Josef M√ºllner and unveiled on 23 May 1928.  Recordings  Alfred Gr√ºnfeld was the first pianist of note to make commercial recordings.88 notes pour piano solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva Editions, 2015, p. 172. His earliest recording was made in 1889 on wax cylinder for the Edison Phonograph, brought to Europe by Theo Wangemann. On 18 November, Gr√ºnfeld recorded his own Kleine Serenade, dances by Brahms and his Ungarische Rhapsodie with a new horn mounted on the underside of the piano. The Ungarische Rhapsodie was discovered in the archives of Thomas Edison and restored in 2012. Gr√ºnfeld recorded 94 discs of classical and romantic piano music - including works by Chopin, Grieg, Poldini, Schumann and Debussy, as well as 50 discs of his own compositions - between 1899 and 1915. He also recorded rolls for the Welte- Mignon reproducing piano and the Phonola player piano between 1905 and 1911. Composition As well as performing, Alfred Gr√ºnfeld composed around 100 pieces for piano as well as songs and chamber music, which appeared in print between 1872 and 1926. His piano works are mostly in the salon music style, the most famous of which was his Kleine Serenade of 1888. He also composed and performed virtuosic piano pieces - transcriptions and paraphrases - which brought him great success but were mostly not published during his lifetime. Some of these survive only as recordings. Gr√ºnfeld also composed an operetta, Der Lebemann, with a libretto by Ludwig Fischl and Alexander Landesberg, which premiered in 1903 in Vienna, and a comic opera Die Sch√∂nen von Fogaras, with libretto by Victor L√©on, which was performed in Dresden in 1907. Neither of these works were hugely successful, but some songs and excerpts went on to be well-known, including An mein Wien and the Diner Waltz from Der Lebemann and the Ballett-Intermezzo and Entr'acte from Die Sch√∂nen von Fogaras. Of his works, the following are for the pianoforte: * Octave-study, Op. 15 * Minuet, Op. 31 * Spanish Serenade, Op. 37 * Tanz-Arabeske, Op. 41 * Romanze, Op. 42 * Ungarische Fantasie: mit Benutzung von Nationalmotiven, Op. 55 (1912) * Johann Strauss II: Transcriptions & Paraphrases for Solo Piano - Die Fledermaus, Op. 56 * Soir√©e de Vienne, Konzertparaphrase √ºber Johann Strau√üsche * Walzer- Paraphrase about Fr√ºhlingsstimmen, Op. 410 by Johann Strauss * Kaiser-Walzer  References  : External links * *Piano Rolls (The Reproducing Piano Roll Foundation) * AEIOU * Jewish Encyclopedia 1852 births 1924 deaths 19th-century classical composers 20th- century classical composers Austrian classical composers Austrian classical pianists Male classical pianists Austrian Jews Jewish classical composers Jewish classical pianists Musicians from Prague Austrian Romantic composers Austrian male classical composers 19th-century classical pianists 20th-century male musicians 19th-century male musicians ","title":"Alfred Gr√ºnfeld"},{"id":"5032730","text":"Fahrudin Omeroviƒá (; born 26 August 1961) is a Bosnian-Herzegovinian former football goalkeeper.

The ADI‚Äôs authority is granted by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth).APRA, \\" List of Authorised Deposit- taking Institutions \\" , APRA, November 2017 The term was adopted to formalise the right of non-bank financial institutions ‚Äî such as building societies, credit unions and friendly societies ‚Äî to accept such deposits. All ADIs are subject to the same prudential standards as banks but for a corporation to use word 'bank', 'building society' and 'credit union' in its name, it must meet certain requirements. The concept of an ADI replaced that of \\"bank\\" following the recommendations of the Wallis Report in March 1997. The statutory requirements of an ADI are elucidated in case Commissioners of the State Savings Bank of Victoria v Permewan, Wright & Co Ltd (1914). The case was seminal in characterising essential elements of a bank as being the collection of money by receiving deposits upon loan, repayable when and as expressly or impliedly agreed upon, and the utilisation of the money by lending it again in such sums as are required. If this is the institution's real and substantial business, and not merely an ancillary or incidental branch of another business, they are deemed to be a bank. Restricted ADI On 4 May 2018, APRA created a restricted ADI (RADI) framework to assist potential new entrants to the banking industry, particularly small firms with limited financial resources, to navigate the licensing process. Eligible entities can conduct a limited range of business activities for two years. On 7 May 2018, APRA issued the first RADI to Volt Bank. Australian government deposit guarantee Since 2008, as part of the response to the global financial crisis, the Australian government set up the Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) to provide protection to depositors in ADIs in the event that an ADI fails. The FCS guarantees certain deposits (currently up to $250,000 for each account holder at any ADI incorporated in Australia). All deposits held by an account holder with a single financial institution are added together towards the FCS limit, including accounts with any other business that the ADI operates under a different trading name. Initially, there was uncertainty as to whether deposits in foreign-owned banks were covered by the FCS, leading to a great outflow of funds from these banks. The government clarified that Australian- incorporated subsidiaries of foreign banks in Australia are covered in the same way as local banks.

One of the POWs on the first flight was Navy Commander Everett Alvarez Jr., the first American pilot to be shot down in North Vietnam and, by the war‚Äôs end, the second longest-held POW there. (The longest-held was US Army Captain Floyd James Thompson who was released the following month.) Alvarez had spent eight-and-a-half years in captivity. The Hanoi Taxi's name comes from the writing on the flight engineer's panel by the POWs aboard the plane for the freedom flight. The commander of the first pick‚Äêup jet‚ÄîNo. 60177‚Äîwas Major James E. Marrott, originally of Provo, Utah. His navigator was Lieutenant colonel James C. Warren, originally of Chicago. Both flew reconnaissance and electronic warfare planes over South Vietnam during the war. On May 5, the Hanoi Taxi repeated the feat by flying approximately 100 former Vietnam POWs to Clark Air Base, The Philippines. Former naval aviator and senator John McCain, who spent five and a half years as a POW after being shot down shot down by a missile over Hanoi was flown home aboard the Hanoi Taxi upon his release in 1973. In May 2004, Air Force Major General Edward J. Mechenbier, himself a POW repatriated from Vietnam, flew the Hanoi Taxi back to Vietnam to repatriate the remains of two American service members killed in action during the war. =Later service= C-141s with the standard Air Force livery can be seen in the background Dobbins, ARB, Ga, shuttle a patient who arrived there on Hanoi Taxi. About 100 Hurricane Katrina victims were airlifted to Dobbins for transportation to hospitals in Atlanta. Originally built as a standard C-141A, the aircraft was converted to a stretched C-141B in October 1981http://www.c141heaven.info/dotcom/aahs/60177_mike_novack.htm, along with most of the C-141 fleet. Subsequent avionics and structural upgrades saw the aircraft converted to the C-141C standard in 1999. Later in her career she was transferred to the 445th Airlift Wing at Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) Area A in Ohio. In 2002 the aircraft's history was discovered by her crew chief while she was undergoing maintenance, and shortly thereafter she was repainted she in the white-over-grey livery she wore in 1973 during her evacuation mission to Hanoi.DTIC.mil Signatures of the freed prisoners were preserved on the panel over the years and became the centerpiece of what was essentially a \\"flying museum\\". Plaques, documents and photographs of the homecoming are part of the on-board exhibit researched and created by the 445th Airlift Wing. Etchings of the names of those who are missing in action were taken from engravings on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and are mounted on the plane. Framed photographs, plaques, and other memorabilia adorn the interior. Following her restoration the aircraft was first exhibited to the public at the 2003 Dayton Air Show. She appeared at numerous other venues until her retirement in May 2006. =Hurricane Katrina= In 2005, Hanoi Taxi was one of the aircraft marshalled by the Air Force to provide evacuation for those seeking refuge from Hurricane Katrina. This aircraft and others evacuated thousands of people, including the medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) of hundreds of ill and injured. =Retirement= With the scheduled 2006 retirement of the last 8 C-141s, the Hanoi Taxi embarked on a series of flights, giving veterans, some of whom flew out of captivity in this aircraft, the opportunity to experience one more flight before its retirement. At 9:30 AM on Saturday, 6 May 2006, the Hanoi Taxi touched down for the last time and was received in a formal retirement ceremony at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) Area B in Riverside, Ohio near Dayton, Ohio. Area B is the Wright Field portion of the base with runways that are no longer in operational service except for inbound flights to the museum.

Tudong (also spelled tudung) is a Malay word, literally meaning the noun \\"cover\\", which is commonly translated/referred to as veil or headscarf in English. In Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore, the tudong is worn in accordance to Islam's hijab. Usually, the tudong covers the hair, ears, neck while leaving only the face exposed. It is part of the standard dress code for offices, such as school uniforms and formal occasions. In Indonesia, a tudung is a form of hijab that has a sewn-in curved visor. In Indonesia the word more analogous to the Malaysian word tudong is \\"kerudung\\" or \\"jilbab\\". In the southern Philippines, a tudong refers to the standard hijab as worn by Muslim women. The term is interchangeable with the standard arabic term hijab (alternatively spelled hidyab in Filipino), and usually takes the form of the headwrap, visor-type, al-amira, khimar or niqab (face veil) types of veiling. A special type known as kombong (alternative spelling: combong), refers to the older style of headwrap hijab worn by Maranao, Iranun, and Maguindanao women with a semi-transcluscent shayla or malong (sarong) worn over the chest and drawn over the kombong for prayers, or for additional veiling when out of the house or familiar areas. Tudong or kombong are the native Austronesian words and cognates with Malay and Indoensian tudung or kerudung for the hijab; and are commonly used in languages as spoken by Muslim Filipinos or Bangsamoros; including the three the Danao languages of Maranao, Maguindanao and Iranun; Kaagan; and Tausug, Yakan, and Sinama (Bajau). In Tagalog or Bisaya, the standard Arabic word of hijab or English terms of headscarf, veil, or scarf are commonly used by non- Muslims to refer to the tudong instead.

He conceived and edited the first Handbook of Research on Teaching (Gage, 1963), led the Stanford Center for Research and Development of Teaching, and served as president of the American Educational Research Association. Gage was a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, where he moved in 1962 after 14 years at the University of Illinois. Deborah Stipek, dean of the Stanford School of Education, called Gage a \\"giant among educational researchers.\\" David C. Berliner, Regents' Professor of Education at Arizona State University, called Gage \\"the father of the field of research on teaching.\\" Education Nathaniel Lees Gewirtz was born in Union City, New Jersey in 1917; his eventual name change is explained below. He attended the City College of New York and the University of Minnesota. At the University of Minnesota, he worked in the laboratory of B.F. Skinner, who later became famous for his contributions to the theory of behaviorism. Gewirtz's duties included making food pellets used to reinforce the behavior of Skinner's laboratory rats. Gewritz graduated magna cum laude in 1938 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, but was rejected by 10 graduate schools before being admitted to Purdue University. According to David Berliner, the many rejections were due to anti-Semitism. A slightly different version of this article appeared in B.J. Zimmerman and D.H. Schuck (Eds.) (2003) Educational Psychology: A Century of Contributions (pp. 391-407) Mahwah, N.J. USA: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Gewirtz then changed his last name to Gage. During World War II, Gage spent two years in the Army, where he developed aptitude tests for choosing navigators and radar observers. Gage earned a Ph.D. in psychology from Purdue University in 1947. Academic career Gage taught at Purdue for a year, and at the University of Illinois for 14 years. In 1962, Gage became a professor at Stanford University, where he remained until his death. In 1965, Gage co-founded the Stanford Center for the Research and Development in Teaching (now known as the Center for Educational Research at Stanford), funded with a $4 million federal grant. Gage edited the Handbook of Research on Teaching (1963), and wrote The Scientific Basis of the Art of Teaching (1978) and Hard Gains in the Soft Sciences (1985). Upon his retirement from active teaching in 1987, Gage became a professor emeritus, and still worked at his office five days a week. From 1987 through 2008, he wrote at least three books and more than 20 articles. He completed his last book, A Conception of Teaching, shortly before his death. His many honors include a Guggenheim fellowship (1976-1977), election to the National Academy of Education (1979), the E.L. Thorndike Award for Career Achievement in Educational Psychology (1986), and an honorary doctorate from the Universit√© de Li√®ge in Belgium (2001). He died of complications of a fall.

His original name was Jalal Khan and he was the second son of Sher Shah Suri. History On his father's death, an emergency meeting of nobles chose Jalal Khan to be successor instead of his elder brother Adil Khan, since he had shown greater military ability. Jalal Khan was crowned on 26 May 1545 and took the title \\"Islam Shah\\". He was still worried that his brother would threaten his power and tried to have him captured. But Adil Khan evaded his grasp and raised an army. It marched on Islam Shah while he was at Agra. In the battle Islam Shah came out victorious and Adil Khan fled, never to be seen again. The support some of the nobles had given his brother made Islam Shah suspicious and he ruthlessly purged their ranks, strictly subordinating the nobility to the crown. He continued his father's policies of efficient administration and increased centralisation. He had little opportunity for military campaigning; the fugitive Mughal emperor Humayun, whom his father had overthrown, made one abortive attempt to attack him. Death Islam Shah died on 22 November 1554. He was succeeded by his son Firuz Shah Suri, who was only twelve. Within a few days the boy ruler had been murdered by Sher Shah's nephew Muhammad Mubariz Khan, who then ascended the throne as Muhammad Adil Shah.

Early years Kajanus was born in Trondheim, Norway, to Prince Pavel [also Paulo] Tjegodiev of Russia and Johanna Kajanus, a French-Finnish sculptress, bronze medal winner for sculpture at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937), and granddaughter of Robert Kajanus, the Finnish composer, conductor, champion of Sibelius and founder of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. He is the brother of the late actress and film-maker Eva Norvind and the uncle to Mexican theater and television actress Nailea Norvind.Sailor - Georg KajanusKajanus BiogJames McCarraher and Georg Kajanus, Kajanus: The Definitive Biography of Composer Georg Tchegodaieff Kajanus, Kajanus moved with his mother and sister to Paris at the age of twelve where he studied music and classical guitar, as well as attending the Cit√© Universitaire‚Äôs flying school. The family then relocated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where Kajanus worked as a stained-glass window designer. Early musical career Kajanus was a member of UK-based folk rock band Eclection, who released a self-titled album in 1968Richie Unterberger, \\"Liner Notes for ELEKTRA Non-LP Rarities\\" and wrote Cliff Richard's single \\"Flying Machine\\" (1971). Kajanus and Phil Pickett, who had been acquainted for some time, collaborated on an album, Hi Ho Silver! (1972), as Kajanus/Pickett. Deciding to form a group, tentatively named KP Packet, Kajanus and Pickett enlisted drummer and percussionist Grant Serpell (Affinity), and keyboard player and guitarist Henry Marsh (Gringo). In 1973, the foursome made their first recordings in a small studio in North London. Most of this material was not released at the time, but three demos are featured in Sailor's Buried Treasure 2-CD box set (2006).Sailor Albums - Buried Treasure Sailor Kajanus had developed a musical theater concept, Red Light Review, based on his memories of being a young man in places like Pigalle in Paris's red-light district. Encouraged by Grant Serpell to rework this material as pop songs, Kajanus devised the concept for Sailor.James McCarraher, A Glass of Champagne: The Official Sailor Story, Sailor: Biography Sailor signed to Epic Records-CBS Records and between 1974 and 1978 released five albums with Kajanus: Sailor, Trouble, The Third Step, Checkpoint (without Pickett) and Hideaway. Kajanus was the lead singer, guitarist and, for the first three albums, the sole songwriter for the band, penning its two major hits, \\"A Glass of Champagne\\" and \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\". Kajanus then left Sailor, leaving Pickett as the creative force behind their next album, Dressed for Drowning. DATA and afterwards After leaving Sailor in 1978, Kajanus began to experiment with electronic music, forming DATA with Frankie and Phil Boulter. The classical-oriented title track of DATA‚Äôs first album, Opera Electronica, was the theme music to the short film, Towers of Babel (1981). DATA then followed with two more studio albums, 2-TiME (1983) and Elegant Machinery (1985). Shortly after DATA disbanded, Kajanus formed Fatima and the Mamluks with Henry Marsh. They recorded only four songs, with two being released on a Razormaid! anthology on vinyl, Razormaid: The Epilogue: Back to Basics (1985). Kajanus and Marsh also collaborated on the soundtrack for the British TV series, The Kid (1986), starring actor/singer Steve Fairnie. He worked with the Japanese composer and musician Shigeru Umebayashi, co-writing and producing songs for his album, Ume (1988).\\"IMDb Resume for Georg Kajanus\\" Sailor again In 1989, Kajanus reunited with Henry Marsh and Phil Pickett to write and record some new material. This was not released at the time, but three songs are featured in Sailor's Buried Treasure 2-CD box set (2006). Kajanus, Marsh, Pickett and Grant Serpell reformed Sailor in 1990. The group recorded two albums, Sailor (1991) and Street Lamp (1992), with Kajanus once again writing and arranging all the material. They achieved further chart success in continental Europe with singles such as \\"La Cumbia\\" and \\"The Secretary\\". Noir In the late nineties, Kajanus formed the \\"poetic-techno\\" duo Noir with Tim Dry (previously of Tik and Tok).

The divide between the two river systems (which is also the border between today's Tomsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Krai) is spanned by a hand-dug canal 8 km long, 20 m wide at the bottom, and 2.1 m (7 feet) deep. History The canal was built in a period between 1882 and 1891, but was too shallow and narrow to compete with the Trans-Siberian Railway. Plans to improve the canal were considered around 1911, but were abandoned due to the beginning of the First World War. The canal was severely damaged during the Civil War, and closed for navigation in 1921. The canal was used one more time in 1942, when three steamboats and a cutter managed to make their way from the Yenisei to the Ob, but the passage was extremely difficult. The canal is now fully abandoned. It is occasionally reached by tourists using canoes, cars, or bicycles, or on foot.

It is one of seven New England dioceses that make up Province 1. The former Episcopal seat of the diocese, the Cathedral of St. John is at 271 North Main Street in the see city of Providence. It has subsequently been closed. There are 51 parishes in the diocese, with more than 17,000 communicants. The bishop is the Right Reverend W. Nicholas Knisely, the thirteenth office holder. History The diocese was founded in 1790 by two clergy and five members of the laity, representatives of the four charter churches of the diocese, King's Church in Providence (1722), Trinity Church in Newport (1698), St. Paul's in North Kingstown (1707), and St. Michael's in Bristol (1720).Register of the Records of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island at the University of Rhode Island Without sufficient resources to support a bishop of their own, they elected Samuel Seabury, who was bishop of Connecticut, to hold the office of bishop of Rhode Island as well. Under Rhode Island's third bishop, Alexander Viets Griswold, the Episcopal Church in Rhode Island expanded from 200 communicants in four parishes to almost 2,000 in seventeen parishes. This growth continued under the next two bishops, John P. K. Henshaw and Thomas M. Clark, and this trend was supported by the immigration of many English Anglicans. By the end of the 19th century, the diocese had grown to 35 parishes. In the first part of the 20th century, the Episcopal Church in Rhode Island focused on urban ministry with a focus on social concerns, led by Bishop William N. McVickar. The first deaconess was ordained in 1890, and from 1910 to 1914 the number of women serving in this position and ordained by Bishop James D. Perry had grown from one to seven. Under Perry and his successor, Gaylord G. Bennett, the number of parishes continued to grow. From 1955 to 1972, the diocese was led by John Seville Higgins, who started campus ministries and a number of other missions. Bishop Frederick H. Belden led the church through the transitions occasioned by the ordination of women to the priesthood, ordaining Jo-Ann J. Drake to the transitional diaconate in 1977 and to the priesthood in 1978, (Patrica A. Smith, ordained deacon by Bishop Belden in 1976, continued her studies for the priesthood and was ordained in 1980) and adoption of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer. Belden was succeeded by George Hunt, who served as bishop from 1980 to 1994. Hunt led a crusade for accountability by the state government on the issues of corruption, organized crime and gambling. He also insisted that the process for ordination in the diocese not discriminate against anyone on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. In 1996, Geralyn Wolf was consecrated, becoming one of the few women serving as a diocesan bishop. There are a few parishes with a sizable percentage of African-American parishioners, and some congregations that have become the spiritual homes for people who have fled the civil war in Liberia. There is an active Spanish speaking congregation in Central Falls and another in Cranston. Most congregations make a point of openly welcoming gay and lesbian members.

Early life He was the son of Nizam Khan, the younger brother of the Sultan Sher Shah Suri. Adil's sister, Bibi Bai, was married to Islam Shah Suri. His real name was Muhammad Mubariz Khan. He was responsible for the assassination of Firuz Shah Suri, the twelve-year-old son of Islam Shah Suri, in 1554. Then he ascended the throne as the last sultan of the united empire. He appointed Hemu as his Wazir. History In 1555, Adil's brother in law, Ibrahim Shah Suri of Agra, revolted. Adil Shah's army was defeated and he lost the throne of Delhi. Soon, the empire founded by Sher Shah was divided into four parts. As Delhi and Agra came under the rule of Ibrahim Shah Suri, only the territories from the vicinity of Agra to Bihar remained under Adil. Shamsuddin Muhammad Shah already declared independence of Bengal in 1554. But hostility did not end with the division of empire. Ibrahim Shah Suri was then defeated by Sikandar Shah Suri at Farah, 32 km from Agra, and thus lost the possession of Delhi and Agra. Then Ibrahim renewed his strife with Adil, but he was defeated by Hemu twice, once near Kalpi and again near Khanua. He took refuge in the Bayana fort, which was besieged by Hemu. Muhammad Shah of Bengal approached near Kalpi, Adil had to recall Hemu to Kalpi. Muhammad Shah was defeated and killed at Chhapparghatta near Kalpi. Adil captured Bengal and appointed Shahbaz Khan as the Governor. He made Chunar his capital. In 1557, Adil was defeated and killed in a battle with the Bengal Sultan Khizr Khan Suri, the son of Muhammad Shah.

Life √Ülnoth may have been prior in the Benedictine community founded in Odense as a daughter house of the Abbey at Evesham.L.

According to the Danish historian Hans Olrik, who wrote the biography of √Ülnoth in the first edition of the Danish biographical reference work Dansk biografisk lexikon, √Ülnoth came to Denmark and Odense about 1100; he there had compatriots called in earlier by King Eric for the new cathedral planned as the burial church for the slain King Canute, his older brotherOlrik, \\"√Ülnoth\\", Dansk biografisk lexikon, XIX, p. 341. (in other words at some point after the death of Canute in 1086). However, it has also been suggested that he came as early as 1085, accompanying relics of Saint Alban.See Abrams. Cf. Bernard Ward, \\"√Ülnoth\\", Catholic Encyclopedia (1907), who assumes the earlier date. Yet another range of possible dates, 1104-1117, for the Life of Saint Canute is mentioned by G√°bor Klaniczay, Holy Rulers and Blessed Princesses, p. 152 (footnote 144), with reference to Robert Folz, Les saints rois du moyen √¢ge en occident (Paris, 1984). Other than his origins in Canterbury, little is known about the life of √Ülnoth, with even the dates of his arrival in Denmark and when he wrote the 'Life and Passion of St Canute' being uncertain. There are hints at persecution from which √Ülnoth considered himself the object, possibly from a priest higher up in the hierarchy. According to Olrik, √Ülnoth shows familiarity with Denmark and Danish customs, but little sympathy for the Danes, and appears to hate the Normans who had caused him to leave his own country. Work When he had been in Denmark 24 years (perhaps between 1109 and 1122, depending on the date he can be assumed to have arrived in Denmark), he wrote his Latin Vita et Passio S. Canuti (English: Life and Passion of St Canute). Olrik calls it \\"one of the most important sources for the history of Denmark in the Middle Ages\\". According to Olrik, √Ülnoth is unusually frank as he, despite his awe of his hero, nevertheless hints at the faults of the violent king. He switches between prose and poetry in a way Olrik defines as typically Anglo-Saxon.Olrik. The legend is dedicated to King Niels, and is more generally written with the political purpose of supporting the claims of the dynasty of the sons of Sweyn Estridson.Abrams; Klaniczay, p. 152 f, 171.

It was dammed by the terminal moraine that now forms the spine of Long Island and Fishers Island. About 15,000 BP, the moraine dam that impounded Lake Connecticut failed; the outlet, known as The Race for its tidal rip currents, lies between the North Fork of Long Island and Fishers Island. For a time, much of the lake bed was exposed to wind-driven erosion: the cue is found in soundings that reveal regional unconformities in the sediment bed of Long Island Sound. The fore-edge lake formed by glacial meltwater expanded to be about the same size as present-day Long Island Sound; it may have been connected at times with similar freshwater lakes in Block Island Sound and Buzzards Bay, while sea level was low. The fairly shallow average depth of 78 feet (24 m) of today's Long Island Sound is the result of fine lake-bottom sediments deposited as glacial outwash slowed in Lake Connecticut. Suspended as rock flour, the fine sediments would have rendered Lake Connecticut a turquoise blue-green. The end of Lake Connecticut was marked by a series of intervals of salt water incursion after about 15,000 BP and subsequent refreshening, as rising sea levels and isostatic rebound of land depressed by the former weight of ice sheets adjusted to one another.

En route to his martyrdom in Rome, Ignatius wrote a series of letters which exemplify very early Christian theology, dealing with such topics as modification of the sabbath, promotion of the bishop, and critique of so-called \\"Judaizers\\". The term proto-orthodox Christianity or proto-orthodoxy was coined by New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman and describes the Early Christian movement which was the precursor of Christian orthodoxy. Ehrman argues that this group from the moment it became prominent by the end of the third century, \\"stifled its opposition, it claimed that its views had always been the majority position and that its rivals were, and always had been, 'heretics', who willfully 'chose' to reject the 'true belief'.\\" In contrast, Larry W. Hurtado argues that proto-orthodox Christianity is rooted in first-century Christianity.  Proto-orthodoxy versus other Christianities  According to Ehrman, \\"'Proto-orthodoxy' refers to the set of [Christian] beliefs that was going to become dominant in the 4th century, held by people before the 4th century.\\" Ehrman expands on the thesis of German New Testament scholar Walter Bauer (1877‚Äì1960), laid out in his primary work Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity (1934). Bauer hypothesised that the Church Fathers, most notably Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History, \\"had not given an objective account of the relationship of early Christian groups.\\" Instead, Eusebius would have \\"rewritten the history of early Christian conflicts, so as to validate the victory of the orthodox party that he himself represented.\\" Eusebius claimed that orthodoxy derived directly from the teachings of Jesus and his earliest followers, and had always been the majority view; by contrast, all other Christian views were branded as \\"heresies\\", that is to say, willful corruptions of the truth, held by small numbers of minorities. However, in modern times, many non-orthodox early Christian writings were discovered by scholars, gradually challenging the traditional Eusebian narrative. Bauer was the first to suggest that what later became known as \\"orthodoxy\\" was originally just one out of many early Christian sects (such as the Ebionites, Gnostics and Marcionists), that however was able to eliminate all major opposition by the end of the 3rd century, and managed to establish itself as orthodoxy at the First Council of Nicaea (325) and subsequent ecumenical councils. According to Bauer, the early Egyptian churches were largely Gnostic, the 2nd-century churches in Asia Minor were largely Marcionist, and so on. But because the church in the city of Rome was \\"proto-orthodox\\" (in Ehrman's terms), Bauer contended they had strategic advantages over all other sects because of their proximity to the Roman Empire's centre of power. As the Roman political and cultural elite converted to the locally held form of Christianity, they started exercising their authority and resources to influence the theology of other communities throughout the Empire, sometimes by force. Bauer cites the First Epistle of Clement as an early example of the bishop of Rome interfering with the church of Corinth to impose its own proto- orthodox doctrine of apostolic succession, and to favour a certain group of local church leaders over another.  Characteristics  According to Ehrman, proto-orthodox Christianity bequeathed to subsequent generations \\"four Gospels to tell us virtually everything we know about the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus\\" and \\"handed down to us the entire New Testament, twenty-seven books\\". Similar to later Chalcedonian views about Jesus, the proto-orthodox believed that Christ was both divine as well as a human being, not two halves joined together. Likewise they regarded God as three persons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; but only one God.: \\"In addition, the proto-orthodox victory conferred to Christian history a set... beliefs [that] include doctrines familiar to anyone conversant with Christianity: Christ as both divine and human, fully God and fully man. And the sacred Trinity, the three-in-one: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three persons, but only one God, the mystery at the heart of traditional Christian faith\\". Martyrdom played a major role in proto-orthodox Christianity, as exemplified by Ignatius of Antioch in the beginning of the second century. Imperial authorities arrested him \\"evidently for Christian activities\\" and condemned him as fodder for wild beasts. He expressed eagerness to die, expecting thus to \\"attain to God\\".: \\"One of his letters is addressed to the Christians of Rome, in which he urges them not to intervene in the proceedings, because he is eager to be devoured by the wild beasts: By suffering that kind of death he will 'attain to God'.\\". Following Ignatius, many proto-orthodox theorists saw it as a privilege to die for faith. In fact martyrdom became a way to tell the true believers from the heretics. If someone wasn't willing to die for what they believed, they were seen as not dedicated to the faith. Another facet of the faith was the structure of the church. It was common ‚Äì as it is today ‚Äì for a church to have a leader. Ignatius wrote several letters to several churches instructing them to let the leaders (usually the bishops) handle all the problems within the church. He exhorted Church members to listen to the bishops as they were the leaders: \\"Be subject to the Bishop as to the commandment‚Ä¶We are clearly obligated to look upon the bishop as the Lord himself ... You should do nothing apart from the bishop.\\" The role of the bishop paved the way for hierarchies in churches that we often see today. Another important aspect about proto-orthodox Christianity involves its views on Jews and Jewish practices. An important book for them was the Epistle of Barnabas, which taught that the Jewish interpretation of the Old Testament was improperly literal, while the Epistle offered metaphorical interpretations as the truth, such as on laws concerning diet, fasting, and the Sabbath, moreover, that the Old Testament was specifically written to presage the coming of Jesus, and that not only did Christ's covenant supersede the Mosaic covenant, but that \\"the Jews had always adhered to a false religion\\". Development of orthodox canon and Christology Ehrman's schematic model of four early Christian sects, including the proto-Orthodox. In order to form a New Testament canon of uniquely Christian works, proto-orthodox Christians went through a process that was complete in the West by the beginning of the 5th century. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, Egypt, in his Easter letter of 367,From Letter XXXIX listed the same twenty-seven New Testament books as found in the Canon of Trent. The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the Synod of Hippo Regius in North Africa (393); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419). To Ehrman, \\"Proto-orthodox Christians argued that Jesus Christ was both divine and human, that he was one being instead of two, and that he had taught his disciples the truth.\\" This view that he is \\"a unity of both divine and human\\" (the Hypostatic union) is opposed to both Adoptionism (that Jesus was only human and \\"adopted\\" by God, as the Ebionites believed), and Docetism (that Christ was only divine and merely seemed to be human, as the Marcionists believed), as well as Separationism (that an aeon had entered Jesus' body, which separated again from him during his death on the cross, as most Gnostics believed). For Ehrman, in the canonical gospels, Jesus is characterized as a Jewish faith healer who ministered to the most despised people of the local culture. Reports of miracle working were not uncommon during an era \\"in the ancient world [where] most people believed in miracles, or at least in their possibility.\\" Criticism The traditional Christian view is that orthodoxy emerged to codify and defend the traditions inherited from the Apostles themselves. Hurtado argues that Ehrman's \\"proto-orthodox\\" Christianity was rooted into first-century Christianity: > ...to a remarkable extent early-second-century protoorthodox devotion to > Jesus represents a concern to preserve, respect, promote, and develop what > were by then becoming traditional expressions of belief and reverence, and > that had originated in earlier years of the Christian movement. That is, > proto-orthodox faith tended to affirm and develop devotional and > confessional tradition [...] Arland HultgrenThe rise of normative > Christianity, Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1994. has shown that the roots of > this appreciation of traditions of faith actually go back deeply and widely > into first-century Christianity.

Career Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Mallory grew up in Mobile, Alabama, where her father operated a tugboat. She attended Murphy High School, and was working in the Lyric Theater as an usherette when the Ziegfeld Follies came to Mobile. Ziegfeld offered her a spot in his show. She eventually travelled to New York City where she made a strong impression in the Broadway production of the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931. Moving to Hollywood, she found employment with Fox Films and was cast in the film version of Dawn Powell's play Walking Down Broadway. This was the first sound film by Erich von Stroheim. He shared both screenwriting and directing credits and regarded Mallory as his discovery. The play told the story of a young unmarried woman involved in a love triangle who becomes pregnant. The finished film, however, strongly suggested a lesbian relationship between Mallory's character and the character played by ZaSu Pitts. Other sexual themes involving the character played by James Dunn were considered too daring. Fox executives brought in director Alfred L. Werker to drastically cut Von Stroheim's version and to shoot additional scenes. The film was finally released under the new title Hello, Sister! (1933) with little promotion and was not a success. Von Stroheim's original version was neither copyrighted nor released, and is considered lost.MSN Movies Hello Sister! Retrieved May 6, 2006. In 1932 her second completed film, Handle with Care, also co-starring James Dunn, was released and marked her debut. It was well received and Mallory was chosen as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars of 1932, but the extensive media publicity surrounding her WAMPAS recognition, was undermined by the poor reception given to Hello, Sister! when it was finally released. A tall blonde, Mallory was well regarded for her striking looks and was photographed by such photographers as George Hurrell. She also posed for risque lingerie photographs, and was painted nude by the pin-up artist Rolf Armstrong. She married James Cagney's lookalike brother William Cagney, an actor who later became a film producer for his brother. Over the next few years, Mallory played the lead in several \\"B\\" pictures, including the Rin Tin Tin feature The Wolf Dog (1933), and received top-billing in Carnival Lady (1934) and The Big Race (1934). On radio she worked with James Cagney in productions for Lux Radio Theatre.Audio Classics Archive - Lux Radio Theatre. Retrieved May 6, 2006.

She and William Cagney had two children, fraternal twins Jill and Stephan. She was married to actor Herbert Marshall from 1947 until her death from chronic throat disease at age 45 in Santa Monica, California, in 1958.

The LL group includes many of the most primitive ordinary chondrites, including the well-studied Semarkona (type 3.0) chondrite. However, most LL chondrites have been thermally metamorphosed to petrologic types 5 and 6, meaning that their minerals are homogeneous in composition and chondrule borders are difficult to discern.

It lies in the historic county of Merionethshire/Sir Feirionnydd, in the valley of the Afon Dulas. It is known principally as a railway junction on the historic Corris Railway, and is also the site of a small number of residential dwellings. Origins Maespoeth was where the horse-hauled Upper Corris Tramway from the slate quarries around Corris Uchaf met the main line (opened in 1859) of the Corris Railway coming from Aberllefenni. The place name, which translates as \\"Hot Field\\", is shared with a nearby house. Development of engine sheds The original engine shed shortly after its return to the Corris Railway in the 1980s, and before passenger services had resumed. The site was merely the meeting place of the two lines until 1878. In that year the Corris Railway Company identified Maespoeth as the site for its new engine shed, planned as part of the introduction of steam engines, which commenced operating later that year. Constructed in the vee of the two lines, the new shed held the railway's three steam locomotives and was equipped to handle all but the heaviest repairs to the locomotives and rolling stock. Immediately to the north of the engine shed is a small stream. At an unknown date a section of the stream was lined with slate and a wood-framed dunny or latrine was built over it to provide toilet facilities with constant running water. Although this remains in situ it is no longer used by railway staff. In the early 1920s the arrival of a fourth locomotive exceeded the capacity of the engine shed, and a small wooden building was built against the south wall of the engine shed and initially used to store one of the railway's original three locomotives. This building was later used to store carriages under repair. It disappeared in the early 1930s. A smaller stone building was later constructed to the south of the engine shed, and used as a stable and store for the Signals & Telegraph (S&T;) department. A wooden signal cabin with a stone chimney was built to protect the lever frame controlling the points and signals at the south end of the site. Much of the engineering machinery was removed after the line became part of the Great Western Railway in 1930, but the engine shed and associated structures survived the closure of the railway in 1948 and subsequently served as a winter working base for the Forestry Commission. Preservation The station yard at Maespoeth Junction, with the replacement signal box in the background. From 1966 onwards a group of volunteers has been working on the preservation of the Corris Railway's infrastructure. In 1981 the Maespoeth Junction site was returned to railway ownership under the auspices of the Corris Railway SocietySee references at Tourist Link Wales (expand article for reference). and the engine shed now once again serves its original purpose as a home for the railway's locomotives, and as its engineering headquarters. The engine shed is a Grade II listed building, and successfully attracted a large Heritage Lottery Fund grant to fund re-roofing of both the engine shed and the associated S&T; shed.Engine shed lottery funding announced. The original S&T; shed to the south of the engine shed also survives, now being used as a volunteer's mess and as a small museum. Originally this building was separate from the engine shed, but the space between the two has now been roofed to provide a toilet block. The original signal box did not survive, but a new signal box was built in the 1990s on the same site as the original. This now controls points and signals around the junction. In 2009 a large new carriage shed, largely built by volunteers from the Corris Railway Society, was opened on the east side of the site. This building is now the headquarters of the railway's passenger carriage construction programme, as well as being a base for the overhauling of freight and engineering vehicles. Passenger station The original railway did not have a passenger station at Maespoeth, although most up-trains halted there to take water from a pipe overhanging the track, fed from a slate water tank inside the engine shed, supplied via a cast iron pipe from a mountain stream several hundred yards away. The heritage railway has built a platform at Maespoeth and this currently serves as the southern terminus of the partially restored line. The station is still referenced as Maespoeth Junction, even though the Upper Corris Tramway no longer exists. The actual junction track work has been relaid, and rails have been relaid for the first hundred yards of the tramway's route, rising sharply to meet the neighbouring roadway. This last spur of the old tramway is still occasionally used as a facility for transferring engines and rolling stock to flatbed lorries for road transportation.

At the battle of Chhapparghatta in December 1555, Adil Shah and his Hindu general Hemu routed the Bengal forces and Muhammad Shah was killed. The following year, following the child-Emperor Akbar's absence from Delhi on a campaign, Hemu attacked and defeated the regent Tardi Beg Khan who fled the city. This was Hemu's 22nd successive victory in battle and rather than appoint Adil Shah as ruler he appointed himself ruler. Meanwhile, the Bengal throne had passed on to Ghiyasuddin Abul Muzaffar Bahadur Shah, son of the slain Muhammad Shah. After killing an ambitious uncle, Bahadur Shah marched against Adil Shah to avenge his father's murder.

History On July 25, 1838, approximately 14 months from the official opening of the Kapodistrian University of Athens, the Catholic priest Constantine Sargologos was granted, \\"on the order of the Ecclesiastic and Public Education of Royal Secretariat Territory\\", authorization for the founding of a primary school for boys. The new school was named after the patron saint of Athens, St. Dionysius the Areopagite, and functioned in Plaka. The St. Dionysius School had been working humbly until 1889, when the Catholic Bishop of Athens managed to expand its activities into both elementary and secondary education and the school was renamed \\"Lyc√©e L√©onin of St. Dionysius\\", in honor of Pope Leo XIII, who admired Greece and funded this project. In 1897, the school was transferred at 4 Sina Street in central Athens. Despite its accommodation in a fully equipped building, Lyc√©e L√©onin underwent a decline from 1897 until 1907. In order to save the school, the Catholic Bishop of Athens invited monks of the Marist Brothers to take over as they had successfully ran similar schools in Istanbul. After the Marist Brothers undertook the management of the school on September 15, 1907, the number of students was tripled. In 1916, Lyc√©e L√©onin expanded to Patras, and the \\"St. Andrew\\" School was founded, which functioned until the end of World War II in 1945. This had been the school of the President of the Hellenic Republic Costis Stephanopoulos. In October 1924 another campus opened in Patisia. It is known as Lyc√©e L√©onin de Patisia. When Greece joined the allied forces in World War II, the two schools stopped functioning. During the occupation and until April 1945, the Marist Brothers organized soup kitchens and prepared 3000 portions of food daily. In the beginning of the 1960s, as Lyc√©e L√©onin at Sina Street had already 700 students in primary and high school, the building was deemed insufficient and the construction of a new campus in Nea Smyrni was decided and was completed in September 1962. The new campus was inaugurated by the President of the French Republic Charles De Gaulle. In 1986, as all schools in Greece, Lyc√©e L√©onin became co-educational.

() is one of the largest food manufacturers and distributors in Israel. The group is owned (100%) by Nestl√© S.A. of Switzerland. Before it was acquired by Nestl√©, the company was publicly traded and listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. It was a constituent of the TA-25 Index. History In 1942, Eugen Propper and his partner merged Hadagan with two other factories - Assisit and Itrit - to create Osem. The name is taken from an ancient Jewish prayer.The story of Osem: A Nestle company Pasta produced by Osem In 1946, the company built its first factory in Bnei Brak, producing noodles. Seven years later, in 1953, upon a request by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, the company added its staple \\"rice- substitute\\" product ptitim. In 1964, Osem's snack factory was founded in Holon, and the company's main product was created - the peanut butter- flavoured Bamba. In 1970, the company started producing baked food in addition to introducing the Bissli snacks, which come in several flavours such as falafel, mesquite, BBQ, pizza, and onion. Osem also produces soup powders which now markets MSG-free versions of its soup mixes under a green label as opposed to the traditional red one. The company's main factory was built in 1976 in Petah Tikva, in which the company's administration offices, distribution centre, and the sauce factory are now found. Osem has acquired several smaller food companies and expanded their product lines, such as Froumine, Argal Bakery Shop, and Magdanot HaBait factory (where the cakes production line is found). Other products manufactured by Osem are Cheerios breakfast cereal and hummus.Nestle to buy out Israeli food maker Osem for about 840 million In 1995, Osem began to market Nestl√©'s products such as coffee, chocolate, and breakfast cereals. That year, Nestl√© acquired 10% of Osem's shares, followed by an additional 41% in 1997. All Osem products produced in Israel are produced under the kosher supervision of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and many are certified by the Edah HaChareidis. Production facilities and subsidiaries Osem factory, Modi'in The company holds a number of subsidiaries which make up the Osem Group. The company's subsidiaries include Sabra Salads, Tivall, Of Tov, Nestl√© Ice Creams, Beit Hashita, Asamim, Nestl√©-Purina, Materna Ltd. (51%), and Foodtec. In 2008, the company bought Tribe Mediterranean Foods Ltd., a Mediterranean food producer and distributor based in the United States. The group produces approximately 2,000 different products, divided into four main categories: room temperature food - snacks and pastries, room temperature food - other, chilled food, and frozen food. The group operates 10 different production facilities in Israel, and distributes its produce through its distribution centers. In 2007, the group completed the construction of a nationwide distribution and logistics center. In addition, the group exports its produce to Europe and the United States through its overseas subsidiaries: Osem U.K. Ltd. and Osem USA Inc.

(or Zugasti, 14 February 1773 ‚Äì 3 May 1809) was a Criollo Franciscan friar and revolutionary, who took part in early stages of the independence movement of Mexico. He is honored in Mexico as a martyr of the struggle for independence from Spain. Life Zugastegui was born in the region of Otumba, the son of Juan Zugasti and Ana Verduzco, both born in Spain. Feeling called to become a priest, he went to Mexico City to study theology, where he decided to enter the Order of Friars Minor. After his ordination as a Catholic priest, Zugastegui was committed to serve the people in the confessional. On afternoons that he was free, he would go to a cafe which was popular with the unemployed men of the city who wished to discuss the current events of the day. On 11 August 1808 he was vocal and vehement in his support of Mexican independence from the Spanish Empire and in support of the call for a national convention to discuss the establishment of a local government due to the seizure of the Spanish Crown by Napoleon. This step was opposed by the Audiencia Real, the legislative authority of the colony. The Viceroy, Jos√© de Iturrigaray, on the other hand, was in favor of the congress and had the support of the Criollos (locally born children of Spanish colonists) segment of the population. When Zugastegui's words were reported to the Alcalde (Chief Justice) of the Real Audiencia, he asked the Guardian of the Convent of San Francisco to have him confined while he prepared a report of the incident. The finalized report simply mentioned the imprudence on Zugastegui's part. With the growing crisis of the government in Spain, the friar was forgotten by the government, and he was soon allowed to the leave the friary again, with the goal of assisting the dying. After the military coup which deposed Iturrigaray, new comments made by Zugastegui criticizing the new viceroy, Pedro de Garibay, however, soon brought him back to the attention of the Audiencia. His accuser claimed that the friar was involved in plans by French forces to overthrow the Spanish government in New Spain. Based on this, the Alcalde had Zugastegui arrested in the middle of the night, so as to avoid attention. Without any judicial process, due to the panic by government authorities out of the political crisis in Spain, on 27 March 1809 he was judged guilty of agitating for independence and ordered deported to Spain. The judgement was approved by Vicetory Garibay on 15 April. He was then transported to Veracruz, together with the Mercedarian friar, Melchor de Talamantes, the author of the tract for independence which had led to the military coup. When they arrived, they were imprisoned in Fort San Juan de Ul√∫a to await transport to Spain. He fell ill from yellow fever while there and died in the early hours of 3 May. Upon being advised of Zugastegui's death, the Guardian of the Franciscan friary in Veracruz requested the body. It was buried in the sepulcher of the house.

As of 2010, the medical school admits 175 British students per year includes 20 students from overseas. Leicester was ranked 23rd in the UK among 31 medical schools in the 2015 Guardian University Guide.

Leicester Medical School is one of the few UK medical schools offering full-body cadaveric dissection.  Course  Leicester medical school offers MBChB degree courses in medicine, either as an undergraduate five-year course, or Health Sciences-graduate four-year course. Some students also adopt to take an intercalated BSc Honours Degree. Leicester Medical school is the first medical school in the UK to teach e-consultations to students. History The school was formed following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965‚Äì68) (which issued its report, popularly known as the \\"Todd Report\\" in 1968). The Commission estimated that by 1994 the UK would need to train more than 4500 doctors a year, and that this would need to be achieved by both increasing the numbers of medical students at existing medical schools, and by establishing a number of new medical schools. It recommended the creation of new medical schools at the Universities of Nottingham, Southampton and Leicester. In 2000, Leicester Medical School assisted the University of Warwick in the foundation of the Leicester-Warwick Medical School, combining Leicester's own school with a new institution based at the University of Warwick. The project was successful, and in 2007, the two institutions separated, creating Warwick Medical School, and recreating Leicester Medical School. In 2012, it was announced that Leicester Medical School was to be rebuilt. The ¬£42 million new build began in 2013, and is expected to be completed in 2015. The building will be used by its first cohort of medical students in September 2016. Medical School UCAS Visit Day, Saturday 16 April 2016 Professor Stewart Petersen said that the reason for this rebuild was \\"We want to attract the best medical students.

As the only remaining part of the Trondheim Tramway, it runs from the city centre at St. Olav's Gate, via the suburban area By√•sen to Lian. It is designated Line 9 (previously Line 1), and is served by six Class 8 articulated trams. After the closure of the Arkhangelsk tramway in 2004, it became the world's northernmost tramway system. The line was opened as the only private tramway in Trondheim by A/S Graakalbanen in 1924. At first it was built to Munkvoll, but extended to Ugla in 1925, and to Lian in 1933. Operations were taken over by the municipal Trondheim Trafikkselskap in 1972, but it was closed along with the rest of the tramway in 1988. In 1990, the private initiative AS Gr√•kallbanen opened the line, later known as Boreal Bane. Located at Munkvoll is the tramway museum and depot. Service The operating company Boreal Bane owns seven Class 8 trams out of the eleven delivered in 1984-85 for the then longer route. The trams are designated with numbers 90 to 100. Of the eleven delivered, Trams 93, 94, 95, 96, 97 and 99 remain in service. 91, 92, 98 and 100 have been scrapped, while 90 is out of service but remains at the depot. Four trams are required for the daily operation on the line on a fixed 15 minute headway, reducing to two trams running on a 30-minute headway in the evenings and the full day on Sundays. Heritage trams are available for chartered tours. History =Establishment= During the 1910s, Fjellseter close to the peak Gr√•kallen had been one of the main recreational areas for Trondheim. The necessary initiative was taken by Robert Millar, chief of marketing at Nordenfjeldske Dampskibsselskab. On 3 November, the first meeting was held, and Millar was chosen to lead an investigation committee. The company A/S Graakalbanen was founded on 6 September 1916, and Nils Christoffer B√∏ckman was elected chairman.Kjenstad, 1994: 12‚Äì17 There were two suggestions for the route. The first was made by engineer Ferdinand Bjerke, who worked for the Norwegian State Railways, on behalf of the company. The line would connect to the city tramway at Ilevolden after following the Ila Line for Torvet, and continue up By√•senveien as a street tram until Bergsli gate. Here it would continue in its own right-of-way, as a single track line up Nyveibakken, past Gamle √Ösvei to Bygrensen, Breidablikk, turning west at Hoem, Rognheim and to Munkvoll. From Munkvoll it would continue south of Kyvannet and north of Lianvannet and then again head north to Fjeldseter.Kjenstad, 1994: 17‚Äì19 The second suggestion was from the city planner, Trygve Thesen, in 1917. He proposed alternative routes. While the upper sections were identical or close to those of Bjerke, Thesen suggested making a large loop around Dyrborg, just west of Ila. This was expected to be the immediate growth area for the city, and would give an improved passenger base for the line. It would, however, increase the travel distance to the upper sections. The city planner presumed that the section within the city limit would be built by the municipal Trondhjems Elektricitetsv√¶rk og Sporvei, while the section in Strinda would be built by the new company. This would cost the city , while it would cost the company NOK 413,000.Kjenstad, 1994: 19‚Äì20 Graakalbanen was sceptical about the suggestion from Thesen, since they would have to rent instead of of track from the city; this would increase the leasing fees from NOK 7,000 to 12,000. The company was also afraid of passengers \\"leaking\\" off at Wullumsg√•rden south of the Dyrborg Loop, and walking to Ila. The Dyrborg suggestion would also increase the travel time from Torvet to Fjellseter from 36 to 57 minutes. However, the city planner's suggestion was cheaper (NOK 1,300,000 vs. NOK 1,630,000). B√∏chman recommended Bjerke's suggestion, and the board agreed. After the hotel at Fjellseter burnt down in 1917, the line was chosen to only terminate at Lian.Kjenstad, 1994: 22‚Äì20 At the same time the end terminal in the city centre was not yet determined. By terminating at Ilevolden, the company could choose any rolling stock, including the higher 1,200 V current used on the Ekeberg Line of Oslo. Should the trams continue they would need to use Trondheim Sporvei's 600 V, metre gauge and car width. However, Trondheim Sporvei had chosen to convert its system to wide cars at width. If the city chose to start the rebuilding of track from the current width, it would allow Graakalbanen to buy wide stock.Kjenstad, 1994: 28 Instead it was chosen to run the trams along the Ila Line to a new station at St. Olavs Gate. Here, the trams would have their recovery time, and return to the Ila Line along a loop through Dronningens gate. The loop was built by Trondheim Sporvei and cost the city NOK 54,000.Kjenstad, 2005: 78 =Construction= The first conveying started in 1917, and the following January the city engineer started construction, but this soon ended. In June 1919, the engineering company Gr√∏ndahl & Kj√∏rholt took over the work, planning to be finished to Lian by 1921. However, by June 1920, the rising prices resulted in the money being used up. At the same time it turned out that the rolling stock was too much more expensive than expected; ordering of rolling stock was therefore delayed. In 1921, no construction was done on the line. Not before Trondhjems og Stridens Sparebank issued a loan of NOK 1.6 million was it possible to continue construction. This was based on mortgaging all assets, as well as a NOK 500,000 guarantee from the city council. While work previously had been along the whole route, it was then only concentrated on the section Ila‚ÄìMunkvoll, where the depot would be located.Kjenstad, 1994: 26‚Äì31 Tracks were delivered from the Norwegian State Railways, who were replacing their 25 kg/m track on the Mer√•ker Line. The track length was . At the same time the company bought the truss bridge Funna Viaduct from the Mer√•ker Line, for installation on the Gr√•kallen Line; it was about 20 metres too short, and a temporary wooden span was built to cover this. At Munkvoll a brick transformer station was built along with a wooden depot with three tracks and capable of nine trams and trailers.Kjenstad, 1994: 31‚Äì32 Four trams and two trailers were ordered from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWa), with motors from Siemens. The GB Class 1 trams cost NOK 360,000, including some work trailers.Kjenstad, 1994: 34 The stock had bogies, were long and weighed , and had 4x .Aspenberg, 1995: 59 The chassis were delivered on 20 July 1924, while the motors came on 5 July. They were assembled at the Dalsenget Depot. Because of the wider bodies, all transport from the track at Ila to Dalsenget had to be done at night, so the trams would not meet other trams in the opposite track. The first test run was on 5 July, but failed due to a short circuit. A successful attempt was made on 9 July.Kjenstad, 1994: 34‚Äì38 The tracks were completed in March, but not until the trams were delivered could service start. The tramway was opened on 18 July 1924 at 18:00. Ordinary service started the next day. The first weekend there were thousands of people who wanted to see the new trams, and demand exceeded capacity. Soon ridership dropped considerably.Kjenstad, 1994: 34‚Äì43 =Expansion= Modern view of Munkvoll The initial service had departures once per hour. Trams left Munkvoll on the hour, and from St. Olavs gate on the half-hour. Weekend traffic was considerable, but ridership on weekdays was very limited. The management felt this was because Munkvoll was not close enough to the recreational areas of Bymarka, and proposed a quick expansion to Ugla. At the same time, the ticket price was set high compared to the city trams, at NOK 0.60 for adults. In 1924, there were 144.774 passengers.Kjenstad, 1994: 42‚Äì43 The first expansion would come the following year. Construction of the line to Ugla had started, and was opened on 30 May 1925. It had a tavern and duck pond to attract riders. A branch was also laid to Kyvannet, from which ice was transported to the city center to be sold. The company continued to lose money.Kjenstad, 1994: 43‚Äì49 Further expansions to Lian were also considered, but management was skeptical at having two destinations, since they would not create the necessary critical mass. Then the tavern and farm at Ugla burnt down in 1931, and the insurance company allowed the insurance money to be used for building at Lian. To finance the line extension, Graakalbanen decided to create a new company; A/S Ugla‚ÄìLian was organized in such a way that it would have no expenses, only income. A/S Ugla‚ÄìLian would build the line, and Graakalbanen would pay NOK 0.05 per passenger freighted on the line. Graakalbanen would cover all operating, maintenance and administrative expenses, even for the other company. Construction of the expansion was started in the autumn of 1932. The first test run was on 29 September 1933, and the line was taken into use on 28 October 1933. A number of recreational services grew up at Lian, including a ski jump and trotting in the winter, and bathing and rowing in the lake Lianvannet in the winter. Despite this, ridership grew slowly, but by 1937 it had passed the 1930-level.Kjenstad, 1994: 53‚Äì58 =War and growth= Original Munkvoll Depot to the right World War II would show the highest ridership on the line through history. With the rationing on petrol, soon only the electric trams operated. Cities without trams or trolleybuses were stuck without public transport. 1940 showed an increase to 884,000 passengers, and for the first time the company made a profit. Ridership continued to increase, with 1.2 million in 1941, and up to 2.16 million in 1945. Conductors had to be taken into use, and even women were employed. To save time on the route, the stations Ferstad, Kyvannet, Vestmarka and Herlofssonl√∏ypa were not served on the way up. In addition, an extra tram was operated from St. Olavs gate to Hoem.Kjenstad, 1994: 61‚Äì66 During the war it was difficult to get spare parts. Trams could operate with only three of four motors, and during night there could not be any lights on. Two working trailers were rebuilt as a single passenger trailer. In addition, the company chose to order a tram and trailer from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk in 1941. The GB Class 2 was put into service on 9 June 1943 and cost NOK 289,000. An additional two trailers were delivered in 1947, and in 1950 a motor arrived so the first trailer could be rebuilt to a tram.Kjenstad, 1994: 62‚Äì68 The high revenue during the war had given the company a large amount of cash, but also a worn down fleet. Each year, the profits were between NOK 143,000 and 430,000. During the war, the company A/S Ugla‚ÄìLian had been bought. With available cash, Graakalbanen started upgrading the infrastructure. Turning loops were built at St. Olavs gate and at Lian. In St. Olavs gate, a proper turning loop was not feasible, and in June 1946 a large loop that went down Dronningens gate for a block was opened. On 13 September 1947, the Lian loop was built, with a radius of only . At the same time, the small garage at Lian was expanded to house two instead of one wagons.Kjenstad, 1994: 71 On 18 July 1947, the first (and only) double track section of the dedicated right-of-way was built. Inspired by Oslo, where all the suburban lines had this, was rebuilt between Breidablikk and Nordre Hoem. This gave a lot better regularity, since the two trams could meet anywhere along the section, and thus both trams would not become delayed if one was. By 1949, all the track had been upgraded to 35 kg/m, and the speed could be increased from to .Kjenstad, 1994: 71‚Äì73 After the war, ridership stabilized at 1.7 million. At first the company operated with 30-minute headways, using trailers during the summer and in rush hour. Introducing 15-minute headways could not be done until six trams were available; so after the rebuilding of a trailer to a tram in 1950, the increased frequency was introduced. During the 1950s, the amount of recreational travel to Lian decreased, but this was compensated by increased traffic from new housing built along the line. By 1955, the commuter ridership exceeded the recreational ridership.Kjenstad, 1994: 75‚Äì76 With the delivery of the new trailers in 1947, the capacity of the depot exceeded the fleet, so one tram was always stored at Lian. A new depot was therefore built on the other side of the tracks at Munkvoll. Construction started in 1952, and finished the following year. It had five tracks; three had places for storage of six wagons, while two were for the workshop that could service two trams simultaneously.Kjenstad, 1994: 77 To supplement the aging stock, the GB Class 3 singe tram and trailer, from H√∏nefoss Karrosserifabrikk (H√∏ka) was ordered in 1954. Delivered in September 1955, it was put into service in December. Because of the increased traffic, a new signaling system was introduced in 1957, and a double track was built from Bergsli gate to Ila. This section had been causing problems for cars, since the trams would operate on the wrong side of the road. To allow a future 10-minute headway, a new signaling system was installed in 1958 up to Ugla. Up until then, tokens had been used to regulate traffic.Kjenstad, 1994: 77‚Äì89 =Integration= In 1960, the sale of cars was deregulated, and anyone could purchase a car. At the same time, Trondheim started a merger process with the neighbouring municipalities, and plans were made to build large suburbs far from the city centre, that would be depopulated, and connect the suburbs with motorways. A new four-lane highway along By√•senveien was opened in 1966. Traffic numbers fell rapidly, and the company needed to replace its aging fleet. Traffic patterns were also changing, since Lian to a greater extent was becoming a winter rather than summer destination. In 1963, Trondheim Sporvei rebuilt one of their trams so it could operate from Lade directly to Lian on holidays. In 1966, Graakalbanen was bought by the city, and Odd Hovdenak became director of both tram operators.Kjenstad, 1994: 90‚Äì97 After being taken into public ownership, the company had more money to spend. A new turning loop was built at Munkvoll, and a 10-minute headway was introduced from St. Olavs gate to Munkvoll, and a 20-minute headway to Lian. Prices were reduced, and 1967 showed a 10% ridership increase. The signalling was improved with fixed blocks, and only Munkvoll‚ÄìLian still used tokens. The rolling stock was painted the same yellow and blue, but the coat of arms used by Trondheim Sporvei were not used on Graakalbanen.Kjenstad, 1994: 97‚Äì99 Instead of purchasing new rolling stock for the Gr√•kallen Line, the city trams were to start operating on the line. However, there was a lack of material in Trondheim Sporvei, and not until 7 November 1966 could a TS Class 7 city tram be taken into use. This was supplemented with a trailer on 6 February 1967. Also, there was operated a direct route from Lian to Lade during the morning rush hour. In 1968, the company acquired five additional trams. However, Trondheim Sporvei had problems delivering the trams. With this deal in place, the oldest trams could be retired. However, from 30 June to 19 August 1968, Trondheim Sporvei needed the trams again, and the old Class 1 was back in service. The final run of the Class 1 in regular service was on 29 November 1968. From 19 May 1969 the trams lost their conductors.Kjenstad, 1994: 99‚Äì107 Graakalbanen was on 1 January 1972 merged with Trondheim Sporvei to form Trondheim Trafikkselskap.Kjenstad, 2005: 252 This would allow the service to run through the city centre, and connect with other routes. From 28 January 1978, the line was numbered as 1/5 and went on the route Voldsminde‚ÄìIlevolden‚ÄìMunkvoll‚ÄìLian, replacing former line 1. The terminus at St. Olavs gate was closed, and passengers were no longer offered a heated waiting room.Kjenstad, 1994: 110‚Äì111 After the 10-minute headway was introduced on 13 April 1975, the section Ugla‚ÄìLian developed into a bottle neck. Six trams were used to handle the route between Voldsminde and Lian. An accident that occurred on the bottle neck caused substantial damage, and a fixed block signaling system was installed on the whole line.Kjenstad, 2005: 270‚Äì271 =More expansion?= During the 1960s, the Gr√•kallen Line experienced a large ridership increase from the Halset area. From 1956 to 1971, Halset was built out with large apartment blocks. These were the only apartment blocks along the line, as most of the route was along housing. By 1970 there were 10,500 people living along the line, and half of them were in the Munkvoll/Halset area. Graakalbanen suggested building a loop around Halset; from Munkvoll, it would follow Selsbakkveien, Allette Beyers vei, A. Andreassens vei and back into the Gr√•kallen Line at Rognheim. Total distance would be , and would cost NOK 1.5 million. Ridership was estimated to increase to 1.2 million.Kjenstad, 1994: 107‚Äì108 The Norwegian Armed Forces were sceptical, and wanted the route moved. Instead a feeder bus was put into service by Trondheim Sporvei, but passengers had to pay for both the bus and the tram, so it only attracted 278 passengers. Instead it was suggested that a walk way should be built along Waldemar Aunes vei to Rognheim, shortening the walking distance from to , but this was never built. In 1969, Trondheim Sporvei applied for a bus concession on the route. Graakalbanen had a concession from 1952 to operate from Ugla to Hauk√•sen and Smistad, but had never started operation, and it was given to Trondheim Bilruter. Due to disagreements regarding whose concessions were being tampered with given a new route to Halset, Trondheim Bilruter received an extension of their concession from Havstad. From 21 November 1971, the Halset bus was in operation, served by two buses from Trondheim Bilruter, and one from Trondheim Trafikkselskap.Kjenstad, 1994: 108‚Äì109 In 1979, a new suggestion was launched. As part of a four-line network connecting all the major suburbs, a new route was proposed branching off from Munkvoll and running through Kystad, Stavsted, Kolstad to Heimdal. The route was too expensive, and was not passed.Aspenberg, 1995: 28 =Closing and reopening= During the 1980s there was a lot of political debate about the future of the tram in Trondheim, and in 1983 the city council decided to close down the Elgeseter Line, and keep only one line between Lian and Lade. At the same time 11 new trams were ordered and a new depot built at Munkvoll, costing over NOK 100 million. But in 1988 the city council changed their minds and closed the tramway in Trondheim. The tracks between St. Olav's Street and Lademoen were removed, but the tracks at Lade were kept, as were the tracks between St. Olav's Street and Lian. The latter was because enthusiasts had plans of operating veteran trams as a heritage railway. But fate had other plans for Gr√•kallbanen. The Trondheim tramway is one of only two in the world, along with the Cairo Tramway, to use the combination of metre gauge and 2.6 metre-wide cars. This made it practically impossible to sell the trams and finance the 20 new Scania buses that Trondheim Trafikkselskap needed to operate the bus route to Lian and Lade. In the end the 11 trams were not sold and instead a company owned by 1400 enthusiasts, AS Gr√•kallbanen, was created to operate the tram route on the only remaining line, that started in 1990. In 2004 Veolia Transport's division in Norway, Veolia Transport Norge, bought the company and have announced they will invest another NOK 10,7 million, after the purchase in improved infrastructure on Gr√•kallbanen. July 1, 2008 the company name changed from AS Gr√•kallbanen to Veolia Transport Bane AS. Since then the company was renamed Boreal Transport Bane AS in 2011, Boreal Transport Midt-Norge AS in 2012 and finally Boreal Bane AS in 2016. On August 3, 2019, the line got a new number following the introduction of the new metrobuss system in Trondheim. The designation as Line 1 was handed over to a metrobuss line (Ranheim-Sentrum- Kattem) and Gr√•kallbanen got a new designation as Line 9. Plans Gr√•kallbanen is working on a number of plans as of 2006. These include an extension of the line to the harbour area via Olav Trygvasons street and Trondheim Central Station. A short stretch from St. Olavs gate to nearby Prinsenkrysset, regarded as part of this plan, was given the green light in 2006, the building was supposed to start in 2009, when the Nordre Avlastningsvei (northern bypass) was due to open and supposedly relieve the city centre from car traffic. As of 2011 it has been decided to build the extension during the summer of 2012 when the city centre's main bus terminal is to be rebuilt (needs reference). At the same time the whole section of track within the city centre will be rebuilt to meet the requirements of increased traffic and to remedy years of neglect. It is stated by Gr√•kallbanen that they seek to modernize their fleet of six vehicles to low-floor, to allow wheelchair users to board the trams. However, as the current operation requires additional funding from the municipality, these plans are not currently financed. The municipality is to create a report on the funding of the line and its future projects. Furthermore, there have been several calls for an additional light rail scheme based upon the current railway lines running through the town. Lately, connecting this light rail project with Gr√•kallbanen to form a tram-train system have been suggested but the different track widths (Gr√•kallbanen uses and the NSB lines ) might be a problem. A connecting PRT system in town has also been suggested.

He amassed La Liga totals of 270 matches and two goals during 11 seasons, mainly with Villarreal (eight years). He also appeared in the competition with Tenerife and Levante, and had a brief abroad spell in England with Brentford. Football career =Early years= Venta was born in Pola de Siero, Asturias. After playing his early career with modest Spanish clubs he was bought in 1999 by Villarreal CF, but would spend the next three seasons with the farm team (CD Onda) and on loan stints. He made his La Liga debut in the latter predicament in the 2001‚Äì02 season, playing 29 league games for CD Tenerife who ranked second from bottom. =Villarreal / Levante= In 2002‚Äì03 Venta returned to Villarreal and went on to become a steady first-choice throughout the season. In the 2004‚Äì05 campaign he appeared in 32 matches, as the Valencian side achieved a club-high third place; he was subsequently named by Spain manager Luis Aragon√©s in his provisional 27-man squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but he did not make the final cut. In late April 2010, it was announced that both the 34-year-old Venta and Robert Pires would be leaving Villarreal. During three years he constantly fought for first-choice status with √Ångel L√≥pez, with both appearing in roughly the same number of games. In late August he signed for one year with Levante UD, returned to the top division after a two-year absence. Venta started in 25 of his 26 appearances in his second season, totalling 2,224 minutes of action as Levante finished sixth and qualified to the UEFA Europa League for the first time in its history. He did not have an offer to renew his expiring contract, however, and returned to Villarreal for a second stint. =Brentford= On 11 July 2013, aged 37, Venta moved abroad for the first time in his career, joining Football League One club Brentford on a one-year deal with an option to extend to a second season depending on appearances. He scored his only goal for the club in a 5‚Äì3 win against AFC Wimbledon for the season's Football League Trophy on 3 September, which also marked his fourth and final overall appearance; he had his contract terminated by mutual consent on the 30th, and returned to Spain for personal reasons.

Despite the title, it is based on H. P. Lovecraft's novella The Shadow Over Innsmouth rather than his earlier short story \\"Dagon\\" (1919). The film takes place in \\"Imboca\\", a Spanish adaptation of \\"Innsmouth\\".The shadow over Galicia: H.P. Lovecraft‚Äôs obsessions resurface in the film adaptation of Dagon (2001) The film marked the last role of Francisco Rabal who died two months before its release. The dedication, which appears before the end credits, reads: \\"Dedicated to Francisco Rabal, a wonderful actor and even better human being.\\" Plot Paul Marsh has a dream that he discovers a mermaid with razor-sharp teeth while scuba diving into a strange underwater building. Paul awakes on a boat off the shores of Spain, where he is vacationing with his girlfriend, Barbara, and their friends Vicki and Howard. A sudden storm blows their boat against some hidden rocks. Vicki is trapped below deck and Howard stays with her while Paul and Barbara take a lifeboat to the nearby deserted fishing village of Imboca. During their absence, an unseen creature from the deep attacks the two in the boat. On the shore, Barbara and Paul find no one about and venture into town until they eventually reach the church, where they find a priest. Barbara convinces him to help them, and the priest speaks with two fishermen at the docks, who volunteer to take either Paul or Barbara to the wreck. Despite Paul's misgivings, Barbara stays to try to find a phone in order to call the police and a doctor while Paul goes to help their friends. Vicki and Howard are mysteriously missing, however, and Paul is taken back to Imboca, where he is sent to the hotel that Barbara was supposed to have gone to. But she is missing as well and Paul is left to wait for her in an old, filthy hotel room, where he dreams of the mermaid again. His fitful rest is disturbed by a large gathering of strange, fish-like people approaching the hotel and he is forced to flee. He ends up in a macabre tannery full of human skins, where he discovers Howard's remains. He escapes the tannery by starting a fire and finds momentary safety with an old drunkard named Ezequiel, the last full- blooded human in Imboca. Ezequiel explains to Paul that, many years ago, the village fell on lean times. A fishing ship captain Orpheus Cambarro (based on captain Obed Marsh) convinced the locals to worship Dagon rather than God. Xavier's first offerings to Dagon brought Imboca enormous wealth in the form of fish and gold. This caused the locals to make him as high priest of the Church of Dagon and help him dismantled the local Catholic church and killed the priest to establish the church in Dagon's honor (based on Esoteric Order of Dagon). However, the wealth brought upon by Imboca from worshiping Dagon had the terrible price as Dagon demanded blood sacrifices and human women to breed with. These were, respectively, the fates of Ezequiel's father and mother who resisted Xavier's heretical practice. Over time, the people of Imboca eventually began to die off leaving only the half-fish/half-human offspring of Dagon and Dagon's offsprings themselves to settle in the village who would kidnap unexpected trespassers to sacrifice to Dagon while Ezequiel watched the village go to ruin and lamented the villagers' foolishness in worshiping a demon for short-lived prosperity. Paul begs Ezequiel to help him escape. Ezequiel relents and takes Paul to the Mayor's manor, so he can steal the town's only car. Ezequiel distracts some Imbocans long enough for Paul to slip inside, but he accidentally honks the horn while trying to hot-wire the engine. Forced to flee into the manor, Paul finds a beautiful woman named Uxia, the mermaid from his dreams. She saves him from discovery, but when he finds that she really is half-fish, he flees in horror, despite her pleas for him to stay. Paul narrowly escapes a horde of villagers in the car but ends up crashing. He is caught and thrown into a barn, where he is reunited with Vicki, Ezequiel, and Barbara. The three plan to escape, but the attempt is foiled. Having been raped and impregnated by Dagon, the traumatized Vicki kills herself. Paul and Ezequiel are separated from Barbara and end up in a butchery, where they are chained and given a chance to join the worship of Dagon. When they both refuse, Paul, apologizes to Ezequiel, who thanks Paul for helping him to remember his mother and father, who died resisting Dagon and the cult. He is flayed alive before Paul's eyes as they recite the 23rd Psalm together. Paul is saved by the appearance of Uxia, who informs him that he has no choice but to join them. He offers to stay with her in return for Barbara's release, but she insists that Barbara must stay and bear Dagon's child. When Paul seems to concede, Uxia tells the priest of Dagon to make arrangements for their marriage. After Uxia leaves, Paul escapes, killing the guards and the priest. He starts looking for Barbara, collecting a can of kerosene on the way. When he reaches the church, apparently intending to burn it down, he instead discovers a hidden passage that leads below ground to a ritual chamber. There a congregation of Imbocans watch Uxia prepare Barbara to be offered to Dagon; she is chained by her wrists and lowered nude into a deep pit leading to the sea. While the Imbocan congregation and Uxia call to Dagon, Paul attacks, dousing several villagers in kerosene and setting them on fire. He winches Barbara back out of the pit, but Dagon has already raped her and she pleads with him to kill her. Paul refuses and the monstrous Dagon himself grabs Barbara and tears her bodily (and bloodily) from the winch, claiming her as his new consort. The uninjured Imbocans assault Paul, but are halted by Uxia and a monstrously deformed Imbocan who is revealed to be Uxia's and Paul's father. Uxia explains that Paul's human mother escaped from Imboca years ago after being impregnated by his half-breed father, but now that Paul has returned, he will be her lover and they will dwell with Dagon forever. Trapped and shocked at the realization that he has been an abomination all along, Paul pours the last of the kerosene over his own body and attempts to set himself on fire. Uxia grabs him and dives into the water, where Paul sprouts gills. With no choice left and no chance to return to the human world, he follows Uxia down into Dagon's undersea lair where Barbara likely is now to dwell there for eternity.

Marjorie Baumgarten from Austin Chronicle gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"horror so extreme that it borders on camp\\", further stating that it was \\"hampered by some clunky scripting [...] and middling performances.\\" AllMovie gave the film a slightly positive review, writing, \\"Though it's not perfect, Lovecraft fans will most likely be willing to forgive Dagon's shortcomings in favor of a film that obviously shows great respect and appreciation for its source materials.\\" KJ Doughton of Film Threat rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"While not a perfect movie, Dagon crams its wild, over-the-top concepts down our throats with so much conviction that we can't help but get swept along for the ride.\\" Scott Tobias from The A.V. Club gave the film a mostly positive review, commending the film's first half, which he felt \\"came alive\\" through its suggestive gothic ambiance. and \\"well- placed jolts of violence\\". However, Tobias criticized the film's third act, which he felt downplayed the film's \\"distinctive flavor to ritualized nudity and gore\\". Ain't It Cool News gave the film a positive review, praising the film's atmosphere, tone, setting, and darker themes when compared to other adaptions of the author's works. HorrorNews.net criticized the film's low- budget special effects, and occasionally \\"hammy\\" acting. However, the reviewer concluded by stating, \\"Dagon comes across with a low budget, but it has a big heart and kind of a big bite to go with it.\\" Nick Hartel from DVD Talk praised the film, calling it director Gordon's all-time best work, and the best Lovecraft adaption. Reviewing the 2007 film Cthulhu, another adaptation of Lovecraft's story, Nick Pinkerton of LA Weekly stated that Dagon remained the better adaption of the story. In their book Lurker in the Lobby: The Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write that \\"Gordon nicely creates the decayed humanity of Lovecraft's Innsmouth\\" but also that the film's \\"relentlessness\\" is \\"draining and numbing.\\" They conclude: \\"Dagon is a dark story well told, but for some Lovecraft lovers, it may be a fish that should have gotten away.\\" References External links  Stuart Gordon Interview at Acidlogic.com 2001 films 2001 horror films Cthulhu Mythos films Dark fantasy films English-language films Films based on works by H.

It was previously considered a subspecies of Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii, formerly Bufo woodhousii).Fowler's Toad. Natural Resources Canada. Etymology The specific name, fowleri, is in honor of naturalist Samuel Page Fowler (1800‚Äì1888) from Massachusetts, who was a founder of the Essex County Natural History Society, which later became the Essex Institute.Dodd, C. Kenneth. (2013). Frogs of the United States and Canada. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 1,032 pp. (in two volumes). . Description Fowler's toad is usually brown, grey, olive green and rust red in color with darkened warty spots. If the toad has a pale stripe on its back it is an adult. The belly is usually uniformly whitish except for one dark spot. The male may be darker in overall color than the female. The adult toad is typically in head-body length. The tadpole is oval with a long tail and upper and lower fins, and is long. Reproduction Fowler's toad reproduces in warmer seasons of the year, especially in May and June. It breeds in open, shallow waters such as ponds, lakeshores, and marshes. The male produces a call which attracts not only females, but also other males. The calling male may attempt to mate with one of the other males, which will then produce a chirping \\"release call\\", informing him of his mistake. When he finds a female, the pair will initiate amplexus and up to 7,000 to 10,000 eggs are fertilized. They hatch in 2 to 7 days. Based on observations, Fowler's toads breed repeatedly through the spring. As many as 10 different age classes, separated by several days, have been observed over the course of a breeding season in one small pond. A new tadpole may reach sexual maturity in one season, but the process may take up to three years. Behavior Predators of Fowler's toad include snakes, birds, and small mammals. It uses defensive coloration to blend into its surroundings. It also secretes a noxious compound from the warts on its back. The secretion is distasteful to predators and can be lethal to small mammals. The toad is also known to play dead. Habitat Fowler's toad lives in open woodlands, sand prairies, meadows, and beaches. It burrows into the ground during hot, dry periods and during the winter. Diet The adult Fowler's toad eats insects and other small terrestrial invertebrates, but avoids earthworms, unlike its close relative, the American toad (Anaxyrus americanus). The tadpole scrapes algae and bacterial mats from rocks and plants using the tooth-like structures in its mouth. In Missouri Ozarks Conservation status An important conservation measure for Fowler's toad is the protection of its breeding sites. Off-road vehicles commonly used in beach and dune habitats are damaging to this species. Agricultural chemicals have caused declines in some areas. It is considered a species at risk in Ontario.

At a special meeting on January 22, 1902, Alexander Hamilton Vinton, Rector of All Saints Church in Worcester, Massachusetts, was elected first diocesan bishop. The first two Anglican parishes in what would become the diocese were started in Great Barrington in 1762 and Lanesborough in 1767 on the Housatonic River, at first served by priests from the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut.

In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, \\"the action selection problem\\" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats‚Äîartificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment. The term is also sometimes used in ethology or animal behavior. One problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an \\"act\\". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from contracting a muscle cell to provoking a war. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed. Most researchers working in this field place high demands on their agents: * The acting agent typically must select its action in dynamic and unpredictable environments. * The agents typically act in real time; therefore they must make decisions in a timely fashion. * The agents are normally created to perform several different tasks. These tasks may conflict for resource allocation (e.g. can the agent put out a fire and deliver a cup of coffee at the same time?) * The environment the agents operate in may include humans, who may make things more difficult for the agent (either intentionally or by attempting to assist.) * The agents themselves are often intended to model animals or humans, and animal/human behaviour is quite complicated. For these reasons action selection is not trivial and attracts a good deal of research.  Characteristics of the action selection problem  The main problem for action selection is complexity. Since all computation takes both time and space (in memory), agents cannot possibly consider every option available to them at every instant in time. Consequently, they must be biased, and constrain their search in some way. For AI, the question of action selection is what is the best way to constrain this search? For biology and ethology, the question is how do various types of animals constrain their search? Do all animals use the same approaches? Why do they use the ones they do? One fundamental question about action selection is whether it is really a problem at all for an agent, or whether it is just a description of an emergent property of an intelligent agent's behavior. However, if we consider how we are going to build an intelligent agent, then it becomes apparent there must be some mechanism for action selection. This mechanism may be highly distributed (as in the case of distributed organisms such as social insect colonies or slime mold) or it may be a special-purpose module. The action selection mechanism (ASM) determines not only the agent's actions in terms of impact on the world, but also directs its perceptual attention, and updates its memory. These egocentric sorts of actions may in turn result in modifying the agent's basic behavioural capacities, particularly in that updating memory implies some form of machine learning is possible. Ideally, action selection itself should also be able to learn and adapt, but there are many problems of combinatorial complexity and computational tractability that may require restricting the search space for learning. In AI, an ASM is also sometimes either referred to as an agent architecture or thought of as a substantial part of one.  AI mechanisms  Generally, artificial action selection mechanisms can be divided into several categories: symbol-based systems sometimes known as classical planning, distributed solutions, and reactive or dynamic planning. Some approaches do not fall neatly into any one of these categories. Others are really more about providing scientific models than practical AI control; these last are described further in the next section. = Symbolic approaches = Early in the history of artificial intelligence, it was assumed that the best way for an agent to choose what to do next would be to compute a probably optimal plan, and then execute that plan. This led to the physical symbol system hypothesis, that a physical agent that can manipulate symbols is necessary and sufficient for intelligence. Many software agents still use this approach for action selection. It normally requires describing all sensor readings, the world, all of ones actions and all of one's goals in some form of predicate logic. Critics of this approach complain that it is too slow for real-time planning and that, despite the proofs, it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to logic is a process prone to errors. Satisficing is a decision- making strategy which attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than identify an optimal solution. A satisficing strategy may often, in fact, be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus. Goal driven architectures ‚Äì In these symbolic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. Each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. The agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. The plan can expand to subgoals, which makes the process slightly recursive. Technically, more or less, the plans exploits condition-rules. These architectures are reactive or hybrid. Classical examples of goal driven architectures are implementable refinements of belief-desire-intention architecture like JAM or IVE. = Distributed approaches = In contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one \\"box\\" in the agent which decides the next action. At least in their idealized form, distributed systems have many modules running in parallel and determining the best action based on local expertise. In these idealized systems, overall coherence is expected to emerge somehow, possibly through careful design of the interacting components. This approach is often inspired by artificial neural networks research. In practice, there is almost always some centralised system determining which module is \\"the most active\\" or has the most salience. There is evidence real biological brains also have such executive decision systems which evaluate which of the competing systems deserves the most attention, or more properly, has its desired actions disinhibited. * is an attention-based architecture developed by Rony Novianto.Samsonovich, A. V. \\"Attention in the ASMO cognitive architecture.\\" Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (2010): 98. It orchestrates a diversity of modular distributed processes that can use their own representations and techniques to perceive the environment, process information, plan actions and propose actions to perform. *Various types of winner-take-all architectures, in which the single selected action takes full control of the motor system * Spreading activation including Maes Nets (ANA) * Extended Rosenblatt & Payton is a spreading activation architecture developed by Toby Tyrrell in 1993. The agent's behaviour is stored in the form of a hierarchical connectionism network, which Tyrrell named free-flow hierarchy. Recently exploited for example by de Sevin & Thalmann (2005) or Kadleƒçek (2001). * Behavior based AI, was a response to the slow speed of robots using symbolic action selection techniques. In this form, separate modules respond to different stimuli and generate their own responses. In the original form, the subsumption architecture, these consisted of different layers which could monitor and suppress each other's inputs and outputs. * Creatures are virtual pets from a computer game driven by three-layered neural network, which is adaptive. Their mechanism is reactive since the network at every time step determines the task that has to be performed by the pet. The network is described well in the paper of Grand et al. (1997) and in The Creatures Developer Resources. See also the Creatures Wiki. = Dynamic planning approaches = Because purely distributed systems are difficult to construct, many researchers have turned to using explicit hard-coded plans to determine the priorities of their system. Dynamic or reactive planning methods compute just one next action in every instant based on the current context and pre- scripted plans. In contrast to classical planning methods, reactive or dynamic approaches do not suffer combinatorial explosion. On the other hand, they are sometimes seen as too rigid to be considered strong AI, since the plans are coded in advance. At the same time, natural intelligence can be rigid in some contexts although it is fluid and able to adapt in others. Example dynamic planning mechanisms include: * Finite-state machines These are reactive architectures used mostly for computer game agents, in particular for first- person shooters bots, or for virtual movie actors. Typically, the state- machines are hierarchical. For concrete game examples, see Halo 2 bots paper by Damian Isla (2005) or the Master's Thesis about Quake III bots by Jan Paul van Waveren (2001). For a movie example, see Softimage. * Other structured reactive plans tend to look a little more like conventional plans, often with ways to represent hierarchical and sequential structure. Some, such as PRS's 'acts', have support for partial plans. Many agent architectures from the mid-1990s included such plans as a \\"middle layer\\" that provided organization for low-level behavior modules while being directed by a higher level real- time planner. Despite this supposed interoperability with automated planners, most structured reactive plans are hand coded (Bryson 2001, ch. 3). Examples of structured reactive plans include James Firby's RAP System and the Nils Nilsson's Teleo-reactive plans. PRS, RAPs & TRP are no longer developed or supported. One still-active (as of 2006) descendant of this approach is the Parallel-rooted Ordered Slip-stack Hierarchical (or POSH) action selection system, which is a part of Joanna Bryson's Behaviour Oriented Design. Sometimes to attempt to address the perceived inflexibility of dynamic planning, hybrid techniques are used. In these, a more conventional AI planning system searches for new plans when the agent has spare time, and updates the dynamic plan library when it finds good solutions. The important aspect of any such system is that when the agent needs to select an action, some solution exists that can be used immediately (see further anytime algorithm). = Others = * CogniTAO is a decision making engine it based on BDI (belief-desire-intention), it includes built in teamwork capabilities. * Soar is a symbolic cognitive architecture. It is based on condition-action rules known as productions. Programmers can use the Soar development toolkit for building both reactive and planning agents, or any compromise between these two extremes. * Excalibur was a research project led by Alexander Nareyek featuring any-time planning agents for computer games. The architecture is based on structural constraint satisfaction, which is an advanced artificial intelligence technique. * ACT-R is similar to Soar. It includes a Bayesian learning system to help prioritize the productions. * ABL/Hap * Fuzzy architectures The Fuzzy approach in action selection produces more smooth behaviour than can be produced by architectures exploiting boolean condition-action rules (like Soar or POSH). These architectures are mostly reactive and symbolic.  Theories of action selection in nature  Many dynamic models of artificial action selection were originally inspired by research in ethology. In particular, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen provided the idea of an innate releasing mechanism to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). Influenced by the ideas of William McDougall, Lorenz developed this into a \\"psychohydraulic\\" model of the motivation of behavior. In ethology, these ideas were influential in the 1960s, but they are now regarded as outdated because of their use of an energy flow metaphor; the nervous system and the control of behavior are now normally treated as involving information transmission rather than energy flow. Dynamic plans and neural networks are more similar to information transmission, while spreading activation is more similar to the diffuse control of emotional / hormonal systems. Stan Franklin has proposed that action selection is the right perspective to take in understanding the role and evolution of mind. See his page on the action selection paradigm. = AI models of neural action selection = Some researchers create elaborate models of neural action selection.

They are named for their resemblance to beehives, teepees or wigwams. A sawdust burner is cylindrical. They have an opening at the top that is covered with a steel grill or mesh to keep sparks and glowing embers from escaping. Sawdust and wood scraps are delivered to an opening near the top of the cone by means of a conveyor belt or Archimedes' screw, where they fall onto the fire near the center of the structure. Teepee or beehive burners are used to dispose of waste wood in logging yards and sawdust from sawmills by incineration. As a result, they produce a large quantity of smoke and ash, which is vented directly into the atmosphere without filtering, contributing to poor air quality. The burners are considered to be a major source of air pollution and have been phased out in most areas. There are a few beehive burners remaining in Western Canada. Teepee burners went out of general use in the Northwestern United States in the early 1970s, and are prohibited from operation in Oregon, as well as southwestern Washington state.http://www.swcleanair.org/regs/SWCAA_400_Nov15_2009.pdf The wood waste is now used as a component in various forest products, such as pellet fuel, particle board and mulch.

In a major fire in late 1984, the house, a grade II listed building, was badly damaged, but was subsequently restored to its current condition. The house re-opened to pupils in 1987. In 1943 the house was sold to Gosport Borough Council, and the 17 acres of parkland were donated to the people of the borough. Following World War II, the house became Gosport County Grammar School. The school was renamed Bay House School in 1972. The school has developed significantly since this time, including introducing a Sixth Form to the Gosport Area. Teachers The school has roughly 250 teachers. Some of the teachers appeared on the BBC Two quiz show Eggheads. In March 2010, the assistant head teacher, Jim Wood, told an education seminar in Portsmouth that school teachers should act like Dirty Harry.Telegraph March 2010 . Telegraph.co.uk (10 March 2010).

The Maitreya Project is an international organisation, operating since 1990, which intends to construct statues of Maitreya Buddha in India and perhaps elsewhere. Initial plans were for a 152-metre (500 ft) colossal statue, to be built in either Kushinagar or Bodhgaya. These plans have since changed, and the Maitreya Project now intends to construct relatively modest statues in both towns. The project was initiated by the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, an organisation within the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Laying of the foundation stone in Kushinagar Maitreya Project Relic Roadshow. On Friday 13 December 2013 the State Government of Uttar Pradesh handed over approximately of land for the site of the Maitreya Project in Kushinagar. The land is immediately adjacent to the Parinirvana Temple denoting the place where Buddha Shakyamuni passed into Parinirvana, and the Rambhar Stupa which marks the holy site of Buddha‚Äôs cremation. On that same day, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, presided over a foundation stone laying ceremony on this land.

Criticism There has been criticism in the press about some aspects of the Project, including the compulsory acquisition, under \\"India's Land Acquisition Act\\", by the State Government of of private land, homes and small farms; which are intended to be leased to the Project, for construction of the statue and related infrastructure, including \\"landscaped park housing a cathedral, monastery, convent, guesthouse, library and food halls...\\".

Following the 1,262nd day of \\"peaceful dharna\\", in August 2010, by the majority of local farmers against the compulsory acquisition of their farms, the Cabinet Secretary of Uttar Pradesh announced a reconsideration of support for the Project.

Rosenbloom (born 1943) is a well-known scholar in the field of Public Administration. He is the Distinguished Professor of Public Administration at the School of Public Affairs at American University in Washington, D.C., and is currently serving as chair professor of public management, City University of Hong Kong. A noted authority on issues related to administrative law and public sector personnel policies, Rosenbloom is widely known for his approach to the field which stresses understanding American public administration from three perspectives mirroring the constitutional separation of powers: law, politics and management. In pursuit of that view, he has become a leading advocate for establishing \\"constitutional competence\\" as a basic standard for public service professionals. Education Rosenbloom earned a BA in political science at Marietta College in 1964. He holds a Master of Arts (1966) and in PhD (1969) in political science, both at the University of Chicago. His master's thesis was titled ‚ÄúIndividual Liberty versus National Security: A Critical Analysis of the Opinions of Judges E. Barrett Prettyman and Henry W. Edgerton on the Loyalty Program for Federal Civil Servants.‚Äù His Ph.D. dissertation, \\"The Relationship Between the Citizen and the State In Public Employment in America,‚Äù was the basis for his first book, Federal Service and the Constitution: The Development of the Public Employment Relationship (1971). He received an honorary doctorate of law in 1994, also from Marietta College. Career Rosenbloom has served as an assistant professor in political science at the University of Kansas from 1970 to 1971. From 1971 to 1973, he visited Tel Aviv University, where he guest-lectured in the field of political science. From 1973 to 1978, he was an associate professor of political science at the University of Vermont. From 1978 to 1990, he attended The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, where he held a number of titles. He was professor of public administration from 1979 to 1988. Additionally, he was appointed as professor of political science from 1987 to 1990. He was also an adjunct professor of law from 1985 to 1989. Lastly at the Maxwell School, he was distinguished professor of public administration from 1988 to 1990. Presently, in addition to being a distinguished professor at American University, he is the chair professor of public management in the Department of Public and Social Administration, at the City University of Hong Kong (visiting). In 2014, he served as book series editor for the American Society for Public Administration indicating that the disability fields do not constitute a categorical system of state agencies and services in the US.Racino, J. (2014). \\"Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US\\". London & NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor. =Research= Rosenbloom is perhaps best known for coming up with three approaches that define the American foundation of Public Administration: the managerial, political, and legal. *Managerial- The Managerial foundation is used to manage the performance of organizations so that they will be successful. Key areas include administrative decision-making, managerial techniques, leaders, and employee contributions. By these elements working together, organizations are able to operate successfully. *Political- The Political approach discusses how the political officials oversee the different administrative decisions. Politicians have the final say on the laws that public administrators are tasked with executing. Within Rosenbloom's editorial \\"Have an Administrative Rx? Don't Forget the Politics!\\" he writes about the Politics/Administration Dichotomy ‚Äì a principle stating that politics and administration should remain separate in the public sector which was developed by the Civil Service Reforms of the 1870s and the 1880s. According to this article, the idea that public administration can be separated from politics is strange. He believes that if politics and public administration were separate, this approach would not work, emphasizing their inevitable interconnection. *Legal- The Legal approach was, according to Rosenbloom, the most crucial. The Rule of Law involves orderliness, comprehension, and spells out when and how tasks will be completed. Rosenbloom argues that in order to carry out their tasks, public administrators must be competent in their legal and constitutional obligations and restrictions. Rosenbloom's argument is that to understand public administration, it is not sufficient enough to use just one of the approaches, but to think of all three at the same time. Rosenbloom documents that in 1946, by making major reforms, Congress became the central authority in how public administration operated in the federal government, incorporating all three approaches. Rosenbloom argues that public administration at other levels should operate in the same way. =Organizations= *Stream Leader, Public Policy and Management, Department of Public and Social Administration, City University of Hong Kong, 2009‚Äì2010. *He was the acting chair of the Department of Public Administration and Policy at American University from 2005 to 2006. *He was the chair of the American University Faculty Senate, from 2004 to 2005. *He was on the board of trustees at Marietta College from 2003 to 2009, and was a life associate trustee in 2009. *He has been a member of the academic advisory board of Partnership for Public Service since 2003. *He was a member of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Graduate Scholarship Program Review Panel from 2003 to 2008. *He was an appointed member of the Clinton-Gore Transition U.S. Presidential Transition, from 1992 to 1993. *He received a fellow from the Government Operations Cluster for U.S. Office of Personnel Management. *He was elected to the National Academy of Public Administration in 1986. =Awards and honors= Rosenbloom has been the recipient of many awards during his career.

They released one album on Elektra Records before singer Kerrilee Male left to be replaced by Dorris Henderson, but the group broke up in December 1969. Formation and initial reception Rosen and Hultgreen met when Hultgreen - who had grown up in Canada - was playing songs in a Bayswater restaurant. They decided to form a group, and recruited Lucas, who had previously recorded in Australia, and in Britain as an accompanist to A. L. Lloyd, after seeing him perform at the 1967 Cambridge Folk Festival. Lucas in turn recommended Kerrilee Male, who had previously worked as a singer with Dave Guard, formerly of The Kingston Trio, on his Australian TV show Dave's Place. The four rehearsed together and acquired the name Eclection - a back- formation to describe their \\"eclectic\\" style and origins - at the suggestion of Joni Mitchell, who was playing folk clubs in England at the time and who was a friend of Rosen's girlfriend. On a visit to New York City, the group approached Elektra Records owner Jac Holzman, who then heard them rehearse in London, and offered them a record deal. The quartet made their first public appearance at the Royal Festival Hall in late 1967, supporting Tom Paxton.Mick Houghton (ed.), Liner notes for Forever Changing: The Golden Age of Elektra Records 1963-1973, p.34 The group then added drummer Gerry Conway, a member of Alexis Korner's backing group. Despite their backgrounds, the band regarded themselves as being a \\"progressive rock\\" group rather than playing \\"folk rock\\", a term which had not yet come into widespread use. They began recording at IBC Studios in London in December 1967, with Australian record producer Ossie Byrne and arranger Phil Dennys, who had both worked on The Bee Gees' first hit \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\". The songs were recorded as rehearsed, with vocal harmonies and ornate orchestral arrangements overdubbed later. The band released their first single, \\"Nevertheless\\", written by Rosen, in June 1968; it received some airplay in the UK but did not chart. They also appeared on Dutch TV, BBC radio, and the BBC TV show Colour Me Pop. The band's self-titled album, Eclection, was released in August 1968. Eight of the songs were written by Hultgreen, and the remaining three by Rosen. Hultgreen and Rosen also shared the lead vocals with Kerrilee Male, although most critics commented on the strength of Male's voice, Lillian Roxon stating that \\"Her voice cuts into the brain like a carving knife\\". The band's style drew comparisons with The Seekers, Jefferson Airplane, The Mamas and The Papas and We Five. Reviewer Richie Unterberger stated: \\"The combination of male-female harmonies, optimistic lyrics with shades of romantic psychedelia, folk-rock melodies, acoustic-electric six- and twelve-string guitar combinations, and stratospheric orchestration couldn't help but bring to mind similar Californian folk-pop-rock of the mid-to-late 1960s.\\" Kajanus (Hultgreen) later said: > \\"The musical direction of the group was probably closer to American folk- > rock than anything else. I must confess, having spent my formative musical > years haunting the folk clubs in Montreal, Canada and watching all the > current folk and folk/rock programs on TV, I was strongly influenced by this > music. The most influential artists for me at the time were people like > Dylan, the Byrds, Fred Neil, Simon and Garfunkel, the Beach Boys, the Mamas > and the Papas, and Gordon Lightfoot. Pre-Eclection, I was a purist fighting > the acoustic battle versus the electric \\"demons\\" creeping into the scene. I > remember being shocked when Dylan went electric. It is therefore ironic that > I should end up a few years later playing an electric 12-string in > Eclection.\\" Later career and split After the album was released, the band began to perform at festivals and in clubs around Britain. Their second single, a version of American band Kaleidoscope's song \\"Please (Mark II)\\", was released in October 1968. However, that month Kerrilee Male decided to leave the band, and returned to Australia. Gerry Conway said: \\"Once we started playing live, it was very soon apparent that Kerrilee didn't want to stay with it. I think she decided she didn't want to be in the music world.\\" The band immediately replaced her with Dorris Henderson, an African-American singer who had moved to Britain, performed in folk clubs, and recorded a 1965 album with John Renbourn. The single was re-recorded with Henderson's vocal replacing Male. In December 1968, Eclection supported The Beach Boys on a 10-day tour, and afterwards they continued to tour clubs. Mike Rosen left the band in March 1969, and the band recruited guitarist Gary Boyle, previously a member of The Brian Auger Trinity, and vibraphone player John \\"Poli\\" Palmer of Blossom Toes. However, Boyle left again in June to rejoin Auger. The band continued as a five-piece and performed (along with Bob Dylan and The Who) at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1969, but Hultgreen then decided to leave. Lucas, Conway, Palmer and Henderson continued to tour for several months, finally agreeing to split up in December 1969 when Palmer decided to join Family. Conway said: \\"We just decided, eventually, that we weren't really going anywhere. Not where we wanted to go, anyway.\\" Jac Holzman stated: > \\"I loved that group. They were a fascinating group, a wonderful band, and I > thought the records were wonderful. I think our mistake was not bringing > them to the States, because they really needed to get out of England. There > was too much other stuff competing in England, and in the States, we might > have had an easier time. I don't know why we didn't bring 'em. I think, had > we got 'em the right venues and gotten them some help with their show, it > would have worked.\\" Aftermath After Eclection split up, Lucas and Conway formed Fotheringay with Lucas' girlfriend (and later wife) Sandy Denny, formerly of Fairport Convention. Lucas and Denny later both rejoined Fairport Convention for a period; Sandy Denny died in 1978, and Trevor Lucas in 1989. Gerry Conway continued a prolific career as a drummer, with Cat Stevens, Steeleye Span, Fairport Convention, Jethro Tull and others. Georg Hultgreen was later known as Georg Kajanus, and had commercial success in the mid-1970s with the band Sailor, later forming DATA and Noir with Tim Dry (Tik from Tik and Tok), and writing musicals and soundtracks. Mike Rosen managed the progressive rock band Cressida, and was later a member of Mogul Thrash, before returning to live in Canada. Little is known publicly about Kerrilee Male after her return to Australia. Dorris Henderson headed a new band, Dorris Henderson's Eclection, in the 1970s, with her son Eric Johns. She died in 2005. The album Eclection was re-issued on CD by Collector's Choice Music in November 2001. The title of psychedelic folk artist Prydwyn's 2009 album with Quickthorn, 'Solitude Owes Me a Smile', is a paraphrase of a line from Eclection's opening track 'In Her Mind'.

The river is 130 km long and gives its name to the region it flows through, which constitutes most of the modern Toplica District of Serbia.  Upper course  The Toplica originates under the name of Duboka from the eastern slopes of the Kopaonik mountain, just south of the highest peak, Panƒçiƒáev vrh. It flows to the southeast, on the western slopes of the Lepa Gora mountain, next to the villages of Merƒáez, Selova, ≈Ωuƒç, Miljeviƒáe and Dankoviƒáe. At the monastery of Maƒçkovac, it reaches the northern side of the Radan mountain and turns to the east. This is also where the Toplica receives from the right its major tributary, Kosanica. Near the mouth are located city of Kur≈°umlija and medieval ruins of \\"Marina kula\\" (The tower of Mara), and this is where Toplica region begins.  Toplica region  The region is very fertile, especially for grains, fruits and grapes (famous prokupaƒçko vino, wine of Prokuplje). The central part of the region occupies Topliƒçka (or Prokupaƒçka) kotlina (Depression of Toplica/Prokuplje), between the mountains of Veliki Jastrebac from the north and Sokolovica, Vidojevica and Pasjaƒça from the south, with many smaller settlements on the river: Donje Krmƒçare, Grabovnica, Bogojeva, Barlovo, Donje Toƒçane, Donji Ploƒçnik, Tulare, Donja Konju≈°a, Donja Toponica, and the center of the whole region, the city of Prokuplje. The river continues on the northern slopes of mountain Pasjaƒça, next to the villages of Podina, Voljƒçince, Badnjevac and the smaller regional center ≈Ωitoraƒëa. After the Toplica reaches municipal center of Doljevac, it enters the most densely populated part of the south Pomoravlje, turns north and flows into the Ju≈æna Morava at the village of Orljane, across the medieval ruins of Kurvin grad, as Ju≈æna Morava's longest left tributary.  Characteristics  The Toplica belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin with its own drainage area of 2,217 km¬≤. The river is not navigable. The river valley is a major traffic route in southern Serbia as both road and railway (Transbalkanic rail) pass through here. It connects northern and eastern Serbia with Kosovo over the Prepolac ridge and Merdare. Above the Prokuplje, the Toplica curves around the huge rock, almost making it an island. The picturesque hill, the Hisar is the symbol of the city Despite being fertile, the Toplica region is one of the highest depopulating areas of Serbia (population of 129.542 in 1971, or 58 per km¬≤; population of 102.075 in 2002, or 45 per km¬≤; down 22%).  Toplica rebellion  The region was the site of a rebellion of the local Serbian population against Bulgarian occupational forces in 1917 during World War I. The Toplica rebellion (Serbian: Topliƒçki ustanak/–¢–æ–ø–ª–∏—á–∫–∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–∫) broke out because of the many atrocities of the Bulgarian army (mass slaughters, pillage and burning of the houses and forceful drafting of the Serbian population into the Bulgarian army). Initially, under the leadership of Kosta Vojinoviƒã (1890-1917), rebels had some success, liberating many places in the area (at that time, Ni≈°ki okrug). All three occupying forces in Serbia, Austro-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria, joined forces and brought three artillery divisions into the area, crushing the rebellion (several thousand killed, mostly civilians).

It is equidistant from Paignton, Dartmouth and Totnes, and has a population of approximately 1,200, reducing slightly to 1,107 at the 2011 census. The village is the major part of the electoral ward of East Dart. The ward population at the abovementioned census was 1,877. Fisherman probably first came to Stoke Gabriel to fish salmon and gain access to the River Dart. The village has an approximately 1,000-year-old yew tree in the churchyard of The Church of St Mary and St Gabriel, a church which has stood since Norman times. Legend has it that if you walk backwards seven times round the yew's main stem you will be granted a wish. Stoke Gabriel was the birthplace of the Great Western Railway's Chief Mechanical Engineer George Jackson Churchward, who lends his name to the local football club Stoke Gabriel A.F.C.'s ground. The village has two public houses; The Church House Inn and The Castle Inn. Until relatively recently there were three pubs. The other being The Victoria and Albert Inn. The Church House Inn was built to accommodate the masons who constructed the church and also served as the courthouse. The old stocks can be seen outside the inn today.

A noted author in organizational theory, sociology of law and public administration, Selznick's work was groundbreaking in several fields in such books as The Moral Commonwealth, TVA and the Grass Roots, and Leadership in Administration. Career Selznick received his PhD in Sociology in 1947 from Columbia University. He was on the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, between 1952 and 1984, initially with the Department of Sociology and later with the School of Law as well. Major contributions Selznick was a major proponent of the neo-classical organizational theory movement starting in the 1930s.Shafritz, J.M., & Ott, J.S. (1996). Classics of Organization Theory (4th ed.). Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace & Company. One of his most influential papers, entitled \\"Foundations of the Theory of Organization\\" (1948), laid out his major contributions to organization theory. =Individuals as independent agents= In simplified form, Selznick postulated that individuals within organizations can hold dichotomous goal-sets, which makes it difficult for organizations and employees to have the same implicit, rational objectives (as theorized in classical organization movement which was a precursor of Selznick's work). =Cooptation theory= Selznick's principle of cooptation is an important precursor to the later developments of organizational ecology and contingency theory.Morgan, G. (1997). Images of Organization (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc. =Sociology of law= Selznick has been a major contributor to the sociology of law, developing his ideas on legal institutions and their problems and possibilities of responsiveness to their constituencies, from his earlier work on the sociology of formal organizations. =Theories of mass society= Selznick was first - anticipating Daniel Bell, Edward Shils, Talcott Parsons, William Kornhauser, and a host of American social scientists - to attack the then prevailing theory of mass society. His approach argued instead that there were two analytically distinct theoretical approaches to mass society: *there were those who were critics of equalitarianism or who emphasized the role of creative and culture-bearing elites; *but there were also those who emphasized social disintegration and the quality of participation in mass society and mass organizations. The first group of theorists is best represented by Jos√© Ortega y Gasset and Karl Mannheim. Each of these theorists located the cause of the advent of mass society in the decline of the social position of creative elites who were responsible for the development and the strength of cultural values. Mass society arose when society was no longer directed by an identifiable and stable structure of elites, when the vulgar appetites of the masses supplanted \\"the canons of refinement and sober restraint.\\" The masses cannot simply take over the role served previously by elites; they can express desires but not values. The second group of mass society theorists, those who emphasized social disintegration and the quality of participation, was best represented by Emil Lederer, Erich Fromm, and Sigmund Neumann. Selznick argued that these theorists leave the role of elites largely unexamined. They defined mass society as the era of mass man, a type defined not in terms of any relationship to a formally superior or intrinsically more qualified elite, but as the expression of a wider social disintegration. The homogeneous, amorphous, and undifferentiated individuals in the mass resulted from radical social changes which rendered old norms obsolete and old roles meaningless. Psychological deterioration followed on social disorganization: 'as family, church, and traditional political ties weaken, a psychological atomization takes place.' This type of mass society theory pictures society as a crowd in which irrational, emotional acts predominate. \\"The readiness for manipulation by symbols, especially those permitting sado-masochistic releases, is characteristic of the mass as of the crowd.\\"Philip Selznick, \\"Institutional Vulnerability in Mass Society,\\" American Journal of Sociology, 56 (January, 1951), 320-31 Selected publications   * References Further reading  Krygier, Martin, Philip Selznick: Ideals in the World.

He was chair of the philosophy department at University of California, Berkeley, a prominent educational reformer, and a key figure in the campus controversy over the 1950s loyalty oath. Tussman was born in Chicago and grew up in Milwaukee. He studied under Alexander Meiklejohn at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Following his graduation from Wisconsin, he followed his mentor west to do graduate work at Berkeley. He served in an army-intelligence unit in southwest China during World War II. After his discharge, he returned to Berkeley. California began to require University employees to sign a loyalty oath in the 1950s, and Tussman was a key organizer of protests. Twenty percent of the Berkeley faculty refused to sign, and 31 professors were dismissed. Being untenured, however, Tussman eventually signed the oath for economic reasons. He said it was the saddest day in his life. Tussman moved to the philosophy department in 1952, leaving in 1955 when denied tenure for insufficient scholarly publication. Over the next few years he taught at Syracuse and Wesleyan and completed his first book, Obligation and the Body Politic. He returned to Berkeley in 1963 and became chair of philosophy the following year. He was a key figure in the Free Speech Movement of 1964. In 1965, Tussman founded the Tussman Experimental College Program (modeled on a program that Meiklejohn had created at Madison), which was offered to 150 students through their freshman and sophomore years and focused on great works written during times of great upheaval. The experiment lasted four years. He then continued to teach in the philosophy department until his retirement in 1983.

It consisted largely of a group of loosely organized Democratic and Republican Assemblymen and State Senators, led by Jarvis Lord in the Assembly and William Johnson in the Senate. The firm Belden & Denison made the most money from the scam, though numerous contractors were involved. They were chiefly organized along the route of the Erie Canal; in Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Lockport, and Oswego. Frauds peaked in 1872, with \\"Appropriations for Extraordinary Repairs\\" rising to $4.1 million. Then Governor of New York Samuel J. Tilden began targeting the ring in 1874. In March 1875, he released a report detailing frauds carried out. This served as a direct appeal to the people, and so aroused public opinion that the legislature was forced to authorize the governor to appoint a canal commission. The reports of this commission resulted in a marked diminution in the appropriation for canals and the indictment of several officials for defrauding the State. His handling of the Ring is credited with helping Tilden secure the Democratic nomination for president in 1876.  Background  The Erie Canal was first proposed in the 1780s, then re-proposed in 1807. A survey was authorized, funded, and executed in 1808. Proponents of the project gradually wore down opponents; its construction began in 1817, and opened on October 26, 1825. In a time when bulk goods were limited to pack animals (a maximum\\"Works of Man\\", Ronald W. Clark, (1985), Viking Penguin, New York quotation page 87: \\"There was little experience moving bulk loads by carts, while a packhorse would [i.e., \\"could\\"] carry only an eighth of a ton [(]. On a soft road, a horse might be able to draw 5/8ths of a ton [() or 5√ó]. But if the load were carried by a barge on a waterway, then up to 30 tons [( or ) or 240√ó] could be drawn by the same horse.\\"), and there were no railways, water was the most cost-effective way to ship bulk goods. It was the first transportation system between the Eastern Seaboard and the western interior of the United States that did not require portage. It was faster than carts pulled by draft animals and cut transport costs by about 95%.Using Clark's Works of Man figures, a mule can draw 60,000 lbs but carry only 250 lbs, which need men to load and unload daily, have a need to carry grain as well (parasitic weight), and for same tonnages, required far more men as a labor force, drastically increasing running costs. A 95% reduction is probably conservative, 250 lb/30 t is 0.4% the expenses, so reduction to 5% costs still indicates someone is taking a lot of profits. The canal gave New York City's port a large advantage over all other U.S. port cities and ushered in the state's 19th century political and cultural ascendancy. The canal fostered a population surge in western New York and opened regions farther west to settlement. Though the Erie Canal and associated feeders were highly successful for several years after opening, overbuilding and the Panic of 1837 marked the end of highly profitable years. Increased competition from railroads and other canals further contributed to decline in profits. In 1851, contracts under the $9 Million Act were divided among Democratic and Whig contractors. In 1854, a board of three commissioners was established to award contracts for the maintenance and repair of the canal. More competition forced the canal to lower rates, resulting in a decline in revenue. The canal saw a boom in prosperity with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, which continued throughout the war and for a brief time after. After the Atlantic Cable was completed in 1866, however, the canal began to lose tonnage again. By 1869, railroads finally surpassed the canals in terms of tonnage, and the routes financial troubles were compounded by the Long Depression beginning in 1873. It registered a net loss of $265,610.70 in 1875.  Canal Ring  The Canal Ring made money by charging low prices for major works, but extremely high ones for minor things, in what was termed an \\"unbalanced bid\\". Under the system, contractors could also not complete all of the work they agreed to in a contract without punishment. In 1862, the enlargement of the canal was deemed finished in an effort to curb corruption, but new improvements were soon necessitated by the increased traffic due to the Civil War. Many New Yorker's felt corruption was a major cause of the canal system's troubles. In 1867 at the state Constitutional Convention, Erastus Brooks alleged canal contracts of being awarded to the highest bidder. A commission was established, consisting of James Gibson, Henry C. Murphy, Charles Stanford, William Bristol, William S. Clark, George W. Millspaugh, and counsel Henry Smith. It concluded there were \\"gross and monstrous frauds\\", and the Canal Commissioner, Robert C. Dorn, was impeached.

Played widely in Iran, it is played similarly to the Italian games of Cassino or Scopa and even more similarly to the Egyptian game of Bastra. Pasur is also known by the names Chah√¢r Barg (4 cards), Haft Kh√¢j (seven clubs) or Haft Va Chah√¢r, Y√¢zdah (7+4=11, the significance being that players want to win 7 clubs in a game of 4-card hands where 11 is a winning number). Etymology The name \\"pasur\\" entered Persia from the Russian –üacyp during the 19th century along with the playing cards themselves. Rules =Preliminaries= One standard pack of 52 cards and 2, 3 or 4 players who take turns being dealer. Object of the game is to get the most points based on winning certain cards. =Deal= Four cards face-down to each player and four face-up to form the ‚Äúpool‚Äù in the middle of the table. If one of the cards in the pool is a Jack, it gets cut back into the deck and is replaced with a new card, and if this is a Jack as well or if there are multiple Jacks in pool, dealer reshuffles and deals again. =Play= Beginning at dealer's left, players take turns playing cards to the table until there are no cards left in their hands. Dealer then deals four more cards to each player (but not to the pool) and play continues until the deck is exhausted. A play consists of playing one card in one of two ways: *1. Either by adding it to the pool of face-up cards *2. Or by using that card to pick up one or more cards in the pool. A player may not add a card to the pool if that card is capable of picking up one or more cards in the pool. The player must pick up the cards or play a different card. =Picking up cards= Cards may be picked up as follows. *1. Number cards (including Aces, which are assigned the numerical value of one) pick up one or more other cards with which they combine to form a sum of eleven. **Example: The pool contains Ace, 2, 2, 4 and 10 in varying suits. A player needs to play a 10 to pick up the ace, a 9 to pick up either one of the twos, an 8 to pick up the Ace and one of the 2's, a 7 to pick up the 4 or both of the 2's, a 6 to pick up the Ace and either the 4 or both 2's, a 5 to pick up the 4 and one of the 2's, a 4 to pick up the 4, a 2 and the Ace, a 3 to pick up the 4 and both 2's, a 2 to pick up the 4, both 2's and the Ace, or an Ace to pick up the 10. The other cards would remain in the pool. *2. A King picks up one King, a Queen picks up one Queen. *3. A Jack picks up all Jacks and number cards on the table, but not Kings and Queens. *4. When a player only has a single card left in the last hand of the deck, all remaining cards in the pool are picked up when the player is able to match: a) a king-king b) queen-queen c) combine to form a sum of 11. (Basically, on the last hand of the deck, whoever picks up the last card gets to pick up all remaining unmatched cards from the table). =Surs= A Sur (or Soor) occurs when a player clears all remaining cards from the pool. There are two exceptions: *1. When a Jack is used to pick up all remaining cards from the pool, this is not scored as a Sur. *2. A Sur may not be scored in the last round of play. Players keep track of their Surs by turning a card face up in their winnings pile. Note: It is not possible for a Sur to occur when the pips on the cards in the pool total more than ten. It is also impossible to score a Sur when there are multiple face cards or a mix of number cards and face cards in the pool. =Scoring= Players keep the cards that they pick up face-down in a pile in front of them. The object of the game is to collect the most points, which are tallied by each player once the deck has been exhausted. Scoring varies slightly from place to place, but generally is as follows: *Most clubs: 7 points (some play 13 points; some play person with the most clubs gets 1 point per club to a maximum of 7 points) *10 of diamonds: 3 points *2 of clubs: 2 points *Each Ace: 1 point *Each Jack: 1 point *Each Sur: 5 points (some play each Sur as 10 points) Thus there are a total of 20 available points each round (or 26 if playing 13 points for most clubs), plus a number of 5-point (or 10-point) bonuses for each Sur that occurs. If 3 or 4 people are playing and there is a tie for most clubs, then nobody scores for clubs and the base point total is 13 instead of 20. =Ending the game= Once the deck has been exhausted and points have been tallied, deal passes to the left and the pack is dealt out anew. Game continues until someone's score is 62 or more points. If players are tied, play continues until the tie is broken. Variations =Pasur Ru Baaz= Pasur Ru Baaz (Persian : Ÿæÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ± ÿ±Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿ≤, literally \\"Open Pasur\\") is a variant identical to a 2-player game of Pasur, the only difference being that one card in each player's hand is always kept face-up on the table, making it visible to both players. Players may play any of their own open cards, the card beneath the played card, which was previously hidden from both players, is then turned over (becomes visible to both players). =Three Players= This three-player variant follows the rules for the standard game, with one variation in scoring for clubs.: If two players tie for having the same number of clubs, then it is the third player who scores 7 points for clubs, even though they have fewer clubs than the other players.

Established in 1966, WIS was the first school in the Washington area to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. The school has two campuses: the primary school (grades PK-5) in Georgetown, and the middle and upper school (grades 6-12) in Cleveland Park. The middle and upper school campus is located on the grounds of Marjorie Merriweather Post‚Äôs Tregaron Estate. The Washington International School's upper school was ranked as the 73rd most challenging high school in the country and the most challenging high school in the Washington, D.C., area by the Washington Post's \\"Ranking America's most challenging high schools\\" article in 2016.\\"Ranking America's Most Challenging High Schools\\" The Washington Post. Retrieved 30 September 2013.\\"Washington International School\\" The Washington Post. Retrieved 30 September 2013. Popular school ranking website Niche listed it as the eighth best private high school in the DC area.  History  Washington International School (WIS) was founded in 1966 to serve the international community in the DC area. During the post-World War II era, many international schools were founded by a particular community or nationality and were \\"international\\" in the sense that students from other nationalities were accepted. From the very beginning, founder Dorothy Goodman envisioned that the school would educate children to become global citizens and the early curriculum reflected her vision. Children were taught several different languages and about world cultures, literature and history. In 1969, with assistance from the Ford Foundation, WIS expanded its campus with the purchase of the former Wendell Phillips School, which had closed a number of years before. In 1980 the Tregaron country house and estate was purchased and has been the site of the Middle (grades 6-8) and Upper Schools (9-12) ever since. The Elementary School moved out of the former Wendell Phillips School building in 1998 and the property was sold and developed into private housing.  Athletics  The Washington International School has a strong athletic program and has excelled in the Potomac Valley Athletic Conference (PVAC) for many years. WIS competes in Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball, Swimming (club), Softball, Baseball, Track and Field, and Cross Country running. WIS has won the PVAC league banner and tournament trophies a number of times. In 2009, WIS won the regular season banner and beat the Field School in the tournament final. In 2010, WIS was able to derail Sandy Spring Friends School's unbeaten run in the finals of the PVAC tournament in a 2‚Äì0 win.\\"WIS derails Sandy Spring unbeaten run in the PVAC final\\" from the Washington Post However, the next year they lost to Sandy Spring in the final 3‚Äì1, as Sandy Spring swept both the regular season and playoff banners. In 2012, WIS returned the favor by also winning both banners, while defeating Sandy Spring 1‚Äì0 in the final for their third playoff banner in four years.\\"Washington International boys‚Äô, girls‚Äô win Potomac Valley Athletic Conference soccer titles\\" from the Washington Post They were the third seed in the inaugural version of the DCSAA, but they were upset in the quarterfinas. In 2013, Washington International finished second place in the regular season but rebounded to defeat Sandy Spring 3‚Äì0 in the final for their fourth tournament title in five years. However, the season ended with a loss to eventual winners Sidwell Friends School in the DCSAA Quarterfinals. In 2014, the team had another successful year. They finished the regular season with a record of 14 wins, 1 loss, and two ties, including an undefeated conference record. However, they were upset in the PVAC Championship game by rival Sandy Spring. Despite this, they were the first seed in the DCSAA tournament. They lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Gonzaga. At one point during the season, they were ranked No. 7 in the metropolitan area by The Washington Post for their highest ranking in school history. The varsity team followed up the 2014 season with arguably their best season in school history. They finished the regular season with a record of 15 wins, 1 loss, and one tie eventually winning both the PVAC regular season and playoff championship. Once again they were the first seed in the DCSAA tournament but lost to St. Albans in the final in overtime, finishing the season with a record of 17 wins, 2 losses, and one tie. Building off of last year's incredible run, WIS once again won both the PVAC Regular Season and Tournament Championship. Seeded #2 in the DCSAA tournament, they beat both Gonzaga and St. Albans on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. In the Championship match, WIS beat Bell Multicultural 1‚Äì0 in overtime for their first DCSAA Boys Soccer Championship. They finished the season with a record of 17 wins and one tie and were ranked No. 2 in the area by The Washington Post. Furthermore, the Girls Soccer team won the PVAC double four years in a row before losing in the semi-finals in 2013. In 2009, the WIS boys basketball team upset Jewish Day School to win the PVAC basketball championship. In 2013, the WIS varsity girls basketball team beat Hebrew Academy to win the PVAC basketball championship. The girls volleyball team has won three straight PVAC championships.

They also made preliminary tests with a kite in 1899. In 1911 Orville conducted tests with a much more sophisticated glider. Neither the kite nor any of the gliders were preserved, but replicas of all have been built. 1899 kite The 1899 kite, which Wilbur flew near his home in Dayton, Ohio had a wingspan of only 5 feet (1.5 m). This pine wood and shellacked craft, although too small to carry a pilot, tested the concept of wing-warping for roll control that would prove essential to the brothers' solving the problem of controlled flight. The Wrights burned the craft along with other trash in 1905. 1900 glider The 1900 Wright Glider was the brothers' first to be capable of carrying a human. Its overall structure was based on Octave Chanute's two- surface glider of 1896. Its wing airfoil was derived from Otto Lilienthal's published tables of aerodynamic lift. The glider was designed with wing- warping capability for full-size testing of the concept first tried on the 1899 Wright Kite. The glider was first flown as an unmanned kite on October 5, 1900 near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Next, Wilbur rode as pilot while men on the ground held tether ropes attached to the airborne craft. Subsequently, Wilbur made about a dozen free flights on a single day, concluding the season's test efforts. The brothers abandoned the glider when they broke camp on 23 October, and it eventually disappeared in the region's severe storms. The fabric covering of the wing components was given to the wife of helper Bill Tate, whose family Wilbur first stayed with at Kitty Hawk in 1900. Mrs. Tate allegedly used the material to make dresses for her daughters. 1901 glider Orville with the 1901 glider, its nose pointing skyward The 1901 Wright Glider was the second of the brothers' experimental gliders. They tested it over the Kill Devil Hills, four miles south of Kitty Hawk. The glider was similar to the 1900 version, but had larger wings. It first flew on July 27, 1901, and was retired on August 17. During this time it made between 50 and 100 free flights, in addition to tethered flights as a kite. The wing ribs flexed under the weight of the pilot, distorting the airfoil shapes of the wings. The brothers fixed the trouble, but the wings still produced much less lift than expected, and wing-warping sometimes made the glider turn opposite the intended direction : it was the discovery and first description of the adverse yaw.\\"How we invented the airplane\\", Orville Wright, page 16 After testing concluded, the brothers stored the glider in their camp shed. The shed and glider were badly damaged later by windstorms. The wing uprights were salvaged for the 1902 Glider, but the rest was abandoned. As a result of lift and \\"drift\\" (drag) measurements taken with the tethered glider, the brothers concluded that Lilienthal's data were inaccurate. Upon returning to Dayton, they designed and built a small wind tunnel to collect their own data. 1902 glider The 1902 Wright Glider (Wilbur piloting) on one of its early test flights before replacement of the fixed double rear vertical rudder with a single steerable rudder The 1902 Wright Glider was the third free-flight glider built by the brothers. This was their first glider to incorporate yaw control by use of a rear rudder, and its design led directly to the powered 1903 Wright Flyer. The brothers designed the 1902 glider during the winter of 1901/02. The wing design was based on data from extensive tests of miniature airfoils in their homemade wind tunnel. They built the components of the glider in Dayton and completed assembly at their Kill Devil Hills camp in September 1902. Flights took place between 19 September and 24 October. In order to cope with 1901 glider discovered adverse yaw, the Wrights tested a double fixed rear rudder, hoping to improve turning control, but several times..., when the machine was allowed to slide a little to one side... Orville Wright, \\"How we invented the airplane\\", page 19 the pilot was unable to stop turning and collided with the ground. \\"The addition of a fixed vertical vane in the rear increased the trouble, and made the machine absolutely dangerous\\". The brothers decided to remove one rudder, without success, then make the remaining rudder steerable to solve the problem. With this modification, they achieved a better control Spiral instability was still present. \\"These troubles were not entirely overcome till the end of september, 1905\\", with \\"the addition of two vertical forward fixed vanes\\" and made between 700 and 800 glides (as estimated by the brothers, who did not keep detailed records). The longest glide was measured and timed at 622.5 ft (189.7 m) in 26 seconds. In September 1903 they brought the 1902 glider out of storage and made over 200 glides to hone their piloting skills while preparing the powered Wright Flyer. One of their photographs shows they installed a second vertical fin as part of the steerable rear rudder, matching the original design and also that of the powered Flyer's twin rear rudder. The glider was last flown in November 1903. After their successful powered flights, they put the glider back in storage at camp before returning home for Christmas. When they next visited Kitty Hawk in 1908 to test their improved Wright Flyer III, Outer Banks weather had taken its toll: the storage shed and glider inside were wrecked. Today a salvaged piece of wingtip from the 1902 Glider is preserved at the National Air and Space Museum a few feet from the 1903 Wright Flyer. =Specifications= : Source: 1902 Wright Glider - National Air and Space Museum 1911 glider The 1911 glider over the Kill Devil Hills. Library of Congress Wright Collection. In 1911 Orville Wright returned to the Kill Devil Hills with a new glider, accompanied by his English friend Alec Ogilvie. Orville intended to test an automatic control system on the glider, but did not because of the presence of reporters (he eventually perfected the system in a powered airplane in 1913). The glider had what was then becoming a conventional tailplane, rather than the front-mounted elevator or canard. The pilot also was seated with hand controls, rather than lying prone in a cradle, as with the original gliders. On October 24 Orville soared in the glider above Kill Devil Hill in a wind for 9 minutes 45 seconds, far exceeding the brothers' previous gliding durations. The record stood for ten years until broken in Germany in 1921 by Wolfgang Klemperer. Replicas Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. A fragment of wing ribbing from the original 1902 glider is also on display in the exhibit. A number of replicas of the gliders exist. Wright brothers historian Rick Young of Richmond, Virginia has built 9 accurate working replicas of all of the Wright gliders and the 1903 Flyer. Young's 1902 gliders have appeared in numerous films and television documentaries, including a 1986 IMAX film On the Wing. One of his 1902 replicas is on display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Wright Brothers gallery. The Virginia Aviation MuseumVirginia Aviation Museum Official Site at Richmond International Airport is home to the Wright 1899 Kite, the 1900, 1901 and 1902 gliders and the 1903 Flyer, all built by Young. In 2011, Young researched and built a Wright 1911 glider replica that was displayed during the Soaring 100 event at the Wright Brothers National Monument to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Orville Wright's record- setting glide. A replica of the 1902 glider is on display at the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park in Dayton Ohio. Another replica of the 1902 glider is also on display at the U.S. National Soaring Museum in Elmira, New York.National Soaring Museum Official Site A full-scale replica of the 1902 glider was constructed and is on display at the San Diego Air & Space Museum in San Diego, California.San Diego Air & Space Museum Official Site Another replica, a half-scale model, is on display at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver, Colorado.Wings Over the Rockies Air & Space Museum Official Site A team led by Nick Engler of the Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company has also built replicas of all three gliders. A replica of the 1911 glider was built by Ernest Schweizer for the 75th anniversary of Orville's soaring flight. It has hung in the National Soaring Museum, Elmira NY since 1986.

He was the brother of Chris Buckley, who played for Aston Villa. Early life Buckley was born in Urmston, Lancashire. He attended St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool, and became an office clerk. Already part of the Manchester Regiment, Buckley signed up for a 12-year enlistment in King's Regiment (Liverpool) and expected to serve in the Boer War, but was instead sent to Ireland. He bought himself out of the army in 1902 to become a professional footballer. Playing career He went from Aston Villa to Brighton to Manchester United and Manchester City all within six years, and found something approaching stability only with Birmingham City, where he made 56 appearances. Soon after that he was on the move again, this time to Derby County. It was with the Rams, in 1914, that he gained his sole England cap, in a shock 3‚Äì0 defeat by Ireland at Ayresome Park, before upping sticks, again, to join Bradford City; his stay in Yorkshire shortened by the start of the First World War. Managerial career =Army service, and introduction to management= Buckley went to war with the 17th Middlesex Regiment (where he commanded the Football Battalion), seeing action and receiving wounds to his lung and shoulder in the Battle of the Somme, and rose to the rank of Major. On his return, he was appointed manager of Norwich City. The Canaries had been so debt-ridden that the receivers had wound the club up, but following an extraordinary general meeting, the club was resurrected; Buckley was placed in charge in February 1919, and returned the club to Southern League football. Despite having retired from playing during the war, he played one game for Norwich in September 1919, when he was the club's secretary-manager. Once again, his stay was short; by July 1920 he was gone, financial disputes precipitating a wholesale change of personnel.EDP24: Norwich City FC centenary =Blackpool= He returned to football management with Blackpool on 6 October 1923; there, his ideas began to come to the fore. He was lured to Bloomfield Road with the promise of an extremely high salary and enough money to strengthen the squad. Buckley is credited with implementing a youth system and scouting scheme to 'the Seasiders'. Despite a total change of tactics, he did not have much more success with Blackpool than did his predecessor, Bill Norman. During the 1924‚Äì25 season Buckley sold established players such as Herbert Jones and Harry Bedford, which proved unpopular amongst the fans. As of 2013, Buckley was the eighth-longest serving Blackpool manager in terms of Football League games in charge. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= In July 1927, he took up an appointment with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Stan Cullis wrote of him: \\"I soon realised that Major Buckley was one out of the top drawer. He did not suffer fools gladly. His style of management in football was very similar to his attitude in the army. Major Buckley implanted into my mind the direct method of playing which did away with close interpassing and square-ball play. If you didn't like his style you'd very soon be on your bicycle to another club. He didn't like defenders over-elaborating in their defensive positions. Major Buckley also knew how to deal with the press.\\" (Quoted in Taylor and Ward, 1995, pp. 31‚Äì2)Fathom :: The Source for Online Learning Buckley's stay at Wolves can be looked at in two ways. On the face of it, he appeared to achieve only modest success with the club; they won the Division Two title in 1931‚Äì32 and finished runners-up in the Division One in 1937‚Äì38 and in both the First Division and the FA Cup the following season. An alternative view is that during his stay at Molineux, Buckley once made the club a ¬£100,000 profit within one year, purely on transfer deals; he toyed, provocatively, with the media, instigating the empty rumour that his players were using a monkey gland treatment (see Serge Voronoff) to aid performance; he used psychologists to instill confidence in his players and was responsible for bringing through Stan Cullis and offering Billy Wright a start in professional football. After he had left the club, however, the full value of his vision, not least the Wolves youth programme, came to fruition and did so much to shape the Wolves side of the 1950s, when they won three Division One championships, twice won the FA Cup, and were one of few genuine challengers to the Busby Babes. Buckley left Wolves in 1944 and another non-committal couple of years followed at Notts County (for a then-unheard-of ¬£4,000 a year) and Hull City before starting work at Leeds United, where one of his first discoveries was John Charles just after Christmas 1948. He was not afraid to try all manner of ideas to induce the Elland Road club out of mediocrity: dancing songs broadcast through the public address system during training days, so-called 'shooting' boxes (a contraption designed to send the ball out at different speeds and angles to players), increasing admission costs, youth development programmes. John Charles did excel during the 1954‚Äì55 season, but the team failed to respond in kind. =Legacy= =Influence= Buckley's influence on the rise of the Blackpool and Wolves sides of the 1950s, of the Leeds United 'club culture' of the 1960s and 1970s should never be understated. His principles may not have been adopted directly by Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Brian Clough and Alex Ferguson but they were innovative principles that are now quite commonplace. A stern disciplinarian throughout his career, Buckley earned devotion and affection, not least because he was also a 'tracksuit' manager. He brought in Jack Charlton, who had this to say about him: > \\"Unlike the pros, we got just two weeks' holidays in the summer, and while > they were away our job was to remove the weeds from the pitch and replace > them with grass seed. I remember being sat out there one day with Keith > Ripley, another ground staff boy, when Major Buckley came over to us. We > must have looked pretty forlorn, the two of us, and to gee us up he said > he'd give us five shillings for every bucket we filled with weeds. Now that > was an offer we couldn't refuse. By the time we were finished, we had filled > six buckets, and, cheeky bugger that I was, I marched straight up to the > Major's office. And when he asked what I wanted, I told him I was there to > claim my thirty bob for the weeds. He nearly blew a bloody gasket! 'Get out > of here!' he bellowed. 'You're already getting paid to do that work ‚Äì don't > ever let me see you up here again with your buckets.' > \\"Yet beneath the gruff exterior, he was a kind man, as he demonstrated once > when I met him. My shoes must have been a sight, for when he looked down at > them, he asked me if they were the only pair I had. I nodded. The next > morning, he summoned me to his office and handed me a pair of Irish brogues, > the strongest, most beautiful shoes I'd ever seen. And I had them for > years.\\" Buckley left Leeds in April 1953, moving to Walsall, but left them in September 1955. He died in Walsall in December 1964, aged 82.

The show is the longest running quiz show on Belgian television, with 22 seasons. On 10 December 2017 the show aired its 5000th episode. Rounds =Round 1= Ben asks a series of 10 questions. The first contestant to buzz in with the correct answer picks up 10 points and drops 2 pieces on the game board. When a line on the board is created, it is cleared, and the contestant finishing that line earns a 50-point bonus. =Round 2= Each contestant plays separately. The contestant with the most points from the first round temporarily leaves and gets to listen to music. Meanwhile, the other contestant will play the round. The contestant will get five hints, and may decide in what order he/she will take the questions. The number of blocks that can be placed after the question was answered correctly is the same as the order of the questions (the first question gives one block, the second question two blocks, etc.). If the contestant answers correctly, 10 points are awarded and he/she drops the pieces assigned to that question. Each line on the board earns a 50-point bonus. In theory, a maximum of 350 points is possible in this round; this was first achieved in Season-18. After the first contestant finishes the round, the other contestant is invited back for his turn. Previous rules Before Season-18, the second round worked differently. The contestant was given 15 pieces to place on the board, and five questions were asked. Before each question, the contestant had to assign some of the pieces (max. five) to that question, based on a hint given in advance. The contestant was allowed to assign zero pieces to a question. In the first season, the second round was played in the same way as the first round, with the board being cleared between rounds. In this round, three of the 10 questions would be designated as 50-point questions; a sound effect would play and the piece on the board would turn gold to signal this event. =Gokronde (Guessing Round)= A final round of 10 questions. Before each question, the host gives a hint about the answer. The first contestant to press the buzzer is given the entire question and the chance to answer. If the answer is correct, 50 points are awarded and the contestant can put 2 pieces on the board. Each line is worth an additional 50 points. If the contestant fails to give the correct answer, 50 points are deducted from that contestant's score, and the other contestant is given a free attempt at the question (that is, the second contestant will not be charged a penalty if wrong; but only 10 points can be earned from the question itself). If neither contestant buzzes in, then the question is played on the buzzers for 10 points. At the end of this round, the contestant in the lead plays the finale. The losing contestant receives a consolation prize. If a tie occurs at the end of the round, the host would ask one final question to both contestants. The first contestant to buzz in with a correct response automatically wins the game, but an incorrect answer results in an automatic loss. Finale (bonus round) The contestant is given a total of 120 seconds for the round. Ben asks a series of questions. Unlike previous rounds, a correct answer is worth one piece. In this round, an eight-letter word (a seven-letter word through season 17) is hidden on the board. Before the round, the contestant is given a clue as to the mystery word. This clue can be a synonym, a descriptive word, or a general category. If a piece is placed on a space or spaces hiding one of the letters, the letters attached to those spaces are revealed. If the first letter of the word is revealed, it will be highlighted (this was not the case in earlier seasons). While the game is in progress, the contestant may only take a guess at the word while placing a piece (or immediately after, before Ben asks the next question; only one guess is allowed on each piece placed). In addition, once the 120 seconds expire, the contestant is permitted a brief interval of time within which to make a guess. If the contestant guesses the word, he/she earns ‚Ç¨1,000 (originally 40,000 Belgian francs) and can come back the next day to try again. If the word is not found, he/she earns ‚Ç¨250 (originally 10,000 Belgian francs) for each complete line on the board (which are recolored rather than cleared in this round), but must retire from the show. (It is possible for a contestant to reach ‚Ç¨1,000 by completing lines, however, the round is only considered won if the contestant successfully guesses the word.) If he/she can win 3 times, then in addition to the ‚Ç¨3,000 won thus far, he/she wins a bonus prize package usually consisting of a flatscreen TV and a video camera. Like the American game show The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime, but unlike other game shows, a contestant can return as champion as long as he/she wins the main game and the subsequent finale, the current record standing at 13 recurrent appearances on the show. * Kiana Buttiens: 13 appearances, 13th finale reached, word not guessed (January 2020) * Ewout Leys: 12 appearances, 12th finale not reached (June 2018) * Saar Bossuyt: 11 appearances, 11th finale reached, word not guessed (September 2013) Show elements *Only the first answer given by the contestant can be accepted. Even the smallest error in an answer (for example: not pronouncing a letter at the end of the word) renders the answer incorrect. *A Viking used to appear frequently behind the showmaster. *The off-screen jury (consisting of only 1 person) corrects Ben when he gets something wrong. *Ben Crabb√© is a major music and sports fan. He has been known to become irritated with contestants who don't know the answer to a sports/music question. *The record of most points collected in the first 3 rounds, is 1440. *Jo met de Banjo, a Belgian DJ and former TV star, is responsible for warming up the crowd. *As of season 15, the set design has completely changed.

A combined corsair expedition, mainly French (an Anglo-French fleet with Portuguese forces included), sailed against a Spanish naval force made up of Portuguese and Castilian ships, to preserve control of the Azores under pretender Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato and to defend the islands from incorporation into the Iberian Union--the largest French force sent overseas before the age of Louis XIV. In the first engagement between large fleets of carracks and galleons operating at great distances from the mainland,Walton p. 80 the mercenary fleet under Filippo di Piero Strozzi was severely defeated by a squadron under √Ålvaro de Baz√°n.Hakluyt p. 418 The Spanish victory resulted in the rapid Spanish conquest of the Azores, completing the incorporation of Portugal into the Spanish Empire.Nascimento Rodrigues/Tessaleno Devezas p. 122 Background The only portion of the Portuguese overseas empire to resist the Habsburg King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal) were the Azores Islands.Konstam p.44 The French crown sent a fleet under the command of the mercenary admiral Filipo Strozzi in order to help defend the islands. King Philip had offered an amnesty to the seven islands if they would surrender,History of Portugal p.269 but his messenger met with a very hostile reception at Angra, and retired to the island of S√£o Miguel, which had presented its allegiance to the King of Spain and Portugal. While a fleet was prepared at Lisbon to subdue the seven islands, a Spanish commander sent out to escort the incoming treasure fleet, Pedro Vald√©s, was ordered to deliver a new offer of pardon, but on no account to begin hostilities until the necessary force was assembled. However, receiving the same replies the former envoy, Vald√©s was persuaded to attempt an assault on Terceira. At what became known as the Battle of Salga, his landing-force of 600 men met with a savage welcome; the half-wild bulls of the island were driven into them and they were cut to pieces as they fled to the ships. Meanwhile, Ant√≥nio reached Calais and proceeded to England. Walsingham and Burghley favoured the sending of an expedition to the Azores: the Count of Vimioso even made an agreement with Drake and Hawkins, but Elizabeth was unwilling to make war on Philip, and Ant√≥nio returned to France. Battle Map of Terceira. By Jan Huygen van Linschoten. In June 1582 Ant√≥nio's French fleet left Belle-Isle, intending to subdue the two islands of S√£o Miguel and Santa Maria and to capture the treasure fleet which would probably put in at the Azores.History of Portugal p.270 However, on learning that Strozzi had sailed, Santa Cruz also made for the Azores with fewer ships but larger in size and arms than Strozzi and about an equal number of men. He arrived too late to prevent the French from landing on S√£o Miguel, but in time to save the capital, Ponta Delgada. After an indecisive gunfight on 24 July 1582 the fleets met two days later in a fierce close battle south of the island of S√£o Miguel.Glete p.157 The French initially had the advantage of the wind and attacked the Spanish rear with superior forces but that gave the Spanish commander the opportunity to gain the wind for the Spanish vanguard which in its turn attacked the French. The Spanish were outnumbered two to one,Angus Konstam p.45 the brunt of the French attack was borne by the Portuguese-built Spanish galleon San Mateo (S√£o Mateus), a vessel of 750 tonnes armed with 30 guns. Although surrounded, battered by artillery, and boarded by several French ships, her sailors held their ground and repulsed all attacks. They then took the fight to the enemy, boarding and capturing two French vessels before the battle ended. Several French ships took flight. Santa Cruz began the action by arranging themselves in a line abreast. This was the traditional tactic employed by the Spanish galleys, which carried their few cannon in the bow. Santa Cruz in his Portuguese-built flagship S√£o Martinho sought out Strozzi's ship amid the smoke and chaos and, having found her, pounded her with gunfire until she was close to sinking. At the battle's close, the Pretender's fleet had lost 10 ships sunk or captured, and well over 1,000 men, including Strozzi,Parker p.72 wounded to death by order of Santa Cruz, and then, still breathing, thrown into the sea. Santa Cruz defeated the French through a combination of gunfire and boarding.Walton p.80 Some thought that Strozzi had been unlucky to lose. His ships had proved nimbler than those of Santa Cruz, and, like Hawkins at San Juan de Ul√∫a, they had used their artillery well, operating in mutually supporting groups of four to charge, and assail each of them one of the great vessels of the enemy. The Spanish fleet suffered severe damage, Philip II's commemorative mural in the Escorial's Hall of Battles correctly depicts extensive shot damage on the Spanish side. The galleon San Mart√≠n (S√£o Martinho) barely managed to tow the captured enemy flagship back to port.Parker p.73 On July 26, after a five-hour naval engagement, the French and English fleets, weaker in battle-power, were routed; seventeen of their ships deserted. Men over seventeen who were captured were put to death as pirates. This sentence seemed very cruel to all, so some of the Spanish soldiers and captains came forward to plead to Alvaro de Bazan for mercy, and suggested that he make an exemption for the French prisoners by sparing their lives as prisoners of war. Alvaro de Bazan responded by saying that he was only executing the \\"mandates\\" of the King of France, that being at peace with Castile would not allow his subjects to act as armed pirates attacking the Spaniards. Aftermath The Spanish Tercios landing on Terceira. El Escorial Hall of Battles. Though larger, the improvised French fleet had not been sufficient to challenge the Spanish in the Atlantic triangle. The magnitude of French losses is uncertain but they were heavy and decisive. In spite of the effective use of artillery, the battle was largely decided in the traditional style of boarding the enemy, although the Portuguese were the first to understand the importance of naval artillery. Apparently, Strozzi ignored the Portuguese who were in his fleet and recommended the use of artillery in their line of battle tactic, as they were doing in the Indian Ocean (resolving many battles by gunnery alone), which would be adopted by the other Europeans in the 17th century. Batalla de la Isla Tercera \\"El mundo no es suficiente para la Espa√±a de Felipe II\\" ABC - Historia militar de Espa√±a, Cesar Cervera (in Spanish) - 2014. However, the battle shows that Strozzi tried, partly, an approximation to this tactic, by an attack by a group of naus engaged in formation.Os navios de Portugal na Grande Armada. O poder naval portugu√™s. 1574-1592, Author: Augusto Salgado, Lisbon, Pref√°cio, 2004, pages 18-29 The other problem for the French-allied fleet to win more easily with such tactical or approximate strategy, despite its numbers and the fact that several carracks in its fleet had more guns aboard than the galleon S√£o Mateus,Os navios de Portugal na Grande Armada. O poder naval portugu√™s. 1574-1592, Augusto Salgado, pages 18-29 although the latter being robust and designed for greater maneuverability, was that of the Atlantic armed carracks, but especially, the Portuguese oceanic fighting galleons, were precisely incorporated into the Spanish fleet, and leading the fight (despite being only two, they would be decisive, being the other ships Portuguese and Castilian carracks, urcas, and pataches). These galleons were also strongly armed‚Äîwith its personnel and specialized bombardeiros or artilheiros‚Äîmore suitable for such a strategy in the Atlantic high seas than other naus and galleons of more mixed-use, or the galleys (the widest Spanish resource for naval engagements until then). However, in the end, the battle was eventually largely resolved in the old way of naval warfare. Batalla de Isla Terceira (26 de julio de 1582): Felipe II consolida el trono de Portugal Revista Militar, Jos√© Ram√≥n Cumplido Mu√±oz Santa Cruz had won a great victory and jubilation at his triumphant return seems to have gripped the whole of Spain. The French ambassador at Philip II's court sourly reported that some Spaniards went so far as to claim that \\"even Christ was no longer safe in Paradise, for the marquis might go there to bring him back and crucify him all over again\\". Later some of this pride and passion turned against the vanquished: according to the same ambassador by October 1582 the Spaniards had taken to \\"spitting in the faces of any Frenchmen they happened to meet in the street.\\" Terceira remained in the Pretender's hands, and in the spring of 1583 he managed to reinforce his garrisons there with 800 fresh French troops. Santa Cruz, who now enjoyed command of the sea, reacted swiftly. Secure within his Lisbon base he prepared an amphibious invasion of overwhelming force: 15,372 men and 98 ships, including 31 big merchantmen converted as troop transports, small vessels and landing craft, fighting galleons, 12 galleys, and 2 galleasses. This time his aim was not to fight a fleet but to land an army‚Äîthe task force could certainly defend itself if necessary, but its primary role was to put troops, together with their supporting equipment and supplies, on a selected beach-head and then to back them up until the military objectives had been gained.Parker p.74 The Terceirans expected the Spaniards to land at the harbours of Angra and Peggia, and had disposed their forces accordingly. However, Santa Cruz decided to deliver his main thrust at Mole, a beach 10 miles from Angra defended only by light earthworks occupied by infantry with some artillery support. Bazan's own report of the landings describes the assault on the beaches: Ant√≥nio himself was on Terceira, where he supervised the raising of levies for defense, but left in November to persuade the French to furnish another 1,500 men, who arrived in June 1583. Santa Cruz had increased his fleet to ninety-six ships and 9,500 men with a garrison of 2,000 on S√£o Miguel. His lavish offers of mercy, marriage, and money for Ant√≥nio's capitulation were refused, but after one day's fighting Terceira fell. French and English soldiers on the island were allowed to retire unharmed, but sixteen supporters of Ant√≥nio, including Silva, who had tried to flee on the night of the attack, were executed. Dom Ant√≥nio and a handful of his supporters were lucky to escape with their lives.Geoffrey Parker p.73 References Sources   External links *Batalla de Isla Terceira in Spanish 1582 in Portugal 16th century in Portugal Conflicts in 1582 Ponta Delgada Battles in the Azores Ponta Delgada 1582 Ponta Delgada 1582 Ponta Delgada 1582 Ponta Delgada 1582 Ponta Delgada 1582 Amphibious operations involving Spain ","title":"Battle of Ponta Delgada"},{"id":"5033651","text":"Barney's Great Adventure (also known by its promotional title Barney's Great Adventure: The Movie) is a 1998 American musical comedy adventure film based on the children's television series Barney & Friends, featuring Barney the Dinosaur in his first ever feature-length film. The plot follows Barney, along with 3 young children named Cody, Abby, and Marcella, as they discover a magical egg in a barn. After learning that the egg is a dream maker, Barney and the gang must return the egg to the barn before it hatches. The film was written by Stephen White, directed by Steve Gomer, produced by Sheryl Leach and Lyrick Studios and released by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment on March 27, 1998 in the United States and Canada at the height of Barney's popularity. This was the third and final film to be produced by Lyrick Studios before it was folded into HIT Entertainment in 2001. It is also the only theatrical Barney film as all other Barney films were just direct to video productions. Plot Cody, Abby, and Fig Newton, alongside Abby's best friend Marcella Walker are dropped off to the Newton's grandparents' farm for a whole week during summer break. As Cody believes there's nothing exciting at the farm, Abby and Marcella rub a Barney doll in his face. Cody starts a game of \\"keep- away\\" by taking the Barney doll and running off with it. The two go after Cody, who hides the doll in the bathroom. The girls catch up with Cody, who tells them to use their imagination and laughs when he thinks that nothing happened. However, the doll comes to life as Barney the Dinosaur takes the girls to play in the barn. Cody refuses to believe in Barney, and claims that real dinosaurs don't talk. That night after dinner, the whole family is outside the front porch where Cody further discusses how Barney was in their barn and was not just a little doll. Grandpa then sings Let Me Call You Sweetheart to Grandma before he goes back inside with her and Fig. Right on cue, Barney appears after Fig and their grandparents went back inside and they sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star before Abby and Marcella go back inside to play in the attic. Barney then gives Cody advice to wish upon a star. Cody takes his advice and wishes for a real adventure that summer and to do things no one else has done before. A shooting star deposits an egg in the barn, and Cody discovers it the next day. Barney and the kids go tell their grandparents about this, but Barney gets distracted when he hears Fig cry. Grandma suggests to Abby and Marcella that they go see Mrs. Goldfinch. Cody finds Barney in the baby room and takes him to see his grandparents, but Abby and Marcella take Cody and Barney to see Mrs. Goldfinch, who tells them that the egg is a dreammaker. Cody accidentally knocks the egg off the table which lands on a birdseed truck. Barney and the others recover it through a parade as the egg avoids being cracked by the people in the parade. Barney's friend B.J. catches it when it almost lands on the ground, but tosses it away. Barney and the gang chase the egg through a French restaurant where Barney sings If All The Raindrops, a circus where Barney and the kids sing We're Gonna Find A Way, and finally, they fly through the sky to continue their pursuit of it. However, they eventually make it back to the barn in time. All the while, Baby Bop is looking for her blanket and B.J. and Baby Bop arrive just in time to see the egg hatch. After they return the egg to the barn, it finally hatches into a koala-like being named Twinken who shows everyone Abby's dream, then Barney's. Cody apologizes to Barney for being mean and says that he's cool. Barney accepts his apology and tells Cody he thinks he's cool too and the two share a hug. Twinken shows everyone a magical fireworks display which lands in Barney's arms. Barney begins to sing \\"I Love You\\", and the rest of the cast sings with him. Baby Bop gets sleepy, which prompts B.J. to decide they are ready to go home. The film ends with Twinken sitting next to Barney who has reverted into his doll form. Cast Production =Development= Word of a Barney film first arose in November 1992 when Debbie Ries, sales director for The Lyons Group said plans for a movie was in the works. In 1993, it was later announced by creator Sheryl Leach at The National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that a movie is coming. Later in 1994, a Barney Magazine article had stated that Barney the Dinosaur would star in his first ever film entitled Barney: The Movie. It was originally going to be distributed worldwide by Geffen Pictures through Warner Bros. and produced by Sheryl Leach and Dennis DeShazer. According to Sheryl Leach, it had a release date for summer 1995. Warner Bros. and Lyons had disagreements over marketing, leading the latter to bring the film (with help from now former producer Geffen) to Polygram. On June 20, 1997, Barney himself announced the film at a news conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Later in 1997, teaser trailers for the film, now entitled Barney's Great Adventure: The Movie, arose on VHS cassettes of some Barney Home Videos. To Sheryl Leach, it was a joy of filming as she stated: Leach adds that the film allowed them to \\"take the familiar Barney and put him outdoors and in other very different settings from his traditional environments.\\" =Filming= The film was shot on locations outside Montreal, Canada, including the renowned Ste. AnnedeBellevue's Morgan Arboretum, a popular wildlife sanctuary. The veteran film crew was initially a bit skeptical of the large purple star. =Original version= According to writer Stephen White, in the original script, the egg was going to hatch a giant bird who misses its mother, Baby Bop and BJ were expected to make a lot more screen time, appearing in the farmhouse attic, but those scenes were soon scrapped, as director Steve Gomer claimed the scenes to be \\"unaffordable\\", Miss. Goldfinch was originally planned to be a comedic character, as opposed to the more subdued character of the final film, the circus scenes and the \\"Collector\\" character were not in the original drafts, as well as rather than using a log, Barney and the gang would have built a plane out of cardboard boxes. Release =Critical reception= The film received mixed to negative reviews from film critics, owing to it being based on the aforementioned television program which is aimed for young children aged 1‚Äì5, the growing popularity of \\"anti-Barney humor\\", and the general unpopularity of the Barney series outside of its target audience of preschoolers. John Petrakis wrote in the Chicago Tribune, \\"If my 21-month-old son had any inkling that I was giving a less than stellar review to [this film,] he would no doubt shoot me that look he tends to give when his milk is warm or his Cheerios a bit stale.\\" The New York Times' Anita Gates wrote that it was a film \\"his young, undemanding fans are likely to enjoy.\\" Another review, from the Los Angeles Times, read: \\"The creators of the great purple scourge, Barney the Dinosaur, have an unspoken contract with parents palatable for all involved: We buy their videos and an occasional plush toy for our 3- and 4-year-olds and make Barney's brain trust obscenely wealthy; they in turn create benignly lobotomized entertainment that holds our non-demanding kids in thrall; our kids watch TV and allow us a few precious minutes of peace. The most important element is parental trust in Barney to be blandly wholesome, so that we have to endure only a few seconds of it while we cue up the VCR for our tykes. Family movies, on the other hand, imply a rather different contract: Parents buy tickets and popcorn for the whole family; filmmakers deliver light entertainment that kowtows to kids yet is not so brain-dead as to alienate sentient adults. 'Barney's Great Adventure: The Movie,' the first theatrical film featuring the green-bellied beast, takes that big old fat foot of Barney's and stomps that contract beyond recognition. [. . .] The flat lighting and two-dimensional sets of the TV screen serve Barney far better than a modestly expanded budget and a director insistent on using locations, romantic lighting and mildly adventurous camera angles. Barney looks both more real and more magical on video; on film, he's clearly a doofus in a felt outfit.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently has a \\"Rotten\\" score of 26%, based on 23 reviews with only 6 fresh reviews, and a rating of a 4.2 out of 10. It was nominated for two awards at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards: Barney himself was nominated \\"Worst New Star\\" and won in a tie with Jerry Springer in Ringmaster. The Jerry Herman-penned \\"Barney, the Song\\" was nominated for \\"Worst Original Song\\", but lost to \\"I Wanna Be Mike Ovitz!\\" from An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn. It also received three nominations at the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. =Box office= In its limited release weekend, the film grossed $2,203,865 from 540 theaters and ranked number 11.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&wknd;=14&p;=.htm A week later, in wide release, it grossed $1,382,373 from 809 theaters and ranked number 15.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&wknd;=15&p;=.htm By the end of its run, the film grossed $12,218,638 in the domestic box office, falling short of its $15 million budget.

Cheney batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Belleville, Kansas. Cheney debuted with the Cubs on September 19, 1911. After two appearances as a reliever, he pitched a shutout against Brooklyn, but was hit by a line drive off the bat of Zack Wheat which Cheney deflected with his throwing hand, fracturing his thumb and nose. The following season he relied heavily on a knuckleball and spitter after his broken finger took some speed off his heavy fastball. Then he blossomed, tying with Rube Marquard for the National League lead in wins (26), leading with 28 complete games, as he finished second in winning percentage (.722). In 1913 Cheney won 21 games (17 as a starter, four as a reliever) and led the league in saves (11) and games pitched (54). On September 14, he shut out the New York Giants while allowing 14 hits, setting a major league record for most hits given up while pitching a nine-inning shutout. He won 20 games in 1914, leading the league in starts (40) and games (50). From 1912 to 1914 he pitched 300 or more innings in each season, with a career-high 311 in 1914. Also in 1914, Cheney set a record for most wild pitches in a season opening with 4 against the Cincinnati Reds on April 14. Traded to Brooklyn in August 1915 for Joe Schultz, after an 8‚Äì9 start, Cheney won 18 games in 1916, helping his new team reach the World Series. He pitched three innings of relief against the Boston Red Sox in Game Four of the Series, striking out five batters. Cheney then pitched for the Robins, Braves and Phillies in 1919, his last major league season, appearing in his final game on September 26. Over nine seasons, Cheney posted a 116‚Äì100 record with 926 strikeouts and a 2.70 ERA in 1881.1 innings. Cheney died in Daytona Beach, Florida at age of 82.

Early life and education Niskanen was born and raised in Bend, Oregon. He received his B.A. from Harvard University in 1954. He pursued graduate study of economics at the University of Chicago, where his teachers included Milton Friedman and other prominent economists who were then revolutionizing economics, public policy, and law with ideas that would come to be known as the Chicago school of economics. Niskanen received his M.A. in 1955 and his doctorate in 1962, writing his dissertation on the economics of alcoholic beverage sales.T. Rees Shapiro. \\"William A.

Career = Early career = After earning his doctoral degree, Niskanen joined the RAND Corporation as a defense policy analyst in 1957, using his economic and mathematical modeling skills to analyze and improve military efficiency. Among his accomplishments was developing a 400-line linear programming model of the Air Force transport system. His programmer for the model was a young William F.

During his time at the Pentagon, Niskanen became disillusioned with the nation's political leadership, later claiming that the president and other executive branch officials \\"lied with ... regularity\\" to the public.

While at Berkeley, Niskanen helped establish the school's graduate school of public policy. During this time in California, he became acquainted with then-governor Ronald Reagan, who appointed him to a task force on the state's economy. Following his dismissal from Ford in 1980 (see below), Niskanen returned to academia, this time to UCLA.Zycher, op. cit. = Ford Motor Company = In 1975, Niskanen was appointed chief economist at the Ford Motor Company under chairman Henry Ford II and president Lee Iacocca. He quickly became critical of Ford's corporate culture and its failure to follow consumer trends, such as the 1970s desire for more fuel-efficient cars because of rising gas prices resulting from OPEC constraints on oil supply. Foreign automakers, especially the Japanese, were quick to exploit American consumers' demand for more fuel-efficient cars, gaining a growing share of the U.S. market in the 1970s. Ford responded by asking the U.S. government to place import quotas on Japanese cars. Niskanen, a free-trade advocate, argued internally against this policy, saying that Ford needed to improve its products in light of consumer demand. In response to this criticism, Ford fired Niskanen in 1980. = Reagan administration = Incoming president Ronald Reagan appointed Niskanen to his Council of Economic Advisers, which was responsible for conducting and analyzing economic research to inform executive branch policies. In a speech before a women's group in 1984, he commented that women's leaving the workforce to raise children contributed to a disparity in pay between the genders. Niskanen's comment was condemned in 1984, including criticism from Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who claimed it exemplified a lack of respect toward women by the Reagan administration. The following year, another of Niskanen's blunt comments ultimately led to his departure from the Reagan administration. During the negotiations over legislation that ultimately became the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Niskanen internally criticized the administration proposal that was drawn up by the Treasury Department under Secretary Donald Regan, telling President Reagan in front of Regan that the proposal was \\"something Walter Mondale would love.\\" Regan took offense at the comment and, after becoming Reagan's chief of staff, blocked Niskanen's ascendancy to the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers after Martin Feldstein left to return to Harvard. Niskanen served as acting chair for a brief period, but then resigned from the council.

Public choice eschewed the traditional notion that these agents are motivated by selfless interest in the public good, and instead considered them as typically self-interested, like other agents. His chief contribution to public choice theory was the budget-maximizing model ‚Äì the notion that bureaucrats will attempt to maximize their agency's budget and authority. He presented this theory in 1971 book Bureaucracy and Representative Government. =Publications= Niskanen authored several books, academic articles, and essays on government and politics. His most noted work, Bureaucracy and Representative Government, published in 1971, made a great impact on the field of public management and strongly challenged the field of public administration in the spirit of Ludwig von Mises's Bureaucracy. The book was for a long time out of print, but was reissued with several additional essays as, William Niskanen, Bureaucracy and Public Economics (Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 1994). Niskanen's work was an early text in rational choice models of bureaucracy. In his work he proposed the budget- maximizing model. Another of his noted works was his 1988 book Reaganomics, which describes both the policies and inside-the-White House politics of Reagan's economic program. Washington Post columnist Lou Cannon, author of the biography President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime, described the book as \\"a definitive and notably objective account of administration economic policies.\\"Library of Economics and Liberty. \\"Reaganomics: About the Author\\" Niskanen's final book was Reflections of a Political Economist (2008). The book is a collection of essays and book reviews on public policy and economic topics, and serves as an intellectual biography.

This resulted in a number of social consequences, such as increasing crime and violence in American inner city neighborhoods, as well as a resulting backlash in the form of tough on crime policies. In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the possession or trafficking of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine.Burton-Rose (ed.), 1998: pp. 246‚Äì247 These were criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly African Americans, who were more likely to have access to crack than powder cocaine.\\"The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases\\", The Washington Post, August 3, 2010. Retrieved September 30, 2010. History \\"Rocks\\" of crack cocaine, with a ruler (marked in inches) for reference The name \\"crack\\" first appeared in the New York Times on November 17, 1985. Within a year more than a thousand press stories had been released about the drug. In the early 1980s, the majority of cocaine being shipped to the United States was landing in Miami, and originated in Colombia, trafficked through the Bahamas and Dominican Republic. \\"DEA History Book, 1876‚Äì1990\\" (drug usage & enforcement), US Department of Justice, 1991, USDoJ.gov webpage: DoJ-DEA-History-1985-1990. Soon there was a huge glut of cocaine powder in these islands, which caused the price to drop by as much as 80 percent. Faced with dropping prices for their illegal product, drug dealers made a decision to convert the powder to \\"crack\\", a solid smokeable form of cocaine, that could be sold in smaller quantities, to more people. It was cheap, simple to produce, ready to use, and highly profitable for dealers to develop. As early as 1981, reports of crack were appearing in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego, Miami, Houston, New York, and in the Caribbean. Initially, crack had higher purity than street powder.The word \\"street\\" is used as an adjective meaning \\"not involving an official business location or permanent residence\\" such as: \\"sold on the street\\" or \\"street people\\" in reference to people who live part-time along streets. Around 1984, powder cocaine was available on the street at an average of 55 percent purity for $100 per gram (), and crack was sold at average purity levels of 80-plus percent for the same price. In some major cities, such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Houston and Detroit, one dose of crack could be obtained for as little as $2.50 (). According to the 1985‚Äì1986 National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee Report, crack was available in Los Angeles, New Orleans, Memphis, Philadelphia, New York City, Houston, San Diego, San Antonio, Seattle, Baltimore, Portland, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Atlanta, Oakland, Kansas City, Miami, Newark, Boston, San Francisco, Albany, Buffalo, and Dallas-Fort Worth. In 1985, cocaine-related hospital emergencies rose by 12 percent, from 23,500 to 26,300. In 1986, these incidents increased 110 percent, from 26,300 to 55,200. Between 1984 and 1987, cocaine incidents increased to 94,000. By 1987, crack was reported to be available in the District of Columbia and all but four states in the United States. Some scholars have cited the crack \\"epidemic\\" as an example of a moral panic, noting that the explosion in use and trafficking of the drug actually occurred after the media coverage of the drug as an \\"epidemic\\". see also Later, the epidemic died down, as a new generation avoided the drug after seeing the powerfully destructive effects on a previous generation. Some died, some were jailed, but many tired of the side effects. Impact by region In a study done by Roland Fryer, Steven Levitt and Kevin Murphy, a crack index was calculated using information on cocaine-related arrests, deaths, and drug raids, along with low birth rates and media coverage in the United States. The crack index aimed to create a proxy for the percentage of cocaine related incidents that involved crack. Crack was an almost unknown drug until 1985. This abrupt introductory date allows for the estimation and use of the index with the knowledge that values prior to 1985 are zero.Beverly Xaviera Watkins, et al. \\"Arms against Illness: Crack Cocaine and Drug Policy in the United States.\\" Health and Human Rights, vol. 2, no. 4, 1998, pp. 42‚Äì58. This index showed that the Northeast U.S. was most affected by the crack epidemic. The U.S. cities with the highest crack index were New York, Newark and Philadelphia. The same index used by Fryer, Levitt and MurphyFryer, Roland G., et al. \\"Measuring Crack Cocaine And Its Impact.\\" Economic Inquiry, vol. 51, no. 3, July 2013, pp. 1651‚Äì1681., doi:10.1111/j.1465-7295.2012.00506.x. was then implemented in a study that investigated the effects of crack cocaine across the United States. In cities with populations over 350,000 the instances of crack cocaine were twice as high as those in cities with a population less than 350,000. These indicators show that the use of crack cocaine was much higher in urban areas. States and regions with concentrated urban populations were affected at a much higher rate, while states with primarily rural populations were least affected. Maryland, New York and New Mexico had the highest instances of crack cocaine, while Idaho, Minnesota and Vermont had the lowest instances of crack cocaine use. Crime Between 1984 and 1989, the homicide rate for black males aged 14 to 17 more than doubled, and the homicide rate for black males aged 18 to 24 increased nearly as much. During this period, the black community also experienced a 20‚Äì100% increase in fetal death rates, low birth-weight babies, weapons arrests, and the number of children in foster care. The United States remains the largest overall consumer of narcotics in the world as of 2014.How bad was Crack Cocaine? The Economics of an Illicit Drug Market. Researched by Steven D. Levitt and Kevin M. Murphy .The World Factbook . Cia.gov. Retrieved on 2014-05-12. A 2018 study found that the crack epidemic had long-run consequences for crime, contributing to the doubling of the murder rate of young black males soon after the start of the epidemic, and that the murder rate was still 70 percent higher 17 years after crack's arrival. The paper estimated that eight percent of the murders in 2000 are due to the long-run effects of the emergence of crack markets, and that the elevated murder rates for young black males can explain a significant part of the gap in life expectancy between black and white males. The reasons for these increases in crime were mostly because distribution of the drug to the end-user occurred mainly in low-income inner city neighborhoods. This gave many inner-city residents the opportunity to move up the \\"economic ladder\\" in a drug market that allowed dealers to charge a low minimum price. Crack cocaine use and distribution became popular in cities that were in a state of social and economic chaos such as New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta. \\"As a result of the low-skill levels and minimal initial resource outlay required to sell crack, systemic violence flourished as a growing army of young, enthusiastic inner-city crack sellers attempt to defend their economic investment.\\"Inciardi, 1994 Once the drug became embedded in the particular communities, the economic environment that was best suited for its survival caused further social disintegration within that city. Sentencing disparities In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the possession or trafficking of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine, which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly African-Americans, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine. This 100:1 ratio had been required under federal law since 1986.Durbin's Fair Sentencing Act Passed By House, Sent To President For Signature, durbin.senate.gov. Retrieved September 30, 2010. Persons convicted in federal court of possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine received a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years in federal prison. On the other hand, possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine carries the same sentence. In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act cut the sentencing disparity to 18:1. In the year 2000, the number of incarcerated African Americans had become 26 times the amount it had been in 1983. In 2012, 88% of imprisonments from crack cocaine were African American. Further, the data shows the discrepancy between lengths of sentences of crack cocaine and heroin. The majority of crack imprisonments are placed in the 10‚Äì20 year range, while the imprisonments related to heroin use or possession range from 5‚Äì10 years which has led many to question and analyze the role race plays in this disparity. Post epidemic commentary In 2007, Memphis black writer Demico Boothe, who spent 12 years in federal prison after being arrested for the first-time offense of selling crack cocaine at the age of 18, published the book, \\"Why Are So Many Black Men in Prison?\\" The book makes the same essential charges that are made in the better-known book published five years later by Michelle Alexander, cited below. Writer and lawyer Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness argues that punitive laws against drugs like crack cocaine adopted under the Reagan Administration's War on drugs resulted in harsh social consequences, including large numbers of young black men imprisoned for long sentences, the exacerbation of drug crime despite a decrease in illegal drug use in the United States, increased police brutality against the black community resulting in injury and death for many black men, women, and children. According to Alexander, society turned into a racist criminal justice system to avoid exhibiting obvious racism. Since African Americans were the majority users of crack cocaine, it provided a platform for the government to create laws that were specific to crack. This was an effective way to imprison black people without having to do the same to white Americans. Thus, there was a discourse of African Americans and a perpetuated narrative about crack addiction that was villainous and problematic. The criminalizing of African American crack users was portrayed as dangerous and harmful to society. Alexander writes that felony drug convictions for crack cocaine fell disproportionately on young black men, who then lost access to voting, housing, and employment opportunities. These economic setbacks led to increased violent crime in poor black communities as families did what they had to do to survive. Alexander explains the process of someone who is caught with crack: first, the arrest and the court hearing that will result in jail or prison-time. Second, the aftermath of permanent stigmas attached to someone who has done jail-time for crack, like being marked a felon on their record. This affects job opportunity, housing opportunity, and creates obstacles for people who are left with little motivation to follow the law, making it more likely that they will be arrested again. =Dark Alliance series= San Jose Mercury News journalist Gary Webb sparked national controversy with his 1996 Dark Alliance series which alleged that the influx of Nicaraguan cocaine started and significantly fueled the 1980s crack epidemic. Investigating the lives and connections of Los Angeles crack dealers Ricky Ross, Oscar Danilo Bland√≥n, and Norwin Meneses, Webb alleged that profits from these crack sales were funneled to the CIA-supported Contras. The United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General rejected Webb's claim that there was a \\"systematic effort by the CIA to protect the drug trafficking activities of the Contras\\". The DOJ/OIG reported: \\"We found that Blandon and Meneses were plainly major drug traffickers who enriched themselves at the expense of countless drug users and the communities in which these drug users lived, just like other drug dealers of their magnitude. They also contributed some money to the Contra cause. But we did not find that their activities were the cause of the crack epidemic in Los Angeles, much less in the United States as a whole, or that they were a significant source of support for the Contras.\\"https://oig.justice.gov/special/9712/ch12.htm#Chapter%20XII: Influence on popular culture =Documentary films= *High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell (1995) *Cocaine Cowboys (2006) *Crackheads Gone Wild (2006) *American Drug War: The Last White Hope (2007) *Cocaine Cowboys 2 (2008) *Freakonomics (2010) *Planet Rock: The Story of Hip-Hop and the Crack Generation (2011) *The Seven Five (2014) *Freeway: Crack in the System (2015) *13th (2016) =Documentary serials= *Drugs, Inc.

The French Union forces, led by World War II hero Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, inflicted a defeat on Vi·ªát Minh forces, which were commanded by General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p. The French Union victory, however, was not decisive and the Vi·ªát Minh would attack again shortly afterwards. Prelude After suffering a heavy setback at the Battle of Vƒ©nh Y√™n, Gi√°p decided to attack the port of H·∫£i Ph√≤ng, the centerpiece of French logistics. Gi√°p planned to breach the French defenses at M·∫°o Kh√™, which was about 20 miles north of the port. He hoped that the fresh 316th Division, supported by diversionary attacks from the 304th and 320th divisions, would be enough to break the French. M·∫°o Kh√™ was poorly defended. It was encircled by a series of outposts, with the town itself held by an armored car platoon of the Moroccan Colonial Infantry. The M·∫°o Kh√™ coal mine was located 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) to the north of the town and was garrisoned by a company of partisans commanded by a Vietnamese lieutenant and three French NCOs. To the east of the town, a company from the 30th Senegalese Composite Battalion guarded a fortified Roman Catholic church. In total, the French had about 400 troops. Battle After diversionary thrusts on 23 March, the Vi·ªát Minh began to assail M·∫°o Kh√™'s outposts later in the night. They had carried all major positions by 26 March and prepared for the main attack on the city. At this point, the anticipated communist attack stalled under heavy pressure from French naval forces, which had managed to approach M·∫°o Kh√™ via a deep channel in the nearby ƒê√† B·∫Øc River. The Vi·ªát Minh's losses were about 30 KIAs and 80 WIAs.History of the 312nd1st Corps High Command: Battles ... De Lattre was uncertain of Gi√°p's intentions, but he did send the 6th Colonial Parachute Battalion (6e BPC) and some artillery batteries to relieve the beleaguered forces at M·∫°o Kh√™. Early in the morning of 27 March, the Vi·ªát Minh 209th Regiment of the 312nd Division launched a massive attack against the coal mine, whose defenders resisted until French B-26s and Hellcats alleviated the pressure. After exhausting their ammunition, the partisans beat a skillful retreat to M·∫°o Kh√™. The Vi·ªát Minh's losses were 46 KIAs, 209 WIAs, and 14 MIAs. At 02:00 on 28 March, the Vi·ªát Minh opened up a torrent of artillery and mortar fire against the town. The 36th Regiment of the 308th Division launched a number of mass infantry assaults which were repulsed by well-placed French artillery. The Vi·ªát Minh eventually entered the town and a bloody hand-to-hand confrontation began, although the momentum of the attack had petered out. The Vietnamese withdrew later in the morning with 58 KIAs and 137 WIAs. Aftermath Casualties had been light for the French and, at around 3,000, heavy for the Vi·ªát Minh by French estimates. Vietnamese figures are about 150 KIAs and 426 WIAs. Although the French had been victorious, Gi√°p's losses were not nearly as bad as at Vƒ©nh Y√™n two months previously. Gi√°p would make another unsuccessful attempt to breach the French lines in late May.

It is located at 54 Washington Street in the Easton's Point neighborhood, near the northern end of the Newport Historic District. History The original portion of Hunter House was built in 1748 for Colonial Deputy Governor Jonathan Nichols Jr. This large 2¬Ω-story house has a balustraded gambrel roof and heavy stud construction. In 1756, the property was sold to Colonel Joseph Wanton Jr., who was a deputy governor of the colony and a merchant. Wanton enlarged the house by adding a south wing and a second chimney, transforming the building into a formal Georgian mansion with a large central hall. Wanton remained a Loyalist during the American Revolution, and General William West ordered him to be imprisoned in Providence and tried by the legislature. He ultimately fled Newport when the British left the city. Local legend has it that space was at a premium aboard British ships when Loyalists were fleeing Newport, but Wanton had his own ship filled with goods and merchandise in preparation for what he hoped would be a short exile. However, the captain of the ship set sail while Wanton was ashore bidding farewell to his wife and turned over the ship to the Patriots in Providence as a prize of war, thus gaining the captain and crew a share of the prize money while simultaneously depriving Wanton of his wealth. The house was then used as the headquarters of Admiral de Ternay, commander of the French fleet when French forces stayed in Newport in 1780. After the war, Senator and Ambassador William Hunter bought the house and transformed it into a formal Georgian Colonial mansion with a large central hall. The house was purchased in 1945 to prevent its demolition, leading to the formation of the Preservation Society of Newport County, and it was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 24, 1968. It is currently open for limited public tours. The house displays period furnishings by Townsend and Goddard, paintings (including one by Gilbert Stuart), and a restored 18th-century garden. It is also known for its woodwork, including a carved pineapple over the doorway, a symbol of welcome throughout Colonial America. During the restoration, cabinetry that had been made in Newport was recovered from as far away as Scotland and installed in the house. Ralph Carpenter supervised the furniture restoration which includes \\"floor-to- ceiling paneling framed with bolection moldings, intricately twisted balusters on the stairs, eighteenth-century Delft tiles around many of the fireplaces, pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and marbleizing and grain painting throughout.\\" See also * List of National Historic Landmarks in Rhode Island * National Register of Historic Places listings in Newport County, Rhode Island References External links *Hunter House *National Historic Landmarks Program listing for Hunter House *photos Gallery Image:Hunter House Newport Rhode Island.jpgHunter House from the water side File:Historic American Buildings Survey, George F.A.

In 2009, she was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her \\"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\\", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson. To date, she remains the first of only two women to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, the other being Esther Duflo. After graduating with a B.A. and Ph.D. from UCLA, Ostrom lived in Bloomington, Indiana, and served on the faculty of Indiana University, with a late-career affiliation with Arizona State University. She was Distinguished Professor at Indiana University and the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science and co-director of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, as well as research professor and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity at Arizona State University in Tempe. She was a lead researcher for the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Collaborative Research Support Program (SANREM CRSP), managed by Virginia Tech and funded by USAID. Beginning in 2008, she and her husband Vincent Ostrom advised the journal Transnational Corporations Review.  Personal life and education  Elinor Claire Awan was born in Los Angeles, California as the only child of Leah Hopkins, a musician, and Adrian Awan, a set designer. Her parents separated early in her life, and Elinor lived with her mother most of the time. She attended a Protestant church with her mother and often spent weekends with her father's Jewish family. Growing up in the post-Depression era to divorced artisans, Ostrom described herself as a \\"poor kid.\\" Her major recreational activity was swimming, where she eventually joined a swimming team and swam competitively until she started teaching swimming to earn funds to help put herself through college. Ostrom grew up across the street from Beverly Hills High School, which she attended, graduating in 1951. She regarded this as fortunate, for the school had a very high rate of college admittance. During Ostrom's junior year, she was encouraged to join the debate team. Learning debate tactics had an important impact on her ways of thinking. It allowed her to realize there are two sides to public policy and it is imperative to have quality arguments for both sides. As a high school student, Elinor Ostrom had been discouraged from studying trigonometry, as girls without top marks in algebra and geometry were not allowed to take the subject. No one in her immediate family had any college experience, but seeing that 90% of students in her high school attended college, she saw it as the \\"normal\\" thing to do. Her mother did not wish for her to attend college, seeing no reason for it. She attended UCLA, receiving a B.A. (with honors) in political science at UCLA in 1954. By attending multiple summer session and extra classes throughout semesters, she was able to graduate in three years. She worked at the library, dime store and bookstore in order to pay her fees which were $50 per semester. She married a classmate, Charles Scott, and worked at General Radio in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while Scott attended Harvard Law School. They divorced several years later when Ostrom began contemplating a Ph.D. After graduation, she had trouble finding a job because employers presumed that she was only looking for jobs as a teacher or secretary. She began a job as an export clerk after taking a correspondence course for shorthand, which she later found to be helpful when taking notes in face-to-face interviews on research projects. After a year, she obtained a position as assistant personnel manager in a business firm that had never before hired a woman in anything but a secretarial position. This job inspired her to think about attending graduate- level courses and eventually applying for a research assistantship and admission to a Ph.D. program. Lacking trigonometry from high school, she was consequently rejected for an economics Ph.D. at UCLA.Elinor Ostrom. https://www.ubs.com/microsites/nobel-perspectives/en/elinor-ostrom.html in UBS Nobel Perspectives interview, 2009. She was admitted to UCLA's graduate program in political science, where she was awarded an M.A. in 1962 and a Ph.D. in 1965. She married political scientist Vincent Ostrom in 1963, whom she met while assisting his research on water resource governance in Southern California. The teams of graduate students she was involved with were analyzing the political economic effects of a group of groundwater basins in Southern California. Specifically, Ostrom was assigned to look at the West Basin. She found it is very difficult to manage a common-pool resource when it is used between individuals. In 1961 Vincent Ostrom, Charles Tiebout and Robert Warren published \\"The Organization of Government in Metropolitan Areas,\\" which would go on to be an influential article and introduced themes that would be central to the Ostroms' work. However, the article aggravated a conflict with UCLA's Bureau of Governmental Research because, counter to the Bureau's interests, it advised against centralization of metropolitan areas in favor of polycentrism. This conflict prompted the Ostroms to leave UCLA. They moved to Bloomington, Indiana, in 1965, when Vincent accepted a political science professorship at Indiana University. She joined the faculty as Visiting Assistant Professor. The first course she taught was an evening class on American government.  Career  Ostrom was richly informed by fieldwork, both her own and that of others. During her PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, she spent years studying the water wars and pumping races going on in the 1950s in her own dry backyard. In contrast to the prevailing rational-economic predictions of Malthusianism and the tragedy of the commons, she showed cases where humans were not trapped and helpless amid diminishing supplies. In her book Governing the Commons, she draws on studies of irrigation systems in Spain and Nepal, mountain villages in Switzerland and Japan, and fisheries in Maine and Indonesia. In 1973, Ostrom and her husband founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University. Examining the use of collective action, trust, and cooperation in the management of common pool resources (CPR), her institutional approach to public policy, known as the Institutional analysis and development framework (IAD), has been considered sufficiently distinct to be thought of as a separate school of public choice theory. She authored many books in the fields of organizational theory, political science, and public administration. Elinor Ostrom was a dedicated scholar until the very end of her life. Indeed, on the day before she died, she sent e-mail messages to at least two different sets of coauthors about papers that she was writing with them. She was the chief scientific advisor for the International Council for Science (ICSU) Planet Under Pressure meeting in London in March, and Johan Rockstrom of the Stockholm Resilience Centre wrote that > \\"Lin, up until the very end, was heavily involved in our preparations for > the Nobel laureate dialogues on global sustainability we will be hosting in > Rio 17th and 18th of June during the UN Rio+20 Earth Summit. In the end, she > decided she could not come in person, but was contributing sharp, > enthusiastically charged, inputs, in the way only she could.\\"\\"Ostrom Facts\\", > Nobel Prize.org It was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable. She was senior research director of the Vincent and Elinor Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, Distinguished Professor and Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science in the College of Arts and Sciences, and professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Research  Ostrom's early work emphasized the role of public choice on decisions influencing the production of public goods and services. Among her better known works in this area is her study on the polycentricity of police functions in Indianapolis. Caring for the commons had to be a multiple task, organised from the ground up and shaped to cultural norms. It had to be discussed face to face, and based on trust. Dr. Ostrom, besides poring over satellite data and quizzing lobstermen herself, enjoyed employing game theory to try to predict the behaviour of people faced with limited resources. In her Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University‚Äîset up with her husband Vincent, a political scientist, in 1973‚Äîher students were given shares in a national commons. When they simply discussed what they should do before they did it, their rate of return from their \\"investments\\" more than doubled. Her later, and more famous, work focused on how humans interact with ecosystems to maintain long-term sustainable resource yields. Common pool resources include many forests, fisheries, oil fields, grazing lands, and irrigation systems. She conducted her field studies on the management of pasture by locals in Africa and irrigation systems management in villages of western Nepal (e.g., Dang Deukhuri). Her work has considered how societies have developed diverse institutional arrangements for managing natural resources and avoiding ecosystem collapse in many cases, even though some arrangements have failed to prevent resource exhaustion. Her work emphasized the multifaceted nature of human‚Äìecosystem interaction and argues against any singular \\"panacea\\" for individual social-ecological system problems. The Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis was meant to utilize diverse scholars throughout economics, political science, and other fields to collaborate and attempt to understand how institutional arrangements in a diverse set of ecological and social economic political settings affected behavior and outcomes. The goal was not to fly around the world collecting data, rather it is to create a network of scholars who live in particular areas of the world and had strong interests in forest conditions and forest policy conducted the studies. =Design principles for Common Pool Resource (CPR) institution= Ostrom identified eight \\"design principles\\" of stable local common pool resource management: # Clearly defined (clear definition of the contents of the common pool resource and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties); # The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions; # Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process; # Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators; # A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules; # Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access; # Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and # In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level. These principles have since been slightly modified and expanded to include a number of additional variables believed to affect the success of self-organized governance systems, including effective communication, internal trust and reciprocity, and the nature of the resource system as a whole. Ostrom and her many co-researchers have developed a comprehensive \\"Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework\\", within which much of the still-evolving theory of common-pool resources and collective self- governance is now located. =Environmental protection= According to the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, \\"Ostrom cautioned against single governmental units at global level to solve the collective action problem of coordinating work against environmental destruction. Partly, this is due to their complexity, and partly to the diversity of actors involved. Her proposal was that of a polycentric approach, where key management decisions should be made as close to the scene of events and the actors involved as possible.\\" Ostrom helped disprove the idea held by economists that natural resources would be over-used and destroyed in the long run. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters in Maine and Indonesia, and forests in Nepal. She showed that when natural resources are jointly managed by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.Vedeld, Trond. 2010, February 12. \\"A New Global Game ‚Äì And How Best to Play It,\\" The NIBR International Blog. =Ostrom's law= Ostrom's law is an adage that represents how Elinor Ostrom's works in economics challenge previous theoretical frameworks and assumptions about property, especially the commons. Ostrom's detailed analyses of functional examples of the commons create an alternative view of the arrangement of resources that are both practically and theoretically possible. This eponymous law is stated succinctly by Lee Anne Fennell as: > A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory.  Awards and recognition  Ostrom was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and president of the American Political Science Association and the Public Choice Society. In 1999, she became the first woman to receive the prestigious Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science. Ostrom was awarded the Frank E. Seidman Distinguished Award for Political Economy in 1998. Her presented paper, on \\"The Comparative Study of Public Economies\\", was followed by a discussion among Kenneth Arrow, Thomas Schelling and Amartya Sen. She was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, and, in 2005, received the James Madison Award by the American Political Science Association. In 2008, she became the first woman to receive the William H. Riker Prize in political science; and, the following year, she received the Tisch Civic Engagement Research Prize from the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University. In 2010, the Utne Reader magazine included Ostrom as one of the \\"25 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World\\". She was named one of Time magazine's \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\" in 2012. The International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded its Honorary Fellowship to her in 2002.Telephone interview with Elinor Ostrom.In 2008 she was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In July 2019, Indiana University Bloomington announced that as part of their Bridging the Visibility Gap initiative, a statue of Ostrom would be placed outside of the building which houses the University's political science department. =Nobel Prize in Economics= In 2009, Ostrom became the first woman to receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. \\"The announcement of her prize caused amazement to several economists,\\" a Princeton economics professor said, \\"including some prominent colleagues who had never even heard of her.\\" The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Ostrom \\"for her analysis of economic governance\\", saying her work had demonstrated how common property could be successfully managed by groups using it. Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson shared the 10-million Swedish kronor (‚Ç¨990,000; $1.44 million) prize for their separate work in economic governance. As she had done with previous monetary prizes, Ostrom donated her award to the Workshop she helped to found. Elinor Ostrom with the other 2009 Nobel Laureates. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Ostrom's \\"research brought this topic from the fringe to the forefront of scientific attention...by showing how common resources‚Äîforests, fisheries, oil fields or grazing lands‚Äîcan be managed successfully by the people who use them rather than by governments or private companies\\". Ostrom's work in this regard challenged conventional wisdom, showing that common resources can be successfully managed without government regulation or privatization.  Death  Ostrom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October 2011. During the final year of her life, she continued to write and lecture, giving the Hayek Lecture at the Institute of Economic Affairs just eleven weeks before her death. She died at 6:40 a.m. Tuesday, June 12, 2012, at IU Health Bloomington Hospital at the age of 78. On the day of her death, she published her last article, \\"Green from the Grassroots,\\" in Project Syndicate. Indiana University president Michael McRobbie wrote: \\"Indiana University has lost an irreplaceable and magnificent treasure with the passing of Elinor Ostrom\\". Her Indiana colleague Michael McGinnis commented after her death that Ostrom donated her share of the $1.4 million Nobel award money to the Workshop‚Äîthe biggest, by far, of several academic prizes with monetary awards that the Ostroms had given to the center over the years. Her husband Vincent died 17 days later from complications related to cancer. He was 92.  Selected publications  = Books =   = Chapters in books = * = Journal articles =  Pdf version.

The term was defined by the lexicographer Eric Partridge in his Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (several editions 1937‚Äì61).  Rugger, footer and soccer  The \\"-er\\" gave rise to such words as rugger for Rugby football, soccer (or the rarer togger) and the now archaic footer was used for association football. The term \\"soccer\\", derived from a transformation/emendation of the \\"assoc\\" in Association football, was popularised by a prominent English footballer, Charles Wreford-Brown (1866‚Äì1951). Ekblom mentions that while he was up at Oxford, Charles Wreford- Brown was asked at breakfast if he was playing rugger \\"No\\" he replied \\"I'm playing soccer\\" (Granville, 1969, p. 29). But Ekblom opinions that like the William Webb Ellis rugby story it is most likely apocryphal. The first recorded use of \\"soccer\\" was in 189519th Cent. Nov. 862. \\"When the boat~race, sports, and 'soccer' are in most men's minds.\\" OED (soccer) (or even earlier in 1892). Two years earlier The Western Gazette reported that \\"W. Neilson was elected captain of 'rugger' and T. N. Perkins of 'socker'\\"1893 Westm. Gaz. 17 Oct. 5/3. OED (rugby). and Henry Watson Fowler recommended socker in preference to \\"soccer\\" to emphasise its correct pronunciation (i.e. hard \\"cc/ck\\").A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, 1926. See also Susie Dent on Countdown, Channel 4 TV, 30 June 2009. In this context, he suggested that \\"baccy\\", because of the \\"cc\\" in \\"tobacco\\", was \\"more acceptable than soccer\\" (there being no \\"cc\\" in \\"Association\\"). \\"Socker\\" was the form that appeared in the first edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary (1911).The Times, 18 August 2011 The sports writer E. W. Swanton, who joined the London Evening Standard in 1927, recalled that \\"Rugby football ... in those days, I think, was never called anything but rugger unless it were just football\\".E. W. Swanton (1972) Sort of a Cricket Person Around the same time the Conservative Minister Leo Amery noted that, for his thirteen-year-old son Jack, \\"footer in the rain [was] a very real grievance\\" at Harrow School.See David Faber (2005) Speaking for England =In literature= In Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited (1945), Oxford undergraduate Anthony Blanche claims that \\"I was lunching with my p-p- preposterous tutor. He thought it very odd my leaving when I did. I told him I had to change for f-f-footer.\\" In Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves (1963), a novel of P. G. Wodehouse (1881‚Äì1975), Bertie Wooster was asked whether he was fond of rugger, to which he replied \\"I don't think I know him\\". As late as 1972 the retired headmaster of a Hertfordshire grammar school recalled \\"the footer\\" (by which he meant rugby) having had a poor season in 1953‚Äì4.Ernest H. Jenkins, Elizabethan Headmaster 1930‚Äì1961  What is and is not  Typically such words are formed by abbreviating or altering the original word and adding \\"-er\\". Words to which \\"-er\\" is simply suffixed to provide a word with a different, though related, meaning ‚Äì such as \\"Peeler\\" (early Metropolitan policeman, after Sir Robert Peel) and \\"exhibitioner\\" (an undergraduate holding a type of scholarship called an exhibition) ‚Äì are not examples. Nor are slang nouns like \\"bounder\\" or \\"scorcher\\", formed by adding \\"-er\\" to a verb. \\"Topper\\" (for \\"top hat\\") may appear to be an example, but as a word meaning excellent person or thing, existed from the early 18th century. Both \\"top hat\\" and \\"topper\\" as synonymous terms date from Regency times (c.1810‚Äì20) and Partridge (op. cit.) seems to suggest that the former, itself originally slang, may have been derived from the latter.Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, op. cit. Words like \\"rotter\\" (a disagreeable person, after \\"rotten\\") are somewhere in between. Fiver and tenner (for five and ten pound note respectively) probably do fit the \\"-er\\" mould, as, more obviously, does oncer (one pound note), though this was always less prevalent than the higher denominations and is virtually obsolete following the introduction of the pound coin in 1983. Antiquarian Tim Wonnacott used the term \\"oner\\" (sic) on an edition of BBC TV's Bargain Hunt as recently as 2007.Edition of Bargain Hunt recorded in Glasgow in 2007 and repeated on BBC1 on 9 July 2009. During the First World War the Belgian town of Ypres was known to British soldiers as \\"Wipers\\"As in the Wipers Times: see The Wipers Times: A facsimile reprint of the trench magazines: The Wipers Times-The New Church Times-The Kemmel Times-The Somme Times-The B.E.F. Times, (Herbert Jenkins, 1918) (and this is still often used by the town's inhabitants if speaking English). This had some hallmarks of an \\"-er\\" coinage and the form would have been familiar to many young officers, but \\"Wipers\\" was essentially an attempt to anglicize a name () that some soldiers found difficult to pronounce. In the BBC TV series Blackadder Goes Forth (Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, 1988), a comedy series set in the trenches during the First World War, Captain Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) and Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie) occasionally addressed Private Baldrick (Tony Robinson) as Balders. A common extension of the \\"-er\\" (though here the schwa sound is usually spelled \\"-a\\" rather than \\"-er\\") is found in names containing a pronounced \\"r\\", e.g., \\"Darren\\", \\"Barry\\", etc. where in addition to the \\"-er\\", the \\"r\\"-sound is replaced by a \\"zz\\" so one gets \\"Dazza\\" from \\"Darren\\", \\"Bazza\\" from \\"Barry\\". Test Match Special The \\"-er\\" form was famously used on BBC radio's Test Match Special by Brian Johnston (1912‚Äì94), ex-Eton and New College, Oxford, who bestowed nicknames on his fellow commentators on Test cricket: thus, Blowers for Henry Blofeld (who was known in Australia as \\"Blofly\\"), Aggers (Jonathan Agnew), Bearders (scorer Bill Frindall, known also as \\"the Bearded Wonder\\") and McGillers (Alan McGilvray of the ABC).Brian Johnston (1992) Someone Who Was The habit extended to cricketers such as Phil Tufnell (Tuffers), but the '-ie' suffix is more common for the current crop of commentating ex-players, such as Michael Vaughan (\\"Vaughnie\\") or Shane Warne (\\"Warnie\\"). The former Hampshire County Cricket Club captain Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie, whose most usual nickname was McCrackers,Wisden 2007 was sometimes addressed as Ingers when he made occasional appearances on TMS and former Middlesex bowler and journalist Mike Selvey was referred to as Selvers.Test Match Special, 2 January 2007 The programme's producer, Peter Baxter, cited Backers as his own nickname and Jenkers that of commentator and cricketing journalist, Christopher Martin- JenkinsPeter Baxter (ed 1981) Test Match Special (though the latter was better known by his initials, \\"CMJ\\"). Johnston himself was known as Johnners. Following his death in 1994, the satirical magazine Private Eye published a cartoon of Johnston arriving at the gates of heaven with the greeting \\"Morning, Godders\\". An earlier Eye cartoon by McLachlan, reproduced in the 2007 edition of Wisden, included in its long caption a reference to former England bowler Fred Trueman as Fredders (in fact, his common nickname, bestowed by Johnston, was \\"Sir Frederick\\"), while yummers (i.e. \\"yummy\\") was applied to \\"another lovely cake sent in by one of our listeners\\". Blowers (Henry Blofeld) has continued the tradition, referring on one occasion to a particular stroke as inexplickers (inexplicable).Andrew John and Stephen Blake (2004) Cricket‚Äîit's a funny old game  Other personal forms  Other \\"-er\\"s as personal names include: *Athers: Lancashire and England cricket captain Michael Atherton (b. 1968), who subsequently became a commentator on both radio and TV (\\"all cricket-lovers have crackpot theories, even Athers\\"); *Beckers: former England football captain David Beckham (b. 1975) became known almost universally as \\"Becks\\" (and with his wife Victoria, formerly of the Spice Girls, as \\"Posh and Becks\\"), but there are some instances of his being referred to as \\"Beckers\\"For example, Scottish Sunday Herald, 21 September 2003); *Beemer: Rich Beem, professional golfer, television commentator and analyst. *Betjers: as an undergraduate, the poet John Betjeman (1906‚Äì1984) was generally known as \\"Betjy\\" or \\"Betj\\", but Philip Larkin, among others, later adopted the \\"-er\\" form; *Blashers: the magazine Country Life referred to the explorer Colonel John Blashford-Snell (b. 1936) as \\"Blashers\\" (as in \\"Hats off to Blashers\\", reporting his having assisted in the design a hat for explorersCountry Life, 29 June 2006); *Brackers: Football commentator Peter Brackley was known as \\"Brackers\\". Tim Wonnacott also used this form with reference to Bargain Hunt expert James Braxton (owner of Edgar Horns Auctioneers, Eastbourne) during the 2008 series of the programme. *Britters: American singer Britney Spears (b. 1981) was often described in the British press as \\"Britters\\".Sky Showbiz, 3 February 2006 Unsurprisingly, her boyfriend when she first rose to fame, the singer Justin Timberlake (b. 1981), was Timbers. *Bozzer (or \\"Bozza\\"): British Prime Minister Boris Johnson (b. 1964) *Camers or Cammers: applied occasionally to British Prime Minister David Cameron (b. 1966), notably by bloggers or spoof writers and especially with reference to his educational background (Eton and Oxford);See, for example, New Statesman, 26 March 2007 *Cheggers: broadcaster Keith Chegwin (1957-2017); *Chunners: Street Fighter video game character Chun-li; *Cleggers: Nick Clegg (b. 1967), British Deputy Prime Minister 2010-2015: shortly after the formation of a coalition government, a cartoon by Peter Brookes of The Times, had Prime Minister David Cameron saying, \\"Polish these [boots], Cleggers, old son ...\\";The Times, 13 May 2010 *Crabbers: former Sunderland AFC local radio commentator Simon Crabtree; *Griggers: recounting how she met John Betjeman, Alice Jennings, a programme engineer at the BBC during the Second World War referred to producer Geoffrey Grigson (1905‚Äì85) as follows: \\"'John said, 'Who's that girl?'

The common abbreviation 'bant' is an archaism - the word banter people hold to have been derived from actually being slang itself, a cruel victim of the Oxford 'er'. The original word bant refers to a drinking toll exacted on those passing from the main quadrangle of University College, Oxford to its secondary Radcliffe 'quad' between the hours of 7 and 10 PM, The tollgate itself being the entrance to a shared student room, and the toll being the rapid consumption of an alcoholic beverage.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper who made nearly 300 appearances in the Football League and Premier League playing for Mansfield Town, Chelsea and Northampton Town. Playing career Hitchcock was born in Canning Town, London, and played non-league football for Barking, having been on Chelsea Youth books for 1978/9 but playing just 2 games plus 1 substitution appearance in their Junior League team, before being released at the end of the season. He joined Nottingham Forest in 1983 for a fee of ¬£15,000. He spent time on loan to Mansfield Town in 1984, and joined the club for a fee of ¬£140,000 at the end of the 1983‚Äì84 season without having played for Forest's first team. He stayed with Mansfield for four seasons, helping the club to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1986, and played a major part in their 1987 Football League Trophy victory against Bristol City, saving two penalties in the shootout. Hitchcock joined Chelsea for ¬£250,000 in March 1988, and made his debut on 26 March in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Southampton. He remained at Chelsea until 2001 and made 96 league appearances, 4 of which were from the bench. His final appearance for Chelsea came against Tottenham in May 1999. Bad luck with injuries left him stuck behind numerous other goalkeepers in the pecking order which was one of the main reasons for him making so few appearances in all that time at the club. He left Chelsea in 2001 to take up the post of goalkeeping coach at Watford, who had just appointed Gianluca Vialli, late of Chelsea, as their new manager. Coaching career He left Watford in 2004 to link up with former Chelsea teammate Mark Hughes as goalkeeping coach at Blackburn Rovers, following him to Manchester City in 2008. On 19 December 2009, he left the club alongside Mark Hughes In March 2010, he was appointed goalkeeping coach at West Ham United, replacing Ludƒõk Miklo≈°ko, but as of June 2010 he left the club along with Steve Clarke. In August 2010 he was appointed Fulham's primary goalkeeping coach and he left Fulham in June 2011 with the arrival of new Fulham manager Martin Jol, who appointed Hans Segers as his new goalkeeping coach. In January 2012 Hitchcock linked up, once again, with former Chelsea teammate Mark Hughes at Queens Park Rangers to take up the post of goalkeeping coach. He left the club in 2015 when a contract renewal was not offered. In December 2016, Hitchcock was appointed goalkeeping coach at Birmingham City by new manager and former teammate Gianfranco Zola. He remained with the club under Zola's successors Harry Redknapp and Steve Cotterill, but left when Cotterill was sacked in March 2018 with the team in the relegation zone. In July 2018, he was appointed as a goalkeeping coach at Indian Super League club Chennaiyin FC, working under John Gregory.

The community had a population of 7,353 in 2011.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000868 History Pontprennau is the Welsh for \\"Bridge of Trees\\". Lying east-west along the foot of the hills of the South Wales valleys, with Caerphilly directly north, the area is defined by a series of hills, intersected by shallow valleys created by streams which feed as tributaries into the Rhymney River. Once a part of an area made up of several farms in Llanedeyrn, Pontprennau was designated in the 1970s for residential development, with the M4 Motorway Junction 30 developed for the purpose. It has expanded greatly since the early 1990s, driven primarily by private sector housing, and then corporate offices on Cardiff Gate.History of Pontprennau St. Mellons and Pontprennau were suburbs of Cardiff by 1974 and by the 1990s the estates started to spill over the boundaries into Lisvane and Cyncoed. The Pontprennau community was created from part of the Llanedeyrn ward of the previously existing St Mellons community in 1996. The remaining part of the St Mellons community became Old St Mellons. Today According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, there were 8,037 people living in Pontprennau. However, this has expanded greatly since, due to sustained housing development both in West Pontprennau and on further pieces of unused land. East Pontprennau, adjacent to the M4 motorway junction 30, is the commercial sector of the development, housing Cardiff Gate Business Park, Cardiff Gate services, and Cardiff Gate Retail Park. The business park provides office accommodation to regional representation for many multinational companies and is also home to the Emergency Control Centre for South Wales, as well as the fire training centre. The retail park is home to a large 24/7 Asda supermarket and petrol station,Asda Pentwyn a B&Q; DIY store, a McDonald's restaurant, a gym, coffee shop, and several home furniture stores. Central Pontprennau is mainly devoted to housing development. The northern edge and highest point in the community is where the community centre, the church, Pontprennau Primary School and Pontprennau Medical Centre, dentist and pharmacy are located. At the bottom of the hill is the western edge, which has a small commercial area, with a large proportion of the land dedicated to industrial use now being converted to private sector housing. It also houses a Waitrose supermarket and the Spire Healthcare hospital. West Pontprennau is the newest of the three areas. It consists mainly of residential housing, but it also contains an Aldi supermarket and Cyncoed Medical Centre, which transferred from Cyncoed to Pontprennau in 2005. =School= Pontprennau Primary school opened in September 2015. It is a 2 Form of Entry school with 48 full-time equivalent nursery places. The school was completed in two phases. The first phase was ready in time for the school year starting September 2015. At this stage the school had two reception classes plus a nursery. The school was then fully open in time for the school year commencing September 2016. The establishment of a primary school within Pontprennau aims to stop the over subscription of children attending schools in Lisvane and Llanishen. This project forms part of Cardiff Councils 21st Century Schools Programme which is 50% funding by Welsh Government. Proposed expansion There are several sites remaining within the area with potential to be developed. The first is to the east in a plot east of the linkroad between Pontprenau and Old St Mellons. Scheduled to provide an additional 50 or more houses, this has now been turned down twice on planning permission. Developments further east would be barred, due to the scheduled green land space between Cardiff and Newport, in which Old St Mellons lies. A proposed major expansion of the area to the west by the Welsh Assembly Government is opposed by Cardiff Council. This would see a development by Redrow plc of a further 4,000 houses in the farmland lying between West Pontprennau and Lisvane. However, since the late-2000s financial crisis, and with apartments lying empty in Cardiff Bay and the councils pressing for development of brown field sites within the city first, development is delayed with no timescale. In July 2012, Cardiff Council's preferred new Local Development Plan was released. The plan proposed 45,000 new homes to be built in Cardiff by 2026, allowing the city's population to rise by a quarter to more than 400,000. The proposal encompasses: 7,500 homes in a new suburb west of Pentrebane; 2,000 homes on land north of junction 33 on the M4; and 6,000 west and 2,000 east of Pontprennau. The Pontprennau development would extend: *West: 6,000 homes between Pontprennau to Lisvane, stretching as far north as the M4 *East: 2,000 homes in the green land, defined by a border south of the M4 and east to the border with Newport, connecting or subsuming Pontprennau and Old St Mellons Transport The A4232 Pentwyn Link Road marks the eastern edge of Pontprennau. View heading north towards Pontprennau roundabout, beyond which is the M4 motorway Pontprennau has good transportation links, being located next to the M4 motorway junction 30. Public transport is provided by Cardiff Bus, which serves Pontprennau with services 57 and 58, with buses running approximately every 7‚Äì8 minutes during peak time, taking around 40 minutes to reach Cardiff Central bus station via Pentwyn, Llanedeyrn, Penylan and Roath. Services 51 and 53 run through west and central Pontprenau to the city centre via the Heath hospital, and the 52 service stops near west Pontprenau, running to the city centre approximately every half hour via Cyncoed, Penylan and Roath. Additionally NAT Group operates the X1 bus, running from Cardiff Gate in East Pontprenau to Culverhouse Cross via the city centre. On the council's bicycle network plan, Pontprennau is linked directly to the city centre via onroad routes via Pentwyn. However, to the south a gravel trail path runs along the flood plain of the Rhymney River on the Llanrumney side of the A48 link road, which is easily accessible via tarmac paths which run north-south within the Pontprennau community. The Rhymney River trail gives both walkers and cyclists easy access to the Newport Road both west and east of Llanrumney, and hence via the eastern entrance through Llanrumney Bowls club to the extensive retail park on Newport Road West. Sport The field is the home of the \\"Pontprennau Pumas\\", the local football team, running two adult teams in the Cardiff Combination Leagues. They also have teams at under 12's and under 11's.

For Britain, the idea of a submarine cruiser had been proposed as early as 1915, but the type was not put into practice until 1921. X1, which was based on the uncompleted German U-173 class of 2,000-ton \\"U-cruisers\\", was laid down on 2 November 1921 at the Naval Dockyard Chatham and completed on 23 September 1925, commissioning in December 1925. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, of which Britain was a signatory, did not ban submarines but it did ban their use against merchant ships, which was X1s unacknowledged purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates. Therefore, a certain amount of secrecy surrounded X1, the government even going to the lengths of taking a national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized. Description The X1s thick pressure hull was in diameter amidships, and was divided into 10 watertight compartments. This was almost completely surrounded by her external hull, which also contained the main ballast tanks and most of her fuel. Her intended maximum diving depth was , but was reduced to once in service.Brown 1982, p. 232 =Armament= X1 carried four QF 5.2 inch Mk I guns in twin unarmoured turrets, one forward and one aft of the conning tower. They had a range of about . A circular trunk ran from each mounting to the magazine in the pressure hull which contained 100 rounds per gun. A working chamber which was in diameter encircled the trunk between the pressure hull and the gun mount. Her ammunition hoists were problematic and could not sustain the desired rate of fire of six rounds per gun per minute. Special ballast tanks were used to compensate for the loss of weight as ammunition was fired. Working and control of the guns required no less than 58 men.Akermann 2002, p. 218 The fire-control tower was in the middle of the conning tower and had a top section that could be raised when in use. The upper control room was between the tower and the pressure hull. Just aft of the control room was the rangefinding room, with a rangefinder on the bridge that could be raised . Her six bow tubes for torpedoes came from a cancelled L-class submarine and she was provided with one reload for each tube. It took some 24 minutes to reload them all because space in the torpedo room was restricted. =Propulsion= The main engines were two 8-cylinder Admiralty diesel engines with a total output of . Two auxiliary MAN diesel engines taken from U-126 were installed for battery-charging purposes. For underwater propulsion, two GEC electric motors of each were fitted. It was hoped to achieve over using both diesels and electric motors together, but the highest power achieved (during a full power trial in March 1926) was . She had three groups of batteries, each with 110 cells weighing a total of .Brown 1982 p. 233 In theory she could make on the surface, and at economical speed she had a greater range than normal cruisers, but both sets of diesel engines suffered from continual mechanical problems that reduced her speed and range. The X1s average diving time (to periscope depth) was 2 minutes 20 seconds. Her handling underwater was considered superior to other submarines of the period.Akermann 2002, p. 220 Career After X1 was commissioned in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 she made a voyage to Gibraltar after which her main engine drive wheels were found to be damaged. After repairs she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea. Her starboard camshaft driveshaft broke during a full-power run in January 1928 and a new set of gears was needed, but after refitting at Malta her port camshaft driveshaft broke in the same place in April 1928. By 1930 her commanding officer reported \\"internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, accommodation is cramped, ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good.\\" Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up. X1 was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at Pembroke on 12 December 1936.

Street-level bureaucracy The concept of street-level bureaucracy was popularized by Michael Lipsky in 1980. He argued that \\"policy implementation in the end comes down to the people who actually implement it\\". View summary. He argued that state employees such as police and social workers should be seen as part of the \\"policy-making community\\" and as exercisers of political power. Lipsky identified several problems with street-level bureaucracy, including \\"the problem of limited resources, the continuous negotiation that is necessary in order to make it seem like one is meeting targets, and the relations with (nonvoluntary) clients\\". However, some commentators have challenged Lipsky's model. Tony Evans and John Harris argue that \\"the proliferation of rules and regulations should not automatically be equated with greater control over professional discretion; paradoxically, more rules may create more discretion.\\" They also argue that the exercise of professional discretion by street-level bureaucrats is not inherently \\"bad\\", but can be seen as an important professional attribute.

Michelet says that the elderly supervisor, Father David, \\"was an 'Adamite', preaching the nudity Adam practised in his innocence\\", but that Madeleine declined \\"to submit to this strange way of living' and incurred the displeasure of her superiors. She lived apart from the rest of the community, having been given the job of touri√®re -the nun who attends to the turning-box of a convent, by means of which communication is kept up with the outside world. Upon Father David's death, he was succeeded as cur√© by Mathurin Picard, who appointed her sacristan, pursued her with amorous intentions and magic potions, and made her pregnant. Sister Madeleine Bavent was 18 years old in 1625; the initial possession victim, she claimed to have been bewitched by the now deceased Picard, the nunnery's former director, and Father Thomas Boulle, the vicar of Louviers. Her confession to authorities claimed that the two men had abducted her and taken her to a witches' sabbat. There, she was married to the Devil, whom she called \\"Dagon\\", committed sexual acts with him on the altar, and that two men were allegedly crucified and disemboweled as these acts took place.Guiley, Rosemary. \\"Louviers possessions (1647), The Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 152 Madeleine's confession prompted the investigation, which found that other nuns reported having been brought to secret sabbats by Picard and Boulle, where sexual intercourse with demons, particularly Dagon, took place. These confessions were accompanied by what investigators believed were classic signs of demonic possession: contortions, unnatural body movements, speaking in tongues (glossolalia), obscene insults, and blasphemies. Beyond mere symptoms of possession, the body of Sister Barbara of St. Michael was said to be possessed by a specific demon named Ancitif. Exorcisms  Exorcism of Madeleine Bavent As in the Loudun possessions a decade prior, the exorcisms at Louviers were a public spectacle. Nearly every person present at the exorcisms was questioned by the inquisitors, and the entire town of Louviers began exhibiting symptoms of hysteria as the cries of the nuns undergoing exorcism rose with the screams of Father Boulle, who was tortured at the same time; Mathurin Picard had died previous to the public display. , which he would publish in 1652. In his account, nuns were said to confess further evidence against Picard and Boulle. In addition to tempting them into sexual acts, Satan (supposedly in the form of Picard and Boulle) had also tried leading the nuns down the road of heresy. Appearing to the nuns as a beautiful angel, the Devil engaged them in theological conversations so clever that they began to doubt their own teachings. When told that this was not the same information they had been taught, Satan replied that he was a messenger of heaven who was sent to reveal fatal errors in what was otherwise accepted dogma. Signs of possession continued throughout the exorcisms. One witness wrote that a nun \\"ran with movements so abrupt that it was difficult to stop her. One of the clerics present, having caught her by the arm, was surprised to find that it did not prevent the rest of her body from turning over and over as if the arm were fixed to the shoulder merely by a spring.\\" Punishment  As hysteria rose, it seemed inevitable that a trial would occur and Father Boulle's fate would be sealed. During the exorcisms, though, parliament at Rouen passed sentence: Sister Madeleine Bavent would be imprisoned for life in the church dungeon, Father Thomas Boulle would be burnt alive, and the corpse of Mathurin Picard would be exhumed and burned. Catalogue of symptoms After the nuns at Louviers were afflicted, authorities undertook the task of cataloguing the symptoms of demonic possession. The treatise they developed included fifteen indications of true possession: #To think oneself possessed. #To lead a wicked life. #To live outside the rules of society. #To be persistently ill, falling into heavy sleep and vomiting unusual objects (either such natural objects as toads, serpents, maggots, iron, stones, and so forth; or such artificial objects as nails, pins, etc.). #To utter obscenities and blasphemies. #To be troubled with spirits (\\"an absolute and inner possession and residence in the body of the person\\"). #To show a frightening and horrible countenance. #To be tired of living. #To be uncontrollable and violent. #To make sounds and movements like an animal. #To deny knowledge of fits after the paroxysm has ended. #To show fear of sacred relics and sacraments. #To curse violently at any prayer. #To exhibit acts of lewd exposure or abnormal strength. Modern viewpoints It is widely believed today that the Louviers Possessions, similar in many ways to those at Aix-en-Provence (1611), Lille (1613), and Loudun (1634) were part of a political and religious \\"show\\" in France. According to Stuart Clark, \\"Possession and exorcism were textual/theatrical allegories of the conflict between the church and Satan, a conflict that, contemporaries believed, was reaching its climax in the early modern era.\\"Clark, Stuart. Thinking with Demons, p. 393 They also differ from later cases of possession and witch-hunt hysteria like that in England and Colonial America in that they involve lurid sex themes. During the exorcisms at Louviers, nuns were seen to raise their habits and beg for sexual attention, use vulgar language, and make lascivious movements. In the earlier case at Loudun, a local doctor named Claude Quillet wrote, \\"These poor little devils of nuns, seeing themselves shut up within four walls, become madly in love, fall into a melancholic delirium, worked upon by the desires of the flesh, and in truth, what they need to be perfectly cured is a remedy of the flesh.\\" Most demonic possessions in France of this period (from the early to late 17th century) were of young women and appeared most often in the convents. Physicians and psychologists today attribute much of the activities to sexual hysteria, alluded to so long ago by Quillet. Robert Mandrou and Jean-Martin Charcot echoed many seventeenth-century physicians and following a French school of anti-Catholic medical positivism of the nineteenth century argued that mental disorders ‚Äîprimarily hysteria triggered the bizarre behaviors.Shulovsky, Moshe. \\"The Devil in the Convent\\", History Cooperatie Extreme seizures explained in the 17th century are today believed to point to epilepsy and similar diseases. In the time-frame of the cases in France, demonic possession served as a catchall explanation for any personality anomaly. Feminist historians reject the term \\"hysteria\\" as misogynistic, and reject the characterization of seventeenth century convents as places of \\"sexual frustration and/or debauchery and constant intellectual ennui.\\" Moshe Shulovsky views these instances in the context of feminine religious mysticism and notes that they tended to appear at new or recently reformed convents.  Louviers possessions in culture  Heavy metal band King Diamond's concept album \\"The Eye\\" tells the story that took place during Louviers possessions. Amongst the protagonists of the story there are Madeleine Bavent and Father Mathurin Picard.

Formerly a standard line regiment that served the Union cause in the American Civil War and the United States again in World War II and into the Cold War, the 10th Infantry Regiment is now a garrison regiment housing training cadre and trainees undergoing Basic Combat Training with the United States Army. History The regiment was first commissioned as the 10th Infantry on 3 March 1855 and was officially organized in April 1855 at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. At some point the Regiment was transferred to Fort Snelling in the Minnesota Territory for garrison duty. From there it was sent West to Utah in 1857 for the Utah War by President James Buchanan. In 1869 the regiment was consolidated with elements of the 26th Infantry Regiment after having served in the Civil War. It was assigned to the 14th Division on 5 July 1918 and stayed there until it was relieved from assignment in 1919. The regiment was inactively stationed at Camp Sherman, Ohio from December 1921 until June 1922 when it was reassigned to Fort Knox again on active duty. In 1923 it was assigned to the 5th Infantry Division and stayed there through World War II. After World War II, the regiment was stationed in Kentucky on inactive duty. In 1947 it was moved to South Carolina until 1951, when it was then stationed at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania. Due to Cold War escalations, it was sent to West Germany in 1953 on active duty. Four years later it was relieved from assignment and reorganized as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. In 1989 it was again reorganized, this time under the United States Army Regimental System, and transferred to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. The regiment was divided into three separate battalions. For the most part, they served in the same theaters. However, there are some slight differences in the active service of these battalions. =1st Battalion= The 1st battalion of this regiment was stationed at Fort Ord, California from 1961 until February 1962 when it went on active duty at Fort Carson in Colorado, where it remained until 1970. It was then relieved of its duty and reassigned to the 4th Infantry Division. Its headquarters were last transferred in 1996 to United States Army Training and Doctrine Command and activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. =2nd Battalion= The 2nd battalion was also inactivated 1 June 1957 at Fort Ord, California, and relieved from assignment to the 5th Infantry Division. After the same duties, it was activated 23 April 1960 in the Panama Canal Zone. Finally, its headquarters were transferred 4 June 1987 to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command and activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. =3rd Battalion= After 19 March 1959, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Battle Group, 10th Infantry were withdrawn from the Regular Army, allotted to the Army Reserve, and assigned to the 83d Infantry Division. It was almost immediately reactivated and consolidated with the 1st Battalion, 331st Infantry. It was later reorganized and redesignated 15 April 1963 as the 3d Battalion, 10th Infantry. In 1967, it was allotted to the regular army, and transferred to the 5th infantry division. Finally, its headquarters were transferred 4 June 1987 to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command and activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Today, the 3rd Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment conducts Basic Combat Training. The five subordinate companies conduct the transformation of civilian volunteers into competent, confident, and disciplined Soldiers who live the Army Values and are physically and mentally prepared to successfully complete the next phase of initial entry training. The Battalion is commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Mason with Command Sergeant Major Jason Duncan. =4th Battalion= * Constituted 3 March 1855 in the Regular Army as Company D, 10th Infantry and organized in June 1855 at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. * Consolidated 25 July 1869 with Company D, 26th Infantry and consolidated unit designated as Company D, 10th Infantry * (10th Infantry assigned 5 July 1918 to the 14th Division; relieved in February 1919 from assignment to the 14th Division; assigned 24 March 1923 to the 5th Division [later redesignated as the 5th Infantry Division]) * Inactivated 31 October 1929 at Fort Thomas, Kentucky * Activated 1 October 1933 at Fort Hayes, Ohio * Inactivated 20 September 1946 at Camp Campbell, Kentucky * Activated 15 July 1947 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina * Inactivated 30 April 1950 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina * Activated 1 March 1951 at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania * Inactivated 1 September 1953 at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania * Activated 25 May 1954 in Germany * Inactivated 1 June 1957 at Fort Ord, California, and relieved from assignment to the 5th Infantry Division; concurrently redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th Battle Group, 10th Infantry * Activated 19 February 1962 in the Panama Canal Zone (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated) * Reorganized and redesignated 1 October 1962 as the 4th Battalion, 10th Infantry, and assigned to the 193d Infantry Brigade * Inactivated 1 October 1983 in Panama and relieved from assignment to the 193d Infantry Brigade * Headquarters transferred 4 June 1987 to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command and activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri * Inactivated 15 April 1996 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri * Redesignated 1 October 2005 as the 4th Battalion, 10th Infantry Regiment * Activated 26 January 2009 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina Source:http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0010in004bn.htm Military service =Military action= The 10th Infantry landed in Iceland in late 1941.http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/guard-us/ch19.htm The 10th Infantry regiment saw extensive service through several wars.

He played centre-back and had the reputation of being one of the hardest defenders in the Bundesliga. He collected 48 yellow and 2 red cards. He was a favourite at Borussia Dortmund and Werder Bremen, his fans regularly chanting \\"Schuuuuuuuuuulz\\" whenever he had the ball. Fellow Bremen player Christian Schulz and fellow Dortmund player Nico Schulz, who bear no relationship to him, were regularly celebrated like this because of him.

But then, Schulz feuded with Matthias Sammer and was sent away, just before BVB won two German Championships in 1995 and 1996 and the UEFA Champions League in 1997. *Werder Bremen (1995‚Äì1997): Schulz joined Bremen just after Werder had won two German Championships and the German Cup. During his period, Werder suffered a drought and won nothing. However, in 1999, Werder won the German Cup again. In a 1997 issue of the German football magazine kicker, published when Schulz announced his retirement, he was asked in the column Mal ehrlich (Now, seriously), whether Bremen, now that Schulz was stopping, would finally win something.

He was a child prodigy, who, with encouragement from his parents, became a skilled artist by the time he was twelve. Today he is considered the \\"best- known and most respected historical artist in the country.\\" K√ºnstler began his career in the 1950s as a freelance artist, illustrating paperback book covers and men's adventure magazines. In 1965 he was commissioned by National Geographic to create what became his first historic painting. He also created posters for movies such as The Poseidon Adventure and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. And by the 1970s he was painting covers for Newsweek, Reader's Digest, and other magazines, with the bulk of his work during that period in advertising art. While many of his early magazine illustrations were for public entertainment, K√ºnstler eventually began creating military art. In 1977, his first major gallery exhibition brought new attention to his talents as a historical artist. By the 1980s he was acclaimed as America's foremost Civil War artist, and would eventually create over 350 Civil War paintings alone. Some of his paintings have changed opinions about the accuracy of early famous paintings by others, such as Emmanuel Leutze's famous \\"Washington Crossing the Delaware.\\" Besides his Civil War paintings, he created historical art of the American Revolution through the Korean and Vietnam wars, along with paintings of World War II. He painted historical events such as the Oklahoma Land Rush and new immigrants on Ellis Island. Collections of K√ºnstler's work are published as limited-edition prints, and his artistic output places him at the forefront of contemporary historical realism. NASA made him their official artist for the space shuttle Columbia. In 1982, CBS-TV had him do a painting for the 3-part mini-series The Blue and the Gray, and in 1993 a one-hour television special, Images of the Civil War - The Paintings of Mort K√ºnstler, was shown on the A&E; TV network. He has received numerous honors and awards, and at least nine books are dedicated to featuring his artwork. Some experts see him as the next Norman Rockwell.\\"Mort Kunstler, premier historical artist, exhibits 50 works in Allentown\\", The Morning Call, Oct. 11, 2014 Early years and education K√ºnstler was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1927 and raised there during the Great Depression.\\"The Art of Mort K√ºnstler\\", Saturday Evening Post, Dec. 19, 2016 His parents had Polish and Austrian roots and were of Jewish heritage. Their name derived from the German word \\"k√ºnstler,\\" which means \\"artist.\\" His great-grandfather was given that name by the Tsar of Russia as thanks after he created a carving of him when he ruled Germany. His father was an amateur artist, and both his parents saw his artistic talent at the age of two and a half.‚ÄúAn interview with artist Mort K√ºnstler ‚Äì Part 1‚Äù, Mens Pulp Mags, August 8, 2011 His father encouraged his son, who was often home sick, by setting up still lifes for him to draw. His mother also encouraged his budding talent by enrolling him in Saturday classes at the Brooklyn Museum. He said \\"My mother was a schoolteacher, and she would take me to the museums by subway every Saturday morning.\\" By the time he was in kindergarten he could already \\"draw very well,\\" he says. And when he was twelve, he adds, \\"I could draw almost as well as I can today.\\"Drawing by Mort Kunstler when he was eight years old His talent in art was further supported when he was at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. There, he along with a number of classmates, were inspired by their art teacher, Leon Friend, who had also written a book on graphic design.Heller, Steven. \\"Leon Friend: One Teacher, Many Apostles\\", Design Observer, July 21, 2007Friend, Leon; Hefter, Joseph. Graphic Design: A Library of Old and New Masters in the Graphic Arts, Amazon books After graduating high school he enrolled at Brooklyn College to study art, although his main focus changed away from art and instead toward athletics. He was diver on the swimming team and a hurdler on the track team, and sports now dominated his life. He earned awards for basketball, diving, football and track, and ultimate honors in the Brooklyn College Sports Hall of Fame. He then received a basketball scholarship from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he continued to focus on sports. But after his father suffered a heart attack, he returned to New York to help his family, and enrolled in the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. He studied to become a fine art illustrator, and graduated after three years. During his senior year he met his wife-to-be, Deborah, who was then a freshman at the school.Doherty, M. Stephen. \\"Biography of the Artist\\", The American Spirit: The Paintings of Mort Kunstler, Rutledge Hill Press (1994) p. 235 They married soon after he graduated. Among the artists whose work he studied that would influence his later career were Norman Rockwell, Winslow Homer and Frederic Remington.\\"Applying Brushstrokes to the Civil War\\", New York Times, Jan. 4, 1998 Early jobs After graduating from Pratt he worked as a freelance artist in New York, where he tried to get assignments from book and magazine publishers. That goal became difficult at the time, which led him to work instead as an apprentice at a studio, where he ran errands, cleaned up and touched up paintings by other artists. K√ºnstler wanted to be a professional illustrator, but discovered that the early 1950s was a bad time to enter the field, since photography and television were replacing the need for artists. And the few magazines that still relied on artists were folding. However, he did find a niche market as a freelancer for adventure magazines, which still appreciated his art: ‚ÄúFortunately for me and other artists, some of them, like the men‚Äôs adventure magazines, would still prefer having paintings made for their covers and interior illustrations.‚ÄùExamples of early men's magazine artwork by Kunstler He continued doing those throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Although to make ends meet he had to live with his parents who supported him during this early period: ‚ÄúI worked 12 hour days, 15 hour days, sometimes seven days a week. Almost always six days a week, from nine o‚Äôclock in the morning to ten or eleven at night.‚Äù Eventually he began to share a studio with another already established adventure artist, George Gross,George Gross artworks, ArtnetGeorge Gross (1909-2003), Pulp Artists whose family was friends with his. ‚ÄúI used to call him Uncle George and I chose him as my mentor.‚Äù George, 22 years his senior, had also attended Pratt Institute, and his father had a successful art career. As a result, says K√ºnstler, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt just a kid working out of his house anymore... George sort of took me under his wing, and he taught me whatever he could. It was a wonderful thing for me.‚ÄùPerrell, Franklin Hill. ‚ÄúMort K√ºnstler - The American Spirit‚Äù, Nassau Museum, August 31, 2006 1950s1960s The Rough Riders, painted by K√ºnstler for the National Guard K√ºnstler began working full-time as a freelance artist, illustrating magazine covers and paperback fiction adventure books, typically oriented toward men, such as Sports Afield, Outdoor Life, and Stag.Men's magazine art example by Mort Kunstler K√ºnstler credits the experience gained from illustrating men‚Äôs adventure magazines in the 1950s and 1960s with teaching him how to compose and tell a story, which he says prepared him for his later work. He received his first assignment to do a historic painting from National Geographic magazine in 1965. He was to paint an illustration for a story about the history of St. Augustine, Florida. He traveled to Florida, spent an afternoon with the two National Park Service historians at the National Historic Site ‚ÄúCastillo de San Marcos‚Äù to learn whatever he could, before beginning. K√ºnstler's later historical paintings would also rely on collaboration with experts who would guide and provide him with the historic facts he needed before beginning. 1970s In the 1970s K√ºnstler painted covers for Newsweek, Reader's Digest and other magazines, although the bulk of his work during this period came from doing advertising art.Advertising art of Mort Kunstler He also did the box covers for Aurora models.‚ÄúAn interview with artist Mort K√ºnstler ‚Äì Part 2‚Äù, Mens Pulp Mags, August 24, 2011 He illustrated a number of movie posters for adventure films, such as The Poseidon Adventure (1972)Poster for The Poseidon Adventure painted by Kunstler and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974).Poster art of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three In 1975 K√ºnstler created the illustration for a MAD Magazine back cover depicting women's liberation; several issues later, he crafted a front cover which parodied the movie Jaws Women's Lib painting for Mad magazine\\"Jaws\\" on the cover Mad magazine, Jan. 1976‚ÄúMort K√ºnstler: The Art of Adventure Opens May 9 in the MSV‚Äù, Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, April 20, 2015 By the early 1970s his paintings were attracting the attention of serious art collectors, which led him to begin retaining the reproduction rights to his original paintings. In 1975 he submitted a number of paintings to galleries, all of which sold, to his surprise. In 1977 his military art drew attention from even more important galleries, which made him widely recognized as an accurate historical artist. The first major gallery to give him a one-man show was the prestigious Hammer Galleries in New York City. He would have 13 additional one-man shows at the gallery in subsequent years, while his work was also being exhibited in museums nationwide.‚ÄúAn Afternoon with Mort Kunstler‚Äù, Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, May 2015 Armand Hammer, founder of Hammer Galleries, supported, encouraged and promoted K√ºnstler's work, helping him become recognized as one of America's leading historical artists. Hammer said \\"his paintings have continually confirmed his talent, and the caliber of K√ºnstler's overall artistic output has now placed him at the forefront of contemporary realism.\\" As a result of major galleries and museums exhibiting his work, his career soon took on new dimensions. From his early popularity as an illustrator for pulp and popular magazines, then to movie posters, National Geographic images, and now to fine art historical paintings and prints, along with books of images, he was acknowledged as one of the few remaining artists of historical subjects.‚ÄúArtist Mort Kunstler's career examined in new retrospective show‚Äù, The Berkshire Eagle, Nov. 14, 2014 1980 to present In 1982, after getting a commission from CBS-TV to do a painting for the 3-part mini-series, The Blue and the Gray (televised November 1982,) K√ºnstler's interest turned towards the Civil War. By 1988 he was concentrating almost entirely on Civil War subjects, which eventually made him the ‚Äúmost collected Civil War artist in America.‚Äù His focus on that war led to him having the first one-man Civil War exhibitions at venues such as the Gettysburg National Battlefield, New York's Nassau County Museum of Art in 1998, the North Carolina Museum of History, Richmond's Museum of the Confederacy and other centers of art and history.‚ÄùCivil War artist to unveil new piece at area gallery's grand opening Saturday,‚Äù The Gettysburg Times, (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania), June 29, 2007 p. 6 They included images of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg,Abraham Lincoln painting by Mort Kunstler His exhibition at the Nassau County Museum, which lasted seven weeks, attracted more than 30,000 visitors, surpassing the previous attendance record set by a Picasso exhibit. The success of that exhibit led the museum to hold a second one-man exhibit of his work in 2006. To create his paintings he undertook careful and painstaking research into the settings and events he would paint. It meant he needed to consult with expert historians and walk the actual battlefields before drawing them, always looking for landmarks to incorporate into the artwork.‚ÄùThe Art of War‚Äù, Lansing State Journal, Oct. 1, 1992, p. 29 This obsession to detail, he says, came from his experience illustrating men's magazines and his work for National Geographic. In preparation for his 1992 painting, ‚ÄúThe Gunner and the Colonel,‚Äù for instance, he researched the exact uniforms the soldier's wore and even the weather on that day, to learn which way the wind was blowing so the flags were unfurled in the right direction.Painting, \\"The Gunner and the Colonel\\" by Mort Kunstler With each new painting, K√ºnstler says he takes on the role of a historian: His battle of Gettysburg painting, titled ‚ÄúHigh Water Mark,‚Äù was unveiled at the Gettysburg Battlefield Museum on the 125th anniversary of that climactic confrontation. The original was reproduced with 750,000 limited-edition prints, all of which sold out after two months. But K√ºnstler also painted individual soldiers in periods of personal crisis, as he did of Stonewall Jackson after Jackson learned that a close friend's 5-year- old daughter had died.Painting titled \\"Divine Guidance\\", by Mort Kunstler With collections of his work published as limited edition prints and sold nationwide. Historians including James M. McPherson would state: K√ºnstler takes a month or two to complete a painting, with many selling for over $100,000. Limited edition prints often sell out quickly. The American Print Gallery's limited edition of 4,150 of Moonlight and Magnolias was sold out in three weeks after publication. By 2015, K√ºnstler had painted more than 350 Civil War subjects. He painted his final Civil War painting in 2015, depicting the end of the war, titled \\"LaGrange vs. LaGrange.\\"\\"LaGrange vs. LaGrange\\" painting, 2015\\"Mort Kunstler‚Äôs Last Civil War Painting\\", Never Yet Melted, April 22, 2015 =\\"Washington Crossing\\"= Some of his paintings have revised opinions of many about the accuracy of earlier paintings by others. One of Kunstler's more recent paintings has, according to recent historians, corrected some obvious inaccuracies of one America's most famous, the 1851 painting by Emmanuel Leutze, \\"Washington Crossing the Delaware\\", depicting Washington's 1776 surprise attack on the 30,000 German soldiers who were fighting for the British. K√ºnstler devoted two months of research with the aid of military experts and historians, besides visiting the location himself, before completing the painting in 2011, titled ‚ÄúWashington's Crossing.‚Äù Among the inaccuracies K√ºnstler corrected was the fact that Washington would not have been able to stand in a rowboat in daylight during a snowstorm, since it would have capsized. Nor would there be small icebergs in the water or the flag shown in the painting to have been used, since it was not adopted until the following year.‚ÄùArtist has new take on Washington's Crossing,‚Äù Arizona Daily Star, (Tucson, Arizona), Dec. 25, 2011, p. 5 Historian and author David Hackett Fischer said that the painting by K√ºnstler was ‚Äúquite accurate...He got more right abut the crossing than any other image,‚Äù which included more than 200 previous paintings depicting that event.‚ÄúMort K√ºnstler feted as painting's unveiled‚Äù, Newsday, Dec. 26, 2011 Although the new image is about 4 feet wide and 3 feet high, compared to Leutze's, which is about 21 feet wide and 12 feet high, K√ºnstler says it is ‚Äúthe most important painting I've ever done.\\" Civil War historian Harold Holzer, formerly with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which owns the original Leutze painting, called K√ºnstler \\"the best-known and most respected historical artist in this country.\\" =Other works= His later work covered a wider range of subject, including all the wars from the American Revolutionvideo:\\"Interview with LI artist Mort K√ºnstler\\", News 12, Long Island, Feb. 11, 2016 through the Korean and Vietnam wars, with many paintings of World War II.Attack on Pearl Harbor painting by Mort Kunstler (1986)D-Day painting by Mort Kunstler (1960) He painted historical events such as the Oklahoma Land Rush Painting called Oklahoma Land Rush, by Mort Kunstler (1985) and he tried to humanize emotional settings by paintings of new immigrants at Ellis IslandPainting of the Great Hall at Ellis IslandPainting entitled \\"Freedom\\" by Mort Kunstler or Teddy Roosevelt celebrating the 4th of July.Painting of Teddy Roosevelt celebrating the 4th of July Some experts feel that it was K√ºnstler's ability to humanize such moments which distinguished his works from most other historical artists. He also painted subjects which illustrated American technological advances, such as dramatic illustrations of the space shuttle Columbia, for which NASA made him their official artist.Photo of Mort Kunstler at the launch of the Space ShuttlePainting of Space Shuttle Columbia His paintings recorded its manufacture, launching and landing. In 1998 his paintings were exhibited at The North Carolina Museum of Art and at other U.S. museums, including the National Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, the North Carolina Museum of History in Raleigh, and the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond.

Early life and personal Johnson was born to Dewey H. and Mabel (n√©e Woodward) Johnson, in 1931 at Augusta, Georgia and grew up in Greenwood, South Carolina, attending Greenwood High School. He attended the University of South Carolina on a football scholarship. Johnson was married to Pierrine Johnson and had four daughters, ten grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. He died of congestive heart failure on July 14, 2017 at the age of 86. Banking career After graduating, Johnson returned home and worked with his father at the Bank of Greenwood, which eventually evolved into the State Bank and Trust Company, and subsequently was renamed Bankers Trust of South Carolina in 1969. By 1965, Johnson had assumed control of the bank, and under his leadership, Bankers Trust of South Carolina rose from obscurity to become a high- performance, widely respected bank. Johnson served as chairman of the executive committee at Bank of America, and also a director of the company. He also served on the boards of Duke Power, Liberty Corporation, Alltel and Stephens, Inc. Augusta National As former chairman and current \\"Chairman Emeritus\\" of Augusta National Golf Club, Johnson held the chairmanship from 1998‚Äì2006 and directed two significant overhauls of the golf course, allowed 18-hole network television coverage of the tournament for the first time, and made significant changes in Masters qualifying procedures. He was succeeded by Billy Payne. =2002 membership controversy= Johnson was widely known for a disagreement beginning in 2002 with Martha Burk, then chairwoman of the Washington-based National Council of Women's Organizations, over admission of female members to Augusta National. Burk contended that hosting the Masters Tournament at a male-only club, constituted sexism because 15% of the club's membership were CEO's, many of them Fortune 500 CEO's. Johnson characterized Burk's approach as \\"offensive and coercive\\", and despite efforts to conflate the issue with sexism and civil rights, Johnson maintained the issue had to do with the rights of any private club. For her part, Burk ‚Äì whose childhood nickname was also Hootie ‚Äì was \\"called a man hater, anti-family, lesbian, all the usual things.\\" For his part, according to former CEO and Chairman of Bank of America, Hugh McColl (friend and member of Augusta National), Johnson was portrayed as a Senator Claghorn type ‚Äì i.e., a blustery defender of all things Southern. Following the discord, which included Burk's launching a now defunct website augustadiscriminates.org, two club members resigned: Thomas H. Wyman, a former CEO of CBS, and John Snow, following his nomination by then-President George W. Bush to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. The International Olympic Committee, upon considering golf an Olympic sport in 2016, re-examined whether the sport itself fits the goal of a \\"sport practiced without discrimination with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.\\" In 2012, Johnson nominated Darla Moore to become a member of Augusta National; Darla Moore and Condoleeza Rice became the first two female members of Augusta National. Political career Johnson was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives during 1957 and 1958. He also was a trustee of historically black Benedict College. Johnson served as former board member of the National Urban League; served as co-chairman of committee that developed a plan to desegregate universities in South Carolina, and in 1975, received the Outstanding Citizen Award from B'nai B'rith. He had supported African- Americans for public office. As a banker, he had appointed African-Americans and women to his corporate boards. He made loans to minorities. Following the 1968 Orangeburg massacre (in which three South Carolina State University students were killed by state troopers while participating in civil rights protests), Johnson had worked on a desegregation plan for the state's colleges and universities. Johnson had also been the first businessman who pushed to have the Confederate flag removed from the state house in Columbia. Johnson also served as chairman of the South Carolina State Ports Authority, chairman of the South Carolina Research Authority, and trustee of the University of South Carolina Business Partnership Foundation.

An early champion of Schoenberg and other contemporary composers, he was also a highly respected Oscar-nominated film composer in Hollywood in the 1940s. Life and career Louis Theodor Gruenberg was born near Brest-Litovsk (now in Belarus but then in Russia), to Abe Gruenberg and Klara Kantarovitch. His family emigrated to the United States when he was a few months old. His father worked as a violinist in New York City. Young Louis had a talent for the piano, and by the age of eight Gruenberg was taking piano lessons with Adele Margulies at the National Conservatory in New York (then headed by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k). Gruenberg played both solo concerts and in ensembles from the beginning, and in his early twenties he went to study in Europe with Ferruccio Busoni at the Vienna Conservatory. Before World War I, Gruenberg taught students and toured, both as an accompanist and soloist. In 1919, Gruenberg wrote The Hill of Dreams for orchestra, which gained him the highly acclaimed Flagler Prize and enabled him to devote himself more completely to composition. As Gruenberg began to make his mark as a composer, he showed his fascination with jazz, composing works with strong jazz and ragtime influences. On February 4, 1923, Gruenberg conducted the American premiere of Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg as a member of the International Composers' Guild (founded by Edgard Var√®se and Carlos Salzedo in 1921). Shortly after this performance, he and other members of the league left over disagreements with Var√®se and formed the League of Composers. In its 1933 season, the Metropolitan Opera premiered his expressionistic opera The Emperor Jones, based on the major experimental the play by Eugene O'Neill which had already triumphed on Broadway with Paul Robeson playing the title role of an African-American who declares himself emperor on a Caribbean island. In the opera, the title role was created by baritone Lawrence Tibbett, performing in blackface. It was performed at the Met for the 1934 season as well, and featured on the cover of Time Magazine receiving much critical acclaim. Paul Robeson's 1936 film Song of Freedom also features a scene from the opera with Robeson singing the role of Jones. (This has sometimes resulted in a confusion that the 1933 film of O'Neill's play is a film of the opera.) Between 1933 and 1936, Gruenberg headed the composition department of Chicago Musical College (now part of Roosevelt University). He collaborated with a man nicknamed \\"Roosevelt's filmmaker,\\" Pare Lorentz to create '\\"The Fight for Life,\\" a semi-documentary film about childbirth in Chicago slums, on which John Steinbeck also collaborated. In 1937, he moved with his family to Beverly Hills, California, where fellow League members Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky also now lived (though they never spoke). There he worked at merging music with visual media and film, and also composed for Hollywood films. Film composer Gruenberg worked on the musical scoring for John Ford's masterpiece Stagecoach (1939), incorporating folk songs; the four other composers who worked with him are named on the Academy Award Stagecoach won for Best Music Scoring in that legendary year - against such tough competition as Dimitri Tiomkin, Erich Korngold and Aaron Copland‚Äîbut Gruenberg, inexplicably, is not on the list of nominees. One wonders, since Gruenberg heads the list of the five-man team who worked on the score in the official credits https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031971/fullcredits and was soon well known in the industry as having worked on Stagecoach's Oscar-winning score Frederic March - A Consummate Actor by Charles Tranberg, Chapter 11, Section III‚Äîif he perhaps took his name off at nomination time, not wanting to be reduced to a team of five that wrote background music for a Western after having his opera on the cover of Time Magazine. After all, no one knew Stagecoach was going to be a masterpiece, let alone win two Oscars; up until then, no Western had ever been a masterpiece. It was also John Ford's first Western with sound. And Schoenberg and Stravinsky, not to mention Rachmaninoff, were all in a three-mile radius. But that is just a guess. Gruenberg soon composed an original film score under his sole credit for So Ends Our Night (1941) adapted from famous German exile Remarque's fourth novel, starring Oscar-winner Fredric March, Margaret Sullavan and a very young Glenn Ford as desperate exiles whom Nazi Germany's rise has rendered stateless. Knowing well the Vienna in which much of the film takes place, Gruenberg composed an enormous breadth of source music, a loving homage to the world of Austrian and German music he had grown up in, now lost to Nazi madness. The constant presence of music becomes a kind of tone poem of the deep nostalgia the frantic exiles feel for their former lives, from characters who whistle a few bars of Beethoven that trigger another character's memory of his mother at the piano, to raucous jazz bands, to tuneless calliopes at the Vienna fairground, to phonograph records in a stranger's apartment. Gruenberg was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, his fellow musical members of the Academy doubtless particularly enjoying his witty musical quote of Richard Strauss' famous descending 6-note \\"sigh\\" from Der Rosenkavalier whenever the virginal 19-year-old character of Glenn Ford gazes longingly at his new love, 32-year-old Margaret Sullavan (on her third marriage in real life, as they all knew). In 1942, Gruenberg was again nominated for his next film, along with Columbia's head of music, Morris Stoloff, for Best Dramatic Score for Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942), directed by John Farrow and starring Paul Muni in a story of a secret Allied attack on the Nazi-occupied Norwegian coast. Originally, Stoloff had convinced his boss, Harry Cohn, to hire Stravinsky for this job, since the Russian genius happened to be sitting out the war in Los Angeles. Stravinsky's wife, Vera, discovered some Norwegian folk songs in a used LA book shop, and Stravinsky set to work adapting these with his usual speed. When the prolific composer finished his score before a single frame of film had been shot; Stoloff ruefully paid Stravinsky and gave the work back. Months later, Stoloff brought Gruenburg on to compose to the completed film, as was the usual practice. Stravinsky, never one to let work go to waste, refashioned his unused score into \\"Four Norwegian Moods,\\" and Gruenberg was nominated for another Oscar.Hollywood Rhapsody: Movie Music and its Makers, 1900-1975, (NY, 1997) by Gary Marmorstein, p. 88 His next film job, An American Romance, was a heart-breaking failure for its director, King Vidor, a $3 million Technicolor tale of a steel industrialist that nobody saw; an uncredited composer was brought in to patch up the half- hour that was lopped out of it after its first screenings, before it lost a million dollars. It ended director King Vidor's long career at MGM. Gruenberg violin concerto But Gruenberg had happier things to worry about, for in 1944, the greatest violinist in the world, Jascha Heifetz, commissioned and premiered Gruenberg's Violin Concerto, Op. 47 with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and recorded it with Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1945. It is a lively work in three movements (Rhapsodie - With simplicity and warmth - Lively and with good humour), and lasts 38 minutes (in Heifetz's performance). Originally recorded for RCA Victor on shellac 78 RPM discs, it's considered a legendary performance of the master at the height of his powers, and is frequently re-issued on LP paired with Heifetz's 1937 recording of the Prokofiev Violin Concerto. As one of that celebrated conductor's earliest recordings, it can also be found in the collected works of Pierre Monteux, re-issued by Sony Classics. Postwar film composing Back on the payroll in LA, Gruenberg was brought in to score the taut, well-received one-room drama of a Russian soldier holding a group of German soldiers, Counter-Attack (1945), written by soon-to-be-blacklisted John Howard Lawson. His next score was for a blacklisted writer who was already working without credit, Dalton Trumbo, in a low-budget Film Noir, The Gangster (1947). Arch of Triumph (aka Arc of Triumph) (1948) based on Erich Remarque's fifth novel, revisited suffering refugees, with Charles Boyer, Ingrid Bergman and Charles Laughton as a Nazi-in-hiding. Another prestigious flop, it cost $5 million to make but made less than a million at the box office. No one, it seemed, wanted to revisit a Paris where the Nazis had yet to be beaten. But Gruenberg's soaring brass-filled opening music is quite wonderful. All The King's Men (1949), the Pulitzer-Prize-winning fictional story of Huey Long, was a tremendous success, winning three top Oscars among many other prizes. Louis Gruenberg was nominated for Best Score in the newly minted Golden Globe Awards. Gruenberg's last Hollywood score was for MIckey Rooney and Peter Lorre in the film noir Quicksand (1950), directed by veteran Irving Pichel, and considered by many to be the adult Rooney's best work. Again, the orchestral opening under the credits has a powerful use of brass, and as Rooney descends into his life of petty crime, a sinewy jazz score emerges.  Later years Louis Gruenberg's film composing career stops in 1950, and it seems a fair premise that, having worked with blacklisted writers (Trumbo and Lawsen), blacklisted directors (Irving Pichel and John Cromwell), and left-wing tainted actors (Ingrid Bergman, Fredric March), he either abandoned Hollywood at this moment in American cinema history or was abandoned by it. There is very little information on the impact of the blacklist on film composers, who tend to be overlooked in the best of times, and 1950 was not the best of times. During the last twenty years of his life, Gruenberg also became increasingly isolated from the concert music world. He did maintain a close friendship with Arnold Schoenberg, by now a permanent resident of Los Angeles as well as a music professor at UCLA, until the latter's death in 1951. Louis Gruenberg composed continually until his death in 1964 in Beverly Hills. Besides other works, he wrote five symphonies, four full length operas (Volpone, Jack and the Beanstalk, Antony and Cleopatra and The Dumb Wife) and the lengthy oratorio A Song of Faith.  Rediscovery  The violinist Koh Gabriel Kameda reintroduced the almost forgotten concerto to the public with a premiere of the work in Japan in 2002 with the New Japan Philharmonic under the direction of Gerard Schwarz. He was the first violinist who has ever played the concerto after Heifetz. In 2009 Kameda made another premiere of the concerto in Mexico with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Mexico City under Edwin Outwater. Gruenberg's diverse range of film scores also deserve further recognition; happily, a more feasible goal now that his 1940s films are becoming available on home video and online. His wonderful work on those intrepid films that contributed to the battle of filmmakers against pro-Fascist, isolationist America, will also be acknowledged one day, along with the other celluloid warriors, so unsung and so brutally punished by the blacklist.

The complex is composed of a 61-story, skyscraper called One Liberty Place, a 58-story, skyscraper called Two Liberty Place, a two-story shopping mall called the Shops at Liberty Place, and the 14-story Westin Philadelphia Hotel. Prior to the construction of Liberty Place, there was a gentlemen's agreement not to build any structure in Center City higher than the statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia City Hall. The tradition lasted until 1984 when developer Willard G. Rouse III of Rouse & Associates announced plans to build an office building complex that included two towers taller than City Hall. There was a great amount of opposition to the construction of the towers with critics believing breaking the height limit would lead to construction of many more tall skyscrapers, ruining the livability and charm of Center City. Despite the opposition, construction of One Liberty Place was approved and the first phase of the project began in 1985 and was completed in 1987. One Liberty Place became the city's first skyscraper. Phase 2 of the project included Two Liberty Place, a hotel, a shopping mall, and a parking garage. Construction began 1988, after Cigna agreed to lease the entirety of the skyscraper for use as that company's world headquarters. Construction was completed in 1990, making Two Liberty Place the second-tallest building in the city. The two towers held their place as first- and second-tallest buildings in Philadelphia until the Comcast Center was topped off in 2007. Liberty Place was received enthusiastically by critics and led to the construction of other tall skyscrapers giving Philadelphia what architecture critic Paul Goldberger called \\"one of the most appealing skylines of any major American city\\". Liberty Place was designed by architect Helmut Jahn and his firm Murphy/Jahn. The steel and blue glass skyscrapers were heavily influenced by New York City's Chrysler Building. The major influence is the spire made of gabled angular setbacks. Two Liberty Place's spire is shorter and squatter, a design influenced by the needs of tenant Cigna. In the 2000s, Cigna reduced its presence in the tower, which led to the owners converting the upper floors into 122 luxury condominiums. Below the two towers is the 289 room Westin hotel and the Shops at Liberty Place. The main feature of the mall is a round atrium topped by a large glass dome. History =Planning and controversy= One Liberty Place (back) looms over City Hall (front). In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there was a gentlemen's agreement not to build any structure in Center City higher than the statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia City Hall. The tradition lasted until the 1980s when developer Willard G. Rouse III of Rouse & Associates announced plans to build an office building complex that included two towers taller than City Hall. Prior to any development plans, Rouse wanted to acquire prime real estate in Philadelphia and he eyed a block in Center City occupied by parking lots and several small buildings. The Oliver Tyrone Pulver Corp. also eyed the land for development and the company and Rouse both vied for the block of land by buying small lots throughout the site. Neither developer was able to acquire enough contiguous space to build a large office building, so after a lawsuit and failed negotiations, the two developers agreed to an organized bidding war for each other's properties. Under the rules agreed upon, the highest bidder would get the option to buy the other's property. Rouse won the auction in 1983 for an undisclosed amount. Originally, Rouse envisioned a $US150 million 38-story skyscraper, but on April 5, 1984 Rouse officially announced his plans to build a complex that would include two office towers, one 65 stories the other 55 stories, a hotel, and retail space. Rumors and local lore speculate Rouse spent so much money buying the land that he had to build something that justified the expense. Opposition to the project had begun before the April 5 official announcement at a Planning Commission meeting. The meeting was attended by 300 people and a number of attendees were opposed or skeptical of the idea that the skyscrapers would be taller than City Hall. Critics feared breaking the gentlemen's agreement would lead to the development of more tall skyscrapers that would end up dwarfing City Hall and changing the makeup of the city. Critic of the plan and former Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon said, \\"Once [the height ceiling is] smashed, it's gone.\\" A phone poll conducted by the Philadelphia Daily News had callers opposing breaking the height barrier by 3,809 to 1,822. Philadelphia Inquirer editorial feared the skyscrapers would ruin downtown. The location of City Hall was intended as the city's center from the city's founding, and critics feared taller buildings would move the city's center away from City Hall. Critics of breaking the height ceiling favored the smaller scale of the cityscape and felt that a Philadelphia with skyscrapers would affect the livability of the city. Edmund Bacon and Center City civic leaders said that Philadelphia owes its livability and charm to its low profile. Chairman of the City Planning Commission, Graham S. Finney, noted that there was a general feeling that the sky above the city was considered a public space. Supporters of breaking the height limitation noted that the project would bring needed jobs and business to Center City and that shorter buildings were already blocking views of City Hall from certain directions. A planning commission meeting was held on May 3 to decide if they would approve skyscrapers that break the height limit. Executive director of the commissioners, Barbara J. Kaplan, said the project had \\"substantial merit\\" and \\"that there is an opportunity here we should not pass up.\\" She cited that the project would create 12,000 jobs and US$15 million in tax revenue. Opponent Lee Copeland, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Arts, said the height limit was \\"a kind of Philadelphia golden rule which is part of the spirit and tradition of our past.\\" The meeting ended with the commission deciding to prevent buildings taller than City Hall while it studies the issue for one year. In May, the Philadelphia City Council announced its support for the project because of the jobs it would create. On June 13, Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode came out in favor of the project. He proposed the creation of a special ordinance that would allow buildings taller than City Hall between 16th and 20th Streets and the north side of Chestnut Street and the south side of John F. Kennedy Boulevard. Upset at the mayor's support for the project, Edmund Bacon resigned from a commission about Philadelphia's future. Bacon called the complex \\"a total disaster,\\" adding that, \\"It absolutely decimates the scale of Center City, and once it's been done, there's no stopping it.\\" =Construction= Phase 1 of the complex, called One Liberty Place, broke ground on May 13, 1985. One Liberty Place would be the tallest structure of the complex. The skyscraper became the tallest structure in Philadelphia on September 10, 1986, when the first steel columns of the skyscraper's 44th floor were installed. One Liberty Place was topped off on December 12 with a ceremony that included a laser light show and Mayor Goode, who said the tower \\"breaks the status quo of the city and says we arrived\\". On March 27, 1987, Robert Heenan, Jr., a 22-year-old glazier, fell 42 stories to his death after his safety line snapped when it got caught in a hoist mechanism. A month later, on May 27, the tower's spire was placed at the top of the building. Placing the spire was delayed when it was discovered sections of the spire didn't align with each other and had to be re-welded. Conrail became the first major tenant to lease space when it signed its lease in December 1985, but by April 1987 only twenty percent of the building was leased. Conrail became the first tenant to move in when the building officially opened on August 17. One Liberty Place was only about one-third full by the end of 1987 when plans for Two Liberty Place were given the green light after Cigna agreed to relocate its 4,400 employees from 15 different Philadelphia buildings to the skyscraper. Cigna agreed to lease the entire of Two Liberty Place on December 14. Phase 2 of the complex broke ground on February 16, 1988 with a ceremony that included thousands of purple, blue, and white balloons being released. Phase two of the project consisted of the remainder of the Liberty Place complex, the Two Liberty Tower, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel, a two-story shopping mall, and a parking garage. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel opened on November 5, 1990, and the shopping mall, called Shops at Liberty Place, opened a week later on November 13. The mall opened during an economic downturn and a quarter of the mall space was vacant. Fifty stores and fourteen restaurants leased space when the mall opened. Two Liberty Place finished construction by the end of the year. =1990‚Äìpresent= In 1990, Rouse sold his interest in One Liberty Place to Japanese insurance company Chyoda. Also, in 1995, the owners of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which included Rouse, defaulted on its US$64 million loan. After a sheriff's auction on December 4 of that year, the creditor, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, took ownership of the property. The hotel again changed ownership in 1996 when Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association agreed to sell all its hotel properties to Starwood Lodging Trust. In 1999 One Liberty Place, Two Liberty Place, and the Shops of Liberty Place were put up for sale. At the time, One Liberty Place was owned by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Chyoda. Two Liberty Place was owned by a partnership led by Willard Rouse called 1650 Market Associates, and the Shops of Liberty Place was owned jointly by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and 1650 Market Associates. One Liberty Place and the Shops at Liberty Place were sold later that year to Sunbelt Management a Palm Beach Gardens, Florida firm owned by German businessman Hugo Mann. Sunbelt acquired the property for a bargain price of US$250 million. The bargain price was a result of One Liberty Place being 99.9 percent leased at the time of the sale and the majority of long-term leases signed when the real estate market was depressed. Rents for One Liberty Place were around US$10 lower than competing office buildings. Two Liberty Place was struggling to find a buyer because it was uncertain Cigna would renew its lease which would expire in 2006. In January 1999, the Ritz-Carlton announced it would not be renewing its lease at its Liberty Place location and would be relocating to Two Mellon Center. St. Regis hotel took its place later that year. The St. Regis wasn't able to maintain the same room rates as Philadelphia's other luxury hotels and was re-branded as the Westin in February 2000, now focusing on business travelers. In June 2002, Two Liberty Place was sold to Shorenstein Properties of San Francisco. The sale was reported to be for $US200 million and included Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association continuing as first-mortgage lender. On April 26, 2004, Cigna announced it would remain in Two Liberty Place after getting millions of dollars in incentives from the city and state, though would be leasing less space. With vacant, Shorenstein Properties and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association sold their interests in Two Liberty Place to private equity firm America's Capital Partners and its partner residential developer Falcone Group for US$151 million. Shortly after buying Two Liberty Place, America's Capital Partners announced it would be converting the top floors of the skyscraper into luxury condominiums. The Residences at Two Liberty officially opened March 7 with the sample units finished. Conversion of the upper floors on the remaining 122 condominiums began that same month. In 2008, newly moved-in condominium owners were outraged at the plan of putting two Unisys signs with illuminated red letters more than halfway up two sides of Two Liberty Place. Information technology company Unisys was planning to make four floors of the skyscraper its corporate headquarters and the signs were part of its plan to re-brand the company. The Philadelphia Zoning Board eventually rejected the sign idea, and Unisys ended up not moving its headquarters out of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, noting the economy ‚Äì and not rejection of the sign ‚Äì was the basis for the decision. The Westin Philadelphia was sold by Starwood Hotels in November 2005 to hotel owner HEI Hospitality. In 2006, HEI Hospitality spent US$10 million on renovating the hotel which included updating the decor and adding wireless internet access. On June 18, 2007, a new skyscraper, the Comcast Center was topped off and officially became the tallest building in the city. The Comcast Center ended One Liberty Place's 19-year place as Philadelphia's tallest building. In September 2009, Eola Capital acquired America's Capital Partners' entire office building portfolio, including the office portion of Two Liberty Place. Parkway Properties Inc. bought Eola's property-management business and office properties in 2011. The Teacher Retirement System of Texas, also part of the transaction, would own 70 percent of the building while Parkway would hold 19 percent stake in the building. Utah Retirement Systems, a public pension fund, also owns an 11 percent stake in the skyscraper. In October 2016, Coretrust Capital Partners LLC of Los Angeles acquired the office portion of Two Liberty Place by purchasing controlling interests in multiple ownership entities for $219 million. The seller was a partnership advised and led by Parkway Properties, Inc. of Orlando, Florida (NYSE: PKY). Architecture Liberty Place is a building complex consisting of two skyscrapers, a hotel, parking garage, and a shopping mall that connects the structures. Located in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Liberty Place was designed by Chicago-based architectural firm Murphy/Jahn. Architect Helmut Jahn designed One Liberty Place and was a consulting architect for the rest of the complex. The two skyscrapers are constructed with a steel structure held up with eight large pillars on the buildings' perimeters and a central core that contains the elevators. The perimeter pillars are connected to keep the towers rigid while allowing for the maximum amount of interior space. The exterior of the towers are made up of granite, aluminium, and glass panels, with the amount of glass used increasing at the towers' spires. The majority of the exteriors on the lower levels and rest of the complex is made of stone. The Bank of the Southwest Tower (Houston, Texas; never built) was also originally designed by Helmut Jahn and served as the primary inspiration for the design of both Liberty Place towers, as well as for such iconic towers as Frankfurt's MesseTurm. =One Liberty Place= Located on the corner of Market and 17th Streets, One Liberty Place is 61 stories tall. At , it is the second-tallest building in Philadelphia. One Liberty Place contains , with an average floor size of . Helmut Jahn is an admirer of American eclecticism and Art Deco; when designing Liberty Place, he used New York City's Chrysler Building as a reference. Rouse said that he calls it the \\"Son of Chrysler\\" because of the similarity in design. The most notable similarity to the Chrysler Building is the spire that crowns the skyscraper. One Liberty Place's spire is made up of four gabled setbacks leading up to a 2-ton, steel spire on top. Instead of curved setbacks like on the Chrysler Building, One Liberty Place's setbacks use straight angular edges. Design of Liberty Place was heavily influenced by the Chrysler Building. Like the Chrysler Building, One Liberty Place has a square shape with recessed corners. The facade is also inspired by the Chrysler Building, using glass and aluminum to invoke the Chrysler Building's horizontal and vertical shapes along the building's core. The facade's color ranges between grays, silver, and metallic blues and uses horizontal bands of granite and glass to de-emphasize the visual impact of the height of the tower. The building's lobby features white and gray marble imported from Italy. The elevator lobby and the elevator cabs echo the shape of the building's spire while the elevator doors feature abstraction of One Liberty Place itself. =Two Liberty Place= Two Liberty Place is very similar to the Two Prudential Plaza. Two Liberty Place is based on the same influences as its counterpart tower and uses a similar shape and matching facade. Located at the corner of 16th and Chestnut Streets, Two Liberty Place is making it the fourth-tallest building in the city. The 58-story skyscraper is shorter than its counterpart, but also contains about of space. Two Liberty Place's spire contains fewer gabled setbacks giving the tower a more squat appearance, but allowing about the same amount of interior space as One Liberty Place. The design of the spire was a result of the building's intended tenant Cigna which wanted the large floor space. Floors 37 and 40 to 57 is about of condominium space. Floors 38, 39 and 58 are mechanical floors. The 122 luxury condominiums, called The Residences at Two Liberty, are the highest in the city, with condominiums located between above ground level. Every condominium unit features a cappuccino machine, Italian-made Snaidero kitchen cabinetry, Miele appliances, and concierge service. The 37th floor contains a full spa and sauna, pool, and a gourmet restaurant called R2L which opened on January 21, 2010. The restaurant occupies and can seat almost 300. The condominiums range in price from US$800,000 for a 40th-floor single bedroom to more than US$15 million for a penthouse. Because of low sales of the condos, the top portion of the building was to be converted into a boutique hotel in 2013. Due to low interest in the hotel, the top 10 floors of The Residences (floors 48‚Äì57) were to be converted into 60 condo units in 2015.http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/real-estate/2014/09/hotel- plan-axed-two-liberty-to-convert-empty- space.html?ana=e_phil_bn_exclusive&u;=tyyEt+%2FiYYHAo%2FlNg%2FNR%2FsTDXJz&t;=1410546180&page;=all Two Liberty Place's lobby was originally specifically designed for Cigna which used to lease the entire building. After Cigna reduced its presence in the tower, three separate lobbies were created, each with its own elevator bank, one for Cigna, one for the other corporate tenants, and the third for the residents. =Hotel and mall= The Shops at Liberty Place The Westin Philadelphia is a 14-story hotel located on 17th Street. The Westin contains 289-rooms, of meeting space, a ballroom, and a restaurant. Near the entrance of the Westin on 17th Street is the entrance to Liberty Place's underground parking garage. The four-story garage, which also has an entrance on 16th street, has room for 750 cars. The Shops at Liberty Place contains . The two- story mall faces Chestnut Street between 16th and 17th Street. The mall was designed to contain between 80 and 85 stores, including a food court area. The mall's main feature is a round atrium that is topped by a large glass dome. The dome is actually in the shape of a tetracontagon allowing a large amount of light into the mall and allows views of the Liberty Place towers and the PNC Bank Building. The glass dome is based on the main conservatory at the New York Botanical Garden. Reception and legacy The construction of One Liberty Place radically changed the Philadelphia skyline. While critics were upset the building would be taller than City Hall, flat-topped office buildings nearly as tall had surrounded much of City Hall. With the construction of One Liberty Place, Philadelphia now had a definable skyline that it had not had since City Hall was obscured. The breaking of the gentlemen's agreement paved the way for other skyscrapers taller than City Hall. After One Liberty Place was approved, a building boom of tall office skyscrapers in Center City such as the Mellon Bank Center and Commerce Square began. This construction boom, which lasted until the early 1990s, turned the West Market Street district into the city's premier office location and gave what architecture critic Paul Goldberger called \\"one of the most appealing skylines of any major American city\\". The success of Liberty Place, along with helping expose an extortion scheme involving a city councilman, helped turn developer Willard Rouse into \\"Public Hero No. 1\\" in Philadelphia during the late 1980s. On April 5, 1984, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: \\"By 'gentlemen's agreement' (the statue of William Penn atop City Hall) remains highest. It is a supremacy that must be maintained, for philosophical and aesthetic and, indeed, economic reasons - density caused by towering skyscrapers is one of the surest ways to render a downtown ruinously overbuilt while its fringes wither.\\" In 1990, the Inquirer took it all back, noting that Rouse transformed Philadelphia's skyline to near universal acclaim. In 1987, Paul Goldberger called One Liberty Place the best skyscraper Helmut Jahn has ever designed and the best skyscraper built in Philadelphia since the PSFS Building. Goldberger noted that \\"The skyline of Philadelphia, far from being destroyed by One Liberty Place, is in fact given new life by this building. The skyline has been transformed from one of the flattest of any American city to one of the richest.\\" He praised the shape which he said \\"strikes a remarkable balance between dignity and verve\\". He was critical that the building was too busy with too many panels and stripes, but acknowledge it was more restrained than other of Helmut Jahn's buildings. Two Liberty Place was less warmly received by critics. Goldberger said that despite the similarity in appearance, Two Liberty was \\"as much of a slab as a tower, with a spire that looks as if it was plopped awkwardly on top instead of having grown naturally out of the building's overall form.\\" He also criticized giving One Liberty Place a smaller, similar twin which he said gives the complex an odd look. A story of the \\"curse\\" of Billy Penn sprang up after Philadelphia sports teams failed to win championship games after the construction of One Liberty Place. The \\"curse\\" stated that no Philadelphia sports team will win a championship while a building rises taller than the statue of William Penn on City Hall. Construction of the Comcast Center included a small statue of William Penn on the tower's highest point, and in 2008 the Philadelphia Phillies won the World Series, effectively proving the \\"curse\\". Tenants =One Liberty Place= Close-up of One Liberty Place spire One Liberty Place's first two tenants were railroad company Conrail and the law firm Hoyle, Morris & Kerr. Occupying the building between August 1987 and 1992, Conrail leased about . Hoyle, Morris & Kerr leased and moved into the tower in November 1987. Law firm Reed Smith Shaw & McClay also moved into the skyscraper in 1987. The law firm leases on floors 24 through 27. Another law firm, White and Williams, leased space in 1990. The firm occupies on floors 15 through 20. Other tenants include American International Group, which leases , global management consulting firm ZS Associates, and pharmaceutical consulting firm Campbell Alliance. Brokerage firm Smith Barney leases at One Liberty Place on the 42nd and 43rd floors, high-profile plaintiff law firm Saltz, Mongeluzzi, Barrett and Bendesky leases space on the 52nd floor, and JPMorgan Chase began leasing space on the 47th floor in 1998. New tenants in the 2000s include Pelino & Lentz, which leased in 2005 and Clark Capital, which moved into on the 53rd floor in January 2006. Kleinbard Bell & Brecker leased on the 46th floor in 2007 and Baker Tilly has leased on the 44th and 45th floors since 2008. Past tenants include Pennrose Properties LLC, intellectual property law firm Woodcock Washburn, Logan Capital Management, Chubb Corp., law firm Duane Morris, and Cigna, which leased until it consolidated space in Two Liberty Place in 2006. One Liberty Place is leased and managed by Cushman & Wakefield. The management office is located on the 6th floor.http://www.onelibertyplace.net/contact.asp Cushman & Wakefield's Philadelphia office is also housed in One Liberty Place on the 33rd floor. Southwest view from the observation deck Paris-based Montparnasse 56 Group (M56) announced in 2014 that it would open an observation deck on the 57th floor of One Liberty Place. The One Liberty Observation Deck, also called Philly from the Top, opened to the public on November 28, 2015. The observation deck is fully enclosed and offers 360-degree panoramic views of the city from 883 feet above street level, which is the highest public access level in Philadelphia as of 2016. =Two Liberty Place= Cigna leased the entirety of Two Liberty Place from its opening to 1999, when it sold its property and casualty unit to ACE Limited By 2007, Ace Ltd. had left for 436 Walnut St. and Cigna had shrunk its presence in the tower to . What was not converted into condominium space in 2007 was the first office space in Two Liberty open for leasing in the skyscraper's history. Law firm Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott moved into in January 2007 and BremnerDuke Healthcare moved into the tower in 2008. Unisys Corp. originally intended to make Two Liberty Place its headquarters but never moved in. The nearly of space Unisys leases is being subleased to others. Tenants subleasing from Unisys include real estate brokerage firm Studley, Inc., which previously had leased space in One Liberty Place. Studley Inc. occupies on the 34th floor and moved into the skyscraper in 2010. Law firm Duffy and Keenan leased space in 2008, Grosvenor Capital Management leased also in 2008, law firm Kutak Rock leased space on the 28th floor in July 2009, and in 2009 law firm Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney moved into Two Liberty Place, occupying of the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd floors of the tower. Other tenants include law firm Elliott Greenleaf and Republic First Bancorp. Notable residents of The Residences at Two Liberty include Tom Knox, who paid US$7.68 million for a condominium, and Chase Lenfest, son of media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, who paid US$7.68 million for a penthouse. Bon Jovi lead guitarist Richie Sambora spent US$3.58 million for a luxury condominium of the 52nd floor. Other residents have included former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels, former Philadelphia 76ers player Andre Iguodala, and executives from Comcast, GlaxoSmithKline, and Cigna. As a result of slow sales, the top floors (48‚Äì57) of the Residences at Two Liberty Place were going to be converted into a boutique hotel. Due to low interest in using the space as a hotel, plans for the hotel were scrapped, and instead, the raw floors were being converted into 60 condo units in 2015.

F. Stout, was a leading English philosopher and psychologist. Biography Born in South Shields on 6 January 1860, Stout studied psychology at the University of Cambridge under James Ward. Like Ward, Stout employed a philosophical approach to psychology and opposed the theory of associationism. It was as a fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge (1884‚Äì1896), that Stout published his first work in 1896: the two-volume Analytic Psychology, whose view of the role of activity in intellectual processes was later verified experimentally by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. The work contains numerous references to Franz Brentano, Kazimierz Twardowski, Carl Stumpf, Christian von Ehrenfels, and Alexius Meinong.Liliana Albertazzi, Immanent Realism: An Introduction to Brentano, Springer, 2006, p. 321. The term analytic psychology is a translation of Brentano's term descriptive psychologyMaria van der Schaar, G. F. Stout and the Psychological Origins of Analytic Philosophy, Springer, 2013, p. 2. (cf. also Analytic psychology (Dilthey)). Stout was appointed to a new lectureship in comparative psychology at the University of Aberdeen in 1896, before becoming reader in mental philosophy at the University of Oxford (1898‚Äì1902), where he published his Manual of Psychology in 1899. This work formulated many principles later developed experimentally by the Gestalt school of psychology. Leaving Oxford, from 1903 to 1936, Stout served as professor of logic and metaphysics at St. Andrews, Fife, where he published another major work, Mind and Matter in 1931. He remained at St. Andrews until his retirement thirty years later, in 1936. Upon his retirement, Stout left for Australia to be with his son. He died in Sydney on 18 August 1944. Over the course of his career, Stout taught a number of notable students, including G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell at Cambridge University.Maria van der Schaar, G. F. Stout and the Psychological Origins of Analytic Philosophy, Springer, 2013, p. viii. In addition, from 1891 to 1920, he served as editor of Mind, a leading philosophical journal, and was president of Aristotelian Society from 1899 to 1904. In metaphysics, Stout is well known for his contribution to trope theory, specifically in the form of a 1923 paper for the Aristotelian Society.

Early life Long Yun was an ethnic Yi general and governor of Yunnan. He was a cousin of Lu Han. Long Yun participated in the anti-Qing struggle in its early years. First he joined the local warlord's army in 1911 and was gradually promoted to the rank of corps commander. He served in Tang Jiyao's Yunnan Army for years until February 1927, when he, together with Hu Ruoyu, launched a coup and expelled Tang from office. Soon after that he became 38th Army commander in the National Revolutionary Army, at the same time continuing as Yunnan chairman for more than a decade. Governor of Yunnan Long Yun After the remarkable \\"26\\" coup, Tang Jiyao, then governor of Yunnan, was overthrown by Long Yun and his allies. Long Yun succeeded as the new governor and served as governor of Yunnan from 1928-45. When he was in power he put forward the goal of building a new Yunnan. He carried out a series of reorganizations and reforms from political, military, economic, cultural and educational aspects. During this period Yunnan was politically clear, had good social stability and a strong atmosphere of democracy. He consolidated and reorganized the economy, expanded paper money in the region and reorganized the tariff tax regulations. He prioritized textile export while reorganizing and developing production of tin ore, tungsten, antimonies, copper, salt, coal and other resources. Another big part of his project was the improvement of infrastructure, which was very poor in Yunnan. To improve it, he established a transportation enterprise that built the Yunnan-Burma Highway, the Diankang Road, the Sichuan-Yunnan West Road, the Yunnan-Sichuan Road, the Yunnan-Guangxi Highway and the Diankang Highway. He also paid much attention to the agricultural parts of Yunnan. He implemented measuring of land and later used the information they achieved to put through a reformed tax collection. He worked to expand grain farming, reduce tax revenue and strived to achieve food self-sufficiency for all farmers. Due to Long Yun's reforms, Kunming (capital of Yunnan) was commonly known as a \\"democratic fortress\\". Second Sino-Japanese War He was nominated as commander-in- chief of the 1st Army Group, fighting against the Japanese in his province. The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì45) brought progress and modernization to Yunnan, as the Nationalist government developed the province into a war base against the Japanese. Factories, universities and government agencies were transplanted there from the coastal regions, and fresh manpower, capital and ideas poured into the province. Industries were established and efforts made by the government to develop the resources of the region. The Burma Road made Yunnan the corridor through which supplies flowed to Allied bases in all parts of China, and Kunming became a key U.S. Air Force base. A major advance by the Japanese Army along the upper Salween River in 1942 was halted at Huitongqiao, near Tengchong, indicating the vital role that Yunnan played in the country‚Äôs defense. General Wei Lihuang (right) and General Long Yun (left) inspecting troops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force, March 1944 The campaign involved Chinese troops, assisted by American forces, crossing the upper Salween on 11 May 1944 in order to drive Japanese forces from Yunnan into northern Burma. On 11 May about 40,000 Chinese of the Chinese Expeditionary Force crossed the Salween initially and a further 60,000 arrived later. About 17,000‚Äì19,000 Chinese and 15,000 Japanese were killed in the resulting battle. There were more Chinese casualties because the Japanese had time to prepare their fortifications on the south side of the river. Post-war Immediately following the war, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek moved against Long Yun. When Chiang had retreated into western China, he was forced into an area barely under his control and hardly touched by the national revolution that had taken place after the fall of the Qing. Both of the two principal provinces of west China, Szechwan (pop.: 60 million) and Yunnan (pop.: 11 million), were dominated by old-style warlords. In 1941, Chiang had ousted the warlord of Szechwan, appointing an honest and progressive governor. When Long Yun's turn came in 1945, he was caught by surprise: patriotically obeying Chiang's diversionary orders, a good part of his private army of over 100,000 men had marched far away, into Indochina. Long Yun was before this offered a face- saving job in Chungking, but he refused. The absence of his army, however, led to the final extraction. That night, 5 October 1945 (\\"the Kunming Incident\\"), rifles fired in Kunming and the next morning a score of bodies lay at the South Gate. For four days the battle continued as soldiers of Chiang Kai- shek's army assaulted the place. Only a few companies of Lung's troops did any shooting; the warlord never had a chance. On the fourth day Premier T.V. Soong flew down from Chungking. He and the Chinese commander in chief, Gen. Ho Ying- chin, had a morning conference with Gen. Long and that afternoon escorted him by air to Chungking. Gen. Lu Han, Long's former aide, took over the Yunnan government for the Generalissimo. After being removed from his reign of 18 years, and his meaningless appointment to a position in Chungking, Long Yun escaped to Hong Kong at the end of 1948 and joined the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (KMT-RC), a KMT anti-Chiang organization. In August 1949 he declared his revolt against Chiang together with Huang Shaohong in Hong Kong. The KMT-RC ultimately became the largest \\"democratic party\\" under Communist Party rule after the founding of the People's Republic). Return to Beijing Long Yun went back to Yunnan in 1950, after the establishment of the People's Republic. By inviting him back, the Communists were acting on the principle of the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Long Yun was not only reinstalled as Governor but awarded several high-ranking positions such as member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He also became vice- chairman of the National Defense Committee and vice-chairman of the Administrative Council of Southwestern China.Who's Who In Communist China, Union Research Institute Hong Kong, 1966 In 1956, he visited Eastern European countries such as the Soviet Union, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and others. Anti-Rightist movement Later, during the Anti-Rightist Movement, Long Yun was labeled a rightist because of his criticism of Chinese foreign aid policy. He maintained that if the living standard in the Soviet Union was so high that many ordinary workers could own their own car, then the responsibility for foreign aid should fall on the Soviet Union and not on China, since the Chinese economy was much less advanced than that of the Soviet Union because it was still recovering from wars. Long Yun refused to change his view and openly complained of his treatment for telling the truth. Ultimately, on the day following his death in 1962, the Chinese government formally declared that he was not a rightist and was thus partially \\"rehabilitated\\". In July 1980, nearly two decades after his death, he was finally fully \\"rehabilitated\\" in accordance with the Chinese government's policy of admitting the Anti-Rightist Movement had been wrong.

It was Lloyd's second and most popular sound ('talkie') feature. It is also one of his 'thrill' comedies, involving him climbing up a tall building. Harold Lloyd was one of very few silent film actors who successfully adapted to sound. Plot Alec B. Francis and Harold Lloyd in Feet First Harold Horne, an ambitious shoe salesman in Honolulu, unknowingly meets the boss's secretary Barbara (Barbara Kent) - thinking she is the boss's daughter - and tells her he is a millionaire leather tycoon. Horne spends much of his time around Barbara hiding his true circumstances, in both the shoe store and later as an (accidental) stowaway on board a ship. Trying to evade the ship's crew, he becomes trapped in a mailbag, which is taken off the ship and falls off a delivery cart onto a window cleaner's cradle, which is hoisted upwards. Escaping from the bag, he finds himself dangling high above the streets of Los Angeles. After several thwarted attempts to get inside the building, he climbs to the very top, only to slip off - unaware his foot is caught on the end of a rope, which rescues him inches from the ground.

(1923). Contrary to some Hollywood lore, this scene did not utilize special effects or back projection. Before the scene in the 1962 compilation film Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy (produced by Harold Lloyd himself), a title card reads as follows: > \\"This sequence was made without trick photography and before process was > perfected. The action ‚Äî at all times ‚Äî actually occurred as high up as you > see it happen.\\" Whilst this is technically true, the impression of height was achieved by the construction of a skyscraper fa√ßade on the roof of another structure: in this case the Southern California Gas Company Building, South Broadway, Los Angeles. Lloyd had already used this technique in Safety Last!, and indeed the location used for that earlier film was only a few blocks away from this one. Additionally, the concluding sequence of the climb, where Harold Horne falls from the building with a rope attached to his foot, does briefly use back- projection for a mid shot. =Re-releases= The film was re-released in the 1960s as part of the feature, Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy where Lloyd felt it was necessary to overdub part of his original dialogue; (see below). Lloyd also added a dramatic underscore to the climb sequence, composed by Walter Scharf. In the original release this scene had no music. The film was re- released again in segments as part of Time-Life's Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy television series in the 1970s. However, since the majority of the clips in the series came from silent films, the sound track was removed as if to imply that it too was a silent film. It has since been released on DVD in its correct format. =Period characteristics= This film contains a classic example of Hollywood's use of an African American in a comic \\"shiftless and slow\\" stereotyped role. In the original release, while hanging outside of a skyscraper window, Lloyd's character attempts to obtain the assistance of a janitor played by Willie Best (billed in this film under the moniker \\"Sleep 'n' Eat\\") whom he nicknames on the spot as \\"Charcoal.\\" In the 1960s re- release, to avoid accusations of racial stereotyping, Lloyd overdubbed his own voice to change the name of the character to \\"Charlie.\\" See also * List of American films of 1930 *List of United States comedy films References External links  The Harold Lloyd Trust 1930 films 1930 comedy films American films American comedy films American black-and-white films English-language films Films set in Honolulu Films set in Los Angeles Paramount Pictures films Films directed by Clyde Bruckman Films with screenplays by Felix Adler (screenwriter) ","title":"Feet First"},{"id":"5034143","text":"Rodd Redwing (August 24, 1904 - May 29, 1971) was an American actor and a noted quick-draw artist with six-guns. He claimed to be Native American, although in the 1940 United States Census, his birthplace was listed as India and some sources reported his real name was Roderick Rajpurkaii Jr. He was also known as Roderic Redwing and Rodric Redwing. Biography Redwing was one of the top gun, knife, tomahawk, and whip instructors in Hollywood. After claiming that he began in films in Cecil B. DeMille‚Äôs 1931 The Squaw Man (although no cast list shows that he acted in that movie), Redwing soon became a gun-handling coach to Alan Ladd, Ronald Reagan, Burt Lancaster, Glenn Ford, Richard Widmark, Anthony Quinn, Charlton Heston, Dean Martin, Fred MacMurray and many other actors. He performed Alan Ladd's fancy gunspinning seen in the film Shane during the climatic showdown. Between 1951 and 1967, Redwing appeared in more than a dozen television programs, including a guest appearance on CBS's celebrity quiz show, What's My Line? In eight episodes of the ABC/Desilu western television series, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Redwing appeared in the part of \\"Mr. Brother,\\" a Cheyenne friend and informer of deputy Marshal Wyatt Earp (Hugh O'Brian). Rico Alaniz similarly appeared with Redwing in the role of the Cheyenne \\"Mr. Cousin.\\" In the 1958 episode \\"One,\\" \\"Mr. Brother\\" is killed by the four-man Dry Gulch Gang. Several episodes of the series are spent as Marshal Earp hunts down the gang, one of whom has been given a haven by his girlfriend, the daughter of a rancher. All of the gang are ultimately hanged.

In April 1064, Robert joined Abelard, Geoffrey, and Joscelin, Lord of Molfetta, in rebellion against Robert, who had just left for Sicily. They received the aid, financial and military, of Perenos, the Byzantine duke of Durazzo. Between 1 September 1065 and 31 August 1066, Byzantine troops landed at Bari. The rebels held out for several years, neither making headway against Robert nor he against them. On 1 January 1068, Romanus Diogenes was acclaimed emperor in Constantinople and the Greeks transferred their military attention to the Seljuk threat to their east. The rebellion fell apart and by February Robert had surrendered. In 1071, with Abelard, and in 1078, with his cousin Prince Jordan I of Capua, Robert was in rebellion again. Robert and his brother and cousins continued in rebellion after the 1079 peace between Jordan and the Guiscard. Robert was one of the first to cease revolting: he died in July 1080.

Synopsis A woman's mistakes come back to haunt her in a terrifying and very literal manner in this mind-bending thriller. Dr. Samantha Goodman (Kate Greenhouse) is a clinical psychiatrist who works with patients at an institution for the criminally insane. Things have not been rosy for Sam lately‚Äîshe's been violently attacked by one of her patients, her marriage to husband David (Gordon Currie) is in bad shape, and she has an inoperable brain tumor that's growing at an alarming rate. Sam needs a weekend away from the city, but what David has set up isn't especially relaxing for her‚Äîa short holiday at a remote cabin, where David will be editing his latest book with the help of Sam's younger, attractive sister Melody (Iris Graham). As Sam watches sparks begin to fly between her sister and her husband, Harlan Pyne (Aidan Devine) and his friend Adrian (Dov Tiefenbach) break into the cabin and announce their presence by shooting Sam's pet dog. Harlan is a convicted sex offender and murderer who was placed under Sam's care in the institution and wasn't happy with the experimental treatment he received; having escaped, he and Adrian have tracked her down and decide to take revenge by forcing Sam, Melody, and David to participate in a series of strange and humiliating games. The Dark Hours was the first feature-length film from director Paul Fox, who subsequently directed the Douglas Coupland scripted comedy, Everything's Gone Green, as well as a number of successful Canadian television series. Reception The Dark Hours garnered recognition and awards from numerous international festivals, including Montreal's Fantasia Film Festival, Scotland's Dead By Dawn Film Festival, Austin's Fantastic Fest and the Sitges- Catelonian International Film Festival in Spain. Despite winning several international awards, The Dark Hours (like many Canadian films) received no U.S. distribution beyond a one-week run at the indie-friendly Pioneer cinema in New York City. In his book The Long Tail, Wired editor Chris Anderson states that the film suffered more than any other film released that year from the inefficiencies of theatrical distribution. A further review on his blog confirmed his judgement that the film did not lack for quality at all, only for marketing and distribution.

The species is native to southern Europe. Etymology The specific name, latastei, is in honor of French herpetologist Fernand Lataste.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2013). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Exeter, England: Pelagic Publishing Ltd. xiii + 262 pp. . Description Rana latastei may attain a head-body length of . The throat is dark, with a light narrow central stripe.Arnold EN, Burton JA (1978). A Field Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibians of Britain and Europe. London: Collins. 272 pp. (Rana latastei, pp. 81-82 + Plate 11 + Map 39). Geographic range Rana latastei is endemic to the plains of northern Italy, the extreme southern tip of Switzerland, the Istrian region of Slovenia, and adjacent Croatia. In Italy, populations are reported from four regions: Lombardy, Venetia, Piedmont and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, but the species is most abundant in the former two. Its distribution mainly follows the Po River plains and tributaries.  Habitat  R. latastei is a decidedly lowland species and rarely occurs above 400 m a. s. l., only going up to the lower foothills of mountains, where the colder climate affects larval development. The Italian agile frog inhabits oak and hornbeam-dominated plain woods, hygrophilous woods and riparian woods characterized by white poplar and white willow trees. This types of woods may regularly inundate. It has also been reported from open habitats like wet meadwos or peat bogs.  Reproduction  Between late February and mid-April, males and females gather at breeding sites. Reproduction activities occurs in small permanent or temporal water bodies with extensive aquatic vegetation or submerged plant material, such as ponds, ditches or floodplain puddles. The minimum water temperature for egg deposition is reported as 2¬∞C, and eggs hatch after 10 to 15 days. As with other European frogs of the genus, metamorphosis is completed after circa 3 months. Females leave the breeding site immediately after spawing, whereas males and juveniles remain there for up to 5 weeks.  Conservation Status  The IUCN lists this species as Vulnerable (VU). Major threats include habitat destruction and fragmentation, as it is highly adapted to the floodplain woods of the Po River basin. To enhance the protection of this species, several conservation areas were proposed in Italy, and frog tadpoles bred and translocated to suitable sites.

Career  On his arrival in New Spain, he met with his viceregal predecessor, Bishop Juan Ortega y Monta√±√©s at Otumba, on the road from Veracruz to Mexico City. He entered the capital incognito on the afternoon of December 18, 1696 and was sworn in at 7 o'clock that evening, before the Audiencia. On his formal entrance into Mexico City on February 2, 1697 his horse fell, to the great amusement of the crowd. He did what he could to help the population through the famine of 1697. He ordered that supplies of maize and wheat be kept in the public granaries to protect against future famines, and he ordered the storing of quantities of other provisions as well. He ordered that the Philippines ship mercury to New Spain, for use in the silver mines. Many mines had been closed for lack of mercury to extract the silver. He legalized the consumption of the mildly alcoholic drink pulque by the natives. He worked to restore the viceregal palace, partially destroyed in the riots and fire of 1692. He was able to occupy it on May 25, 1697. One of his daughters, Fausta Dominga, died shortly thereafter, of smallpox.

(c. 1697-1701) Brooklyn Museum In 1700 he established the night watch in Mexico City to combat crime. The city was divided into eight wards, and a constable was placed in charge of the night watch in each ward. Offenders were to be whipped publicly on the first offense and branded on the back on the second. For a third offense the penalty was the loss of an ear. By order of March 6, 1700, assailants on the Camino Real were to suffer death. Sarmiento y Valladares also ordered that criminals and delinquents be transported to Puerto Rico. Reverse side of the folding screen, depicting a hunting scene. Brooklyn Museum A ship arrived in Veracruz on March 6, 1701 carrying the news of the death of King Charles II of Spain on November 1, 1700. Charles II left no heir. The War of the Spanish Succession, between Spain and France on the one hand and Austria, England and Holland on the other, began, to determine his successor. Sarmiento y Valladares was publicly known as a supporter of the Habsburg claims to the Spanish throne, but the Bourbons were in control there. The viceroy was removed from office and ordered to return to Spain. Bishop Juan Ortega y Monta√±√©s was once again named interim viceroy. Nevertheless, upon his return to Spain Sarmiento y Valladares received a pension and many honors, among them the titles of duke of Atlixco and grande of Spain. He received the latter title on November 25, 1704. He died in Madrid in 1708.  Personal life  He was married to Mar√≠a Jer√≥nima Moctezuma y Jofre de Loaiza, third Countess de Moctezuma, a descendant of the last Aztec emperor. It was through her that he received his title. She bore him two daughters but then died. Thereafter he married a granddaughter of the Marquess de Villamanrique. His second wife accompanied him to New Spain. His descendants continue to bare the title Duke of Atrisco in Spain, currently held by Adelaida Baron y Carral, whilst another branch (Romay) resides in Mexico and is represented by Ricardo de Romay y Hernandez-Chazaro, 47th Lord of Cadro y Monterroso.

Maintenance often involves using engineering judgment to make maintenance repairs with the highest long-term benefit and lowest cost. The Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is an example of an engineering approach applied to existing pavements. Another example is the use of a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) to non-destructively test existing pavements.

Early life and career Pope grew up in the north London suburb of Enfield. Both his parents were bankers, and he has a sister, Amanda. He always knew that he wanted to make films, boasting in an interview once, \\"Even my dreams came with dirt on them, like my Standard-8 movies\\". He attended St Andrew's primary school, Cecil Road, Enfield, and then went to St Michael's boarding school in Otford, Kent, returning to north London to attend Latymer Grammar School, Haselbury Road. While still attending Latymer, he participated in the first ever Film Studies O-level and was featured in the Evening Standard as \\"Tim Pope, aged seventeen, who wants to be a film director\\". To achieve this aim, he began to attend Saturday morning film classes at Hornsey College of Art. Here he was able to experiment freely with cameras, spending much time photographing various happenings. His first school film was entitled Voyage, which was shot on a 16mm Bolex camera ‚Äì and another equally absurd creation was the film Canine Excrement, where he is purported to have followed a dog around the then bombsites of Seven Sisters, waiting for the inevitable to happen. Pope applied to many film colleges, realising that film was something he seriously wanted to devote his life to, and having been turned down by many, he finally attended Ravensbourne College of Art & Design, Bromley. The course was more TV-oriented, and Pope achieved his highest course marks when a brief was set to create an idea to a piece of music. He chose Frank Zappa's \\"I'm the Slime\\" from his album Overnite Sensation. When Pope left college, two years later, he found himself unemployable and, after a period of working for Williams & Glynn's bank in Islington, he got his first job with HyVision, a company in Covent Garden that trained politicians to appear on TV. One of the many people he worked with, apart from Trevor McDonald, Melvyn Bragg, and others, was the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, whom his boss, Stanley Hyland, trained to appear on the BBC's Panorama programme. Pope says that he left 10 Downing Street with the same camera and then went to Guildford to film the ska band The Specials on stage. Terry Hall, the lead singer, was later to be one of Pope's many clients, as a pop promoter director. Middle career While still at HyVision, in 1979 Pope met Alex McDowell, who ran Rocking Russian, a company that designed T-shirts and record sleeves from a studio in Berwick Street. Alex had designed Iggy Pop's album sleeve for Soldier and Pope was a massive Iggy Pop fan. (Pope later became a close friend to the singer and worked with him many times). The duo went on to form a very successful and long-lasting relationship with McDowell as production designer and Pope as director ‚Äì before McDowell emigrated to America in the mid-1980s to become a movie production designer for people like Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton. At about this time, pop videos were starting to be made more frequently by directors like Russell Mulcahy (Duran Duran), David Mallet (David Bowie), and Brian Grant (Olivia Newton-John). Pope decided to turn his hand to this new form. His first attempts at rock video were shot in Carnaby Street and in Putney Bridge's tunnels on a non-broadcast format for the single \\"Cut Out the Real\\" by Jo Broadbery and the Standouts, as well as its B-side. After unsuccessfully pitching many videos (and with very little to show as his own work), he was finally engaged to make Soft Cell's first video for Some Bizzare Records, Non- Stop Exotic Video Show, which was a companion release to their debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret. The collection was originally issued on VHS, Betamax, and laserdisc in 1982, and re-issued on DVD in 2004. The video for \\"Bedsitter\\" had Pope's trademark individuality, as it featured the band's singer, Marc Almond, wearing shirts that matched the walls behind him. In many ways, it is considered this video bears all the major hallmarks of a Pope video: individuality, linear progression in terms of story, and a slight psychedelic feel. (Pope has many names for different genres of videos and this type he calls a narrative/atmospheric. He has lectured all over the world on the subject, including at London's National Film Theatre.) More Some Bizzare videos followed with Soft Cell, including \\"Say Hello and Wave Goodbye\\" and thereafter an entire album of videos for their debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, including the infamous \\"Sex Dwarf\\" that featured a handful of real- life prostitutes, their pimp, a trainee doctor in leather trousers, and a handful of maggots that Pope chucked in during, causing a riot when the prostitutes fled from the St John's Wood film studio. The video was later seized by the Scotland Yard Pornography Squad, but handed back soon after, as it was realized that hype was more at play than real facts about the video's contents. The video is considered a cult classic and is even banned from TV programmes about banned videos. It was probably this Some Bizarre video that earned Pope his early reputation as a 'bad boy'. Promos for The Cure By 1982, and with a few more videos made, (Scottish band Altered Images, Nancy Nova, Jersey pub-rockers-financed-by-a-millionaire \\"Volcano\\", etc.) Pope met The Cure's singer Robert Smith. Their work together was to prove that directors could be constantly innovative, on a factory-line basis. Pope ultimately directed over 37 videos for the group, including many of their most famous songs ‚Äì \\"Let‚Äôs Go To Bed\\" (1982), \\"Close To Me\\" (1985), \\"Just Like Heaven\\" (1987), \\"Friday I‚Äôm in Love\\", (1992), \\"Wrong Number\\" (1997). He also directed the 35mm movie of \\"The Cure in Orange\\", which captures their performance at the eponymous theatre in the south of France. He recorded his own song with them, called \\"I Want to be a Tree\\", with its B-side \\"Elephants\\" and \\"The Double Crossing of Two-Faced Fred\\" (a choral verse poem he had written and performed at Latymer, a few years earlier). The single is a collector's item for many Cure fans and Pope was the only early collaborator, apart from their postman, with a song called \\"I Dig You\\". Pope provided the video for \\"I Want to be a Tree\\", which was famously achieved in a single, unbroken shot of over three minutes duration ‚Äì the first time this was ever attempted in a pop video. Pope also musically supported another band he was working with at the time, The Psychedelic Furs, at Hammersmith Odeon, the same stage David Bowie had 'retired' from as his fictional character Ziggy Stardust. Pope parodied Bowie, referring to his own character as \\"Twiggy Sawdust\\" (a play on words from the Tree song). This appears to be the climax of Pope's burgeoning wannabe-pop star career. The single reached number 137 in the British charts. In between commitments to the Cure, the Glove and the Banshees, Robert Smith also found time to perform on Pope's Syd Barrett- inspired \\"I Want To Be A Tree\\" single.Sutherland, Steve, \\"History of The Cure Part 2\\", Melody Maker, 1990.Butler, Daren, The Cure on Record, (1995), Omnibus Press, p. 56. Pope at the time was the regular director of promotional videos for the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Marc Almond, among others, but was taken aback when his fame on American MTV as a video director began to rival that of the bands he worked for.\\"Tim Pope ‚Äì I Want To Be A Tree\\" (Fiction/Polydor Promotional Folder), 1984. He described the project as \\"a real piss-take of what was going on in America\\", prompted by people referring to \\"Tim Pope Videos\\", and said that he \\"felt really strongly that they were not Tim Pope videos, they were Cure videos or Siouxsie videos or whatever\\".Bowler, Dave, and Bryan Dray, The Cure ‚Äì Faith, (1995), Sidgwick & Jackson, p. 108; Over the 1983 Christmas holidays, Pope and a friend, Charles Gray, recorded what Pope described as \\"this really stupid song\\" that they had co-written years earlier as teenagers. Pope made an accompanying video for his showreel, asking several of the artists he worked with (the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Soft Cell, Talk Talk, the Style Council, Paul Young and Freur) to \\"come along and slag me off on the showreel\\". He then played the artists the song, while filming their reactions to it. The Old Grey Whistle Test screened the video, which Pope says resulted in several record deals being offered. The song was re-recorded with Robert Smith playing most instruments in January 1984, produced by Chris Parry, and was released on Fiction Records (with a new video) in June, reaching number 34 in the British charts. Work in the U.S. He was invited to America for the first time in 1983 by Neil Young who asked him to film the video for his song \\"Wonderin'\\". Young personally drove him around Los Angeles on a guided tour to see the sights, using the car that was ultimately to feature in the famous \\"Wonderin'\\" video, filmed with its idiosyncratic speed-up, speed-down style. Pope shot many more videos for Young until 1997. He said of the experience: \\"I thought it was everyone‚Äôs lot to be brought to America and driven around by iconic pop stars in flash motors.\\" He also shot many more videos in the United States for various bands, including Hall & Oates, Iggy Pop and Wendy & Lisa, as well as more bands in the UK: The The, David Bowie, Strawberry Switchblade, Men Without Hats, Talk Talk, Paul Weller, Siouxsie and the Banshees and others. Pope's career in commercials began at this time, too, and he soon achieved a worldwide reputation, shooting for clients all over the world. In 1989, Pope directed the TV comedy series The Groovy Fellers which he co-wrote with Squeeze keyboardist and TV presenter Jools Holland and comedian Rowland Rivron, about a Martian (played by Rivron) who lands in England and is shown around the country by Holland, being presented with many of the eccentricities of life peculiar to the United Kingdom. The TV series was one of the first to use members of the public and also featured David Steel, Michael Heseltine and Sir Patrick Moore. The Martian lands naked in episode 1, walks into a pub, and the series climaxes with a car chase with Holland and the Martian attempting to answer the question \\"Why are we here on Planet Earth?\\" with the police in hot pursuit. The programme was produced by Border Television for Channel 4. Later career In 1991, Pope directed his first short film, Phone, that led directly to his being asked by the Weinstein Brothers of Miramax to make The Crow: City of Angels for them. Phone starred Bill Pullman, along with Linda Blair and Amanda Plummer. The film earned many awards from around the world, and was based on a real-life phone prank that Pope came across on a tape in a skip behind a strip club in Hollywood Boulevard. He continued working on videos, spending more time in America. He worked with many new bands of the period, though old clients like Neil Young, David Bowie, The The and The Cure continued to request his services. The Crow: City of Angels put Pope together again with production designer Alex McDowell and the duo gave the film an individual look and feel. It reached number one in the American movie charts, though Pope refused to do the commentary on the DVD, saying the studio had tampered with his film too much. He directed David Bowie's 50th birthday celebration at Madison Square Gardens in 1997, working with Bowie to construct the show over a long period. The show featured other artists, including Pope's old friend Robert Smith, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Frank Black, the Foo Fighters and Lou Reed. Shortly afterwards, Pope read and bought the rights for The Last King of Scotland and brought Oscar winner Forest Whitaker to the project as Idi Amin (though he left the project due to differences on the progress of the film, in particular with the studio wanting to use writer Joe Penhall). 2000 to present Pope returned to London from Hollywood and continued with his career making commercials. In 2005, Pope was awarded a CADS lifetime achievement award by the music industry and after a prolonged and self-imposed period of 12 years, he returned to making videos again, working with The Darkness, KT Tunstall, The Kaiser Chiefs and Fatboy Slim. In 2013, Pope embarked with The Cure to film their \\"LatAm\\" tour across South America and Mexico, and a tour film is expected to be produced later with material both off and on stage. In 2018, Pope filmed a documentary on Sheridan Smith called Sheridan Smith: Coming Home. On July 7, 2018 Pope directed the \\"Anniversary: 1978-2018 - Live in Hyde Park London\\" concert the Cure performed as part of the British Summer Time concert series. The concert was released on dvd as part of the six disc set of \\"Curaetion 25 - Anniversary\\", released in October 2019. Personal life He now lives with his family in Brighton, East Sussex. He has lived in Henfield in West Sussex.

It is a 129 km long right tributary of the Danube, flowing through the regions of Homolje, Zvi≈æd and Braniƒçevo.  Homolje region  The Pek originates from two major headwaters, Veliki Pek and Mali Pek (Serbian Cyrillic: –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ü–µ–∫ and –ú–∞–ª–∏ –ü–µ–∫; Great Pek and Little Pek). The Mali Pek comes down from the northern slopes of the Li≈°kovac mountain, flows to the southwest through the city of Majdanpek, one of the major mining centers of Serbia (city's name itself, Majdan-pek, means Mine on the Pek). After a short course, the Pek reaches the western side of the Homolje mountains and flows in into the river Lipa at the village of Debeli Lug. Measured from the Lipa source, Pek is 129 km long, measured from its own, 110 km. Near the confluence of the two rivers is the reservoir of Veliki Zaton (or Valja Fundata), artificial body of water used as a tailing pond for the nearby mines. The Lipa (or Veliki Pek) springs out on the western side of the Veliki Kr≈° mountain, near the village of Lipa. It flows straight to the north, following the western side of the Mali Kr≈° mountain, next to the villages of Vlaole, Jasikovo (where it receives the left tributary Jagnjilo/–à–∞–≥—ö–∏–ª–æ) and Leskovo before it meets the Pek. Shortly after the confluence of Lipa and Mali Pek, the river receives the small stream of Todorov (Cyrillic: –¢–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤) from the left, and ≈Ωeleznik (Cyrillic: –ñ–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∫) from the right. The Pek continues to the north, curves between the mountains of Homolje and northern Kuƒçaj, next to the villages of Blagojev Kamen and receives the rivers Brodica from the right and Kom≈°a and Kisela Voda from the left.  Zvi≈æd region  This section of the river course both begins and ends with a gorge. At the village of Reƒçica, the Pek enters the Kuƒçevska klisura (Cyrillic: –ö—É—á–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞ –∫–ª–∏—Å—É—Ä–∞; Gorge of Kuƒçevo). The river receives from the left the stream Glo≈æana (Cyrillic: –ì–ª–æ–∂–∞–Ω–∞) and from the right the Daj≈°a (Cyrillic: –î–∞—ò—à–∞), makes an elbow turn to the north at the village of Neresnica, leaves the gorge and enters the Kuƒçevska kotlina (Cyrillic: –ö—É—á–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–ª–∏–Ω–∞; Depression of Kuƒçevo) where the regional center Kuƒçevo is located. The Pek continues to the north through the Kaonska klisura (Cyrillic: –ö–∞–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –∫–ª–∏—Å—É—Ä–∞; Gorge of Kaona), between the villages of Kaona and Turija. The river makes another elbow turn, next to the villages of Sena, Lje≈°nica and Mi≈°ljenovac and enters Braniƒçevo.  Braniƒçevo region  In the final section, the Pek gently makes a big curve to the east. Braniƒçevo is the lowest part of the Pek valley, so the river spills in several arms and passes next to many villages (Zelenik, Klenje, Mrƒçkovac, Miljeviƒá, ≈†uvajiƒá, Donja Kru≈°evica, Tribrode, Braniƒçevo, Kusiƒáe, before it empties into the Danube east of the town of Veliko Gradi≈°te. In this section, important left tributary is the ƒåe≈°ljebarska reka (Cyrillic: –ß–µ—à—ô–µ–±–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞).  Characteristics  The Pek drains an area of 1,236 km¬≤ and belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. It is not navigable. The river's course is characterized by many elbow turns, similar to the Danube's on this same section (most notably, the ƒêerdap), but on a much lesser scale. Average discharge is 10.5 m¬≥/s and the river's mouth is known for the Danube's inverse flow (during high levels, water from the Danube flows up the Pek). = Gold = The areas surrounding the Pek's course are rich in a variety of ores and minerals, like copper, iron, pyrite, zinc, wolfram and coal (Rakova Bara coalmine), but the river is famous for the gold which it brings from the mountains around Majdanpek in small amounts, so from time to time, a media coverage of the gold findings (more often used as a publicity stunts) provoke gold rush in the region. For this, the river is nicknamed Zlatni Pek (Cyrillic: –ó–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∏ –ü–µ–∫; Golden Pek). It is known that the Romans exploited gold from the river and its surrounding. The extraction stopped during the Ottoman period, but was restored in the late 19th century. Austro-Hungarian naturalist and traveller Felix Kanitz who visited the Pek area in 1858, wrote that the old name of the town of Kuƒçevo was \\"Chrisovehia\\" (meaning \\"Old Gold[en Land]\\", in Serbian \\"Starozlatija\\"). During the Interbellum, an excavator owned by the royal Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty was dredging the river at Neresnica in search of gold. It was filtering of gold per week. In total, it excavated some 7 tons of 22-carat gold before the outbreak of World War II. The mining industry collapsed in Serbia since the 1990s. The most symptomatic example of this in the Pek valley is the village of Blagojev Kamen. The settlement encompasses the former gold mine of the same name. The mine became operational in 1902. In 1953, Blagojev Kamen had a population of 1,258, elementary school, cultural institutions, cinema, etc. The mine was closed in 1961 and the population tumbled down to 26 in 2011. When the reporters visited the place in 2019, only 10 people were in the village which was completely desolated and ruined. Though gold was excavated and acquired as byproduct on numerous locations throughout Serbia, Blagojev Kamen was the only proper gold mine in Serbia, where only gold was mined. An attempt to revive the production in the mid-1990s, ended in 2001 when the mine was again closed. The traditional placer mining, in the form of gold panning, is the most used type of gold prospecting, and has survived until the 21st century, though the number of prospectors dropped. Wooden and modernized plastic pans are used. It takes an estimated of sand and sludge to be filtered in order to obtain of gold, if gold is present in the deposit brought by the river as the deposits of gold are at the depth of .

Bateman working at his home in Reigate, Surrey, 2 December 1931 Henry Mayo Bateman (15 February 1887 ‚Äì 11 February 1970, Gozo, Malta) was a British humorous artist and cartoonist. H. M. Bateman was noted for his \\"The Man Who...\\" series of cartoons, featuring comically exaggerated reactions to minor and usually upper-class social gaffes, such as \\"The Man Who Lit His Cigar Before the Royal Toast\\", \\"The Man Who Threw a Snowball at St. Moritz\\" and \\"The Boy Who Breathed on the Glass at the British Museum.\\" which appeared in the satirical magazine Punch. Early life \\"Winston Churchill smiles at the camera\\". Cartoon by H. M. Bateman (ca. 1912). Henry Bateman was born in the small village of Sutton Forest in New South Wales, Australia. His parents were Henry Charles Bateman and Rose Mayo. His father had left England for Australia in 1878, at the age of 21, to seek his fortune, then returned to England briefly in 1885 before going back with an English wife. Soon after Henry was born, his strong-willed mother insisted that they return to London 'and civilisation'. He had one sister, Phyllis, three years younger. Bateman was always drawing from an early age, consistently producing funny drawings that told stories. He was inspired by comics, had a keen critical eye, and was enthusiastically drawing at every available moment. At the age of 14, he had already decided that he would draw for publication. In 1901, the cartoonist Phil May, in response to a letter from Rose, showed interest in his drawings, and that year he was inspired by an exhibition of black-and-white art at the Victoria and Albert Museum. His father had initially decided that his son should follow him into business, but eventually, after many arguments between him and Rose, his father financed his study at the Westminster School of Art which he commenced at the age of 16. He did well but was bored by the lifeless \\"life\\" classes and after qualifying at Westminster transferred his study to the New Cross Art School. He also did some practical work at the studio of Charles van Havenmaet. Career Bateman's first solo exhibition in 1901 was at the Brook Street Gallery, Mayfair, in central London. His first contract was in 1904, for ten drawings and two illustrations in a fourpenny monthly magazine called The Royal. At the age of 17, his style was already that of a mature artist. He then progressed to a contract with The Tatler and many other magazines besides, including the Illustrated Sporting News and Dramatic News, Pearson's Weekly and Punch. Bateman greatly influenced the style of American cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman. Bateman was selected by Percy Bradshaw for inclusion in his 1918 The Art of the Illustrator which presented a portfolio for each of twenty illustrators. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Personal life Bateman married Brenda Collison Wier and they had two children, Diana and Monica, both of whom became artists. They lived at Curridge, just north of Newbury, Berkshire. In later life, Bateman carried on an increasingly acrimonious battle with the Inland Revenue. His final years were spent on the island of Gozo, Malta.The Best of H. M. Bateman (Bodley Head, 1987) A centenary celebration of his work was exhibited at the Royal Festival Hall on London's South Bank in 1987. An English Heritage blue plaque, unveiled in 1997, commemorates Bateman at 40 Nightingale Lane in Clapham south London. Publications * Bateman, H. M., intr. A. E. Johnson. Burlesques.

This process started as early as 1874 when the Anc√≥n District was created and continued to as recent as 1961 when the Comas District was created and as recent as 1969 when the Ventanilla District was founded in neighboring Callao Province. Carabayllo still remains the largest district in Lima with an area of 346 km2 and a population of about 200,000 (2005). Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica e Inform√°tica. Banco de Informaci√≥n Distrital . Retrieved November 1, 2008. Carabayllo is a zone of recent expansion to the city. The principal road connecting the district to the rest of the metropolis is the Tupac Amaru Avenue. It is at an altitude of 238 meters above sea level. Its social economic level is principally made up of middle and lower middle classes.

His research centres on the areas of quantum optics and quantum information. He and his team performed one of the first experiments to teleport atoms, the other was done at NIST in Boulder Colorado. The reports of both groups appeared back-to-back in Nature. Early life and education Blatt graduated in physics from the University of Mainz in 1979. He finished his doctorate in 1981 and worked as research assistant in the team of G√ºnter Werth. Career In 1982 Blatt received a research grant of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to go to the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA), Boulder, and work with John L. Hall (Nobel Prize winner 2005) for a year. In 1983 he went on to the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, and in the following year joined the working group of Peter E. Toschek at the University of Hamburg. After another stay in the US, Rainer Blatt applied to qualify as a professor by receiving the ‚Äúvenia docendi‚Äù in experimental physics in 1988. In the period from 1989 until 1994 he worked as a Heisenberg research fellow at the University of Hamburg and returned several times to JILA in Boulder. In 1994 Blatt was appointed to a chair in physics at the University of G√∂ttingen and in the following year he was offered a chair in experimental physics at the University of Innsbruck. From 2000 until 2013 Blatt headed the Institute for Experimental Physics. He is a member of the academic senate. Since 2003 Blatt has also held the position of Scientific Director at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (√ñAW). Blatt is a member of the council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings. In 2018, Rainer Blatt co-founded Alpine Quantum Technologies, a quantum computing hardware company. Blatt is married, with three children. Research Experimental physicist Rainer Blatt has carried out trail-blazing experiments in the fields of precision spectroscopy, quantum metrology and quantum information processing. He works with atoms caught in ion traps which he manipulates using laser beams. This work is based on suggestions made in the mid-1990s by theorists Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller.J.I. Cirac, P.

These techniques differ from classical planning in two aspects. First, they operate in a timely fashion and hence can cope with highly dynamic and unpredictable environments. Second, they compute just one next action in every instant, based on the current context. Reactive planners often (but not always) exploit reactive plans, which are stored structures describing the agent's priorities and behaviour. Although the term reactive planning goes back to at least 1988, the term \\"reactive\\" has now become a pejorative used as an antonym for proactive. Since nearly all agents using reactive planning are proactive, some researchers have begun referring to reactive planning as dynamic planning.  Reactive plan representation  There are several ways to represent a reactive plan. All require a basic representational unit and a means to compose these units into plans. = Condition-action rules (productions) = A condition action rule, or if-then rule, is a rule in the form: if condition then action. These rules are called productions. The meaning of the rule is as follows: if the condition holds, perform the action. The action can be either external (e.g., pick something up and move it), or internal (e.g., write a fact into the internal memory, or evaluate a new set of rules). Conditions are normally boolean and the action either can be performed, or not. Production rules may be organized in relatively flat structures, but more often are organized into a hierarchy of some kind. For example, subsumption architecture consists of layers of interconnected behaviors, each actually a finite state machine which acts in response to an appropriate input. These layers are then organized into a simple stack, with higher layers subsuming the goals of the lower ones. Other systems may use trees, or may include special mechanisms for changing which goal / rule subset is currently most important. Flat structures are relatively easy to build, but allow only for description of simple behavior, or require immensely complicated conditions to compensate for the lacking structure. An important part of any distributed action selection algorithms is a conflict resolution mechanism. This is a mechanism for resolving conflicts between actions proposed when more than one rules' condition holds in a given instant. The conflict can be solved for example by * assigning fixed priorities to the rules in advance, * assigning preferences (e.g. in Soar architecture), * learning relative utilities between rules (e.g. in ACT-R), * exploiting a form of planning. Expert systems often use other simpler heuristics such as recency for selecting rules, but it is difficult to guarantee good behavior in a large system with simple approaches. Conflict resolution is only necessary for rules that want to take mutually exclusive actions (c.f. Blumberg 1996). Some limitations of this kind of reactive planning can be found in Brom (2005). = Finite State Machines = Finite state machine (FSM) is model of behaviour of a system. FSMs are used widely in computer science. Modeling behaviour of agents is only one of their possible applications. A typical FSM, when used for describing behaviour of an agent, consists of a set of states and transitions between these states. The transitions are actually condition action rules. In every instant, just one state of the FSM is active, and its transitions are evaluated. If a transition is taken it activates another state. That means, in general transitions are the rules in the following form: if condition then activate-new-state. But transitions can also connect to the 'self' state in some systems, to allow execution of transition actions without actually changing the state. There are two ways of how to produce behaviour by a FSM. They depend on what is associated with the states by a designer --- they can be either 'acts', or scripts. An 'act' is an atomic action that should be performed by the agent if its FSM is the given state. This action is performed in every time step then. However, more often is the latter case. Here, every state is associated with a script, which describes a sequence of actions that the agent has to perform if its FSM is in a given state. If a transition activates a new state, the former script is simply interrupted, and the new one is started. If a script is more complicated, it can be broken down to several scripts and a hierarchical FSM can be exploited. In such an automaton, every state can contain substates. Only the states at the atomic level are associated with a script (which is not complicated) or an atomic action. Computationally, hierarchical FSMs are equivalent to FSMs. That means that each hierarchical FSM can be converted to a classical FSM. However, hierarchical approaches facilitate designs better. See the paper of Damian Isla (2005) for an example of ASM of computer game bots, which uses hierarchical FSMs. = Fuzzy approaches = Both if-then rules and FSMs can be combined with fuzzy logic. The conditions, states and actions are no more boolean or \\"yes/no\\" respectively but are approximate and smooth. Consequently, resulted behaviour will transition smoother, especially in the case of transitions between two tasks. However, evaluation of the fuzzy conditions is much slower than evaluation of their crisp counterparts. See the architecture of Alex Champandard. = Connectionists approaches = Reactive plans can be expressed also by connectionist networks like artificial neural networks or free-flow hierarchies. The basic representational unit is a unit with several input links that feed the unit with \\"an abstract activity\\" and output links that propagate the activity to following units. Each unit itself works as the activity transducer. Typically, the units are connected in a layered structure. Positives of connectionist networks is, first, that the resulted behaviour is more smooth than behaviour produced by crisp if-then rules and FSMs, second, the networks are often adaptive, and third, mechanism of inhibition can be used and hence, behaviour can be also described proscriptively (by means of rules one can describe behaviour only prescriptively). However, the methods have also several flaws. First, for a designer, it is much more complicated to describe behaviour by a network comparing with if-then rules. Second, only relatively simple behaviour can be described, especially if adaptive feature is to be exploited.  Reactive planning algorithms  Typical reactive planning algorithm just evaluates if- then rules or computes the state of a connectionist network. However, some algorithms have special features. *Rete evaluation: with a proper logic representation (which is suitable only for crisp rules), the rules need not to be re-evaluated at every time step. Instead, a form of a cache storing the evaluation from the previous step can be used. *Scripting languages: Sometimes, the rules or FSMs are directly the primitives of an architecture (e.g. in Soar). But more often, reactive plans are programmed in a scripting language, where the rules are only one of the primitives (like in JAM or ABL).  Steering  Steering is a special reactive technique used in navigation of agents. The simplest form of reactive steering is employed in Braitenberg vehicles, which map sensor inputs directly to effector outputs, and can follow or avoid. More complex systems are based on a superposition of attractive or repulsive forces that effect on the agent. This kind of steering is based on the original work on boids of Craig Reynolds. By means of steering, one can achieve a simple form of: * towards a goal navigation * obstacles avoidance behaviour * a wall following behaviour * enemy approaching * predator avoidance * crowd behaviour The advantage of steering is that it is computationally very efficient. In computer games, hundreds of soldiers can be driven by this technique. In cases of more complicated terrain (e.g. a building), however, steering must be combined with path-finding (as e.g. in Milani ), which is a form of planning .
