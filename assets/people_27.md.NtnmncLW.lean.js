Oulu, 1986. and the Sami. The settlement was founded as the Pechenga Monastery in 1533 at the influx of the Pechenga River into the Barents Sea, 135 km west of modern Murmansk, by St. Tryphon of Pechenga, a monk from Novgorod. In 1533, the area became part of Russia. Inspired by the model of the Solovki, Tryphon wished to convert the local Sami population to Christianity and to demonstrate how faith could flourish in the most inhospitable lands. His example was eagerly followed by other Russian monks. By 1572, the Pechenga Monastery counted about 50 brethren and 200 lay followers. Six years after Tryphon's death in 1583, the wooden monastery was raided and burnt down by the Swedes. It is said that the raid claimed the lives of 51 monks and 65 lay brothers. The monastery was moved closer to the Norwegian border. It was destroyed in 1764, but restored in 1880, and exists to this day. On 18 May 1918 the Finnish government declared war on Soviet Russia. During the war the area around Pechenga was occupied by the Finnish forces, and as a result of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920 became a part of Finland, renamed Petsamo. Nickel was discovered in 1921 and began to be exploited commercially in 1935. The area was captured by the Soviets during the Winter War in 1940 but returned to Finland at the conclusion of the war. During the Second World War, between 1941 through 1944, Petsamo was used as a staging post for attacks on Murmansk by Finland and Germany. Aircraft from the British aircraft carrier HMS Furious attacked the port on July 30, 1941. The area was captured by the Red Army during the Petsamo‚ÄìKirkenes Offensive in 1944 and in 1947, after the subsequent Paris Peace Treaty, incorporated into the Soviet Union. After the war the area was a military zone due to its proximity to the Norwegian border. Nickel mining has led to ecological problems in the area. The 200th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade is stationed at the settlement.

Its responsibility extends over the Tideway of the River Thames and its continuation (the Kent/Essex strait). It maintains and supervises navigation, and protects the river's environment. The PLA originally operated all enclosed dock systems on the river (except the Regent's Canal Dock), but these have long been closed to commercial traffic, with the exception of Port of Tilbury, which was privatised in 1992. It inherited the private police forces of the companies which had previously run the docks, reorganising them into a single Port of London Authority Police.  Finance  The PLA receives no funding from the government and is entirely self-financing. Revenues are raised from conservancy charges on vessels and cargo, pilotage charges, annual port dues, hydrographic services, river works licence fees and charges for other services. Limits PLA boundary marker opposite Teddington The PLA's responsibility extends from a point marked by an obelisk just downstream of Teddington Lock (the upstream limit of the tidal river) to the end of the Kent/Essex strait of the North Sea (between Margate to the south and Gunfleet Lighthouse, near Frinton-on-Sea, to the north,) a total of about 95 miles (150 km). The PLA does not cover the Medway or the Swale. From the City of London, via the Thames Conservancy, the PLA inherited the conservancy, management and control of the river instead of ownership of the bed of the river and foreshore (the Crown was prohibited from alienating any of its lands by section 5 of the Crown Lands Act 1702, the Crown was presumed to own the bed of Thames and 'as conservators' the City of London were prohibited from owning any part of that same river bed) from Teddington to the Yantlet Line (between Southend and Grain). During much of the 20th century the PLA owned and operated many of the docks and wharfs in the port, but they have all now been either closed or privatised. Today the PLA acts mainly as a managing authority for the tidal stretch of the River Thames, ensuring safe navigation, and the well-being of the port and its activities. Comparable responsibilities for the river including, and upstream of, Teddington Lock fall to the Environment Agency. The PLA today has a number of statutory duties, including river traffic control, security, navigational safety (including pilotage, buoys, beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), conservation (including dredging and maintaining certain river banks), encouraging both commercial and leisure uses of the river, and protecting its environment. The PLA is responsible for the operation of Richmond Lock, but not for the Thames Barrier which is managed by the Environment Agency in its flood management role.  Harbour masters  The PLA's navigational safety team is headed by a Chief Harbour Master who has overall responsibility for defining and enforcing the regulations needed to support and manage the safety of navigation within the PLA's limits. Given the extensive length of river covered by the PLA, day to day management of the river is overseen by two district harbour masters who cover the river between Teddington Lock and Crossness (around Dagenham) and Crossness and the outer estuary, respectively. Centres Former PLA Cold Store, Charterhouse Street, Smithfield The PLA originally had its headquarters on Tower Hill in the City of London, but today it is based at London River House and Royal Terrace Pier in Gravesend. The PLA retains a presence in the City in offices at Bakers' Hall on Harp Lane, where the Chairman, Chief Executive and Secretary of the PLA are based. Control of ship traffic on the Thames within the Port is orchestrated from two Port Control centres: *The Thames Barrier Navigation Centre in Woolwich, for reaches upstream of Erith, London, and *Port Control Gravesend (the main facility) for reaches downstream of Erith. Both Port Control centres operate the same system for coordinating traffic within the PLA's area, Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). The system involves 16 radar stations along the river and out in the estuary. The PLA owns Denton Wharf and Jetty in Gravesend, which is the main base for its fleet of more than 40 vessels. It also provides lift-out and maintenance services for other users of the Thames. The PLA owns Barrier Gardens Pier and Unity House, near the Thames Barrier, providing a convenient base for its Driftwood vessels. There are also two pilot stations at Harwich and Ramsgate, beyond the estuary and the Port of London. From these stations pilots are sent out and return from large vessels entering and leaving the Port. The PLA employs about 360 people.  Pier and jetty ownership  The PLA owns three piers and jetties on the River Thames. These are available for other river users as well as the PLA's own vessels. * Barrier Gardens Pier and Unity House, Woolwich * Royal Terrace Pier and landing stage, Gravesend * Denton Wharf and Jetty, Gravesend Vessels A PLA harbour master craft at Woolwich The PLA has four channel surveying vessels, eight launches for harbour and river patrols, and twenty other craft.

Railways PLA 69, Hawthorn Leslie 0-6-0T The PLA inherited an extensive railway system from the previous dock companies. This included engine sheds (located at Millwall, Tilbury and Custom House), its own signal boxes and level crossings. The main duties undertaken by the authority‚Äôs locomotives were shunting the various sidings, yards (which provided links to the mainline system), wharves and factories around the PLA estate. The PLA operated a fleet of 0-6-0T and 0-6-0ST steam locomotives made by various manufacturers including Hudswell Clark, Robert Stephenson, Andrew Barclay, Hunslet and Manning Wardle. The steam locomotives were largely withdrawn in 1959 although a few lingered on until 1963. The diesels that replaced them were built by the Yorkshire Engine Company but with declining traffic the railway system closed on 1 May 1970. Traditions The Lord Mayor of London, the chief dignitary of the City of London, is ex officio the Admiral of the Port of London. left The PLA uses a blue ensign with a gold heraldic sealion on all its vessels. It also has a house flag and pennants for the use of the chairman and the vice chairman of its board. The coat of arms of the PLA was granted in August 1909. The blazon or heraldic description is as follows: > Azure, issuing from a castle argent, a demi-man vested, holding in the > dexter hand a drawn sword, and in the sinister a scroll Or, the one > representing the Tower of London, the other the figure of St Paul, the > patron saint of London. > Crest: On a wreath of the colours, an ancient ship Or, the main sail charged > with the arms of the City of London. > Supporters: On either side a sea-lion argent, crined, finned and tufted or, > issuing from waves of the sea proper, that to the sinister grasping the > banner of King Edward II; that to the dexter the banner of King Edward VII The Latin motto is \\"Floreat Imperii Portvs\\", meaning \\"May the Port of the Empire Flourish\\".

A multi-instrumentalist, he was best known for his guitar and violin work and his collaborations with The Residents. History Lithman was born in Tooting, South London, and came from the British blues scene. He moved to San Francisco in 1971 and became associated with the avant-garde group The Residents. It is said he was given the name 'Snakefinger' by The Residents themselves based on a photograph of Lithman performing, in which his finger looks like a snake about to attack his violin. In 1972 Lithman returned to England and formed the pub rock band Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers with Martin Stone, ex-member of Mighty Baby and a fellow ex-member of Junior's Blues Band. As a duo, they released the album Kings of Robot Rhythm. In 1974, as a full band and popular live act in Britain, they released Bongos Over Balham. Chilli Willi lasted until 1975, their last record not selling well, and by 1976 Lithman was back in the United States, this time in Los Angeles, California, seeking a recording contract, shopping his rock-style demos. After a few years, Lithman moved back to San Francisco, reconnected with The Residents, and performed and recorded with them. Lithman's solo records, recorded under the name Snakefinger, were released by their record label Ralph Records. His first album on Ralph was Chewing Hides the Sound in 1979, featuring original material co-written with The Residents as well as esoteric covers like Kraftwerk's \\"The Model\\". The songs showcased Lithman's distinctive slide guitar playing and often surreal imagery. This album was followed by Greener Postures in 1980, which included his first solo compositions as Snakefinger. While on tour in Australia in 1980, Lithman had a heart attack that left him hospitalised for six months. In 1982 Lithman formed his backing band The Vestal Virgins with former Captain Beefheart sideman Eric Drew Feldman. Snakefinger and The Vestal Virgins released Manual of Errors on Ralph in 1982. This was followed by the blues cover album Snakefinger's History of the Blues: Live in Europe in 1984. Lithman released his fourth and final album,Night of Desirable Objects in 1986, which consisted of largely original material. Lithman performed with The Residents on their 13th Anniversary Tour in 1986. Death On 1 July 1987, Snakefinger and his band, The Vestal Virgins, arrived in Linz, Austria, on the European Night tour. The next morning, he was found dead in a guestroom of the Posthof Club where the band had been due to perform. He had suffered a heart attack. His single \\"There's No Justice in Life\\" was released on the same day.

An inflatable is an object that can be inflated with a gas, usually with air, but hydrogen, helium and nitrogen are also used. One of several advantages of an inflatable is that it can be stored in a small space when not inflated, since inflatables depend on the presence of a gas to maintain their size and shape. Function fulfillment per mass used compared with non-inflatable strategies is a key advantage. Stadium cushions, impact guards, vehicle wheel inner tubes, emergency air bags, and inflatable space structures employ the inflatable principle. Inflation occurs through several strategies: pumps, ram-air, billowing, and suction. Although the term inflatable can refer to any type of inflatable object, the term is often used in boating to specifically refer to inflatable boats. Types =High-pressure vs. low-pressure= A distinction is made between high-pressure and low-pressure inflatables. In a high-pressure inflatable, structural limbs like pillars and arches are built out of a tough, flexible material and then inflated at a relatively high pressure. These limbs hold up passive membranes. The space where the visitors or inhabitants stay is at normal atmospheric pressure. For example, airplane emergency rafts are high-pressure inflatable structures. Low-pressure inflatables, on the other hand, are slightly pressurized environments completely held up by internal pressure. In other words, the visitors or inhabitants experience a slightly higher than normal pressure. Low-pressure inflatables are usually built of lighter materials. Both types of inflatables (the low-pressure type more so) are somewhat susceptible to high winds. =By use= Balloon A balloon is an inflatable flexible filled with air and also gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide or oxygen. Modern balloons can be made from materials such as latex rubber, polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, while some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders . Latex rubber balloons may be used as inexpensive children's toys or decorations, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation. A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications. The inventor of the natural latex rubber balloon, (the most common balloon) was Michael Faraday in 1824, via experiments with air and various gases.Swain, Heather (2010) These Toys: 101 Clever Creations Using Everyday Items Penguin, 2010 Inflatable castles An inflatable castle type of moonwalk. Inflatable castles and similar structures are temporary inflatable buildings and structures that are rented for functions, school and church festivals and village fetes and used for recreational purposes, mainly used by children. The growth in popularity of moonwalks has led to an inflatable rental industry which includes inflatable slides, obstacle courses, games, and more. Inflatables are ideal for portable amusements because they are easy to transport and store. The name given to such structures varies. They have been marketed with such names as Bounce house, Moon Bounce, Astrojump, Moonwalk, Jolly Jump, Leaping Lodge and Spacewalk. The term \\"Bounce House\\" came to popularity with the resurgence of hipster culture in New England. The term 'Jolly Jumps' is often used to describe the inflatable playground structure in rural areas and some areas in the Western US, but the term is otherwise obsolete. Although they are often aimed at children, adult castles can be hired in the UK. Because of liability concerns, moonwalks are rarely rented to adults in the US. Historically, names for inflatable structures, particularly in the United States, are composed of two, one syllable words. In the United States the terms that consist of two, one syllable words are popular. In Southern California, another popular term is Closed Inflatable Trampolines, or \\"CITs\\". Bouncy Castle or Inflatable Castle are used in Ireland, the UK, New Zealand and parts of Australia, and Jumping Castles in Arizona, Australia, Canada and South Africa. As a whole the term moon bounce has become a generic term for enclosed inflatable trampolines worldwide even though some still cling to the less popular hipster form \\"Bounce House.\\" Inflatable boat An inflatable boat. An inflatable boat is a lightweight boat constructed with its sides and bow made of flexible tubes containing pressurised gas. For smaller boats, the floor and hull beneath it is often flexible. On boats longer than , the floor often consists of three to five rigid plywood or aluminium sheets fixed between the tubes but not joined rigidly together. Often the transom is rigid, providing a location and structure for mounting an outboard motor. Some inflatable boats have been designed to be disassembled and packed into a small volume, so they can easily be stored and transported to water when needed. Here the boat when inflated is kept rigid crossways by a foldable removable thwart. This feature allows such boats to be used as liferafts for larger boats or aircraft, and for travel or recreational purposes. Other terms for inflatable boats are \\"inflatable dinghy\\", \\"rubber dinghy\\", \\"inflatable\\", \\"inflatable rescue boat\\" or \\"rubber duck\\". Pneumatic tire An inflated vehicle tire A tire (in American English and Canadian English) or tyre (in British English, New Zealand English, Australian English and others) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground. The word itself may be derived from the word \\"tie,\\" which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see Etymology below). The fundamental materials of modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, along with other compound chemicals. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body ensures support. Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels in order to prevent wear and tear. Today, the vast majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut- shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion. Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as bicycles, motorcycles, cars, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft. Air-supported structure Air-supported dome used as a sports and recreation venue An air-supported (or air-inflated) structure is any permanent building that derives its structural integrity from the use of internal pressurized air to inflate a pliable material (i.e. structural fabric) envelope, so that air is the main support of the structure. It is usually dome-shaped, since this shape creates the greatest volume for the least amount of material. However, rectangular inflatables are also possible, such as the Airtecture Exhibition Hall constructed by Festo AG & Co. The concept was popularized on a large scale by David H. Geiger with the United States pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan in 1970. To maintain structural integrity, the structure must be pressurized such that the internal pressure equals or exceeds any external pressure being applied to the structure (i.e. wind pressure). The structure does not have to be airtight to retain structural integrity‚Äîas long as the pressurization system that supplies internal pressure replaces any air leakage, the structure will remain stable. All access to the structure interior must be equipped with two sets of doors or revolving door (airlock). Air-supported structures are secured by heavy weights on the ground, ground anchors, attached to a foundation, or a combination of these. Inflatables for entertainment The original inflatable game was the Moonwalk (bounce house). Today there are a wide variety of inflatable games that come in all shapes and sizes. Many inflatable games put people in head to head competition with other people such as the bungee run and gladiator joust. There are also several inflatable obstacle courses available. Because of their large size, most obstacle courses consist of two or more inflatables connected together. There are also several variations on sports games which are made portable thanks to inflatables. A sports cage is an inflatable cage that holds up a backdrop that resembles a sport (e.g. baseball, American football, soccer, golf) in which you throw, toss, hit or kick a ball at a marked spot on the backdrop. The cage not only holds the backdrop but keeps balls from flying everywhere. Some sports cages come with a radar gun that will tell you the speed of your throw or kick. Decorative inflatables Holiday yard inflatables at a Walmart in The Villages, Florida. During the 2000s, inflatables have replaced the plastic blow-molded yard decorations used as Christmas decorations at many U.S. homes, and are also now used as Halloween decorations and for other occasions as well. These are made of a synthetic fabric, of which different colors have been sewn together in various patterns. An electric blower constantly forces air into the figure, replacing air lost through its fabric and seams. They are internally lit by small C7 incandescent light bulbs (also used in nightlights), which are covered by translucent plastic snap-on globes that protect the fabric from the heat if they should rest against it. Inflatables come in various sizes, commonly four feet or 1.2 meters tall (operated with a low-voltage DC power supply and a computer fan), and six or eight feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) tall, running directly from AC mains electricity. Like inflatable rides, outdoor types are staked to the ground with guy wires (usually synthetic rope or flat straps) to keep them upright in the wind, though being rather flimsy this does not always work. Heavy snow or rainwater which has accumulated may also prevent proper inflation. While these store compactly, there are disadvantages, including the large amount of electricity needed to constantly keep them inflated. While they can be turned off in the daytime, this leaves the figure deflated, and subject to the rain and snow problem. Freezing rain, heavy snow, or high winds may also cause inflatables to collapse. Additionally, like a tent, they must be completely dry before being packed for storage, or mildew may be a problem (especially if kept in a basement). Decorative inflatables can be mended using duct tape or rip stock patching tape. Since these materials are now available in colors, matching the patch to the inflatable is not difficult. Decorative inflatables are made in many popular characters, including Santa Claus and snowmen for Christmas, and ghosts and jack-o-lanterns for Halloween. Several trademarked characters are also produced, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Winnie the Pooh, and Snoopy and Woodstock from Peanuts. There are also walk-through arches and \\"haunted houses\\" for children, and items for other holidays like Uncle Sam for Independence Day, and palm trees for backyard summer cookouts. Since 2005, there are also inflatable snow globes which blow tiny styrofoam beads around on the inside, the blower's air jet picking them up and through a tube to the top, where they fall down inside the clear vinyl front. On others, mainly for Halloween, lightweight foam bats or ghosts spin around like confetti in what is called a \\"tornado globe\\". The figures inside both types are also inflatables. Since 2006, several of these have motion, which is driven by the air itself and the Venturi effect. The original is a merry-go-round (usually surrounded by clear vinyl for support), another from 2007 is an airplane with moving propeller. Ghosts may also have streamers which blow around where the air escapes. Alphie the Alpha Turtle floating on Darling Harbor (2014) Inflatables have been made by visual artists and displayed in prominent places in Australia, including on the water in Sydney Harbor and in the sky over the city of Canberra. Examples include Alphie the Alpha Turtle and Patricia Piccinini's The Skywhale. Structural inflatables Public screening with an inflatable movie screen Airbeams, inflatable spars, inflatable wings, and tensairity-enhanced inflatable bladders provide a means to structure practical objects. Inflatable ballute structures have been proposed for use during aerocapture, aerobraking and atmospheric entry of cubesat and nanosat satellites. The inflatable structures for these applications may take a variety of engineered shapes including stacked toroidal, tension cone and isotensoid ballute form factors. Inflatable space habitats have been proposed since the 1960s and one expandable space station is currently planned for launch in 2015.Bigelow Marketing Inflatable Space Stations, Aviation Week, 2010-05-06, accessed 2010-10-30. =Examples= Typical examples of an inflatable include the inflatable movie screen, inflatable boat, the balloon, the airship, furniture, kites, and numerous air-filled swimming pool toys. Air beams as structural elements are finding increasing applications. Balloons are inflatables. Smaller-scale inflatables (such as pool toys) generally consist of one or more \\"air chambers\\", which are hollow enclosures bound by a soft and flexible airtight material (such as vinyl), which a gas can enter into or leave from through valves (usually one on each air chamber). The design dependence upon an enclosed pocket of gas leads to a need for a very durable surface material and/or ease of repair of tears and holes on the material, since a puncture or tear will result in the escape of the gas inside (a leak) and the deflation of the inflatable, which depends on the gas's pressure to hold its form. Detectable leaks can be caused by holes (from punctures or tears) on the material, the separating of seams, the separating of valve parts, or an improperly shut or improperly closing valve. Even if an inflatable possesses no macroscopic leaks, the gas inside will usually diffuse out of the inflatable, albeit at a much slower rate, until equilibrium is reached with the pressure outside the inflatable. Many inflatables are made of material that does not stretch upon inflation; a notable exception of this is the balloon, whose rubber stretches greatly when inflated. The airship is usually inflated with helium as it is lighter than air and does not burn unlike hydrogen airships such as the Hindenburg. Inflatables are also used for the construction of specific sports pitches, military quick-assembly tents, camping tent air beams, and noise makers. Inflatable aircraft including the Goodyear Inflatoplane have been used. Inflation by dynamic ram-air is providing wings for hang gliding and paragliding. Inflatables came very much into the public eye as architectural and domestic objects when synthetic materials became commonplace. Iconic structures like the US Pavilion at the 1970 Osaka Expo by Davis and Brody and Victor Lundy's travelling pavilion for the Atomic Energy Commission popularized the idea that inflatables can be a way to build large structures with very extendend interior spans without pillars. These great hopes for inflatable structures would later be dashed by the many practical difficulties faced by inflatable buildings, such as climatization, safety, sensitivity to wind and fireproofing that, currently, restrict their use to very specific circumstances. The DVD Ant Farm has directions for making your own inflatables, using plastic bags and an iron. The low technological barrier to building inflatables is further lowered by DIY instruction sets like the Inflatocookbook. A patent was granted in Australia in 2001 for a \\"Manually portable and inflatable automobile\\" (Australian Patent Number 2001100029), however no known practical form of this type of inflatable has yet been commercialised. Large scale low-pressure inflatables are often seen at festivals as decorations or inflatable games. These are made out of rip stop nylon and have a constant flow of air from a blower inflating them. In some cases, an inflatable roof is added to an otherwise traditional structure: the biggest example in the world was the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. Another example can be found in the Roman amphitheater of N√Æmes. Many companies use inflatables in the shape of their product or service; they do this because you need no permission to display them from your local council or authority and they are very easily moved from place to place. Inflatables have been used prominently in works of art by artists such as, Paul Chan (artist)https://4columns.org/laddaga- reinaldo/paul-chan, Martin Creedhttp://www.martincreed.com/site/works/work- no-200http://www.martincreed.com/site/works/work-no-360, John Jaspersehttp://johnjasperse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fort-Blossom- Revisited-Press-Kit.pdf, Jeff Koonshttp://www.jeffkoons.com/artwork/inflatables/inflatable-flower-and-bunny- tall-white-pink-bunny, and Andy Warhol.https://www.warhol.org/andy-warhols- silver-clouds-more-than-just-hot-air/ See also *Air mattress *Airship *Balloon *Beach ball *Cold-air inflatables *Inflatable arch *Inflatable boat *Inflatable tunnel *Inflatable movie screen *Inflatable costume *Inflatable rat *Leading edge inflatable kite *List of inflatable manufactured goods *Swim ring *Stiffening *Tire References Balloons Fluid dynamics Inflatable manufactured goods ","title":"Inflatable"},{"id":"294861","text":"Jean Luc Joseph Marie \\"Jean-Luc\\" Dehaene (; 7 August 1940 ‚Äì 15 May 2014) was a Belgian politician who served as Prime Minister of Belgium from 1992 until 1999. During his political career, he was nicknamed \\"The Plumber\\" and \\"The Minesweeper\\" for his ability to negotiate political deadlocks. A member of the Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD&V;) party and its antecedents, Dehaene gained his first ministerial appointment in 1981. Dehaene's first government (1992‚Äì1995) included both Christian and Social Democrats and presided over the creation of a new constitution, effectively transforming Belgium into a federal state. His second government (1995‚Äì1999) coincided with a number of crises in Belgium including the Dutroux scandal. The Dioxin Affair, occurring shortly before the 1999 election, led to a swing against the major parties and Dehaene's government fell. Following his final term as Prime Minister he was active in both Belgian and European politics. He was also on UEFA's financial fair play regulatory body and managed Dexia Bank during the financial crisis. He was the last prime minister of King Baudouin's reign. Early life and political career Dehaene was born on 7 August 1940 in Montpellier, France, when his parents were fleeing the advance of the German army into Belgium and France. During his studies at the Universit√© de Namur and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, he was a member of the Olivaint Conference of Belgium.Jean-Luc Dehaene obituary: Politician who fought hard to keep Belgium together and went on to lead Uefa‚Äôs Financial Fair Play initiative, , The Independent. Retrieved May 27, 2014 He got into politics through the ' (General Christian Workers' Union; ACW), a trade union which was closely linked to the Christelijke Volkspartij (Christian People's Party; CVP). Dehaene's long-time wife Celie Verbeke is a native of Illinois in the United States but both her paternal and maternal grandparents were Belgian immigrants. Since she was raised by her parents in Dutch and speaks without a foreign accent, the Belgian public remained unaware of her American background for a long time. Dehaene was a keen football fan, and viewed it as an important part of Belgian national identity. He was a supporter of Club Brugge K.V.. In 1981, he became Minister of Social Affairs and Institutional Reform, until 1988, when he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications and Institutional Reform. As Prime Minister =Dehaene I (1992‚Äì95)= Make-up of the Dehaene I government by party In 1992, after both Guy Verhofstadt and Melchior Wathelet had failed, Dehaene managed to form a governing coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. This became one of Belgium's most important governments, because it successfully transformed Belgium into a federal state in 1993. In March 1993, Dehaene offered the King the resignation of his government, because of diverging views on how to handle the public finances. However, within a week the differences were put aside. After the death of King Baudouin on 31 July 1993, Dehaene's government exercised the royal function until Prince Albert was sworn in as King Albert II nine days later. In 1994, Dehaene ordered the unilateral withdrawal of Belgian troops from Rwanda following the massacre of a number of Belgian peacekeepers, thus lifting the last barrier to the genocide of Tutsis. During questions from the Belgian parliamentary commission into this decision he repeatedly acknowledged no regrets about the decision. He was the leading candidate to replace Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission, but British Prime Minister John Major vetoed the appointment. The Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer was appointed as a compromise candidate instead. =Dehaene II (1995‚Äì99)= Jean-Luc Dehaene giving a speech in 2005 Dehaene's second government was also composed of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. Despite the fact that the government was marked by a number of political crises and scandals, most notably the Dutroux affair, it managed to serve the entire legislature. During this period, for his work toward a unified Europe, Dehaene received the Vision for Europe Award in 1996. Dehaene led Belgium into the Euro, and in preparation for joining the Eurozone, the Dehaene government was forced to make some sharp and unpopular economic reforms. Some weeks before the 1999 elections the dioxin affair erupted, and both governing parties lost much of their support. He was replaced by a new government, led by Flemish liberal Guy Verhofstadt. After 1999 =Later political career= Between 2000 and 2007, he sat as Burgemeester (mayor) of Vilvoorde. At the request of his party, the CD&V;, he was once again put up as a candidate during the 2003 elections, but this was clearly not with the intention of becoming Prime Minister as he was put as last person on the party list. In June 2004 and again in June 2009, Jean-Luc Dehaene was elected to the European Parliament for the CD&V; within the center-right European People's Party (EPP) group. In 2003, he was awarded the Vlerick Award. Between 2006 and 2007, Dehaene served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters. After the Belgian elections of 2007, Dehaene was appointed as mediator in the process to form a new government. He was also called in to assist in the negotiations around the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde partition. =UEFA Financial Fair Play= Jean-Luc Dehaene (left) with Wilfried Martens (center) at a European People's Party (EPP) meeting, 2005 Dehaene also served as the chief enforcer of the football association, UEFA's, Financial Fair Play (FFP). In 2011, he was involved in an investigation of Manchester City F.C. over sponsorship irregularities. =Dexia= Dehaene, who had previously been director of InBev, became chairman of Dexia Bank, a Belgian-French bank, in October 2008. With the bank in difficulty owing to the financial crisis, he was asked to lead the company through the difficult period which he described as \\"mission impossible\\". Owing to his extensive political background, it was thought that he could cope with the negative public perception Dexia had acquired through the financial crisis. His political connections helped Dexia's bad bank to secure funding guarantees of up to ‚Ç¨90 billion, provided primarily by the Belgian government. In 2012, Dexia Belgium became Belfius. Death On 15 May 2014, Dehaene died after a fall while holidaying in Quimper in France. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier the same year and was not seeking reelection as an MEP in the 2014 elections for health reasons. He was 73 years old. In the aftermath of his death, he received tributes from the incumbent Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo who described him as an \\"exceptional statesman\\". Tributes were also made by Guy Verhofstadt, President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz and President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso. His body lay in state in Vilvoorde's town hall and the retired King Albert II and the Flemish Minister-President Kris Peeters both visited Vilvoorde to pay their respects.

Marching Pep Band, & Chowder Society Review, Unlimited!!!\\". In the tradition of scatter or scramble bands, like those at Stanford, Rice and the Ivy League, the Pep Band preferred irreverent humor and individuality to marching in uniform formations. Founded in 1974, this group of students served as UVa's band supporting athletics in an official capacity until 2003. After being banned from official athletic events in 2003, the group continued to perform at sporting events such as swimming, field hockey, and ice hockey. The ensemble has also performed at Charlottesville community events including the Charlottesville 10-miler, the Alzheimer's Walk, and the United Way Day of Caring. History Uniquely painted sousaphones used by the Virginia Pep Band The earliest appearance of the organization which became the Virginia Pep Band was in 1909, when the East Lawn Chowder Society appeared in the University of Virginia yearbook, Corks and Curls. The East Lawn Chowder Society was a secret society that engaged in general tomfoolery, often involving their rivals, the West Lawn Chowder Society. Later, the East Lawn Society formed a band, which evolved over time into the most recently recognized format. The style and appearance of the organization has changed over time; at some point it even performed a traditional marching band style as the University of Virginia Marching Band (this is why both \\"award-winning\\" and \\"marching\\" appear in the band's name). In the fall of 1974, under the leadership of Stephen F. Mershon, Hugh Riley, and Franklin Seney, the band adopted the Ivy League scramble band style, beginning the modern era of the band. In the early scramble-band seasons, the band did, in fact, march for the opening and closing numbers in more-or-less straight lines. Marching was later abandoned entirely. The one thing common to all of the current group's predecessors was student governance‚Äîcomplete control by its members rather than University faculty. =The \\"Revolution of '93\\"= In 1993, UVa's then‚Äìathletic director, Jim Copeland, announced that the Pep Band would be run by a professional band director. In response, the band went on strike, and its leaders argued they were standing up for student self-governance. Called the \\"Revolution of '93\\" by Pep Band members, the clash with the athletic department garnered national attention. Columns and letters in news sources such as The New York Times, the Washington Post, and USA Today addressed the conflict. During the strike, the athletic department replaced the Pep Band with a faculty-run group called the \\"UVa Sports Band,\\" a 24-member band which included several hired musicians. The Sports Band proved unpopular with fans, and was introduced at Scott Stadium only once (when it was resoundingly booed). During this game, Pep Band members protested on \\"The Hill\\". The athletic department reinstated the Pep Band to athletic events in time for the last home game of the season against Virginia Tech. =The Expulsion of 2003= The band's performance at the 2002 Continental Tire Bowl prompted West Virginia Governor Bob Wise to demand an apology from the band and the school for its portrayal of West Virginia residents. The show's script was the result of student writing followed by Athletics Department censorship and approval, and is available online. The Pep Band was permanently banned from ever playing at the bowl again. This prompted emails and phone calls to the UVa Athletics Department, some suggesting the elimination of the Pep Band and the creation of a university marching band. In the spring of 2003, after the last issue of the Cavalier Daily was published for the year, the Athletics Department banned the Pep Band from performing at official UVa athletic events. Athletics Department officials locked the Pep Band's storage closet without warning, effectively confiscating the band's instruments, both University owned and private. The formation of a new marching band, the Cavalier Marching Band, to debut for the 2004 football season was announced, although the 2003 season was left with no official band. The new band would be run by a professional band director and staff, as opposed to the Pep Band, whose director and managing board were elected from among its student members. The University of Virginia student council passed a resolution in February 2004 asking for the cooperative \\"coexistence of two bands,\\" both the faculty and the student-run organizations. Specifically, they asked for the Pep Band's return to athletic events, especially those where the marching band would not perform, but the Athletics Department made no official response to the resolution, leading Pep Band advocates to decry what they saw as an outright dismissal of student governance. The Athletics Department cited several reasons for the change, including fan disinterest in, or fan outrage at, their performances, which were intended to be provocative. Pep Band Director Adam Lorentson said at the time that \\"cost is the key reason the University does not have a traditional marching band.\\" The principal players in the Continental Tire Bowl Show, including a \\"West Virginia Student\\" (left), \\"The Bachelor\\" (center), and a\\"UVa Student\\" (right). Advocates for the Virginia Pep Band, including some in the Cavalier Daily editorial section, claimed that there was strong student support for the organization and that the administration of the University of Virginia and its Athletics Department were exerting more control over something that was historically student-run. They saw the elimination of a \\"student-run\\" band as a departure from what they considered to be the Jeffersonian ideals of self-government and freedom of speech that the University of Virginia inherited from its founder. They point out that all the scripts for their performances had been approved by the UVa Athletics Department and, in the case of the Tire Bowl, by the bowl officials themselves. Some columnists downplayed the offensiveness of the band's performances; one Washington Post columnist wrote that the Pep Band was \\"banned not for the crime of political incorrectness, but for the potential to possibly, just maybe, somehow, somewhere, some day commit it.\\" Despite the ban, the Pep Band remained active from 2003 to 2011, performing its traditional roles in Charlottesville events and supporting University of Virginia student athletes outside the jurisdiction of the athletic department, such as at club sporting events. For some years on football game day, the Pep Band performed regularly for the UVa Alumni Association at Alumni Hall, as well as performing what they call a \\"pre-game scramble\\" for tailgating fans outside Scott Stadium. They also performed for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League and the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball. Current status The Virginia Pep Band ceased being an official student group at UVa in 2011. The band was incorporated as Virginia Pep Band inc. in 2011, which consists of a board of alumni charged with maintaining the band's property and legacy.

By default, \\"correlation function\\" refers to the two-point autocorrelation function. The two-point autocorrelation function is a function of one variable (distance); it describes the excess probability of finding two galaxies separated by this distance (excess over and above the probability that would arise if the galaxies were simply scattered independently and with uniform probability). It can be thought of as a lumpiness factor - the higher the value for some distance scale, the more lumpy the universe is at that distance scale. The following definition (from Peebles 1980) is often cited: : Given a random galaxy in a location, the correlation function describes the probability that another galaxy will be found within a given distance. However, it can only be correct in the statistical sense that it is averaged over a large number of galaxies chosen as the first, random galaxy. If just one random galaxy is chosen, then the definition is no longer correct, firstly because it is meaningless to talk of just one \\"random\\" galaxy, and secondly because the function will vary wildly depending on which galaxy is chosen, in contradiction with its definition as a function. Assuming the universe is isotropic (which observations suggest), the correlation function is a function of a scalar distance. The two-point correlation function can then be written as :\\\\xi_2(\\\\left \\\\mathbf x_1 - \\\\mathbf x_2 \\\\right) = \\\\langle \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x_1) \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x_2) \\\\rangle, where \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x) = (\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf x) - \\\\bar\\\\rho)/\\\\bar\\\\rho is a unitless measure of overdensity, defined at every point. Letting \\\\Delta = \\\\left \\\\mathbf x_1 - \\\\mathbf x_2 \\\\right, it can also be expressed as the integral :\\\\xi_2(\\\\Delta) = \\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\int d^3 x \\\\, \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x) \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf x + \\\\mathbf \\\\Delta) . The spatial correlation function \\\\xi(r) is related to the Fourier space power spectrum of the galaxy distribution, P(k), as \\\\xi(r) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi^2} \\\\int dk \\\\, k^2 P(k) \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\sin(kr)}{kr} The n-point autocorrelation functions for n greater than 2 or cross-correlation functions for particular object types are defined similarly to the two-point autocorrelation function. The correlation function is important for theoretical models of physical cosmology because it provides a means of testing models which assume different things about the contents of the universe.

Joining the band in 2001, Shriner is the band's longest serving bass guitarist. Prior to his musical career, Shriner was a member of the Marine Corps. At the age of twenty-five, he moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music, attending the Musicians Institute. Shriner subsequently performed with multiple independent acts, and toured in Vanilla Ice's backing band, in support of the rapper's nu metal album Hard to Swallow. In 2001, Shriner joined Weezer on a provisional basis, following the sudden departure of bass guitarist Mikey Welsh, who had left the band due to personal reasons. Upon becoming Welsh's full-time replacement, Shriner made his recording debut on the band's fourth studio album, Maladroit (2002). During the band's tour in support of its fifth studio album, Make Believe (2005), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo would at times relinquish his role as lead vocalist to allow Shriner, and his bandmates, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson, to sing lead vocals on specific songs. This increased vocal responsibility carried over to the band's 2008 self-titled release (aka the \\"Red Album\\"), where Shriner co-wrote and sang lead vocals on \\"Cold Dark World\\" and performed lead vocals on \\"King\\". Shriner also performed in his bandmate Patrick Wilson's side-project The Special Goodness for some time. Early life Shriner was born in Toledo, Ohio. He took up bass in high school.Luerssen D., John. Rivers' Edge: The Weezer Story. ECW Press, 2004, p. 369 After being discharged from the Marine Corps, he found his high school bass teacher Mark Kieswetter, with whom he studied until moving to Los Angeles in 1989. While in Toledo, Shriner and his best friend Rob Weaver started a band called The Seventh Wave with former Newles members Bob Schramm and Bill Whitman. Shriner went on to play with several Toledo bands, namely The Movers, The Fever, The Theresa Harris Band, and Loved by Millions. He then finished his Toledo music experience with Tim Gahagen, Matt Donahue and Brad Coffin in a band called \\"The Great Barbeque Gods\\". Shriner moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of 25 to attend Musicians Institute and went on to play in several bands including Broken, Bomber, Black Elvis, Mystery Train, Electric Love Hogs, Crown and, most notably, Vanilla Ice's backing band, in support of the rapper's nu metal album Hard to Swallow.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 370Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 371 Weezer In the summer of 2001, Shriner joined Weezer on a provisional basis. Following the departure of their second bassist, Mikey Welsh (who left the band due to personal problems), Shriner was made their full-time bassist.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 372 In his first show with Weezer, the 2001 KROQ-FM Inland Invasion, he was attacked by a man later found out to be a friend of his, yet continued to play on as security guards pried the guy off his back. Initially it was made clear to Shriner that he was not going to be a member of the band and was just filling in until Welsh returned. It was only during the photo shoot for the Maladroit album artwork that Shriner realized that he was officially a member of Weezer, having previously only been told to show up for gigs and recording. Shriner is now Weezer's third bassist, and the longest-running bassist in Weezer history. He has appeared on ten of Weezer's thirteen studio albums: Maladroit, Make Believe, Weezer (The Red Album), Raditude, Hurley, Everything Will Be Alright in the End, Weezer (The White Album), Pacific Daydream (2017 Weezer), Weezer (The Teal Album), and Weezer (The Black Album) (2019). On Weezer's third self- titled album, he co-wrote and sang lead vocals on \\"Cold Dark World,\\" sang lead vocals on \\"King\\" (a deluxe edition track), and sang most of the lead vocals for the band's covers of \\"The Weight\\" by The Band and \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\" by R.E.M. Scott Shriner performing with Weezer at Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on August 5, 2019. In 2005, he sang lead vocals on Weezer songs \\"In the Garage,\\" \\"Dope Nose,\\" and \\"Fall Together.\\" In 2008, during the band's Hootenanny Tour, he sang lead vocals on a cover of \\"Creep\\" by Radiohead. On the band's 2008 Troublemaker Tour, he sang \\"Perfect Situation\\" and \\"My Name is Jonas,\\" which he sings in a three-way lead vocal second, with Patrick Wilson and Rivers Cuomo singing lead vocals first and last respectively. He also played on the band's EP The Lion and the Witch and numerous b-sides and demos that can be found on the internet. He has also played shows with Patrick Wilson's band The Special Goodness. On April 11, 2018, several days prior to the Cars' performance at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on April 14, Shriner announced that he would perform with the band. Shriner had previously worked with Cars leader Ric Ocasek when the latter produced the 2014 Weezer album Everything Will Be Alright in the End. In 2020, Shriner voiced himself in The Simpsons episode \\"The Hateful Eight-Year-Olds\\", along with the rest of Weezer. Equipment Shriner's primary bass guitars are his 1960 and 1962 Fender Precision Bass guitars, and an Electrical Guitar Company Custom Bass; he can also be seen playing Lakland and Warwick Thumb, and more recently, a Rickenbacker bass. His rig setup consists of an early 70's Ampeg SVT Head and Mesa Boogie 8x10 and 4x12 cabinets. For distortion, Scott uses an Electro-Harmonix bass big muff pi. Scott also uses Shure in-ear monitors. Personal life On November 9, 2005, Shriner married Jillian Lauren, author and former member of the harem of Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei, in Hawaii. The couple have two adopted children. They have two dogs, Peanut and Calvin, both of whom appeared in a PETA video encouraging people to adopt from shelters.\\"Weezer Bassist Scott Shriner Stars in New PETA Campaign,\\" ABC News Radio, 4 March 2015 He guest-starred with the band The Scrantones at the 2007 The Office convention. During this performance, the band played Radiohead's \\"Creep\\" with The Office's Craig Robinson on vocals. In June 2009, Scott guest- starred with E.J.

Until 1998, he was the bassist for the alternative rock band Weezer, which he cofounded in 1992. He appears on their first two albums, the Blue Album (1994) and Pinkerton (1996). In 1994, Sharp founded the Rentals, who have released four albums. Sharp has also released an EP and an album as a solo artist. Early life Matt Sharp was born in Bangkok, Thailand, to American parents on September 22, 1969, and moved to Arlington, Virginia, when he was one year old. At the age of nine, he made his first musical purchase, a 45 rpm single of the song \\"Le Freak\\" by Chic.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 50 At sixteen, he moved to San Diego.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 51 In 1989, Sharp started fronting a goth band named the Clique. The band lasted less than one year. A few months after its demise, he befriended future Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson, and they created the band 60 Wrong Sausages. Future Weezer guitarist Jason Cropper soon joined.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 53 At this time, Wilson was also in a band with future Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo named Fuzz. In need of an 8-track player, Wilson convinced Cuomo to move into the same apartment he and Sharp were sharing.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 55 During this time, Sharp worked as a telemarketer.  Career  In mid-1991, Sharp moved north to Berkeley to pursue what Weezer collaborator Karl Koch called \\"some sorta symphonic keyboard sequencing music\\".Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 56 Other members of the band moved to separate apartments.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 58 In January 1992, Wilson showed him material he and Cuomo had been working on. Impressed, Sharp returned to Los Angeles to join the band, now under the name Weezer.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 62 = 1994‚Äì1999: Weezer and the Rentals = Weezer released their self-titled debut album in May 1994. It was certified platinum in January 1995. In early 1994, Sharp founded the Rentals.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 150 They released their debut album Return of the Rentals the following year, which featured the radio hit \\"Friends of P\\". Weezer's second album, Pinkerton, was released in September 1996. With a darker, more abrasive sound, Pinkerton was a commercial and critical failure, but attained critical acclaim later. Following the mixed response to Pinkerton, Weezer went on a five-year hiatus. Sharp left Weezer in February 1998.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 257 In 2016 he said of his departure: \\"I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared. I certainly have my view of it, as I'm sure everybody else has their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn't communicate, you're going to have a whole lot of different stories.\\" In 1999, the Rentals released their second album, Seven More Minutes. Among its contributors were Damon Albarn (of Blur and Gorillaz), Donna Matthews (of Elastica), Miki Berenyi (of Lush), and Tim Wheeler (of Ash).Seven More Minutes booklet and liner notes Maya Rudolph (later of Saturday Night Live) was a member of the touring band during this time. The track \\"My Head is in the Sun\\" was co- written with Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo. The album sold considerably less than Return of the Rentals, and the Rentals went on hiatus in late 1999.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 273 = 2000‚Äì2003: Solo records and Weezer lawsuit = Sharp moved to the town of Leiper's Fork, Tennessee, about an hour outside of Nashville, and began recording. In an interview with MTV News, Sharp said he was trying to cut ties to the music world.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 470 Sharp went on an acoustic tour in 2002 with former Cake guitarist Greg Brown.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 469 In 2003, after a four-year hiatus, Sharp returned with an EP, Puckett's Versus the Country Boy.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 472 On April 19, 2002, Sharp filed a five-count federal lawsuit against Weezer. He alleged he was owed royalties for co-writing Weezer's first hit, \\"Undone ‚Äì The Sweater Song\\", and that he owned a 25% interest in the first nine tracks of Pinkerton, which had been credited solely to Cuomo. Sharp also claimed he had handled most of Weezer's business affairs during their early success, including the hiring of accountants and attorneys, as well as helping the band secure their record deal.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 423 The lawsuit also stated that Cuomo was going to ask him to appear in the music video for their 2001 song \\"Island in the Sun\\". Finally, Sharp charged his former bandmates with breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, dissolution of partnership, and declaratory relief.Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 424 The lawsuit was settled out of court. = 2003‚Äìpresent: Reunion with Cuomo, re- formation of the Rentals = In 2003, Sharp released a solo EP, followed by a self-titled solo album in 2004. He continued to tour in 2004‚Äì2005 with the band Goldenboy. On February 12, 2004, Sharp and Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo reunited onstage when Rivers sat in during a solo performance by Matt at Cal State Fullerton. Sharp and Cuomo played four songs together: the Sharp/Cuomo collaborations \\"Mrs. Young\\" and \\"Time Song,\\" as well as Weezer songs \\"Say It Ain't So\\" and \\"Undone\\". Sharp announced at the show that he and Cuomo would be working on a collaborative record together. Later in 2004, Sharp announced on his website that although he and Cuomo had come up with \\"15 or 16 new song ideas\\", their \\"special brand of dysfunctionality\\" might keep them from finishing the project. In March 2004, Sharp recorded synthesizer on So Jealous by Canadian indie pop band Tegan and Sara. After a slow period in 2005, Sharp contemplated what to do next, considering either a new solo album or starting a new collaborative partnership. The possibility of him rejoining Weezer was also an option; although this did not happen, in a 2006 interview, Sharp credited these conversations with Cuomo as giving him the idea to return to writing pop music, which eventually led him to re-form the Rentals. These ideas particularly strengthened after meeting Sara Radle. In 2005, six years after 1999's Seven More Minutes, the Rentals re-formed; the new lineup included original backup vocalist Rachel Haden, Sara Radle, Ben Pringle of Nerf Herder, Lauren Chipman, and Dan Joeright. Sharp and the Rentals toured North America in the summers of 2006 and 2007. The Rentals released The Last Little Life EP on August 14, 2007. Between Rentals tours, Sharp returned to work in early 2007 with Tegan and Sara on their next album, The Con, later appearing at their concerts in 2008 to play bass in a cover of Weezer's \\"Tired of Sex\\". After the three releases in the Songs About Time series in April, July, and October 2009, Sharp and the Rentals went on hiatus. In October 2010, Sharp sold most of his equipment from his Weezer and Rentals days on eBay. His Orange Matamp Lead 200 was purchased by Greg Veerman, bassist of Canadian rock band San Sebastian. In November 2010, Cuomo mentioned in an interview with Spin that \\"the idea came up\\" of having Sharp rejoin the band for their \\"Memories Tour\\", in which they play The Blue Album and Pinkerton. Cuomo said: \\"I think we left that idea behind pretty early on. I don't remember. I wasn't involved in the discussion so I don't know what the issues were.\\" Discography =Weezer= * 1994 ‚Äì Weezer (The Blue Album) * 1996 ‚Äì Pinkerton =The Rentals= * 1995 ‚Äì Return of the Rentals * 1999 ‚Äì Seven More Minutes * 2007 ‚Äì The Last Little Life EP * 2009 ‚Äì Songs About Time * 2011 ‚Äì Resilience: A Benefit Album for the Relief Effort in Japan * 2014 ‚Äì Lost in Alphaville * 2020 ‚Äì Q36 =Solo= * 2003 ‚Äì Puckett's Versus the Country Boy * 2004 ‚Äì Matt Sharp =With Homie= * 1998 ‚Äì \\"American Girls\\" from the Meet the Deedles Soundtrack =With Tegan and Sara= * 2004 ‚Äì So Jealous * 2007 ‚Äì The Con  References   Bibliography  * .

The club was previously a biker bar and before that was a dive bar. The letters CBGB were for Country, BlueGrass, and Blues, Kristal's original vision, yet CBGB soon became a famed venue of punk rock and new wave bands like the Ramones, Television, Patti Smith Group, Blondie, and Talking Heads. From the early 1980s onward, CBGB was known for hardcore punk.Bands such as Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, U.S. Chaos, Cro-Mags, Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of It All, and Youth of Today became identified with CBGB. One storefront beside CBGB became the \\"CBGB Record Canteen,\\" a record shop and caf√©. In the late 1980s, \\"CBGB Record Canteen\\" was converted into an art gallery and second performance space, \\"CB's 313 Gallery.\\" CB's Gallery was played by music artists of milder sounds, such as acoustic rock, folk, jazz, or experimental music, such as Dadadah, Kristeen Young and Toshi Reagon, while CBGB continued to showcase mainly hardcore punk, post punk, metal, and alternative rock. 313 Gallery was also the host location for Alchemy, a weekly Goth night showcasing goth, industrial, dark rock, and darkwave bands. On the other side, CBGB was operating a small cafe and bar in the mid-1990s, which served classic New York pizza, among other items. Around 2000, CBGB entered a protracted dispute over allegedly unpaid rent amounts until the landlord, Bowery Residents' Committee, sued in 2005 and lost the case, but a deal to renew CBGB's lease, expiring in 2006, failed. The club closed upon its final concert, played by Patti Smith, on October 15, 2006.Yahoo Music coverage of concert. CBGB Radio launched on the iHeartRadio platform in 2010, and CBGB music festivals began in 2012. In 2013, CBGB's onetime building, 315 Bowery, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of The Bowery Historic District (not a New York City Historic District). Founding CBGB was founded on December 10, 1973,Q magazine, 2002 on the site of Kristal's earlier bar, Hilly's on the Bowery, that he ran from 1969 to 1972. Initially, Kristal focused on his more profitable East Village nightspot, Hilly's, which Kristal closed amid complaints from the bar's neighbors. After Hilly's closure, Kristal focused on the Bowery club. Its full name of CBGB & OMFUG stands for \\"Country, Bluegrass, Blues and Other Music for Uplifting Gormandizers.\\" Although a gormandizer is usually a ravenous eater of food, what Kristal meant was \\"a voracious eater of ‚Ä¶ music.\\" Official CBGB website . Kristal's intended theme of country, bluegrass, and blues music along with poetry readings yielded to the American movement in punk rock. A pioneer in the genre, the Ramones played their first shows at CBGB.Crotty & Lane, \\"Interview with Hilly,\\"The Mad Monks Guide to NYC, 1999, p 190. Evolution In 1973, while the future CBGB was still Hilly's, two locals‚ÄîBill Page and Rusty McKenna‚Äîconvinced Kristal to let them book concerts. In February 1974, Hilly booked local band Squeeze to a residency, playing Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the club's change from country and bluegrass to original rock bands. Squeeze was led by guitarist Mark Suall, later with CBGB's quasi house band the Revelons, which included Fred Smith of Television and JD Daugherty of the Patti Smith Group. Although these bands did not play punk rock, they helped lay its foundation.\\"Debunking CBGB myths: An interview with Dana, Hilly Kristal's son, Tiny Mix Tapes, September 11, 2007. The August 1973 collapse of the Mercer Arts Center left unsigned bands little option in New York City to play original music. Mercer refugees‚Äîincluding Suicide, The Fast, Ruby and the Rednecks, Wayne County, and the Magic Tramps‚Äîsoon played at CBGB.Marky Ramone of the Ramones and Debbie Harry of Blondie attend a screening of Burning Down the House: The Story of CBGB, a documentary on CBGB's heyday, at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival. In 1974, on April 14, in the audience of Television's third gig were Patti Smith and Lenny Kaye, whose Patti Smith Group debuted at CBGB on February 14, 1975. Other early performers included the Dina Regine Band. Dennis Lepri was lead guitarist as well as the Stillettoes which included Deborah Harry on vocals. The newly formed band Angel and the Snake, later renamed Blondie, as well as the Ramones arrived in August 1974. Mink DeVille, Talking Heads, the Shirts, the Heartbreakers, the Fleshtones and other bands soon followed. In April 1977, The Damned played the club, marking the first time a British punk band had ever played in America. During 1975 and 1976, Metropolis Video recorded some shows on film. Starting in 1977, Metropolis Video filmmaker Pat Ivers and partner Emily Armstrong continued to record shows in a project called Advanced TV, later renamed GoNightclubbing. Ivers' and Armstrong's films are available at the New York University Fales Library. CBGB's two rules were that a band must move its own equipment and play mostly original songs‚Äîthat is, no cover bands‚Äîalthough regular bands often played one or two covers in set.Kristal's son claims the policy meant to avert owing royalties to ASCAP. \\"Debunking CBGB myths: An interview with Dana, Hilly Kristal's Son, Tiny Mix Tapes, September 11, 2007. CBGB's growing reputation drew more and more acts from outside New York City. In 1978, new wave songwriter Elvis Costello would open shows for The Voidoids, while The Police played at CBGB for their first American gigs. Meanwhile, CBGB became famed for the Misfits, Television, Patti Smith Group, Mink DeVille, the Dead Boys, the Dictators, the Fleshtones, the Voidoids, the Cramps, the B-52's, Blondie, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, the Shirts, and Talking Heads. Yet in the 1980s, hardcore punk's New York underground was CBGB's mainstay. Named \\"thrash day\\" in a documentary on hardcore, Sunday at CBGB was matin√©e day, which became an institution, played from afternoon until evening by hardcore bands.Examples include Reagan Youth, Bad Brains, Beastie Boys, Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, Cro-Mags, Leeway, Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of It All, The Misfits, Sheer Terror, Stillborn and Youth of Today. In 1990, violence inside and outside of the venue prompted Kristal to suspend hardcore bookings, although CBGB brought hardcore back at times. CBGB's last several years had no formal bans by genre. Rent controversy In 2005, atop its normally paid monthly rent of $19,000, CBGB was sued for some $90,000 in rent allegedly owed to its landlord, Bowery Residents' Committee (BRC).Chris Harris, \\"CBGB doesn't have to pay $90,000 in back rent, judge rules\\", MTV News, August 10, 2005. Refusing to pay until a judge ruled the debt legitimate, Kristal claimed that he had never been notified of scaled rent increases, accruing over a number of years, asserted by BRC's executive director Muzzy Rosenblatt. Ruling the debt false‚Äîthat BRC had never properly billed the rent increases‚Äîthe judge indicated that CBGB ought to be declared a landmark, but noted that Rosenblatt did not need to renew the lease, soon expiring. Rosenblatt vowed to appeal. Expecting Rosenblatt's resistance to lease negotiation, Kristal agreed that the rent ought to rise, but not to the $55,000 monthly that Kristal believed the BRC to want.NY1 News, \\"Judge rules punk landmark CBGB doesn't owe back rent\\" , Time Warner Cable News: NY1, August 11, 2005. A nonprofit corporation housing homeless above CBGB mostly through donations and government funding, the BRC had only one commercial tenant and raised its monthly rent to $35,000. Kristal and the BRC reached an agreement whereby CBGB would leave by September 30, 2006.Unsigned, \\"CBGB to shut down on Sept. 30\\", Billboard website, July 6, 2006. Planning to move CBGB to Las Vegas, Kristal explained, \\"We're going to take the urinals. I'll take whatever I can. The movers said, 'You ought to take everything, and auction off what you don't want on eBay.' Why not? Somebody will.\\"\\"Stars return in CBGB's last shows\\", BBC News, October 12, 2006. Closure Exterior view of CBGB on the day it closed CBGB on the day after it closed Many punk rock bands played at CBGB when they found it was going to close in hopes that their support could keep it from closing. Rocks Off, a promoter in New York, organized CBGB's final weeks of shows to book \\"many of the artists who made CB's famous.\\" Avail, the Bouncing Souls, and such newer acts opened during the last week, which included multi-night stands by Bad Brains and the Dictators and an acoustic set by Blondie. The final show, broadcast live on Sirius Satellite Radio on October 15, was played by Patti Smith, helped on some songs by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Television's Richard Lloyd, too, played in a few, including \\"Marquee Moon\\". Nearly finished, Smith and band playing \\"Gloria\\" alternated the chorus with echos of \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\"‚Äîby the Ramones‚ÄîHey! Ho! Let's go!. During \\"Elegie,\\" her final encore, Smith named musicians and other music figures who had died since playing at CBGB. On October 15, 2006, upon Patti Smith's last show at CBGB, the storied bar and club closed. Aftermath After closing, the old CBGB venue remained open as CBGB Fashions‚Äîretail store, wholesale department, and an online store‚Äîuntil October 31, 2006. CBGB Fashions moved to 19‚Äì23 St. Mark's Place on November 1, and closed nearly two years later in summer 2008. Hilly Kristal died from complications of lung cancer on August 28, 2007. In early October, Kristal's family and friends hosted a private memorial service in the nearby YMCA. Soon, there was a public memorial, contributed to by CBGB onetime staff and by others. Kristal's ex-wife Karen Kristal and his daughter, Lisa Kristal Burgman, battled legally over the purported $3 million CBGB estate, and settled in June 2009 with Burgman receiving most of the money left after payment of creditors and estate taxes.The final CBGB settlement: Hilly Kristal's estate takes its last legal bow , Village Voice, June 16, 2009. In 2011, a group of unknown investors bought the remaining CBGB assets, including the associated intellectual property and original interior. The location is now occupied by John Varvatos fashions. In December 2015, various news outlets reported on a rebranded CBGB \\"reopening\\" at Newark International Airport - as CBGB L.A.B. (Lounge and Bar) by New York Chef chef Harold Moore; which had opened as of the end of December 2015. Venue The John Varvatos store on the site where CBGB used to stand CBGB '73 in front of the former location. By late 2007, fashion designer John Varvatos planned to open a store in CBGB's former space, 315 Bowery, but to tastefully trail CBGB's legacy rock and roll stickers on the walls, and much of the graffiti at the toilets was preserved, as were some playbills, found behind a wall, from shows at the club's 10th anniversary in 1983. The store opened in April 2008. In 2008, a SoHo art gallery dedicated to music photography, the Morrison Hotel, opened a second location in the onetime CBGB Gallery at 313 Bowery, but the Morrison Hotel gallery closed in 2011. The building is currently occupied by Patagonia, a clothing store. Called the \\"Extra Place\\", the alley behind the building became a pedestrian mall. The Dead Boys' Cheetah Chrome rued, \\"All of Manhattan has lost its soul to money lords\\", yet reflected, \\"If that alley could talk, it's seen it all\\". CBGB's nomination as a landmark drew an explanation: Today visitors can see etched into the cement at the entrance to the clothing store, the name of the music venue and the date it was founded \\"CBGB '73\\". People often stop and take pictures of the inscription as well as the facade of the store. Influence CBGB's awning was moved into the lobby of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. The CBGB Festival produced large free concerts in Times Square and Central Park on July 7, 2012. They also showcased hundreds of bands in venues across the city. The festival premiered dozens of rock-n- roll movies in theaters around Manhattan.

History The Ouachita National Forest is the oldest National Forest in the southern United States. The forest encompasses , including most of the scenic Ouachita Mountains. Six locations in the forest, comprising , have been designated as wilderness areas. Ouachita is the French spelling of the Indian word Washita, which means \\"good hunting grounds.\\" The forest was known as Arkansas National Forest on its establishment on December 18, 1907; the name was changed to Ouachita National Forest on April 29, 1926. Ouachita National Forest Rich in history, the rugged and scenic Ouachita Mountains were explored by Europeans in 1541 by Hernando de Soto's party of Spaniards. French explorers followed, flavoring the region with names like Fourche La Fave River. The area including the forest nearly became a national park during the 1920s, but a last-minute pocket veto by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge ended the effort. The bill had been pushed by U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson and U.S. Representative Otis Wingo, both Democrats, and State Representative Osro Cobb, then the only Republican in the Arkansas legislature. Cobb had been invited to meet with Coolidge before the proposal was killed because of opposition from the National Park Service and the United States Department of Agriculture,Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas (Little Rock, Arkansas: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), pp. 41‚Äì44 presumably because of the nearby location of Hot Springs National Park. In a magazine article, Cobb describes the area that he had sought to protect for future generations, located approximately midway between Little Rock and Shreveport, Louisiana, as within relatively easy driving distance of 45 million Americans, many of whom could not afford long trips to the national parks in the western states. He compared flora and fauna in the Ouachita forest to those of the southern Alleghenies, a division of the Appalachian Mountains.Cobb, p. 282 Cobb continues: > A visitor standing upon one of the many majestic peaks in the area of the > proposed park is thrilled by a panoramic view that cannot be had elsewhere > in the South Central States.

These woodlands, of little commercial value, were never logged and the extent of old growth forest within them may total nearly . There are also old-growth woodlands of Eastern Redcedar, Gum Bumelia, Winged Elm, and Yaupon along some streams. Two wilderness areas are found in the forest, protecting the sections of the forest that have had the least amount of human intervention. The Black Fork Mountain Wilderness is located in both Arkansas and Oklahoma and contains significant old-growth forests. The Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness is located solely in Oklahoma. The Talimena Scenic Drive, which is Highway 1 in Oklahoma and Highway 88 in Arkansas, is a National Scenic Byway which meanders through the forest providing amazing vistas and excellent photo opportunities. The Scenic Drive passes through old-growth oak woodlands on Winding Stair and Rich Mountains. Forest headquarters are located in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Locations of Ouachita Mountains and Ouachita National Forest in the United States =Recreation= The forest contains a number of hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding trails. The most extensive hiking trail is the Ouachita National Recreation Trail, which traverses across the region. This is a well-maintained backpacking, hiking trail with overnight shelters in several portions of the trail. Mountain biking is also allowed for some sections of the trail. Camp Clearfork was originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),it is on Clearfork Lake, about west of Hot Springs, Arkansas on U.S. 270. Reservations are required for camping, and may be made through the Womble USDA Office at (870) 867-2101.\\"Camp Clearfork.\\" USDA Forest Service. Undated Accessed June 17, 2018. The campground has 6 dorm/cabins which can hold up to 10 people each; 3 staff cabins that hold 5-6 people each, a dining hall, a recreation hall, and accessible flush toilets and showers.\\"Camp Clearfork Group Camp.\\" Explore the Ozarks. Accessed June 17, 2018. In the Oklahoma section of the forest the Winding Stair Mountain National Recreation Area and six other designated areas offer visitors a full range of activities with more than 150 campsites, a lake, and an equestrian camp. Southeast of Idabel, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation manages the Red Slough Wildlife Management Area, a wetland area donated to the USFS by The Conservation Fund in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Hunting (no lead shot) and fishing are allowed there. The area is also a destination for birdwatchers from throughout the United States and the United Kingdom as well. Canoeing and fishing are popular activities on the Mountain Fork River, Caddo River, Little Missouri River, and Ouachita River within the bounds of the forest. The Cossatot River, said to be the most difficult whitewater river between the Smoky and Rocky Mountains, also passes through the forest. Rockhounds frequent a belt several miles wide containing concentrations of quartz crystals. Visitors and rock collectors are free to pick up loose crystals within the belt for personal use and may dig for quartz with the permission of the district ranger. Counties Ouachita National Forest is located in 13 counties in western and central Arkansas and 2 counties in southeastern Oklahoma. They are listed here in descending order of forestland within the county. Also given is their area as of September 30, 2007. About 80% of the forest's area is in Arkansas, with the remaining 20% in Oklahoma. In Arkansas there are local ranger district offices located in Booneville, Danville, Glenwood, Jessieville, Mena, Mount Ida, Oden, Perryville, and Waldron. In Oklahoma they are located in Hodgen, Talihina, and north of Broken Bow. Even though the Ouachita National Forest is far from being the largest, its twelve ranger districts are the most of any in the National Forest system.

C. Forbes, a financial columnist for the Hearst papers, and his partner Walter Drey, the general manager of the Magazine of Wall Street, founded Forbes magazine on September 15, 1917.Gorman, Robert F.

Forbes became editor-in-chief, a post he held until his death in 1954. B.C. Forbes was assisted in his later years by his two eldest sons, Bruce Charles Forbes (1916‚Äì1964) and Malcolm Forbes (1917‚Äì1990). Bruce Forbes took over on his father's death, and his strengths lay in streamlining operations and developing marketing. During his tenure, 1954‚Äì1964, the magazine's circulation nearly doubled. On Bruce's death, his brother Malcolm Forbes became president and chief executive of Forbes and editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine.'Forbes Announce Elevation Partners Investment in Family Held Company' Elevation Partners press release, August 6, 2006. Between 1961 and 1999 the magazine was edited by James Michaels. In 1993, under Michaels, Forbes was a finalist for the National Magazine Award. In 2006, an investment group Elevation Partners that includes rock star Bono bought a minority interest in the company with a reorganization, through a new company, Forbes Media LLC, in which Forbes Magazine and Forbes.com, along with other media properties, is now a part. A 2009 New York Times report said: \\"40 percent of the enterprise was sold ... for a reported $300 million, setting the value of the enterprise at $750 million.\\" Three years later, Mark M. Edmiston of AdMedia Partners observed, \\"It's probably not worth half of that now.\\"\\"Even Forbes is Pinching Pennies\\" by David Carr, The New York Times, June 14, 2009 (June 15, 2009 on p.

The company's headquarters moved to the Newport section of downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, in 2014. =Sale to Integrated Whale Media (51% stake)= In November 2013, Forbes Media, which publishes Forbes magazine, was put up for sale. This was encouraged by minority shareholders Elevation Partners. Sale documents prepared by Deutsche Bank revealed that the publisher's 2012 EBITDA was US$15 million. Forbes reportedly sought a price of US$400 million. In July 2014, the Forbes family bought out Elevation and then sold a 51 percent majority of the company to Hong Kong-based investment group Integrated Whale Media Investments.

Other company groups include Forbes Conference Group, Forbes Investment Advisory Group and Forbes Custom Media. From the 2009 Times report: \\"Steve Forbes recently returned from opening up a Forbes magazine in India, bringing the number of foreign editions to 10.\\" In addition, that year the company began publishing ForbesWoman, a quarterly magazine published by Steve Forbes's daughter, Moira Forbes, with a companion Web site. The company formerly published American Legacy magazine as a joint venture, although that magazine separated from Forbes on May 14, 2007. The company also formerly published American Heritage and Invention & Technology magazines. After failing to find a buyer, Forbes suspended publication of these two magazines as of May 17, 2007. Both magazines were purchased by the American Heritage Publishing Company and resumed publication as of the spring of 2008. Forbes has published the Forbes Travel Guide since 2009. In 2013, Forbes licensed its brand to Ashford University, and assisted them launch the Forbes School of Business & Technology. Forbes Media CEO Mike Federle justified the licensing in 2018, stating that \\"Our licensing business is almost a pure-profit business, because it's an annual annuity.\\" Forbes would launch limited promotions for the school in limited issues. Forbes would never formally endorse the school. On January 6, 2014, Forbes magazine announced that, in partnership with app creator Maz, it was launching a social networking app called \\"Stream\\". Stream allows Forbes readers to save and share visual content with other readers and discover content from Forbes magazine and Forbes.com within the app. Forbes.com Forbes.com is part of Forbes Digital, a division of Forbes Media LLC. Forbes's holdings include a portion of RealClearPolitics. Together these sites reach more than 27 million unique visitors each month. Forbes.com employs the slogan \\"Home Page for the World's Business Leaders\\" and claimed, in 2006, to be the world's most widely visited business web site. The 2009 Times report said that, while \\"one of the top five financial sites by traffic [throwing] off an estimated $70 million to $80 million a year in revenue, [it] never yielded the hoped-for public offering\\". Forbes.com uses a \\"contributor model\\" in which a wide network of \\"contributors\\" writes and publishes articles directly on the website. Contributors are paid based on traffic to their respective Forbes.com pages; the site has received contributions from over 2,500 individuals, and some contributors have earned over US$100,000, according to the company. Forbes currently allows advertisers to publish blog posts on its website alongside regular editorial content through a program called BrandVoice, which accounts for more than 10 percent of its digital revenue. Forbes.com also publishes subscription investment newsletters, and an online guide to web sites, Best of the Web. In July 2018 Forbes deleted an article by a contributor who argued that libraries should be closed, and Amazon should open bookstores in their place. David Churbuck founded Forbess web site in 1996. The site uncovered Stephen Glass's journalistic fraud in The New Republic in 1998, an article that drew attention to internet journalism. At the peak of media coverage of alleged Toyota sudden unintended acceleration in 2010, it exposed the California \\"runaway Prius\\" as a hoax, as well as running five other articles by Michael Fumento challenging the entire media premise of Toyota's cars gone bad. The site, like the magazine, publishes many lists focusing on billionaires and their possessions, especially expensive homes, a critical aspect of the website's popularity. Currently, the website also blocks internet users using ad blocking software (such as Adblock Plus) from accessing articles, demanding that the website be put on the ad blocking software's whitelist before access is granted. Forbes argues that this is done because customers using ad blocking software do not contribute to the site's revenue. Malware attacks have been noted to occur from Forbes site. Forbes won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Business Blog/Website in the category Web.

It was sponsored by American Tobacco's Lucky Strike cigarettes. During this 24-year run, the show had 19 orchestra leaders and 52 singers or groups. Many listeners and viewers casually referred to the show with the incorrect title The Hit Parade. When the show debuted, there was no agreement as to what it should be called. The press referred to it in a variety of ways, with the most common being \\"Hit Parade,\\" \\"The Hit Parade,\\" and even \\"The Lucky Strike Hit Parade\\".see for example \\"Lucky Strike Hit Parade is Popular,\\" Laredo (Texas) Times, May 21, 1935, p. 7 The program's title was not officially changed to \\"Your Hit Parade\\" until November 9, 1935.\\"Al Goodman to Be Maestro on Radio Series,\\" Oakland Tribune, November 9, 1935, p. 14. Every Saturday evening, the program offered the most popular and bestselling songs of the week. The earliest format involved a presentation of the top 15 songs. Later, a countdown with fanfares led to the top three finalists, with the number one song for the finale. Occasional performances of standards and other favorite songs from the past were known as \\"Lucky Strike Extras.\\" Listeners were informed that the \\"Your Hit Parade survey checks the best sellers on sheet music and phonograph records, the songs most heard on the air and most played on the automatic coin machines, an accurate, authentic tabulation of America's taste in popular music.\\" However, the exact procedure of this \\"authentic tabulation\\" remained a secret. Some believe song choices were often arbitrary due to various performance and production factors. The show's ad agencies‚Äîinitially Lord and Thomas and later Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne--never revealed the specific sources or the methods that were used to determine top hits. They made a general statement that it was based mainly on \\"readings of radio requests, sheet music sales, dance-hall favorites and jukebox tabulations\\"; Radio Guide claimed \\"an endless popularity poll on a nationwide scale.\\" Radio =Lucky Strike's first radio endeavors= The origins of the format can be traced back to the Lucky Strike Saturday Night Dance Party sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes.Fred W. Edmiston, The Coon- Sanders Nighthawks: the band that made radio famous. McFarland, 2003, p.276. Chicago booking agency \\"Jules Stein's Music Corporation of America was the exclusive supplier of the bands for The Lucky Strike Dance Hour \\" Led by Benjamin A. Rolfe the show was heard on the NBC Red network Saturdays between 10 and 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time beginning in September 1928. The program was devised by American Tobacco's George W. Hill an attempt to popularize the consumption of tobacco products, which were increasingly used by young people and women. For the latter demographic group, the company also launched the slogan \\"Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet\\" at the same time. In a cross- promotion, Rolfe made recordings for Edison Records credited as \\"B.A. Rolfe and his Lucky Strike Orchestra\\". Beginning in April 1930, the show became known as The Lucky Strike Dance Hour, as a second hour-long show began airing Wednesday nights on the NBC Blue network (9.30 to 10.30 p.m.). During the fall, the Wednesday show was replaced by Tuesday and Thursday night broadcasts, also on NBC Red.[ AMG, B.A. Rolfe Biography]mit.edu, The Tech, November 9, 1931, p.3. (advert)Hagley Lib (partial NBC script)B.A. Rolfe & His Lucky Strike Dance Orchestra During its first three years, the show featured Rolfe's band play popular songs and novelty tunes interspersed with plugs for Lucky Strikes by the announcer, whose other role was introducing each number. During the fall of 1931, the program was revamped as The Lucky Strike Magic Carpet Show, a variety show hosted by Walter O'Keefe featuring the orchestras of Rolfe, Anson Weeks, Jack Denny, George Olsen, Abe Lyman, Phil Harris and others supplied exclusively by Jules Stein's Music Corporation of America, and the bands were picked up from diverse points across the U.S. instead of originating entirely from New York, which was a novelty at the time. The \\"variety\\" segments included dramatizations of cases from the New York Police Department, society gossip by Walter Winchell (then a gossip columnist for Hearst's tabloid New York Daily Mirror, featuring a style different from the one is more remembered for), and comedy by Bert LahrThe Lucky Strike Dance Hour and Jack Pearl. During the spring and summer of 1933, the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts were phased out and the show reverted to the original Lucky Strike Saturday Night Dance Party format with Rolfe's orchestra and the Men About Town trio, running until early 1934. =Your Hit Parade on radio (1935-1953)= The Frank Sinatra Your Hit Parade cardboard fan, designed like a tobacco leaf, is a rare collectible. Your Hit Parade began on NBC April 20, 1935, as a 60-minute program with 15 songs played in a random format before presenting the number 1 song. Initially, the songs were more important than the singers, so a stable of vocalists went uncredited and were paid only $100 per episode, equal to $ today. In 1936‚Äì37, it was carried on both NBC and CBS. Script continuity in the late 1930s and early 1940s was written by Alan Jay Lerner before he found fame as a lyricist. The first number one song on the first episode was \\"Soon\\" by Bing Crosby. (Bruce C. Byrd, Your Hit Parade & American Top Ten Hits, 4th edition, 1994, p 15.) Some years passed before the countdown format was introduced, with the number of songs varying from seven to 15. Vocalists in the 1930s included Buddy Clark, Lanny Ross, Kay Thompson and Bea Wain (1939‚Äì1944), who was married to the show's announcer, French-born Andr√© Baruch. Frank Sinatra joined the show in 1943, which gave the show even more popularity. By 1944 however, Sinatra's move to Hollywood led to a conflict with American Tobacco as it determined that the singer was the one to pay the production costs (including the telephone hook-up to New York) and was fired for messing up the No. 1 song, \\"Don't Fence Me In\\" by interjecting a mumble to the effect that the song had too many words and missing a cue. An AFRS transcription survives of this show. As he zoomed in popularity he was rehired, returning (1947‚Äì1949) to co-star with Doris Day. Helen O'Connell, making a guest appearance on the radio show Your Hit Parade, early 1950s. Hugely popular on CBS through the WWII years, Your Hit Parade returned to NBC in 1947. The show's opening theme, from the musical revue George White's Scandals of 1926, was \\"This Is Your Lucky Day\\", with music by Ray Henderson and lyrics by Buddy G. DeSylva, Stephen W. Ballantine and Lew Brown. Orchestra leaders over the years included Al Goodman, Lennie Hayton, Abe Lyman, Leo Reisman, Harry Salter, Ray Sinatra, Harry Sosnik, Axel Stordahl, Peter Van Steeden, Mark Warnow and Raymond Scott (1949‚Äì1957). The chorus was led by musical director Lyn Murray. Dozens of singers appeared on the radio program, including \\"Wee\\" Bonnie Baker, Dorothy Collins, Beryl Davis, Gogo DeLys, Joan Edwards (1941‚Äì1946), Georgia Gibbs, Dick Haymes, Snooky Lanson, Gis√®le MacKenzie, Johnny Mercer, Andy Russell, Dinah Shore, Ginny Simms, Lawrence Tibbett, Martha Tilton, Eileen Wilson, Barry Wood, and occasional guest vocalists. The show featured two tobacco auctioneers, Lee Aubrey \\"Speed\\" Riggs of Goldsboro, North Carolina and F.E. Boone of Lexington, Kentucky. From the summer of 1950 to the start of summer of 1951 (the first year of the Hit Parade television show), the stars of the TV show‚ÄîEileen Wilson, Snooky Lanson, and Dorothy Collins‚Äîalso starred on the Hit Parade radio show. (Wilson had sung on the radio show since 1948.) Beginning in the fall of 1950, the radio show and the TV show both aired on Saturdays; the radio program was heard from 9:00-9:30 p.m., Eastern time, and the TV show was seen from 10:30-11:00 p.m., Eastern time. Both shows featured the Lucky Strike Orchestra, led by Raymond Scott. In the fall of 1951, the radio show moved to Thursday nights, and its personnel and format were changed. The show, still sponsored by Lucky Strike, now starred Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. Vocalists from Lombardo's orchestra sang on the new version of the radio show, which also featured a guest female vocalist each week; the guest vocalist was called the \\"Lucky Star of the Week.\\" Guy Lombardo was host of the show until January 16, 1953, when the Hit Parade radio program aired for the last time. Spin-off series The success of the radio show spawned a spin-off series, Your All-Time Hit Parade, sponsored by Lucky Strike and devoted to all-time favorites and standards mixed with some current hits. The program began on NBC February 12, 1943, airing Fridays at 8:30pm until June 2, 1944, and then Sundays at 7pm as a summer replacement for Jack Benny, continuing until September 24, 1944. The regular vocalists were Marie Green, Ethel Smith, Martha Stewart, Bea Wain and Jerry Wayne. Lyn Murray led the chorus, and the orchestra was conducted by Mark Warnow. On December 6, 1948, Lucky Strike introduced yet another musical series, the daytime Your Lucky Strike, aka The Don Ameche Show, since the host was Don Ameche. This 30-minute show, airing weekdays at 3:30pm(et) on CBS, was a talent competition with little-known and unknown professional vocalists, backed by Al De Crescent on organ or Bill Wardell on piano. The performers were judged by a trio of random housewives casting votes via long-distance phone calls. Winners were booked into the Mocambo, Earl Carroll's or other night clubs. Produced by Bernard Schubert and directed by Harlan Dunning, this show also featured auctioneer Riggs. It went off the air March 4, 1949. During the early 1980s, Andr√© Baruch and Bea Wain hosted a syndicated radio version of Your Hit Parade, reconstructing the list of hits of selected weeks in the 1940s and playing the original recordings. =Your Hit Parade on television (1950-1959)= Andr√© Baruch continued as the announcer when the program arrived on NBC television in summer 1950 (Del Sharbutt succeeded him in the 1957‚Äì58 season), written by William H. Nichols, and produced, in its first years, by both Dan Lounsbery and Ted Fetter. Norman Jewison and Clark Jones (nominated for a 1955 Emmy Award) directed with associate director Bill Colleran. Tony Charmoli won a 1956 Emmy for his choreography, and the show's other dance directors were Tom Hansen (1957‚Äì58), Peter Gennaro (1958‚Äì59) and Ernie Flatt (uncredited). Paul Barnes won an Emmy in 1957 for his art direction. In 1953, the show won a Peabody Award \\"for consistent good taste, technical perfection and unerring choice of performers.\\" The seven top-rated songs of the week were presented in elaborate TV production numbers requiring constant set and costume changes. However, because the top songs sometimes stayed on the charts for many weeks, it was necessary to continually find ways of devising a new and different production number of the same song week after week. After the show was revamped in September 1957, the top songs were reduced to five, while \\"extras\\" were increased. On the TV series, vocalists Dorothy Collins (1950‚Äì1957, 1958‚Äì59), Russell Arms (1952‚Äì1957), Snooky Lanson (1950‚Äì1957) and Gis√®le MacKenzie (1953‚Äì1957) were top-billed during the show's peak years. During this time, MacKenzie had her own hit record in 1955 with \\"Hard to Get\\" which climbed to the #5 ranking in June 1955 and stayed on the charts for 16 weeks. She also starred in her own NBC variety program, The Gisele MacKenzie Show from 1957 to 1958, a series produced by her mentor, Jack Benny. Russell Arms also enjoyed a hit record during his stint on the show - \\"Cinco Robles (Five Oaks)\\" (# 22 / 1957) The line-up of the show's other singers included Eileen Wilson (1950‚Äì1952), Sue Bennett (1951‚Äì52), June Valli (1952‚Äì53), Alan Copeland (1957‚Äì58), Jill Corey (1957‚Äì58), Johnny Desmond (1958‚Äì59), Virginia Gibson (1957‚Äì58), and Tommy Leonetti (1957‚Äì58). All were performers of standards, show tunes or big band numbers. Featured prominently were the Hit Parade dancers and the Hit Paraders, the program's choral singers. The vocal arranger and choral director of the Hit Parade was Ray Charles (1950‚Äì57).Andrew Lee Fielding, The Lucky Strike Papers p.161 He started with the pilot shows in 1949 but did not receive billing until 1955 because he was simultaneously working with a choir on a show with a competitive sponsor Chesterfield cigarettes. The Hit Paraders sang the opening commercial jingle (composed by Raymond Scott): :Be happy, go Lucky, :Be happy, go Lucky Strike :Be happy, go Lucky, :Go Lucky Strike today!

From 1950 until 1957, the orchestra was led by well-known bandleader and musician Raymond Scott (who married Dorothy Collins in 1952); the show's other music supervisors were Dick Jacobs (1957‚Äì58) and Harry Sosnik (1958‚Äì59). During the 1957‚Äì58 season, sponsor American Tobacco pitched Hit Parade filter cigarettes instead of Lucky Strikes. Alternate sponsors included Avco Manufacturing's Crosley division (1951‚Äì54), Richard Hudnut hair care products (1954‚Äì57), and The Toni Company (1957‚Äì58). Your Hit Parade finished in the Nielsen ratings at #29 in the 1950‚Äì1951 season, #30 in 1953‚Äì1954, #15 in 1954-1955 and #23 in 1955‚Äì1956.http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm The show faded with the rise of rock and roll when the performance became more important than the song. It is said that big band singer Snooky Lanson's weekly attempts to perform Elvis Presley's \\"Hound Dog\\" hit in 1956 hastened the end of the series. In the fall of 1957, the show was revamped: production was moved to Hollywood with a new cast and was now broadcast in color, being the first TV show be introduced by the animated version of the \\"Living Color\\" peacock (introduced one year earlier and nowadays the logo of NBC). But low ratings caused the show to revert to New York and black-and-white in 1958, switching to CBS before being cancelled the following year. While Your Hit Parade was unable to deal with the rock revolution, the show's imaginative production concepts had an obvious influence on the wave of music videos that began in the decade that followed. CBS also brought it back for a brief summer revival in 1974 and 1975. That version featured Kelly Garrett, Sheralee and Chuck Woolery. The 1974 version of Your Hit Parade also featured hit songs from a designated week in the 1940s or 1950s. Milton DeLugg conducted the orchestra and Chuck Barris packaged this series. The show's familiar closing theme was \\"So Long for A While\\": :So long for a while. :That's all the songs for a while. :So long to Your Hit Parade, :And the tunes that you picked to be played. :So long!

It is the first of the IITs to be established and is recognised as an Institute of National Importance. In 2019 it was awarded the status of Institute of Eminence by the government of India. The institute was initially established to train scientists and engineers after India attained independence in 1947. However, over the years, the institute's academic capabilities diversified with offerings in management, law, architecture, humanities, etc. IIT Kharagpur has an campus and has about 22,000 residents.  History  = Foundation = In 1946, a committee by Sir Jogendra Singh, Member of Viceroy's executive council, to consider the creation of higher technical institutions \\"for post-World War II industrial development of India\\". This was followed by the creation of a 22-member committee headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. In its interim report, the Sarkar Committee recommended the establishment of higher technical institutions in India, along the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulting from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign along with affiliated secondary institutions. The report urged that work should start with the speedy establishment of major institutions in the four-quarters of the country with the ones in the east and the west to be set up immediately. On the grounds that West Bengal had the highest concentration of industries at the time, Bidhan Chandra Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, persuaded Jawaharlal Nehru (India's first prime minister) to establish the first institute in West Bengal. The first Indian Institute of Technology was thus established in May 1950 as the Eastern Higher Technical Institute. It was located in Esplanade East, Calcutta, and in September 1950 shifted to its permanent campus at Hijli, Kharagpur 120 kilometres south-west of Kolkata (formerly called Calcutta). Hijli had been used as a detention camp during the British colonial rule in India, to keep Indian freedom fighters captive. IIT Kharagpur is the 4th oldest technical institute in the West Bengal state after Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology Shibpur (established as B.E. College in 1856), Jadavpur University (established as Bengal technical institute in 1906) and Rajabazar Science College (established as Calcutta University campus for Science and Technology in 1914). When the first session started in August 1951, there were 224 students and 42 teachers in the ten departments of the institute. The classrooms, laboratories and the administrative office were housed in the historic building of the Hijli Detention Camp (now known as Shaheed Bhawan), where political revolutionaries were imprisoned during the British rule. The office building had served as the headquarters of the Bomber Command of the U.S. 20th Air Force during World War II. IIT Kharagpur main building = Early developments = The Hijli Detention Camp (photographed in 1951) served as IIT Kharagpur's first academic buildingThe name \\"Indian Institute of Technology\\" was adopted before the formal inauguration of the institute on 18 August 1951 by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. On 18 May 1956 a Bill (Bill no 36 of 1956)The Gazette of India No 27, 18 May 1956 p 408 was introduced in Lok Sabha to declare the institution known as the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur to be an institution of national importance and to provide for its incorporation and matters connected therewith. The motto of the institute, ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§É ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡•Å ‡§ï‡•å‡§∂‡§≤‡§Æ‡•ç is taken from the Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 50 and it has been translated by Sri Aurobindo as \\"Yoga is skill in works\\". On 15 September 1956, Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act, 195 of Parliament received the assent of the President.The Gazette of India No 55, p908 Prime Minister Nehru, in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur said: The main building of the institute during construction (1955)The Shaheed Bhawan was converted to a museum in 1990. Nalanda Complex, 2018 The Srinivasa Ramanujan Complex was incorporated as another academic complex of the institute with Takshashila starting operation in 2002, Vikramshila in 2003 and Nalanda in 2012. Earlier the Hijli Detention camp building, now named as Hijli Saheed Bhavan, where the Nehru Museum of Science & Technology is located is an imposing building, bearing resemblance to the Byzantine style of architecture. Nehru Museum  Administration  IIT Kharagpur shares a common Visitor (a position held by the President of India) and the IIT Council with other IITs. The rest of IIT Kharagpur's organisational structure is distinct from that of the other IITs. The Board of Governors of IIT Kharagpur is under the IIT Council, and has 13 members that include representatives of the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, in addition to other members appointed by the IIT Council and the institute's senate. Under the Board of Governors is the institute director, who serves as the chief academic and executive officer of the IIT. He is aided by the Deputy Director. Under the director and the deputy director are the deans, heads of departments, registrar, president of the students' council, and chairman of the Hall Management Committee. The registrar is the chief administrative officer and oversees day-to-day operations. He is the custodian of records, funds, and other properties of the institute. Under the charge of the heads of departments (HOD) are the faculty (full-time professors as well as those of associate and assistant status). The wardens of hostels are placed under the chairman of the hall management committee in the organisation. IIT Kharagpur receives comparatively more funding than other engineering colleges in India. While the total government funding to most other engineering colleges is around 100‚Äì200 million ($2‚Äì4.5 million) per year, IIT Kharagpur gets nearly per year. Other sources of funds include student fees and research funding by industry-sponsored projects. IIT Kharagpur provide scholarships to all MTech students and research scholars to encourage them to pursue higher studies. The cost borne by undergraduate students, including boarding and mess expenses, is around per annum. 35% of undergraduate students are given additional financial support based on personal need and economic background, with their annual expenses being nearly . The academic policies of IIT Kharagpur are decided by its senate. It consists of all professors of the institute, and administrative and student representatives. The senate controls and approves the curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the institute are periodically reviewed by the senate to maintain educational standards. The Director of IIT Kharagpur is the ex officio chairman of the Institute Senate. IIT Kharagpur follows the credit- based system of performance evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. For each semester, the students are graded by taking a weighted average from all the courses with their respective credit points. Each semester's evaluation is done independently with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) reflecting the average performance across semesters. Gymkhana Lake  Campus  IIT Kharagpur is located west of Kolkata. The campus is located five kilometres away from Kharagpur Railway Station in West Midnapore district. The layout of the present campus and the design of the buildings were carried out by a group of engineers and architects under the guidance of Werner M. Moser, a Swiss architect. The campus is residence to about 22,000 inhabitants. In 2015, IIT Kharagpur had about 605 faculty members, 1,933 employees and approximately 10,010 students living on the campus. The campus has a total of of roadways. The Institute plans to go Green by 2020. The 22 student hostels are located on either side of Scholars Avenue, which extends from the institute gate to the B. C. Roy Technology Hospital. The three earliest halls‚ÄîPatel, Azad, and Nehru‚Äîtogether constitute the PAN loop or Old Campus, which is located just next to Scholar's Avenue. There are ten hostels for undergraduate male students (MMM, LBS, RP, RK, MS, LLR, HJB, Patel, Azad and Nehru) and two for undergraduate female students (SN/IG and MT). There are a few post-graduate students' hostels including four for women(RLB, Gokhle, Nivedita and SAM) and hostels for research scholars (BCR, VS, BRH and JCB) and a separate hostel for scholars from the armed forces. The Jnan Ghosh stadium and Tata Sports Complex host large-scale sports competitions. The Tagore Open Air Theatre has a capacity of 6,000 people, and is used to host cultural programs. The Science and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park (STEP) provides infrastructure facilities to alumni who want to become entrepreneurs but lack infrastructure to start their own corporation. In addition to the main campus at Kharagpur, the institute has an extension centre at Kolkata to provide venues for continuing education programmes, distance learning courses, and guesthouse accommodation. The institute plans to expand the Kolkata extension centre at Rajarhat, and use it to offer full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses from the 2008 session onwards. The Rajarhat campus will house 2,500 students, and will eventually expand to . The institute's plan for a similar branch campus of in Bhubaneswar was scrapped following rejection by the Union Human Resource and Development ministry. The Ministry of human resource development on 5 September 2019 awarded Institute of Eminence(IoE) status to IIT Kharagpur along with four public institution in India, which will enable to get full autonomy and special incentives. Vikramshila, 2018 Takshashila, 2018 = Academic buildings = IIT Kharagpur has 19 academic departments, eight multi- disciplinary centres/schools, and 13 schools of excellence in addition to more than 25 central research and development units. Apart from the main building in the central academic complex, the Srinivasa Ramanujan Complex also has common academic facilities. In the S. R. Complex, the Takshashila building houses the G. S. Sanyal School of Telecommunication, the School of Information Technology and the Computer and Informatics Centre; and has facilities for conducting lecture classes as well. Vikramshila is another academic building in the S. R. Complex, having four lecture halls, several seminar rooms, and Kalidas Auditorium, which has a seating capacity of 850. The School of Medical Science and Technology is housed in the basement of the Vikramshila building. The institute main building houses most of the administrative offices, the lecture halls, and two auditoriums on either side. The signage at the front displays the message,\\" Dedicated to the service of the nation.\\" The tower of the main building has a steel tank with 10,000 imperial gallons of water capacity for emergency supply needs. The Netaji Auditorium in the main building is used for official functions and events, and doubles as a cinema theatre on weekend nights, showing films to the IIT community at subsidised rates. IIT Kharagpur's first library was located in a small room of the institute's Old Building (Shaheed Bhawan). At the time of its opening in 1951, the library had a collection of 2,500 books. Now located in the main building of the institute, the Central Library is one of the largest of its type. Its collection includes over 350,000 books and documents, and it subscribes to more than 1,600 printed and online journals and conference proceedings. The library has six halls and a section exclusively for SC and ST students. The library's collection consists of books, reports, conference proceedings, back volumes of periodicals, standards, theses, micro-forms, DVDs, CD-ROMs, and audio-visual material. The library's transaction service is automated and online searches are possible through an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). The Electronic Library section has a collection of databases, video lectures and miscellaneous other resources. The Nehru Museum of Science and Technology has over a hundred indoor exhibits that include technical models collected from institutions across India. The park outside the museum contains 14 open- air demonstrations and outdoor exhibits, including a hunter plane and a steam engine. The museum has an archive room, showing documents relating to the history of the institute and West Midnapore district. The Rural Museum, located in the Rural Development Centre of the institute, has a collection of exhibits in local culture. = Civic amenities = The institute campus has six guest houses, a civic hospital, four nationalised banks, four schools(Hijli High School;Kendra Vidyalaya;D.A.V Model School;St. Agnes Branch School), a railway reservation counter and a police station. The campus has a water pumping station, electrical sub-station, telephone exchange, a market, six restaurants, and a garbage disposal section for the daily needs of the residents. Construction is going on for another guest house and a convention centre having a capacity of 2,000. The institute draws its supply of water from wells near the Kosai river (located 112 kilometres away from institute) by harnessing sub-surface water. Three deep wells near the institute supplement the supply from the river. The water is supplied by a pipeline to 12 tanks in the campus with a total capacity of 2,800,000 litres (615,000 imperial gallons). However students have recently shown dissatisfaction with the current level of amenities, especially the civic hospital, forcing the director to resign. IIT Kharagpur is located just outside the town of Kharagpur, in the Hijli village. The civic amenities provided to the campus of IIT Kharagpur make it nearly self-sufficient with regards to the basic needs of the residents. As Kharagpur is a small town, there is limited direct interaction between the campus community and the town. There is also little opportunity for the employment of family members of the faculty. Unlike some other IITs (such as IIT Bombay), IIT Kharagpur does not restrict outsiders' entry into the campus. IIT Kharagpur provides much of its benefits to the local community through the Rural Development Centre (RDC) located in the campus. Established in 1975, the RDC helps the local community by developing customised technologies. The RDC also co-ordinates the National Service Scheme (NSS) programs in IIT Kharagpur, with the members of NSS taking part in weekly community service activities such as sanitation, road construction, teaching and building educational models. In 2005, IIT Kharagpur started construction of a boundary wall for the security of the campus, which is now complete . Mild restrictions apply to entry of outside vehicles. The boundary wall was opposed by the local community as it would hinder their access to amenities provided by the institute. Campus residents have also been denied direct access to the adjoining Hijli railway station as a result of this wall. The local community opposed the construction of a flyover from the railway station to the campus formerly, under the pretext that it would lead to substantial losses of opportunity for the shops along the roads. After the flyover construction had been completed and became operational, things ensued in a manner as the local community had anticipated, but the flyover has resulted in more convenience for transport. The construction of the 1052.69 m long flyover was approved by the Indian Railways and West Bengal state government. It's called Hijli Road overbridge, and was constructed for estimated cost of .  Academics  Admission to most undergraduate and postgraduate courses in IIT Kharagpur is granted through written entrance examinations. Admissions to M.S.(by Research) and PhD programmes are based on written tests followed by personal interviews. Admission to undergraduate programmes in all IITs was tied to the Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination (IIT- JEE). Candidates who qualify for admission through IIT-JEE used to apply for admission in four-year BTech (Bachelor of Technology), five-year BArch degree, five-year Dual Degree (Integrated Bachelor of Technology and Master of Technology) and five-year integrated MSc (Master of Sciences) courses at IIT Kharagpur. Starting from 2013, admission was done on the basis of two exams; JEE Mains and JEE Advance. Students who qualified for JEE Mains got the opportunity to appear for JEE Advance and scores of this exams are considered for the admission into IITs. The admissions to postgraduate programmes (MTech) are made primarily through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Other postgraduate entrance exams include Joint Admission to MSc (JAM) for MSc, and Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by IIMs for management studies. 15% of the seats are reserved for students belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes (ST). As of 2008, 27% separate reservation exists for the Other Backward Classes. IIT Kharagpur is a member of LAOTSE, a network of universities in Europe and Asia exchanging students and senior scholars. = Undergraduate education = A lecture auditorium in the Vikramshila complex IIT Kharagpur offers degrees as part of its undergraduate programmes. They include Bachelor of Technology (BTech.Hons), Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) and the 5-year integrated Master of Science. The BTech degree is the most common undergraduate degree in IIT Kharagpur in terms of student enrolment. It is based on a four-year programme with eight semesters. The first year of the BTech curriculum has common courses from various departments. At the end of the first year, an option to change departments is given to students on the basis of their performance in the first two semesters. Unlike other IITs which evaluate their students on the basis of others' performance which does not foster shared learning and communication, IIT Kharagpur uses absolute scores. From the second year onwards, the students take courses offered by their departments that are known as depth courses. In addition to these, the students take inter-disciplinary courses known as breadth courses. Separate courses from the humanities and social sciences (HSS) department, and management and information technology are also required. At the end of the third year, the BTech and dual degree students undertake industrial training for a minimum period of eight working weeks as part of the undergraduate curriculum. In the final year of their studies, most of the students are offered jobs in industries and other organisations through the Training and Placement section of the institute commonly known as Career Development Centre or CDC. Some students opt out of this facility in favour of higher studies or by applying to recruiting organisations directly. In addition to the major degree as part of the undergraduate education, students can take courses from other departments, and by demonstrating knowledge of a discipline based on objectives set by the department, earn a minor in that department. To stay up-to-date with the latest academic and industry standards, IIT Kharagpur revamps its academic curriculum periodically. In August 2017, an Undergraduate Council(UG Council) was constituted by the institute under the Dean of Undergraduate Studies(Dean UGS) as its Chairman and with one student representative from each department to be elected/nominated for an annual term, to assist in the process of curriculum update, assimilate student feedback on different academic policies, and forward suggestions and proposals to the institute senate. = Postgraduate and doctoral education = Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law offers law programmes in Intellectual Property IIT Kharagpur offers postgraduate programmes including Master of Technology (MTech), Master of Business Administration (MBA), and Master of Sciences (MSc). Some specialised post graduate programmes offered by IIT Kharagpur include Master of Human Resource Management (MHRM), Postgraduate Diploma in Information Technology (PGDIT), Master in Medical Science and Technology (MMST), Master of City Planning (MCP), LL.B in Intellectual Property Law (LL.B Honors in IP Law), and Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Operation and Management (PGDMOM). The institute offers the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) as part of its doctoral education programme. The doctoral scholars are given a topic by the professor, or work on the consultancy projects sponsored by industry. The duration of the programme is usually unspecified and depends on the discipline. PhD scholars submit a dissertation as well as conduct an oral defence of their thesis. Teaching assistantships (TA) and research assistantships (RA) are provided based on the scholar's academic profile. IIT Kharagpur offers an M.S. (by research) programme; the MTech and M.S. being similar to the US universities' non-thesis (course-based) and thesis (research-based) master programmes respectively. Vinod Gupta School of Management, the first school of management within the IIT system. IIT Kharagpur (along with other IITs) offers Dual Degree programs that integrate undergraduate and postgraduate studies in selected pairs of branches and specialisations. Most of the Dual Degree programs involve specialisation in the major field of education of the student. For a dual degree involving an MBA from Vinod Gupta School of Management, the selection is made on the basis of an aptitude test of students across all engineering streams. The Dual Degree program spans five years as against six years in conventional BTech (four years) followed by an MTech or MBA (two years). IIT Kharagpur has a management school (Vinod Gupta School of Management), an entrepreneurship school (Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship) and a law school (Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law) on its premises. The Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law has been opened in collaboration with George Washington University.

Student life and culture  =Halls of residence= Madan Mohan Malviya Hall accommodates both undergraduates and post-graduates Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence IIT Kharagpur provides on-campus residential facilities to its students, research scholars, faculty members and many of its staff. The students live in hostels (referred to as halls) throughout their stay in the IIT. Hostel rooms are wired for internet, for which students pay a compulsory charge. Most of the rooms in the older halls of residences are designed to accommodate one student, but due to scarcity of sufficient student accommodation, two students share the single-seater room in first two years. The new rooms of Lal Bahadur Shastri hall & new blocks of few other hall of residence accommodate three students in one room. The halls of IIT Kharagpur are: * Ashutosh Mukherjee Hall * Azad Hall * Bidhan Chandra Roy Hall * B R Ambedkar Hall * Gokhale Hall * Homi Jehangir Bhabha Hall * Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Hall * Lala Lajpat Rai Hall * Lal Bahadur Shashtri Hall * Madan Mohan Malviya Hall * Meghnad Saha Hall * Mother Teresa Hall * Nehru Hall * Patel Hall * Radha Krishnan Hall * Rajendra Prasad Hall * Rani Laxmibai Hall * Sarojini Naidu / Indira Gandhi Hall * Sister Nivedita Hall * Vikram Sarabhai Residential complex * Vikram Sarabhai Residential complex 2 * Vidyasagar Hall * Zakir Hussain Hall Undergraduate students choose between National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) and National Sports Organisation (NSO) for their first two years of study. IIT Kharagpur has common sports grounds for cricket, football, hockey, one court for volleyball, two for lawn tennis, four indoor badminton court, tracks for athletics; and swimming pools for aquatic events. Most of the hostels have their own sports grounds. The institute used to organise Shaurya, an annual inter-collegiate sports and games meet during October which was discontinued in 2012. The students of IIT Kharagpur compete among themselves in various events held under the purview of open-IIT and inter-hall events, and the results of the latter contribute to the points that determine the winner of General Championship. The four categories in which General Championships are decided are Sports, Social and cultural activities, Technology, and Hall affairs. The women's hostel together participate as a single team in all events with the exception of sports, where women's team do not participate at inter-hall level. IIT Kharagpur participates in the Inter IIT Sports Meet, held annually in one of the IITs by policy of rotation.Alankar magazine's logo in 1984 The students choose their representatives by elections held under the control of the Technology Students' Gymkhana. A fortnightly newsletter called The Scholar's Avenue, named after the avenue common to the student halls, is published by an independent student body. A Hindi monthly newsletter, Awaaz, is published by another independent student body. Individual halls organise \\"Hall day\\" ‚Äî an annual event that involves lighting and decoration of the organising hall, with a social gathering of students from all halls‚Äîduring March. The event is also used by the halls to popularise their candidates for student body elections. Students who violate the code of conduct of the institute have to defend themselves in front of the Hall Disciplinary Committee (HDC), which investigates the case and prescribes punishment if necessary. Students may appeal against the punishment to the Appellate-cum-Liaison Committee known as Inter Hall Disciplinary Committee (IHDC). The IHDC submits its recommendations to the Senate, which finalises the punishment. Extreme cases of indiscipline are referred directly to the IHDC. The IHDC is empowered to give punishments to students for acts of indiscretion committed anywhere in India. IIT Kharagpur has strict provisions dealing with physical and mental harassment of junior students (ragging). Students found harassing their juniors are suspended from the institute, without going through the Disciplinary Committee. = Festivals = Bands performing at Spring Fest 2012, IIT Kharagpur.

It was founded by former Unitarian minister George Ripley and his wife Sophia Ripley at the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts (9 miles outside of downtown Boston) in 1841 and was inspired in part by the ideals of transcendentalism, a religious and cultural philosophy based in New England. Founded as a joint stock company, it promised its participants a portion of the profits from the farm in exchange for performing an equal share of the work. Brook Farmers believed that by sharing the workload, ample time would be available for leisure activities and intellectual pursuits. Life on Brook Farm was based on balancing labor and leisure while working together for the benefit of the greater community. Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered. The community was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model based on the socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the community was financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member of Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel The Blithedale Romance (1852). After the community's failure, the property was operated for most of the next 130 years by a Lutheran organization as first an orphanage, and then a treatment center and school. The buildings of the Transcendentalists were destroyed by fire over the years. In 1988 the State of Massachusetts acquired of the farm, which is now operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation as a historic site. Brook Farm was one of the first sites in Massachusetts to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places and be designated a National Historic Site. In 1977, the Boston Landmarks Commission designated Brook Farm a Landmark, the city's highest recognition for historic sites.  History  =Planning and background= George Ripley founded Brook Farm based on Transcendental ideals. In October 1840, George Ripley announced to the Transcendental Club that he was planning to form a Utopian community.Packer, 133 Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment was meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, based on the principles of \\"industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity\\".McFarland, 83 At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s, though it was the first to be secular.Delano, 52 Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society. He predicted: \\"If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star.\\" As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.Marshall, 398 =Beginnings= Ripley and his wife Sophia formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors.Hankins, 34 He sold shares of the company $500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor. Shareholders were also allowed a single vote in decision-making and several held director positions. The Ripleys chose to begin their experiment at a dairy farm owned by Charles and Maria Mayo Ellis in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, near the home of Theodore Parker.Delano, 39 They began raising money, including holding a meeting at Peabody's bookshop to raise $10,000 for the farm's initial purchase.Marshall, 415 The site was eventually purchased on October 11, 1841, for $10,500.Delano, 71 though participants had begun moving in as early as April.Marshall, 407 The farm about eight miles (13 km) from Boston was described in a pamphlet as a \\"place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country\\". The purchase also covered a neighboring Keith farm, approximately , \\"consisting altogether of a farm with dwelling house, barn, and outbuildings thereon situated\\". The first major public notice of the community was published in August 1841. \\"The Community at West Roxbury, Mass.\\" was likely written by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.Delano, 63 Though they began with 10 investors, eventually some 32 people would become Brook Farmers.Rose, 132 Writer and editor Margaret Fuller was invited to Brook FarmGura, 156 and, though she never officially joined the community, she was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there.Blanchard, Paula. Margaret Fuller: From Transcendentalism to Revolution. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1987: 187. Ripley received many applications to join the community, especially from people who had little money or those in poor health, but full-fledged membership was granted only to individuals who could afford the $500 share of the joint stock company.Packer, 155 One of the initial founders of Brook Farm was author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne did not particularly agree with the ideals of the experiment, hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody. She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841, though Hawthorne sent her away.Marshall, 408‚Äì409 Ripley was aware of Hawthorne's motivations, and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees, specifically overseeing \\"Direction of Finance\\". After requesting his initial investment be returned, Hawthorne officially resigned from Brook Farm on October 17, 1842.Delano, 97 He wrote of his displeasure with the community: \\"even my Custom House experience was not such a thraldom and weariness; my mind and heart were freer ...Thank God, my soul is not utterly buried under a dung-heap.\\"Marshall, 417 =Fourier inspiration= Brook Farm was reorganized to follow the work of Charles Fourier. In the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in \\"Associationism\\", an early socialist movement based on the work of Charles Fourier. Horace Greeley, a New York newspaper editor, and others began to pressure the Brook Farm experiment to follow more closely the pattern of Charles FourierHankins, 35 at a time when the community was struggling to be self-sufficient. Albert Brisbane, whose book The Social Destiny of Man (1840) had been an inspiration to Ripley,Felton, 123 paid Greeley $500 for permission to publish a front-page column in the New York Tribune which ran in several parts from March 1842 to September 1843. Brisbane argued in the series, titled \\"Association: or, Principles of a True Organization of Society\\", how Fourier's theories could be applied in the United States. Brisbane published similar articles in 1842 in The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists.Delano, 91 Fourier's societal vision included elaborate plans for specific structures and highly organized roles of its members. He called this system for an ideal community a \\"Phalanx\\".Delano, 90 To meet this vision, now under the name \\"Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education\\", Brook Farmers committed themselves to constructing an ambitious communal building known as the Phalanstery. Construction began in the summer of 1844 and the structure would provide accommodations for 14 families and single people as well. It was planned to be by and include, as Ripley described, \\"a large and commodious kitchen, a dining-hall capable of seating from three to four hundred persons, two public saloons, and a spacious hall or lecture room\\".Delano, 255 Ripley and two associates created a new constitution for Brook Farm in 1844, beginning the experiment's attempts to follow closely Fourier's Phalanx system.Packer, 157 Many Brook Farmers supported the transition; at a dinner in honor of Fourier's birthday, one member of the group proposed a toast to \\"Fourier, the second coming of Christ\\".Packer, 158 Others, however, did not share in the enthusiasm and some left the commune altogether. One of those who left was Isaac Hecker, who converted to Catholicism and went on to become the founder of the first American-based order of priests, the Paulist Fathers, in 1858.Howe, Daniel Walker. What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007: 300‚Äì301. In particular, many Brook Farmers thought the new model was too rigid and structured and too different from the carefree aspects that they had been attracted to.Felton, 127 Both supporters and detractors referred to the early part of Brook Farm's history as the \\"Transcendental days\\". Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.Crowe, 170 November 7, 1846, issue of The Harbinger, printed at Brook Farm In the last few months of 1844, Brook Farmers were offered the possibility of taking over two Associationism- inspired publications, Brisbane's The Phalanx and John Allen's The Social Reformer. Four printers were part of Brook Farm at the time and members of the community believed it would elevate their status as leaders of the movement as well as provide additional income.Delano, 190‚Äì191 Ultimately, the Brook Farmers published a new journal combining the two, The Harbinger. The journal's first issue was published June 14, 1845, and was continuously printed, originally weekly, until October 1847, when it was relocated to New York City, still under the oversight of George Ripley and fellow Brook Farmer Charles Anderson Dana.Delano, 217 Naming the publication, however, turned out to be a difficult task. Parke Godwin offered advice when it was suggested to keep the name The Phalanx: =Decline and dissolution= Brook Farm began to decline rapidly after its restructuring. In October 1844, Orestes Brownson visited the site and sensed that \\"the atmosphere of the place is horrible\\".Delano, 192 To save money, \\"retrenchments\\", or sacrifices, were called for, particularly at the dinner table.Packer, 160 Meat, coffee, tea, and butter were no longer offered, though it was agreed that a separate table with meat be allowed in December 1844. That Thanksgiving, a neighbor had donated a turkey.Packer, 161 Many Brook Farmers applied for exceptions to these rules and soon it was agreed that \\"members of the Association who sit at the meat table shall be charged extra for their board\\".Delano, 193 Life on Brook Farm was further worsened by an outbreak of smallpox in November 1845; though no one died, 26 Brook Farmers were infected. Ripley attempted to quell the financial difficulties by negotiating with creditors and stockholders, who agreed to cancel $7,000 of debts.Crowe, 187 Construction on the Phalanstery was progressing well until the evening of March 3, 1846, when it was discovered that the Phalanstery had caught fire. Within two hours, the structure had completely burned down;Delano, 254 firefighters from Boston arrived too late.Packer, 162 The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney. One participant noted, \\"Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure; running across long corridors and up and down the supporting columns of wood, until the huge edifice was a mass of firework\\".Felton, 128 The financial blow from the loss of the uninsured building was $7,000 and it marked the beginning of the end of Brook Farm. George Ripley, who had begun the experiment, made an unofficial break with Brook Farm in May 1846.Delano, 269 Many others began to leave as well, though the dissolution of the farm was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem \\"dreamy and unreal\\". On November 5, 1846, Ripley's book collection, which had served as Brook Farm's library, was auctioned to help cover the association's debts.Delano, 283 By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445.Rose, 136 Ripley told a friend, \\"I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral\\". He took a job with the New York Tribune and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt, which he did in 1862.Rose, 209 After Brook Farm The Print Shop, constructed in about 1890, is the last remaining historic building at Brook Farm, though it is not associated with the Transcendentalist Utopian community. It was built by the Lutheran Church, which operated the Martin Luther Orphan's Home on the property from 1871 to 1944. A man named John Plummer purchased the land that was Brook Farm in 1849 before selling it six years later to James Freeman Clarke, who intended to establish another community there. Instead, Clarke offered it to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War and the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry Regiment used it for training as Camp Andrew.Felton, 129Historical Digression, Civil War Training Camps in Massachusetts, part 2 9 August 2015. Retrieved 14 July 2020. Clarke sold the property in 1868 to two brothers, who used it as a summer boarding house. In 1870 Gottlieb F. Burckhardt purchased the property, after which he formed the Association of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for Works of Mercy to operate an orphanage in The Hive, as the main house on the property was known. The orphanage opened in 1872 and operated until 1943. In 1948 the Lutherans converted it into a treatment center and school, which closed in 1977. Parts of the farm were separated in 1873 for use as a cemetery, a use that continues today as a non-denominational cemetery known as the Gardens of Gethsemene (as part of St. Joseph's Cemetery and the Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries). During the period of Lutheran ownership the only now extant building, a c. 1890 print shop, was built on the land; the buildings associated with the Transcendentalists, most recently the Margaret Fuller Cottage, had burned down by the 1980s. In 1988 the Metropolitan District Commission (since merged with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, or DCR) purchased of the original land.Delano, 326 The farm was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965, a Boston Landmark in 1977, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Polly M. Rettig and S. Sydney Bradford (April 3, 1976) , National Park Service and The DCR now operate the state- owned portion as a historic site; the West Roxbury Historical Society periodically offers tours.  Landscape and facilities  Brook Farm was named for the brook that ran near the roadside and that eventually went to the Charles River.Myerson, 299‚Äì300 It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, turned out to be difficult to farm.Packer, 134 The land on the Keith lot that was purchased along with the Ellis farm included a functional farmhouse, which Brook Farmers immediately began calling \\"The Hive\\". The Hive became the center for social activities and was where the people of the community went to eat three meals a day. The Hive's dining room held fifty people and its library was stocked with George Ripley's personal book collection which was made available for all community members.Felton, 124‚Äì125 As the community grew, it became necessary to add more buildings for lodgings and various activities. The first building constructed was \\"The Nest\\", where school lessons took place and where guests of the farm would stay. Mr. and Mrs. Ripley's house, later to be called the Eyrie, was built during the second year. The next building to be built was the Margaret Fuller Cottage; though named after Fuller, she never spent a night there.Felton, 125 A participant at Brook Farm named Ichabod Morton built the Pilgrim House, named in honor of his home town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The -story building was the third structure built that year and cost nearly $5,000 to build.Delano, 96 Morton stayed there only two weeks before moving out, after which the building was used for general lodging and also held the laundry facilities. The many constructions, including greenhouses and small craft shops, quickly reduced their treasury.  Community life  = Work and finances = Participants at Brook Farm were also shareholders and were promised five percent of the annual profits or free tuition for one student. In exchange for 300 days of work per year, they were granted free room and board. Members performed whatever work most appealed to them and all, including women, were paid equal wages.Delano, 65‚Äì66 The philosophy of labor, according to Ripley, was \\"to insure a more natural union between intellectual and manual labor than now exists; to combine the thinker and the worker, as far as possible, in the same individual.\\"Marshall, 407‚Äì408 The organization of work in Brook Farm changed over time because of both financial troubles and changes in ideologies. Members of Brook Farm initially participated in an \\"attractive industry\\" system where each individual could pick his or her work assignments based on their own preferences. This method did not have any specific authority making sure that essential tasks were getting done. After initial leniency, some sensed that not all members were doing their fair share of the labor, so in 1841 the community adopted required standards for work: ten hours of work were required per day during the summer, and eight hours during winter. When Brook Farm first started adopting Fourierist notions, they created a more structured work environment with a system that consisted of three series of industry, which were agriculture, mechanical, and domestic, and within each series there were a number of groups that handled more specific tasks. Each group had a chief whose duty it was to keep a record of the work done. While this system did create a new work hierarchy, the members still had the flexibility to move between groups easily. These new measures caused Brook Farm to achieve a profit in 1844 which was a feat that had not been accomplished in its first few years of the community's existence. Typical work duties at Brook Farm included chopping wood, bringing in firewood, milking cows, turning a grindstone, and other farming chores. Not all were farmers, however. Some worked in the trades, including making shoes, and others were teachers. Regardless of the job, all were considered equal and because of the job distribution, as Elizabeth Peabody wrote, \\"no one has any great weight in any one thing\\".Rose, 135 In exchange for their work, participants were granted several \\"guarantees\\", including \\"medical attendance, nursing, education in all departments, amusements\\".Delano, 67 There were some occasional conflicts between different workers, partly because those who were educators believed themselves more aristocratic; overall, however, as historian Charles Crowe wrote, \\"indeed all aspects of communal life operated with surprisingly little friction\\" in general. Visitors to Brook Farm came frequently, totaling an estimated 1,150 each year, though each was charged for their visit. Between November 1844 and October 1845, surviving records show that $425 was collected from visitor fees.Delano, 53 The list of visitors included theologian Henry James, Sr., sculptor William Wetmore Story, artist John Sartain, and British social reformer Robert Owen.Delano, 54 Despite multiple sources of income, the community was in constant debt almost immediately after it began. The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, though it was sold at low grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable.Crow, 161 The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845. Brook Farm got into the habit of spending money before they had raised it. As one Brook Farmer wrote, \\"I think here lies the difficulty,‚Äîwe have not had business men to conduct our affairs ... those among us who have some business talents, see this error\\". =Education= On September 29, 1841, the \\"Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education\\" was organized. The school was the most immediate (and at times the only) source of income for Brook Farm and attracted students as far away as Cuba and the Philippines. Children under twelve were charged three-and-a-half dollars per week and, at first, boys over twelve were charged four dollars a week and girls were charged five; by August 1842, the rates were made identical, regardless of gender. Adult education was also available in the evenings. The schedule for adults included courses on moral philosophy, German language, and modern European history.Felton, 126 Within the school there was an infant school for children under six, a primary school for children under ten, and there was a preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community who was in charge of his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise.Myerson, 82 The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Bradford, John Sullivan Dwight) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna Bruce and Abby Morton).Delano, 79 Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught musicMyerson, 305 as well as Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of John Dewey. Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.Rose, 186 = Leisure = The people of Brook Farm spent most of their time either studying or working the farm, but they always set aside time in the day for play. In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating.Rose, 131 Every week everyone in the community would gather at The Hive for a dance of the young ladies of the community. They would wear wreaths of wild daisies on top of their heads, and each week a special wreath, bought from a florist, would be given to the best dressed girl.Myerson, 302‚Äì303 At the end of every day, many performed a \\"symbol of Universal Unity\\", in which they stood in a circle and joined hands and vowed for \\"truth to the cause of God and Humanity\\".Felton, 125‚Äì126 Spirits remained high throughout the experiment, regardless of the community's financial standing. Their social structure demanded selflessness and individuals rarely failed to fulfill their duties,Crowe, 178 a requirement to earn leisure time. Leisure time was important to the Brook Farm philosophy. As Elizabeth Palmer Peabody wrote for The Dial in January 1842, \\"none will be engaged merely in bodily labor ... This community aims to be rich, not in the metallic representative of wealth, but in ... leisure to live in all the faculties of the soul\\".Marshall, 416 = Role of women = At Brook Farm, women had the opportunity to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued.Packer, 159 They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. However, during the harvest time women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time. Because of the community's focus on individual freedom, women were autonomous from their husbands and were also allowed to become stockholders. Women also played an important role in providing sources of income to the community. Many devoted time to making, as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described, \\"elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.,\\" for sale at shops in Boston. Others painted screens and lamp shades for sale. Women were allowed to go to school and, because of the well-known education of women at Brook Farm, many female writers and performers visited the farm. George Ripley's wife Sophia, who had written an outspoken feminist essay for The Dial on \\"Woman\\" before moving to Brook Farm,Rose, 185 was very educated and was able to teach history and foreign languages at the farm. Criticism Many people in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light- hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, \\"It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all\\".Packer, 135 The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, \\"We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints ... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons.\\"Rose, Ann C. Beloved Strangers: Interfaith Families in Nineteenth-century America Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001: 94‚Äì95. Nathaniel Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. Initially, he praised the work he was doing, boasting of \\"what a great, broad- shouldered, elephantine personage I shall become by and by!\\"Marshall, 409 Later, he wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, \\"labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified\\".McFarland, 84 After disassociating with the community Hawthorne demanded the return of his initial investment, though he never held any ill will with Ripley, to whom he wrote he would \\"heartily rejoice at your success‚Äîof which I can see no reasonable doubt\\". Many outside the community were critical of Brook Farm, especially in the press. The New York Observer, for example, suggested that, \\"The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the 'passions' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes\\", concluding that they were \\"secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society\\".Delano, 275‚Äì276 Critic Edgar Allan Poe expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled \\"Brook Farm\\" in the December 13, 1845, issue of the Broadway Journal. He wrote that he had \\"sincere respect\\" for the group and that its journal, The Harbinger, was \\"conducted by an assemblage of well-read persons who mean no harm‚Äîand who, perhaps, can do no less\\".Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 35. Despite many critics, none suggested George Ripley be replaced as Brook Farm's leader. Ralph Waldo Emerson never joined the Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his \\"conviction that the Community is not good for me\\". He also questioned the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, \\"The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day ... and both received at night the same wages\\". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, one of the founders of another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were \\"playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner\\".Delano, 119 Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community.Rose, 189 After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment.Crowe, 179 Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, \\"As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven\\". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as \\"childish, empty, & sad\\".Rose, 196  In fiction  A founding member, Hawthorne later fictionalized his experience at Brook Farm in The Blithedale Romance. Nathaniel Hawthorne, though a founding member, was unhappy during his tenure as a Brook Farmer, partly because he was unable to write while living there. \\"I have no quiet at all\\", he complained, and his hands were covered \\"with a new crop of blisters‚Äîthe effect of raking hay\\". He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel, The Blithedale Romance.McFarland, 149 He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying \\"in the 'Blithedale' of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists.\\" The chapter called \\"The Masqueraders\\", for example, was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season.Delano, 102 George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the New York Tribune, said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story. Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne's fictional character Zenobia. In the novel, a visitor‚Äîa writer like Hawthorne‚Äîfinds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity. In his introduction, Hawthorne insisted that, although his experience with Brook Farm undoubtedly influenced his concept of a Utopian community, that the characters in his novel in no way represented any of the Brook Farm residents specifically.Nathaniel Hawthorne, Blithedale Romance, Oxford University Press See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Boston, Massachusetts Notes References * Crowe, Charles.

McGillis played the part of caretaker for Miss Venable (Jessica Tandy) in 1988's The House on Carroll Street, which also starred Jeff Daniels. She overhears a suspicious conversation in the house next door and suspects that she's stumbled on a conspiracy to smuggle Nazi war criminals into the United States. After 1988's The Accused, she appeared in Cat Chaser with Peter Weller, a film she despised and which discouraged her from pursuing an acting career.

Career Miller studied electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1973.http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_alan_miller.html Miller joined Atari, Inc. in February 1977 and was one of the first four Atari 2600 game designers. His 2600 titles include Surround, Hunt & Score, Hangman and Basketball. With others, he co-authored the operating system for the Atari 400/800 computers in late 1978 and early 1979. His last game for Atari, Basketball, was one of the first ROM games for the Atari computers. Miller did not work on any Atari 2600 cartridges during his last year with Atari. In late 1979, Miller left Atari with three other programmers, David Crane, Larry Kaplan and Bob Whitehead. They were disillusioned and disappointed with Atari's refusal to give them screen credit for any of the games they worked on. With music industry executive, Jim Levy, they formed Activision, the first independent video game developer and publisher. Activision rapidly grew to US$159 million in revenue in 1983, its third year of sales. Miller acted as Vice President of Product Development and designed several of the company's first games. Among his games designed while with Activision are Checkers, Tennis, Ice Hockey, Starmaster and Robot Tank.Distinguished Guest: Alan Miller from Classic Gaming Expo website Miller experimented with implementing a 3D display for the game Checkers but due to technical limitations of both the Atari 2600 and television sets of the era, the idea was dropped. Miller and Whitehead thought that diversification to other platforms, such as the home computers like the Commodore 64, was essential for success.Bob Whitehead interview from DigitalPress Activision was resistant to this idea, so he and Whitehead left Activision in 1984 and together formed the game publisher Accolade. While with his new company, he designed only one game, Law of the West for the Commodore 64. Miller started as Vice President of Product Development but in a few years rose to Chairman and CEO. After ten years at Accolade, Miller left in 1994. Ironically, Accolade hit hard times and in 1999 was purchased by Infogrames, which later changed its subsidiaries' names to Atari Inc., Atari Europe, Atari Australia, and Atari Japan respectively. In September 2001, Miller rejoined David Crane at Crane's company, Skyworks Technologies, a leading developer of custom branded online games (advergames) for Fortune 100 companies, where he served as Vice President of Business Development for four years. Click Health In 1997, Miller co-founded Click Health, a pioneering publisher of health education games for children with asthma and diabetes. The games were made available for Nintendo consoles and IBM PCs. Miller served as Chairman and CEO. Clinical trials of the company's games demonstrated significant effectiveness. In a clinical trial with pediatric diabetes patients at Stanford University Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente, children who played the company's diabetes game, Packy and Marlon, experienced a 77% reduction in urgent care visits over six months, compared to children in the control group who were given a standard video game to play. The company's anti-smoking game, Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon, is an interactive exhibit in the Health Odyssey Museum at the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, played by thousands of children each year as they tour the museum. Unable to find significant interest in distribution of the effective games through health care providers, insurers, and government agencies, Click Health closed its doors in September 2001.

About $3.6 billion of this had been recovered by the Philippine government as of 2018, either through compromise deals or sequestration cases. She married Ferdinand Marcos in 1954 and became First Lady in 1965 when he became President of the Philippines. She ordered the construction of many grandiose architectural projects, using public funds and \\"in impossibly short order\\" \\\\- a propaganda practice which eventually came to be known as her \\"edifice complex.\\" The People Power Revolution in February 1986 unseated the Marcoses and forced the family into exile. In 1991, President Corazon Aquino allowed the Marcos family to return to the Philippines after the 1989 death of Ferdinand Marcos. Imelda Marcos was elected four times to the House of Representatives of the Philippines, and ran twice for the presidency of the Philippines. She and her family gained notoriety for living a lavish lifestyle during a period of economic crisis and civil unrest in the country. She spent much of her time abroad on state visits, extravagant parties, and shopping sprees, and spent much of the State's money on her personal art, jewelry and shoe collections. She and her husband Ferdinand hold the Guinness World Record for the Greatest Robbery of a Government. The subject of dozens of court cases around the world, she was eventually convicted of corruption charges for her activities during her term as governor of Metro Manila in 2018.  Early life  = Birth and family background = Imelda Remedios Visitacion Romu√°ldez was born at dawn in San Miguel, Manila on July 2, 1929. Her parents were Vicente Orestes Romu√°ldez, a lawyer, and his second wife, Remedios Trinidad. Imelda is the sixth of Vicente's eleven children, and Remedios's firstborn. Born into the Romu√°ldez political dynasty from the province of Leyte, Imelda grew up in a wealthy clan of devout Catholics. She was baptized in the nearby San Miguel Church on the day after her birth. Notable members of Imelda's family include the clan matriarch Do√±a Trinidad L√≥pez de Romu√°ldez; her uncle Norberto Romualdez, who was Supreme Court of the Philippines Associate Justice; and her younger brother Benjamin Romualdez, who served as the Governor of Leyte and later as an ambassador under the Ferdinand Marcos regime. = Early childhood = At the time of her birth, the Romualdezes were wealthy. However, around 1931‚Äì1932, the financial conditions of Imelda's family began to decline. Imelda's parents were separated for a time, during which Remedios worked for the nuns at the Asilo de San Vicente de Paul. Vicente and Remedios eventually reconciled but to avoid further conflict, she and her children, including Imelda moved to their house's garage. In 1937 after Conchita's birth, Remedios's health began to fail and she died on April 7, 1938 due to double pneumonia. In her ten years of marriage, Imelda had five siblings ‚Äì Benjamin, Alita, Alfredo, Armando and Conchita. On the same year, 1938, Imelda's father gave up Manila due to his declining fortunes in his law practice and returned to Tacloban where he could support his family with a simpler lifestyle. She grew up learning Waray language, learned Tagalog language and, eventually, English. = Education =  Elementary  Imelda finished grade one in the nearby College of the Holy Spirit Manila, where her older half-sisters also studied. She continued her early studies at Holy Infant Academy, a convent school run by Order of Saint Benedict. The old wooden structure of the school still stands today four blocks away from the Romualdez house. At school, Imelda had to face her family's humiliating poverty, and she was frequently among the students who had to apologize for late payments.  High school  In 1942, the Romualdezes returned to Tacloban, and around that time, Imelda's father refused to let her go back to school. When the Americans returned in 1944, she was eager to resume her studies at Leyte Progressive High School. She finished first year at the provincial high school where she was also chosen Miss I-A; then in her second year, she moved to Holy Infant and stayed there until she graduated. Imelda continued her higher studies at Holy Infant Academy from 1938 to 1948, the year she graduated from high school. As a student, her scholastic record shows that she had a general average of 80 per cent throughout her primary and high school.  College  Imelda ran for President of the student council at St. Paul's College (now named Divine Word University) in 1951, three years before her marriage to Marcos. At that time, she was about to graduate with a degree in Education. She was put up as candidate for the Department of Education, which had an enrollment of 800 students. Even during the nomination, her victory was already a foregone conclusion, but the school authorities insisted that another candidate be put up to make the elections a democratic procedure. That was how the College of Law, with 200 students, put up Francisco Pedrosa. While an undergraduate student, Marcos taught at a local Chinese high school before graduating in 1952. She had won a scholarship to study music at the Philippine Women's University under Adoracion Reyes, a close friend of the family. She had a job at a music store but left this for a better one at the Central Bank. After a few lessons, Adoracion was convinced that Imelda had talent and persuaded her to enroll at the College of Music and Fine Arts at PWU, under a special arrangement that would put her on register while Adoracion would continue to give her free lessons.i  Early career  ; Life in Manila with Daniel Romualdez Imelda Marcos in 1953 Imelda came back to Manila in 1952 during the regime of President Elpidio Quirino and stayed in the house of her relative, House of Representatives of the Philippines Speaker Pro tempore Daniel Romualdez, who had three adopted children. Imelda's status in the house of Romualdez during this time has been described as \\"higher than servants and lower than family members as a poor relative\\". Imelda found work as a salesgirl in a store called P. E. Domingo, which infuriated her father when he learned during one of his visits, perceiving it as ill treatment of Imelda. ; Work at the Central Bank Intelligence Division and lessons at the Philippine Women's University To calm the indignation of Vicente Romualdez, Eduardo and Daniel exercised their political and economic influence to find work for Imelda in the Central Bank where she worked under Braulio Hipuna, the Chief Clerk of the Intelligence Division. During this time her cousin Loreto Ramos introduced her to Adoracion Reyes, a teacher from the College of Music and Fine Arts of Philippine Women's University (PWU), who gave her vocal lessons and a chance to get a PWU scholarship. She later sang three songs at a performance with her cousin Loreto at Holy Ghost College (now named College of the Holy Spirit Manila). Imelda also joined the 1953 Miss Manila beauty pageant. The results became controversial, resulting in both Imelda and Ms. Norma Jimenez being declared Manila's candidate to the larger Miss Philippines pageant. Both of them eventually lost to Cristina Galang.  Courtship and marriage to Ferdinand Marcos  Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos met on April 6, 1954 during a budget hearing at the Philippine Congress. Ferdinand was part of the opposition team who led the argument against the budget, while Imelda was there to visit her cousin Daniel, who was the Speaker of the House. During a recess, Imelda caught Ferdinand's eye, and he asked his journalist friend Jos√© Guevarra of The Manila Times to introduce him to Imelda. At that time, Ferdinand already knew of Imelda and her reputation. Imelda, on the other hand, knew very little of Ferdinand Marcos. After comparing heights and confirming that he was at least an inch taller than her, Ferdinand immediately decided to pursue her in marriage. This began an eleven-day whirlwind courtship where Ferdinand, with the help of Guevarra, courted Imelda for 11 days. During Holy Week of that year, Ferdinand visited Imelda's house, and when Imelda claimed that she plans to spend the holidays in Baguio, Ferdinand and Guevarra offered her a ride up to Daniel's family mansion where she planned to stay, while the two booked a room in nearby Pines. For the remainder of that Holy Week, Ferdinand showered Imelda with flowers and gifts and would visit her daily, prodding her to sign the marriage license that would seal the agreement. On April 16, 1954, Good Friday, after having been jokingly asked by Guevarra if she wanted to be \\"the First Lady of the Land someday\\", Imelda finally agreed to sign it. On April 17, 1954, Ferdinand and Imelda were secretly married by a reluctant Francisco Chanco, a judge befriended by Ferdinand who lived in the area. The church wedding followed only after receiving the blessing of Vicente Orestes, Imelda's father, which Ferdinand asked via telegram on Easter Sunday. Their wedding was held on May 1, 1954 at the San Miguel Pro-Cathedral in Manila where Imelda was christened. The marriage meant that Ferdinand's common-law wife, Carmen Ortega of La Union's Ortega political clan, with whom he had already sired three children, had to be quietly taken out of the public eye.  The 1965 presidential campaign  262x262px It was during the 1965 campaign that Imelda became influential as a political figure at the national level, supporting her husband‚Äôs political tactics through her charismatic appeal and youth. Crowds of working class Filipinos came out in droves to Marcos campaigns because they wanted to see the \\"beautiful wife of Marcos\\". Campaign strategists incorporated Imelda‚Äôs public appeal into the overall tone of the Marcos-led Nacionalista campaign, asking Imelda to always appear at her best in public at all times regardless of the type of audience, and encouraging her to wear her signature ternos as integral part of their image strategy. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, eventually telling the press at one point that it was Imelda who had delivered the one million vote margin he needed to win the election. It was in this period that Imelda described herself - a neophyte transitioning into a true political partner to her husband ‚Äì as \\"a butterfly breaking out of its cocoon\\" This led one foreign journalist to call her as \\"the iron butterfly.\\" Imelda had assumed a managerial position in her husband's campaign early on, when Marcos faced his first challenge of the campaign, which was to win the presidential candidacy for the Nacionalista Party. She enthusiastically ran a detailed campaign, befriending the 1,347 delegates of the Nacionalista Party Convention until Ferdinand Marcos won the party‚Äôs presidential nomination on November 21, 1964, for the Nacionalista Party. McCoy recounts that it was supposedly also Imelda who convinced Fernando Lopez to accept the vice-presidential nomination alongside Marcos. She met Lopez personally, appealing to him by recounting the many struggles she and Ferdinand faced during the campaign. Lopez refused to give in multiple times, until Imelda cried in front of him. When he relented, Imelda proceeded to hand a document to sign, stating that he had accepted the nomination as the Nacionalista vice-presidential candidate. During the presidential election itself, she delivered votes from the southern province of Leyte, and Manila. She was especially popular with the poor. Imelda also used her voice to appeal to voters, singing during campaigns. Her songs are usually varieties of local folk songs.  The first Marcos term (1965‚Äì1969)  Imelda began Ferdinand Marcos's first term doing the duties traditionally expected of a First Lady, mostly social events and public appearances. Imelda became a power broker. Receptions at her offices in the Malaca√±ang \\"Music Room\\" were sought after by cabinet members, heads of financing institutions, and business leaders who felt that she had Ferdinand's ear. A year later in March 1966, Marcos established the Cultural Center of the Philippines through Executive Order No. 60, and arranged for Imelda to be elected chairman of the board in a bid to change the perception that she was just another \\"politician's wife.\\" = The 1965 inauguration = Imelda Marcos at the Bataan Death March Memorial Ferdinand Marcos was elected as the 10th President of the Philippines on November 9, 1965. When he was inaugurated on December 30, 1965, Imelda officially became the First Lady. The Romualdez clan had been torn apart by the presidential campaign. To fix this, Imelda allegedly sent out invitations to family members, some of whom supported the opposing party, and told them they were all welcome at their house in Ortega Street, San Juan, Metro Manila. Ferdinand and Imelda held mass in the courtyard of their house in Ortega Street before proceeding to Luneta Park for the inauguration ceremonies. At night, a state dinner hosted 60 guests in the reception hall of the Malaca√±ang Palace. = Early projects as First Lady = In the first three years of being First Lady, she spent PHP 1 million for the beautification of the Paco Park and 24 million for the beautification of Fort Santiago. In May 1966, Imelda pushed a 12 million peso plan to pool together the social welfare efforts of several dozen social welfare groups. The plan involved the construction welfare villages and the reorientation of personnel to staff them. The cornerstone for first village, the Reception and Study Center in Quezon City was laid in 1996, and several more were built from then until 1968: Marilla Hills in Alabang, the Children's Orphanage in Pasay, the Molave Village in Tanay, Rizal, a Home for the Aged in Quezon City, and the Philippine Village at the Manila International Airport. In mid-1967, Imelda started the \\"Share for Progress\\" Seed Dispersal Program a project that suggested making vegetable gardens out of idle lots all over the country. By 1968, 309,392 kits containing seeds had been distributed in over 1500 towns. = The Blue Ladies = The \\"Blue Ladies\\", a group initially composed of wives of political men in the Nacionalista Party, had played a critical role during Marcos's 1965 campaign. They contributed funds and provided publicity, giving the campaign a personal touch by visiting factories and farms to shake hands and have small conversations with the voters, making door-to-door appeals in the slum areas. They also utilized the new innovation brought into politics that year by buying radio and television time in order to campaign for Marcos through the use of little speeches for the voters. The cost was not a problem for Marcos seeing as how most of its members were composed of prominent matrons and/or beautiful youthful girls married to men of means. Upon becoming First Lady, Imelda often asked members of the Blue Ladies to accompany her on her trips out of the country. One of her most famous socialite friends was Cristina Ford. Imelda's Blue Ladies‚Äîspecifically Maria Luisa, a daughter of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Daniel Vazquez‚Äîcontributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. It was also at this time that Vazquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. In November 1968, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vazquez are one and the same is validated by the notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos's handwriting. = The Beatles incident = On July 4, 1966, the First Lady also invited the Beatles to perform for a private affair in the Palace but the invitation was rejected. An order to lock down the Manila International Airport was enacted as a result of the rejection. This resulted in mobs trying to storm the band's hotel rooms and prevent them from leaving the country. There were also reports that their manager was issued a PHP 100,000 tax assessment. = Increased independence = The Dovie Beams scandal, which began as rumors in the late 60s, eventually led to a significant change in Imelda's public role. President Marcos had met the American actress after she arrived in Manila in 1968 to play the female lead in \\"Maharlika,\\" a propaganda film portraying Ferdinand's supposed exploits during World War II. According to Beams, the two had an affair and she was moved into one of Ferdinand's safe houses, where she recorded their lovemaking with Ferdinand's full consent. These tapes were later played in a press conference, causing great humiliation for Imelda. Members of the Marcos Cabinet such as Cesar Virata and Gerardo Sicat recount that Imelda used the humiliation of the Dovie Beams affair as leverage to begin developing an independent political agenda which gave her more and more political power.} Initially, this meant that Imelda had free rein on her projects while her husband prepared for the Ferdinand Marcos presidential campaign, 1969,} but as Marcos's health declined, it involved her being put in increasingly powerful positions, including those of Minister of Human Settlements and of Governor of Metro Manila.  The second Marcos term (1969‚Äì1972)  In July 1974, the annual Ms. Universe pageant was held in Manila, to which then First Lady Imelda Marcos allegedly spent PHP 40 million (USD 5.5 million) for the renovation of all public and private infrastructures throughout Manila, and the other cities in which the Ms. Universe pageant participants were subsequently toured. = Foreign relations roles = Lyndon B. Johnson and Imelda Marcos dancing Since the President hardly left the Malaca√±ang Palace, Ferdinand increasingly sent his wife on official visits to other countries as a de facto vice president. When the Marcoses went to the United States in September 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson offered Imelda the Philippine war damage claims totaling US$28 million. President Johnson agreed to have US$3.5 million be used as funds for the Cultural Center, one of Imelda's projects. For the inauguration of the CCP, a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of a story about the prehistory of the Philippines, occurred on September 8, 1969. US President Richard Nixon was invited but instead California Governor Ronald Reagan, along with his wife, flew to the country on Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities by getting them tickets to ride Air Force One but she was denied this luxury by President Nixon. Accounts have also mentioned that this trip by the then-Governor Reagan and his wife led to the closeness of the Reagans and Marcoses. In 1971, Imelda attended Iran's 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire of the founding of the Persian Empire. This trip, according to palace insiders, provided her with a social introduction to some of the world's wealthiest people. = Accusation of bribery in Constitutional Convention = On May 19, 1972, the Constitutional Convention delegate for Leyte's first district, Eduardo Quintero, accused Imelda and thirteen others of bribing some of the convention members to vote against provisions which would have prevented Marcos from retaining power beyond the two four-year terms allowed him by the previous constitution. In the stress following the accusations and media circus, Imelda claimed to have suffered a miscarriage. Later, this was revealed to be a hoax to avoid Quintero's charges. According to Ellison, this was \\"an eloquent example of the lengths to which Imelda would go to support [Ferdinand] and her ambition.\\" = Imelda's actions preceding martial law = Meeting of the Marcoses and the Nixons in 1969 at the Malaca√±ang Palace In Ferdinand's diary preceding May, he revealed that he and Imelda were planning to wager all their power and wealth \\"on a single throw of the dice of fate for the sake of the people and the Republic.\\" On the eve of September 5, 1972, tourism minister Manuel Elizalde called each member of Manila's foreign press corps to a party. Imelda arrived at the party, allegedly rambling about democracy and how only the Americans could afford it. On that same day, Martial Law was announced. Ferdinand stated the purpose of the Martial Law was to create a \\"New Society\\" with reformed institutions, no inequalities, corruption, or crime. Imelda called it \\"martial law with a smile.\\" Days after the announcement, a warrant of arrest was issued for Amelita Cruz, author of the \\"you-know-who\\" columns on Imelda. Cruz was told that the orders \\"came directly from the music room\\", Imelda's palace study.  Martial law (1972‚Äì1981)  During this time period, she orchestrated public events using national funds to bolster her and her husband's image.\\"Ferdinand Marcos, Former Philippines Dictator, Forced Generals To Perform Drag Show, According To WikiLeaks\\".

She organized the Kasaysayan ng Lahi, a festival showcasing Philippine history. She also initiated social programs, such as the Green Revolution, which was intended to address hunger by encouraging the people to plant produce in household gardens, and created a national family-planning program.

In 1975, after the assassination of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Imelda wanted to extend the official condolences. Women were not welcome in the Saudi court, but Imelda, through her connection to the surgeon who previously performed a heart surgery on the new king, managed to be the first woman guest to be honored.

Aquino supposedly agreed to her conditions that he would return to the Philippines, and he would not speak out against the Marcos regime in the US. Having made a quick recovery, Aquino decided to remain in the US, saying, \\"a pact with the devil is no pact at all\\". Six months after martial law was lifted on January 17, 1981, Ferdinand Marcos was re-elected as president. While her husband began to suffer from lupus erythematosus, Imelda effectively ruled in his place.

The New York Times. October 6, 2012.  Downfall of Marcos  On February 7, 1986, snap elections were held between Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino, the widow of Benigno Aquino Jr. Despite Ferdinand Marcos claiming to have won the elections, allegations of vote rigging led to mass protests that would be later known as the People Power Revolution. On February 25, Ferdinand Marcos with his wife Imelda by his side still held the inauguration at Malaca√±ang Palace. The couple later emerged on the Palace balcony in front of a loyalist crowd and Imelda sang a song for the crowd. Later that day, Ferdinand Marcos finally agreed to step down, and was given safe passage for him and his entire family to flee to Hawaii, United States.  Exile in Hawaii (1986‚Äì1991)  At midnight, February 26, 1986, the Marcos family fled the country to Hawaii with a party of about 80 individuals ‚Äì the extended Marcos family and a number of close associates. The US Government initially hosted the exiles at Hickam Air Force Base. Ferdinand and Imelda moved into a pair of residences in Makiki Heights, Honolulu a month later. Ferdinand Marcos eventually died in exile in September 1989. His son Bongbong Marcos was the only family member present at his deathbed. After Imelda left Malaca√±ang Palace, she was found to have left behind 15 mink coats, 508 gowns, 888 handbags, and 3,000 pairs of shoes. Some news reports estimated that there were up to 7,500 pairs, but Time magazine reported that the final tally was 1,060.

These assets were previously frozen by Swiss courts in 1986 shortly after the People Power Revolution. The decision eventually led to reforms in 1998 that made it more difficult for dictators and criminals to keep their money in the Swiss banking system. = 1995 Human Rights Victims Class Suit (Hawaii) = In February 1995, the United States District Court in Hawaii ruled against the Marcoses, awarding $1.96 billion to 9,539 victims of human rights violations during the Marcos dictatorship. This decision was upheld by US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1996. However, the ruling has yet to be enforced in the Philippines due to jurisdiction issues. = Corruption cases in the Philippines = Upon the Marcos family's return to the Philippines in the early 1990s, 28 criminal cases were filed against Mrs. Marcos by the Philippines' Office of the Ombudsman from 1991 to 1995. These included cases of graft and malversation of public funds. In 1993, Marcos was convicted on a graft case.

August 29, 2012. On November 9, 2018 the Sandiganbayan convicted Marcos on seven counts of graft and corruption, which disqualified Marcos from holding any public office. In October 2015, Imelda Marcos still faced 10 criminal charges of graft and 25 civil cases in the Philippines.  2018 Swiss foundation cases convictions  In 1991, Marcos was indicted on ten corruption charges in the Philippines' anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan. Twenty-seven years later, on November 9, 2018, she was convicted on seven counts of violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, for funneling roughly US$200 million to various Swiss foundations while she was still serving as governor of Metro Manila in the 1970s. That same day, the court announced her acquittal on the three remaining counts, but since she failed to appear, the court also ordered the forfeiture of the earlier bond that she had posted in 1991. She was sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to eleven years for each count ‚Äì totalling a minimum of 42 years and 7 months, and a maximum of 77 years. The Sandiganbayan also disqualified Marcos, a representative for the first district of Ilocos Norte and a candidate for governor of the same province, from holding any public office. The sanction will not go into immediate effect, pending appeal by her, but she nonetheless withdrew her candidacy for the governorship. On November 12, 2018, Marcos's attorney filed a \\"Motion for Leave of Court to Avail of Post-Conviction Remedies\\", which included a provision for bail. The court granted bail due to her \\"ill health\\", but reserved ruling on the balance of the requests until November 28. Marcos posted bail on November 16, 2018, a week after her conviction. She intends to appeal her conviction. The normal form of appeal is a \\"motion for reconsideration\\" to the Sandiganbayan; however, she also requested a direct appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court, which while originally denied as premature, was granted on November 28.  Ill-gotten wealth  = Court rulings on and estimated amount of stolen wealth = The Philippine Supreme Court considers the unexplained wealth of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos to be \\"ill-gotten\\" based on the definitions set forth in Republic Act 1379, which was passed in 1955. The Supreme Court's interpretation of R.A. 1379 says that property acquired by a public officer or employee which is \\"manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer and to his other lawful income\\" is \\"presumed prima facie to have been unlawfully acquired\\". The bulk of the assets of the Marcoses, including the Marcos jewels, were treated as unlawful in a 2012 decision which specified that \\"according to the Official Report of the Minister of Budget, the total salaries of former President Marcos as President from 1966 to 1976 was ‚Ç±60,000 a year and from 1977 to 1985, ‚Ç±100,000 a year; while that of the former First Lady, Imelda R. Marcos, as Minister of Human Settlements from June 1976 to February 22‚Äì25, 1986 was ‚Ç±75,000 a year\\" ‚Äì about $304,372.43. Estimates of this ill-gotten wealth vary, with sources estimating a figure of about US$5‚Äì10 billion for wealth acquired in the last years of the Marcos administration. The Telegraph estimates her current net worth at a more modest $22M (the amount declared by Imelda Marcos in 2012), but states that it is likely that she and her husband stole billions while in power, and that the amount they stole could have paid off the entirety of the Philippine foreign debt. In a 1985 report to the United States Congress House Committee on Foreign Affairs, US Ambassador to the Philippines Stephen Bosworth estimated that the Marcoses had stolen an accumulated wealth of US$10 billion \\"in recent years\\", in the context of the rapid decline of the Philppine economy in the early 1980s. The same figure was cited by the Philippines' Office of the Solicitor General soon after Marcos was deposed by the EDSA Revolution in 1986. Bosworth's source, Dr. Bernardo Villegas of the Philippine think tank the Center for Research and Communication (CRC), noted that the figure ultimately cited by Bosworth was a conservative estimate, and that the amount probably came closer to $13 billion. The PCGG's first chairperson, Jovito Salonga later said that he estimated figure of US$5‚Äì10 billion, based on the documentary trail left behind by the Marcoses in 1986. Internationally, Salonga's estimate has become the popularly cited estimate of the Marcoses' unexplained wealth. However Dr. Jesus Estanislao, another noted economist from the CRC, pointed out that this figure reflected amounts taken out of the country in the years immediately prior to the ouster of the Marcos administration, and that there was no way to accurately estimate the wealth acquired by the Marcoses since the 1950s. He suggested that the figure could be as much as $30 billion. Aside from the Marcoses' amassed wealth, Imelda Marcos was famous for spending it, with some accounts calling her \\"the ultimate personification of conspicuous consumption.\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/imelda-the- first-lady-of-fashion-423412.html On one occasion, Imelda spent $2,000 on chewing gum at the San Francisco International Airport and, on another, forced a plane to do a U-turn mid-air because she had forgotten to buy cheese in Rome.

Some of it has also been recovered by the Philippine government through settlements and compromise deals, either with Imelda herself or with cronies who say that certain properties had been entrusted to them by the Marcoses. However, some of the recovery cases have been dismissed by the courts for reasons such as improper case filing procedures and technical issues with documentary evidence. An amount of unidentified proportions has yet to be recovered, as the full extent of the family's wealth remains unknown. In March 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda opened four accounts, under the names of William Saunders and Jane Ryan, with Credit Suisse in Zurich,\\"Some Are Smarter Than Others & The Collection of Jane Ryan and William Saunders: Pio Abad's exploration of the Marcos horde\\", The Philippine Star.

But Imelda has also said in interviews that \\"If you know how rich you are, you are not rich. But me, I am not aware of the extent of my wealth. That's how rich we are .\\" = World record for largest theft from a government = The amount the Marcoses were estimated to have plundered from the Philippines is so large that it has been the subject of world records. Imelda Marcos, together with her husband Ferdinand (who is considered by many to be one of the greatest plunderers in history according to the Washington Post), were jointly credited in 1989 by Guinness World Records with the largest-ever theft from a government: an estimated 5 to 10 billion dollars salted away. She is quoted as having stated: \\"We practically own everything in the Philippines, from electricity, telecommunications, airlines, banking, beer and tobacco, newspaper publishing, television stations, shipping, oil and mining, hotels and beach resorts, down to coconut milling, small farms, real estate and insurance.\\" In 2009, Imelda Marcos was listed by Newsweek as being one of the \\"greediest people of all time.\\" To this, Marcos replied \\"I plead guilty. For me, greedy is giving. I was first lady for 20 years, you have to be greedy first to give to all. It is natural. The only things we keep in life are those we give away.\\"  Edifice complex  The term \\"edifice complex\\" has been applied to Imelda and her penchant for grandiose public buildings, often constructed in impossibly short order. Imelda's building projects were often of the Brutalist architectural style characterized by fortress-like, massive shapes intended to effect a sense of grandiosity. Cultural Center of the Philippines In 1966, Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing the Cultural Center of the Philippines and appointing its board of directors. The board elected Imelda as their chairperson, giving her the legal mandate to negotiate and manage funds for the center. The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex is considered the premier symbol of Imelda's edifice complex. It was designed by Architect Leandro Locsin, and was built on a reclaimed land along Roxas Boulevard in Manila and covered an area of about 21 hectares. Ninety thousand pesos was granted by the Philippine- American Culture Foundation for its construction and was aided with funds from the Cultural Development Fund and the Special Fund for Education. Upon completion, however, it amounted to Php 50 million‚Äîa 50 000% increase from the original budget. Although it is notable that prices of the construction materials such as cement, steel, and tiles increased by 30‚Äì40 per cent within this time frame, the escalation in the increase of the expenditures are highly questionable. Imelda called the CCP Complex the \\"sanctuary of the Filipino soul,\\" as it became the locus of all state-initiated cultural productions. Another construction project linked with Imelda during her husband's first term as President is the San Juanico Bridge, which links the island of Samar to Imelda's home province, Leyte. Although it wasn't initiated by Imelda herself, it was promoted by the administration as Ferdinand Marcos's gift to his wife. It was funded with foreign loans of US$22 million (about ), from Japan's Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency (OTCA), the predecessor of today's Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Upon its completion on July 2, 1973, Imelda's birthday, economists and public works engineers quickly tagged it as a white elephant which was \\"constructed several decades too soon,\\" because its average daily traffic (ADT) was too low to justify the cost of its construction.  Cultural influence and portrayals in media  Imelda Marcos features prominently in protest art displayed in the lobby of the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Museum, which documents the events of the Marcos Dictatorship and \\"honors the heroes and martyrs that fought the regime.\\" =The word \\"Imeldific\\"= The late 1980s, the revelation that Imelda Marcos had \\"amassed a huge collection of art, jewellery, property and ‚Äì most famously ‚Äì at least 1,000 pairs of shoes\\", had turned her into a household name, frequently compared to Marie Antoinette of France, except \\"with shoes.\\" This led to the coining of the Philippine English adjective \\"Imeldific\\", to describe It also refers to people who have \\"the Imelda Marcos syndrome\\" ‚Äì tending to be extravagant and not being afraid to flaunt it, or to describe a lifestyle of \\"ostentatious extravagance\\". It has also come to be used in International English, with dictionary writer and Atlantic columnist Anne Soukhanov expounding on the \\"ostentatious extravagance\\" etymology. In popular international media, the Sydney Morning Herald's Jackie Dent sums up the meaning of the word simply by saying it \\"means to be ... well, like Imelda.\\" The coining of term is often attributed to Imelda Marcos describing, although it was used by People Magazine's Carlos Lopez as early as April 1986, when he said: = Influence on Philippine fashion = Marcos influenced fashion in the Philippines, although her role as a patroness of the arts and fashion is still controversial.The day I met Imelda Marcos.

Sukiyaki beef in raw egg. Traditional Yokohama-style gy≈´nabe. is a Japanese dish that is prepared and served in the nabemono (Japanese hot pot) style. It consists of meat (usually thinly sliced beef) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table, alongside vegetables and other ingredients, in a shallow iron pot in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. The ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten. Generally sukiyaki is a winter dish and it is commonly found at b≈çnenkai, Japanese year-end parties. Ingredients Thinly sliced beef is usually used for sukiyaki, although in the past, in certain parts of the country (notably Hokkaid≈ç and Niigata) pork was also popular. Popular ingredients cooked with the beef are: *Tofu (usually seared firm tofu). *Negi (a type of scallion). *Leafy vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and shungiku (garland chrysanthemum leaves). *Mushrooms such as shiitake and enokitake. *Glass noodles made out of konnyaku and/or corm such as ito konnyaku or shirataki noodles. Boiled wheat udon or mochi (rice- cakes) are sometimes added, usually at the end to soak up the broth. Preparation Sukiyaki is a one pot dish (nabemono) that was developed during the Meiji era. Different regions have different ways of preparing sukiyaki. There are two main styles, the Kanto style from eastern Japan and Kansai style from western Japan. In the Kanto style, warishita (a mixture of sake, soy sauce, sugar, mirin and dashi) is poured and heated in a pot, then meat, vegetables and other ingredients are added and simmered together. In Kansai-style sukiyaki, meat is heated in the pot first. When the meat is almost cooked, sugar, sake and soy sauce are added, then vegetables and other ingredients are added last. The vegetables and meat used are different between the two styles. Because beef was expensive in the past, the use of pork was common in northern and eastern regions. Other ingredients added to modern sukiyaki include chicken (tori-suki), fish (uo-suki), udon noodles (udon- suki), negi, shiitake mushrooms, shirataki and slightly grilled tofu. In both styles, raw eggs are used as a dipping sauce and steamed rice with black sesame seeds is served. History There are various traditions about sukiyaki. Some concern the name. A theory about the origin of the name is from the word , which means spade, and which is the verb to grill. During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), farmers used suki to cook things like fish and tofu. However, sukiyaki became a traditional Japanese dish during the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912). Another theory is that the name comes from the word , which means \\"thinly sliced meat\\". Another tradition concerns the history of sukiyaki. Buddhism was introduced to Japan during the Asuka period. At that time, killing animals was against Buddhist law. Also eating beef was prohibited since cattle were considered work animals. However, people could eat meat under some special circumstances such as when they were sick or at special events like b≈çnenkai, the year-end drinking party. During the Edo period eating game such as boar and duck was common and not forbidden. In the 1860s, when Japan opened its ports to foreign merchants, foreigners who came to Japan introduced the culture of eating meat and new cooking styles. Cows, milk, meat, and eggs became widely used, and sukiyaki was a popular way to serve them. At first, cattle were imported from neighboring countries like Korea and China as the demand for beef increased. Sukiyaki possibly originated and became popular in the Kansai region. Following the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, many beef restaurants in Tokyo were closed and many people in Kant≈ç temporarily moved to the Osaka area. While the people of Kant≈ç were in Osaka, they got accustomed to the Kansai style of sukiyaki, and when they returned to Kant≈ç, they introduced the Kansai sukiyaki style, where it has since become popular. Beef is the primary ingredient in today's sukiyaki.http://baike.baidu.com/item/ÂØøÂñúÁÉß/62210 Baidu Baike =Trivia= The 1961 song \\"Ue wo Muite Aruk≈ç\\" was given the alternative title \\"Sukiyaki\\" so that it could be short and recognizably Japanese in English-speaking countries alike.

Carotenoids (), also called tetraterpenoids, are yellow, orange, and red organic pigments that are produced by plants and algae, as well as several bacteria, and fungi. Carotenoids give the characteristic color to pumpkins, carrots, corn, tomatoes, canaries, flamingos, salmon, lobster, shrimp, and daffodils. Carotenoids can be produced from fats and other basic organic metabolic building blocks by all these organisms. The only land dwelling arthropods known to produce carotenoids are aphids, and spider mites, which acquired the ability and genes from fungi., It is also produced by endosymbiotic bacteria in whiteflies. Carotenoids from the diet are stored in the fatty tissues of animals, and exclusively carnivorous animals obtain the compounds from animal fat. In the human diet, absorption of carotenoids is improved when consumed with fat in a meal. Cooking carotenoid-containing vegetables in oil increases carotenoid bioavailability. There are over 1,100 known carotenoids which can be further categorized into two classes, xanthophylls (which contain oxygen) and carotenes (which are purely hydrocarbons and contain no oxygen). All are derivatives of tetraterpenes, meaning that they are produced from 8 isoprene molecules and contain 40 carbon atoms. In general, carotenoids absorb wavelengths ranging from 400 to 550 nanometers (violet to green light). This causes the compounds to be deeply colored yellow, orange, or red. Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in autumn leaf coloration of about 15-30% of tree species, but many plant colors, especially reds and purples, are due to polyphenols. Macular pigments of the human eye Carotenoids serve two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they provide photoprotection via non-photochemical quenching. Carotenoids that contain unsubstituted beta-ionone rings (including beta-carotene, alpha- carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and gamma-carotene) have vitamin A activity (meaning that they can be converted to retinol). In the eye, lutein, meso- zeaxanthin, and zeaxanthin are present as macular pigments whose importance in visual function, as of 2016, remains under clinical research.  Biosynthesis  Pathway of carotenoid synthesis The basic building blocks of carotenoids are isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). These two isoprene isomers are used to create various compounds depending on the biological pathway used to synthesis the isomers. Plants are known to use two different pathways for IPP production: the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway (MVA) and the plastidic methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP). In animals, the production of cholesterol starts by creating IPP and DMAPP using the MVA. For carotenoid production plants use MEP to generate IPP and DMAPP. The MEP pathway results in a 5:1 mixture of IPP:DMAPP. IPP and DMAPP undergo several reactions, resulting in the major carotenoid precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). GGPP can be converted into carotenes or xanthophylls by undergoing a number of different steps within the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. = MEP pathway = Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate, intermediates of photosynthesis, are converted to deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) using the catalyst DXP synthase (DXS). DXP reductoisomerase reduces and rearranges the molecules within DXP in the presence of NADPH, forming MEP. Next, MEP is converted to 4-(cytidine 5‚Äô-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME) in the presence of CTP via the enzyme MEP cytidylyltransferase. CDP- ME is then converted, in the presence of ATP, to 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5‚Äô-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME2P). The conversion to CDP-ME2P is catalyzed by the enzyme CDP-ME kinase. Next, CDP-ME2P is converted to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP). This reaction occurs when MECDP synthase catalyzes the reaction and CMP is eliminated from the CDP- ME2P molecule. MECDP is then converted to (e)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HMBDP) via HMBDP synthase in the presence of flavodoxin and NADPH. HMBDP is reduced to IPP in the presence of ferredoxin and NADPH by the enzyme HMBDP reductase. The last two steps involving HMBPD synthase and reductase can only occur in completely anaerobic environments. IPP is then able to isomerize to DMAPP via IPP isomerase. = Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway = The conversion of phytoene to lycopene in plants and cyanobacteria (left) differs compared to bacteria and fungi (right). Two GGPP molecules condense via phytoene synthase (PSY), forming the 15-cis isomer of phytoene. The subsequent conversion into all-trans-lycopene depends on the organism. Bacteria and fungi employ a single enzyme, the bacterial phytoene desaturase (CRTI) for the catalysis. Plants and cyanobacteria however utilize four enzymes for this process. The first of these enzymes is a plant-type phytoene desaturase which introduces two additional double bonds into 15-cis-phytoene by dehydrogenation and isomerizes two of its existing double bonds from trans to cis producing 9,15,9‚Äô-tri-cis-Œ∂-carotene. The central double bond of this tri-cis-Œ∂-carotene is isomerized by the zeta-carotene isomerase Z-ISO and the resulting 9,9'-di-cis-Œ∂-carotene is dehydrogenated again via a Œ∂-carotene desaturase (ZDS). This again introduces two double bonds, resulting in 7,9,7‚Äô,9‚Äô-tetra-cis-lycopene. CRTISO, a carotenoid isomerase, is needed to convert the cis-lycopene into an all-trans lycopene in the presence of reduced FAD. This all-trans lycopene is cyclized; cyclization gives rise to carotenoid diversity, which can be distinguished based on the end groups. There can be either a beta ring or an epsilon ring, each generated by a different enzyme (lycopene beta-cyclase [beta-LCY] or lycopene epsilon-cyclase [epsilon-LCY]). Alpha-carotene is produced when the all-trans lycopene first undergoes reaction with epsilon-LCY then a second reaction with beta-LCY; whereas beta- carotene is produced by two reactions with beta-LCY. Alpha- and beta-carotene are the most common carotenoids in the plant photosystems but they can still be further converted into xanthophylls by using beta-hydrolase and epsilon- hydrolase, leading to a variety of xanthophylls. = Regulation = It is believed that both DXS and DXR are rate-determining enzymes, allowing them to regulate carotenoid levels. This was discovered in an experiment where DXS and DXR were genetically overexpressed, leading to increased carotenoid expression in the resulting seedlings. Also, J-protein (J20) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperones are thought to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of DXS activity, such that mutants with defective J20 activity exhibit reduced DXS enzyme activity while accumulating inactive DXS protein. Regulation may also be caused by external toxins that affect enzymes and proteins required for synthesis. Ketoclomazone is derived from herbicides applied to soil and binds to DXP synthase. This inhibits DXP synthase, preventing synthesis of DXP and halting the MEP pathway. The use of this toxin leads to lower levels of carotenoids in plants grown in the contaminated soil. Fosmidomycin, an antibiotic, is a competitive inhibitor of DXP reductoisomerase due to its similar structure to the enzyme. Application of said antibiotic prevents reduction of DXP, again halting the MEP pathway.  Structure and function  General structure of a carotenoid: polyene tail with double bonds, possible terminal rings The structure of carotenoids imparts biological abilities, including photosynthesis, photoprotection, plant coloration, and cell signaling. The general structure of the carotenoid is a polyene chain consisting of 9-11 double bonds and possibly terminating in rings. This structure of conjugated double bonds leads to a high reducing potential, or the ability to transfer electrons throughout the molecule. Carotenoids can transfer excitation energy in one of two ways: 1) singlet- singlet energy transfer from carotenoid to chlorophyll, and 2) triplet-triplet energy transfer from chlorophyll to carotenoid. The singlet-singlet energy transfer is a lower energy state transfer and is used during photosynthesis. The length of the polyene tail enables light absorbance in the photosynthetic range; once it absorbs energy it becomes excited, then transfers the excited electrons to the chlorophyll for photosynthesis. The triplet-triplet transfer is a higher energy state and is essential in photoprotection. Both light and oxygen produce damaging species during photosynthesis, with the most damaging being reactive oxygen species (ROS). As these high energy ROS are produced in the chlorophyll the energy is transferred to the carotenoid‚Äôs polyene tail and undergoes a series of reactions in which electrons are moved between the carotenoid bonds in order find the most balanced state (lowest energy state) for the carotenoid. The length of carotenoids also has a role in plant coloration, as the length of the polyene tail determines which wavelengths of light the plant will absorb. Wavelengths that are not absorbed are reflected and are what we see as the color of a plant. Therefore, differing species will contain carotenoids with differing tail lengths allowing them to absorb and reflect different colors. Carotenoids also participate in different types of cell signaling. They are able to signal the production of absicisic acid, which regulates plant growth, seed dormancy, embryo maturation and germination, cell division and elongation, floral growth, and stress responses.  Properties  Gac fruit, rich in lycopene Ingesting carotenoid- rich foods affects the plumage of flamingos. Carotenoids belong to the category of tetraterpenoids (i.e., they contain 40 carbon atoms, being built from four terpene units each containing 10 carbon atoms). Structurally, carotenoids take the form of a polyene hydrocarbon chain which is sometimes terminated by rings, and may or may not have additional oxygen atoms attached. * Carotenoids with molecules containing oxygen, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, are known as xanthophylls. * The unoxygenated (oxygen free) carotenoids such as Œ±-carotene, Œ≤-carotene, and lycopene, are known as carotenes. Carotenes typically contain only carbon and hydrogen (i.e., are hydrocarbons), and are in the subclass of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Their color, ranging from pale yellow through bright orange to deep red, is directly linked to their structure. Xanthophylls are often yellow, hence their class name. The double carbon-carbon bonds interact with each other in a process called conjugation, which allows electrons in the molecule to move freely across these areas of the molecule. As the number of conjugated double bonds increases, electrons associated with conjugated systems have more room to move, and require less energy to change states. This causes the range of energies of light absorbed by the molecule to decrease. As more wavelengths of light are absorbed from the longer end of the visible spectrum, the compounds acquire an increasingly red appearance. Carotenoids are usually lipophilic due to the presence of long unsaturated aliphatic chains as in some fatty acids. The physiological absorption of these fat-soluble vitamins in humans and other organisms depends directly on the presence of fats and bile salts. Foods Beta-carotene, found in pumpkins, sweet potato, carrots and winter squash, is responsible for their orange-yellow colors. Dried carrots have the highest amount of carotene of any food per 100-gram serving, measured in retinol activity equivalents (provitamin A equivalents). Vietnamese gac fruit contains the highest known concentration of the carotenoid lycopene. Although green, kale, spinach, collard greens, and turnip greens contain substantial amounts of beta- carotene. The diet of flamingos is rich in carotenoids, imparting the orange- colored feathers of these birds. Physiological effects Reviews of epidemiological studies seeking correlations between carotenoid consumption in food and clinical outcomes have come to various conclusions: * A 2015 review found that foods high in carotenoids appear to be protective against head and neck cancers. * Another 2015 review looking at whether caretenoids can prevent prostate cancer found that while several studies found correlations between diets rich in carotenoids appeared to have a protective effect, evidence is lacking to determine whether this is due to carotenoids per se. * A 2014 review found no correlation between consumption of foods high in carotenoids and vitamin A and the risk of getting Parkinson's disease. * Another 2014 review found no conflicting results in studies of dietary consumption of carotenoids and the risk of getting breast cancer. Carotenoids are also important components of the dark brown pigment melanin, which is found in hair, skin, and eyes. Melanin absorbs high-energy light and protects these organs from intracellular damage. * Several studies have observed positive effects of high-carotenoid diets on the texture, clarity, color, strength, and elasticity of skin. * A 1994 study noted that high carotenoid diets helped reduce symptoms of eyestrain (dry eye, headaches, and blurred vision) and improve night vision.Roh S, Weiter JJ,. 1994., Light damage to the eye., J Fla Med Assoc. 1994 Apr;81(4):248-51.Rozanowska M, et al., Light-Induced Damage to the Retina, http://photobiology.info/Rozanowska.html Humans and other animals are mostly incapable of synthesizing carotenoids, and must obtain them through their diet. Carotenoids are a common and often ornamental feature in animals. For example, the pink color of salmon, and the red coloring of cooked lobsters and scales of the yellow morph of common wall lizards are due to carotenoids. It has been proposed that carotenoids are used in ornamental traits (for extreme examples see puffin birds) because, given their physiological and chemical properties, they can be used as visible indicators of individual health, and hence are used by animals when selecting potential mates.  Plant colors  Yellow and orange leaf colors in autumn are due to carotenoids, which are visible after chlorophyll degrades for the season. Apricots, rich in carotenoids The most common carotenoids include lycopene and the vitamin A precursor Œ≤-carotene. In plants, the xanthophyll lutein is the most abundant carotenoid and its role in preventing age-related eye disease is currently under investigation. Lutein and the other carotenoid pigments found in mature leaves are often not obvious because of the masking presence of chlorophyll. When chlorophyll is not present, as in autumn foliage, the yellows and oranges of the carotenoids are predominant. For the same reason, carotenoid colors often predominate in ripe fruit after being unmasked by the disappearance of chlorophyll. Carotenoids are responsible for the brilliant yellows and oranges that tint deciduous foliage (such as dying autumn leaves) of certain hardwood species as hickories, ash, maple, yellow poplar, aspen, birch, black cherry, sycamore, cottonwood, sassafras, and alder. Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in autumn leaf coloration of about 15-30% of tree species. However, the reds, the purples, and their blended combinations that decorate autumn foliage usually come from another group of pigments in the cells called anthocyanins. Unlike the carotenoids, these pigments are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer. Aroma chemicals Products of carotenoid degradation such as ionones, damascones and damascenones are also important fragrance chemicals that are used extensively in the perfumes and fragrance industry. Both Œ≤-damascenone and Œ≤-ionone although low in concentration in rose distillates are the key odor-contributing compounds in flowers. In fact, the sweet floral smells present in black tea, aged tobacco, grape, and many fruits are due to the aromatic compounds resulting from carotenoid breakdown. Disease Some carotenoids are produced by bacteria to protect themselves from oxidative immune attack. The golden pigment that gives some strains of Staphylococcus aureus their name (aureus = golden) is a carotenoid called staphyloxanthin. This carotenoid is a virulence factor with an antioxidant action that helps the microbe evade death by reactive oxygen species used by the host immune system.

The poem has six cantos for the six Indian seasons- (summer), (monsoon/rains), (autumn), (cool), (winter), and (spring)Ritu (Indian season). It is considered to be Kalidasa's earliest work. The word Ritu (seasons)with the word sa·πÉhƒÅra is used here in the sense of \\"coming together\\" or \\"group\\".http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/.

The evocative poetry is in the popular Anustubh Chanda form of four line stanzas- a total of 144 stanzasRitusamhara Or The Peageant Of The Seasons, R. S. Pandit, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.525197. This was the first Sanskrit text to be printed and published in Calcutta (Kolkata)in 1792, and remains one of the popular classics of Kalidasa. The changing seasons are portrayed in acute details using the thematic backdrop of how lovers react differently to the changing landscapes- the two themes beautifully accentuating each other. This imbues the poem with distinctly amorous taste(shringara) rasa. The predominant emphasis on a single rasa has been criticized by some, however it showcases the latent virtuosity of the neophyte poet, as he explores the range of flavors (Svad) within the single rasa rasa- an exuberant exposition of joie de vivre, conveyed through the interplay of changing nature and steady romanceRitusamhara Or The Peageant Of The Seasons, R. S. Pandit, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.525197. Sometimes his authorship has been challenged on the grounds of weak poetic imagination. As an example, here is verse 1.4 of Grishma, where the lovers are struggling against the heat: : To relieve their lovers of heat, : Women make them lie : On their girdled, round hips covered with silken robes, or : On their sandal anointed breasts : Heavy with ornaments. : They seek help from fragrant flowers : Set in coiffures after a bath, : To intoxicate and delight their lovers. Of these verses (4-9 of Grishma canto) the Mysore scholar K. Krishnamurthy says: : The sensuality and cloying love depicted in these verses is such that it cannot bring fame to any poet.Kalidasa, K. Krishnamoorthy, Sahitya Akademi 1994 However, others have cited the primacy of shringara rasa (considered as a primeval source for other rasas), and also the balance the poet seeks to achieve by setting the lovers against the background of nature, as redeeming features of the work. Simple evocations of changing seasons intersperse the more colorful ones: The summer scorched forest is thrilled with joy at the touch of new showers, A new pleasure sprouts on the Kadamba trees, and every branch shakes in a gaiety unexplained,. Every flower of Ketaki is blossomed as if the forest has laughed. And peacocks dance with a precipitate joy(Canto 2)https://archive.org/details/ritusamharakalidasarangeyaraghav_202003_110_J/page/n9/mode/2up Cooled by the touch of fresh drops of water, And perfumed by the flower laden fragrant Lasak trees Aye! scented sweet by the Ketaki pollen, the pleasing wind enraptures the lovelorn women.(Canto 2)https://archive.org/details/ritusamharakalidasarangeyaraghav_202003_110_J/page/n9/mode/2up.

Most of the victims of the heat wave were elderly poor residents of the city, who could not afford air conditioning and did not open windows or sleep outside for fear of crime. The heat wave also heavily impacted the wider Midwestern region, with additional deaths in both St. Louis, Missouri and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Weather  High pressure up traps heat near the ground, forming a heat wave The temperatures soared to record highs in July with the hottest weather occurring from July 12 to July 16. The high of on July 13 was the second warmest July temperature (warmest being set on July 23, 1934) since records began at Chicago Midway International Airport in 1928. Nighttime low temperatures were unusually high ‚Äî in the upper 70s and lower 80s ¬∞F (about 26 ¬∞C). Plotted observed temperatures from O'Hare International Airport. Red Lines are daily max temperatures, Blue Lines are daily minimum temperatures, and the Black Line is the July 1960‚Äì2016 mean temperature. The humidity made a large difference for the heat in this heat wave when compared to the majority of those of the 1930s, 1988, 1976‚Äì78 and 1954‚Äì56, which were powered by extremely hot, dry, bare soil and/or air masses which had originated in the desert Southwest. Each of the above-mentioned years' summers did have high-humidity heat waves as well, although 1988 was a possible exception in some areas. Moisture from previous rains and transpiration by plants drove up the humidity to record levels and the moist humid air mass originated over Iowa previous to and during the early stages of the heat wave. Numerous stations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and elsewhere reported record dew point temperatures above with a peak at with an air temperature of making for a heat index reported from at least one station in Wisconsin (Appleton) at 5:00 pm local time on the afternoon of 14 July 1995, a probable record for the Western Hemisphere; this added to the heat to cause heat indices above in Iowa and southern Wisconsin on several days of the heat wave as the sun bore down from a cloudless sky and evaporated even more water seven days in a row. A few days after, the heat moved to the east, with temperatures in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania reaching and in Danbury, Connecticut, which is Connecticut's highest recorded temperature. North of the border, Toronto, Ontario reached , when coupled with record high humidity from the same airmass resulted in its highest ever humidex value of 50. Dewpoint records are not as widely kept as those of temperature, however, the dew points during the heat wave were at or near national and continental records. link=2-meter temperature (colors) and 500 hPa geopotential heights (contours) for the United States on 1995-07-13 20:00 UTC in the MERRA-2 reanalysis = Analysis = The heat wave was caused by a large high pressure system that traversed across the midwest United States. This system was consistently producing maximum temperatures in the 90's (¬∞F / 32-38 ¬∞C) during the day with minimum temperatures still remaining as high as the 80s (~ 31 ¬∞C) at night, which is abnormal for midwest summer months. The system also brought extremely low wind speeds, along with high humidity. In the MERRA-2 and the ERAI meteorological reanalyses, the system (see figure) moved eastward, becoming indistinguishable by July 18.  Victims  Eric Klinenberg, author of the 2002 book Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago, has noted that the map of heat-related deaths in Chicago mirrors the map of poverty. Most of the heat wave victims were the elderly poor living in the heart of the city, who either had no working air conditioning or could not afford to turn it on. Many older citizens were also hesitant to open windows and doors at night for fear of crime. Elderly women, who may have been more socially engaged, were less vulnerable than elderly men. By contrast, during the heat waves of the 1930s, many residents slept outside in the parks or along the shore of Lake Michigan. Because of the nature of the disaster, and the slow response of authorities to recognize it, no official \\"death toll\\" has been determined. However, figures show that 739 additional people died in that particular week above the usual weekly average. Further epidemiologic analysis showed that blacks were more likely to die than whites, and that Hispanics had an unusually low death rate due to heat. At the time, many blacks lived in areas of sub-standard housing and less cohesive neighborhoods, while Hispanics at the time lived in places with higher population density, and more social cohesion. Mortality displacement refers to the deaths that occur during a heat wave that would have occurred anyway in a near future, but which were precipitated by the heat wave itself. In other words, people who are already very ill and close to death (expected to die, for instance, within days or a few weeks) might die sooner than they might have otherwise, because of the impact of the heat wave on their health. However, because their deaths have been hastened by the heat wave, in the months that follow the number of deaths becomes lower than average. This is also called a harvesting effect, in which part of the expected (future) mortality shifts forward a few weeks to the period of the heat wave. Initially some public officials suggested that the high death toll during the weeks of the heat wave was due to mortality displacement; an analysis of the data later found that mortality displacement during the heat wave was limited to about 26% of the estimated 692 excess deaths in the period between June 21 and August 10, 1995. Mortality risks affected Blacks disproportionally. Appropriately targeted interventions may have a tangible effect on life expectancy. In August, the remains of forty-one victims whose bodies had not been claimed were buried in a mass grave in Homewood, Illinois.  Aggravating factors  Impacts in the Chicago urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than . Urban heat islands are caused by the concentration of buildings and pavement in urban areas, which tend to absorb more heat in the day and radiate more of that heat at night into their immediate surroundings than comparable rural sites. Therefore, built-up areas get hotter and stay hotter. Other aggravating factors were inadequate warnings, power failures, inadequate ambulance service and hospital facilities, and lack of preparation. City officials did not release a heat emergency warning until the last day of the heat wave. Thus, such emergency measures as Chicago's five cooling centers were not fully utilized. The medical system of Chicago was severely taxed as thousands were taken to local hospitals with heat-related problems. Another powerful factor in the heat wave was that a temperature inversion grew over the city, and air stagnated in this situation. Pollutants and humidity were confined to ground level, and the air was becalmed and devoid of wind. Without wind to stir the air, temperatures grew even hotter than could be expected with just an urban heat island, and without wind there was truly no relief. Without any way to relieve the heat, even the insides of homes became ovens, with indoor temperature exceeding at night. This was especially noticeable in areas which experienced frequent power outages. At Northwestern University just north of Chicago, summer school students lived in dormitories without air conditioning. In order to ease the effects of the heat, some of the students slept at night with water-soaked towels as blankets. The scale of the human tragedy sparked denial in some quarters, grief and blame elsewhere. From the moment the local medical examiner began to report heat-related mortality figures, political leaders, journalists, and in turn the Chicago public have actively denied the disaster's significance. Although so many city residents died that the coroner had to call in nine refrigerated trucks to store the bodies, skepticism about the trauma continues today. In Chicago, people still debate whether the medical examiner exaggerated the numbers and wonder if the crisis was a \\"media event.\\" The American Journal of Public Health established that the medical examiner's numbers actually undercounted the mortality by about 250 since hundreds of bodies were buried before they could be autopsied.

In the centre is the Ch√¢teau d'If. The mistral (, , , , Corsican: Maestral) is a strong, cold, northwesterly wind that blows from southern France into the Gulf of Lion in the northern Mediterranean.

See also definition of Meteo France on their website and the U.S. Navy Marine Meteorology site, which describe the mistral as a strong, cold northwesterly wind It affects the northeast of the plain of Languedoc and Provence to the east of Toulon, where it is felt as a strong west wind. It has a major influence all along the Mediterranean coast of France, and often causes sudden storms in the Mediterranean between Corsica and the Balearic Islands.Definition from the Website of Meteo France, the national weather service of the French government. (see external links.) The name mistral comes from the Languedoc dialect of the Occitan and means \\"masterly\\". The same wind is called mistrau in the Proven√ßal variant of Occitan, mestral in Catalan, maestrale in Italian and Corsican, maistr√†le or bentu maestru in Sardinian, and majjistral in Maltese. The mistral is usually accompanied by clear, fresh weather, and it plays an important role in creating the climate of Provence. It can reach speeds of more than / , particularly in the Rh√¥ne Valley. Its average speed during the day can reach about / , calming noticeably at night. The mistral usually blows in winter or spring, though it occurs in all seasons. It sometimes lasts only one or two days, frequently lasts several days, and sometimes lasts more than a week.Internet site of Meteo France, article on the mistral.  Cause  A map showing the force of the mistral one day in November 2008. The wind reached a speed of , with average speeds of more than an hour near Marseille. The mistral takes place each time there is an anticyclone, or area of high pressure, in the Bay of Biscay, and an area of low pressure around the Gulf of Genoa. When this happens, the flow of air between the high and low pressure areas draws in a current of cold air from the north which accelerates through the lower elevations between the foothills of the Alps and the Cevennes. The conditions for a mistral are even more favorable when a cold rainy front has crossed France from the northwest to the southeast as far as the Mediterranean. This cold, dry wind usually causes a period of cloudless skies and luminous sunshine, which gives the mistral its reputation for making the sky especially clear. There is also, however, the mistral noir, which brings clouds and rain. The mistral noir occurs when the Azores High is extended and draws in unusually moist air from the northwest. The long and enclosed shape of the Rh√¥ne Valley, and the Venturi effect of funnelling the air through a narrowing space, is frequently cited as the reason for the speed and force of the mistral, but the reasons are apparently more complex. The mistral reaches its maximum speed not at the narrowest part of the Rh√¥ne Valley, south of Valence, but much farther south, where the Valley has widened. Also, the wind occurs not just in the Valley, but high above in the atmosphere, up to the troposphere, above the earth. The mistral is very strong at the summit of Mont Ventoux, 1900 meters in elevation, though the plain below is very wide. Other contributing factors to the strength of the mistral are the accumulation of masses of cold air, whose volume is greater, pouring down the mountains and valleys to the lower elevations. This is similar to a foehn wind, but unlike a foehn wind the descent in altitude does not significantly warm the mistral. The causes and characteristics of the mistral are very similar to those of the Tramontane, another wind of the French Mediterranean region.Site of Meteo France The bell tower of the hilltop village of La Cadi√®re-d'Azur is open, which allows the mistral to pass through. In France, the mistral particularly affects Provence, Languedoc east of Montpellier, as well as all of the Rh√¥ne Valley from Lyon to Marseille, and as far southeast as Corsica and Sardinia. The mistral usually blows from the north or northwest, but in certain pre-alpine valleys and along the C√¥te d'Azur, the wind is channelled by the mountains so that it blows from east to west. Sometimes it also blows from the north-north-east toward the east of Languedoc as far as Cap B√©ar. Frequently, the mistral will affect only one part of the region. In the Languedoc area, where the tramontane is the strongest wind, the mistral and the tramontane blow together onto the Gulf of Lion and the northwest of the western Mediterranean, and can be felt to the east of the Balearic Islands, in Sardinia, and sometimes as far as the coast of Africa. When the mistral blows from the west, the mass of air is not so cold and the wind only affects the plain of the Rh√¥ne delta and the C√¥te d'Azur. The good weather is confined to the coast of the Mediterranean, while it can rain in the interior. The C√¥te d'Azur generally has a clear sky and warmer temperatures. This type of mistral usually blows for no more than one to three days. The mistral originating from the northeast has a very different character; it is felt only in the west of Provence and as far as Montpellier, with the wind coming from either a northerly or north-northeasterly direction. In the winter this is by far the coldest form of the mistral. The wind can blow for more than a week. This kind of mistral is often connected with a low pressure area in the Gulf of Genoa, and it can bring unstable weather to the C√¥te d'Azur and the east of Provence, sometimes bringing heavy snow to low altitudes in winter. When the flow of air comes from the northeast due to a widespread low pressure area over the Atlantic and atmospheric disturbances over France, the air is even colder at both high altitudes and ground level, and the mistral is even stronger, and the weather worse, with the creation of cumulus clouds bringing weak storms. This kind of mistral is weaker in the east of Provence and the C√¥te d'Azur. The mistral is not always synonymous with clear skies. When a low pressure front over the Mediterranean approaches the coast from the southeast, the weather can change quickly for the worse, and the mistral and its clear sky changes rapidly to an east wind bringing humid air and threatening clouds. The position of the low-pressure front creates a flow of air from the northwest or the northeast, channeled through the Rh√¥ne Valley. If this low-pressure area moves back toward the southeast, the mistral will quickly clear the air and the good weather will return; but if the cold-weather front continues to approach the land, bad weather will continue for several days in the entire Mediterranean basin, sometimes transforming into what French meteorologists call an √©pisode c√©venol, a succession of torrential rains and floods, particularly in the areas west of the Rh√¥ne Valley: the Ard√®che, the Gard, H√©rault and Loz√®re.Jean Vialar, Les vents r√©gionaux et locaux, 1948, republished by M√©t√©o-France in 2003 The summer mistral, unlike the others, is created by purely local conditions. It usually happens in July, and only in the valley of the Rh√¥ne and on the coast of Provence. It is caused by a thermal depression over the interior of Provence (The Var and Alpes de Haute-Provence), created when the land is overheated. This creates a flow of air from the north toward the east of Provence. This wind is frequently cancelled out close to the coast by the breezes from the sea. It does not blow for more than a single day, but it is feared in Provence, because it dries the vegetation and it can spread forest fires.  Effects  Schematic diagram of mistral wind occurrence in Europe. The mistral helps explain the unusually sunny climate (2700 to 2900 hours of sunshine a year) and clarity of the air of Provence. When other parts of France have clouds and storms, Provence is rarely affected for long, since the mistral quickly clears the sky. In less than two hours, the sky can change from completely covered to completely clear. The mistral also blows away the dust, and makes the air particularly clear, so that during the mistral it is possible to see mountains and farther away. This clarity of the air and light is one of the features that attracted many French impressionist and post- impressionist artists to the South of France. The mistral has the reputation of bringing good health, since the dry air dries stagnant water and the mud, giving the mistral the local name mange-fange (Eng. \\"mud-eater\\"). It also blows away pollution from the skies over the large cities and industrial areas. The sunshine and dryness brought by the mistral have an important effect on the local vegetation. The vegetation in Provence, which is already dry because of the small amount of rainfall, is made even drier by the wind, which makes it particularly susceptible to fires, which the wind spreads very rapidly, sometimes devastating vast expanses of mountainside before being extinguished. During the summer, thousands of hectares can burn when the mistral is blowing. In the Rh√¥ne Valley and on the plain of la Crau, the regularity and force of the mistral causes the trees to grow leaning to the south. Once the forest has been razed by fire, the strong wind makes it difficult for new trees to grow. The farmers of the Rh√¥ne Valley have long planted rows of cypress trees to shelter their crops from the dry force of the mistral. The mistral can also have beneficial effects‚Äîthe moving air can save crops from the spring frost, which can last until the end of April. As summer visitors to the beach in Provence learn, the summer mistral can quickly lower the temperature of the sea, as the wind pushes the warm water near the surface out to sea and it is replaced by colder water from greater depths. = The effects of the mistral beyond France = Oak bent to the south by the mistral in Sardinia The mistral regularly affects the weather in Sardinia and sometimes also affects the weather in North Africa, Sicily and Malta and other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly when low-pressure areas form in the Gulf of Genoa. The winds create a physically cold, salty ocean body that sinks in the Gulf of Lion when certain weather conditions are present.Wunsch, Carl. (2015). Modern Observational Physical Oceanography: Understanding the Global Ocean. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 273. .  Maestral or maestro in the Adriatic  Similar names‚Äîmaestral or maestro‚Äîare used for (although also mostly northwestern) a quite different wind in the Adriatic Sea. It is an anabatic sea-breeze wind which blows in the summer when the east Adriatic coast gets warmer than the sea. It is thus a mild sea-to-coast wind, unlike the mistral. The strong katabatic wind there is the northeastern bora. In Greece it is also known as ma√Østros or ma√Østr√°li and south-western Crete it is considered the most beneficial wind, said to blow only in daytime.  In Proven√ßal culture  santon, or Christmas creche figure, from Arles, facing the mistral The mistral played an important part in the life and culture of Provence from the beginning. Excavations at the prehistoric site called Terra Amata, at the foot of Mount Boron in Nice, showed that in about 40,000 B.C. the inhabitants had built a low wall of rocks and beach stones to the northwest of their fireplace to protect their fire from the power of the mistral.Henry de Lumley, :La Grande Histoire des premiers hommes europeens, Odile Jacob publishers, 2007. Pg. 225. The mas (farmhouse) traditionally faces south, with its back to the mistral. The bell towers of villages in Provence are often open iron frameworks, which allow the wind to pass through. The traditional Proven√ßal Nativity scene usually includes a figure of a shepherd holding his hat, with his cloak blowing in the mistral. A F√™te du Vent (Festival of Wind) is held periodically on the Prado Beach in Marseille.

Polyenes are poly-unsaturated organic compounds that contain at least three alternating double and single carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds. These carbon‚Äìcarbon double bonds interact in a process known as conjugation resulting in some unusual optical properties. Related to polyenes are dienes, where there are only two alternating double and single bonds. The following polyenes are used as antibiotics for humans: amphotericin B, nystatin, candicidin, pimaricin, methyl partricin, and trichomycin. The polyene carotene is responsible for the orange colour of carrots. Optical properties Some polyenes are brightly colored, an otherwise rare property for a hydrocarbon. Normally alkenes absorb in the ultraviolet region of a spectrum, but the absorption energy state of polyenes with numerous conjugated double bonds can be lowered such that they enter the visible region of the spectrum, resulting in compounds which are coloured (because they contain a chromophore). Thus many natural dyes contain linear polyenes, e.g. beta-carotene, which is responsible for the color of carrots.  Chemical and electrical properties  Polyenes tend to be more reactive than simpler alkenes. For example, polyene-containing triglycerides are reactive towards atmospheric oxygen. Polyacetylene, which partially oxidized or reduced, exhibits high electrical conductivity. Most conductive polymers are polyenes, and many have conjugated structures. Occurrence A few fatty acids are polyenes. Another class of important polyenes are polyene antimycotics, File:Amphotericin B new.svgAmphotericin B is an example of a polyene antifungal (antimycotic) agent.Torrado, J.

Jack Foley, in his Introduction to Sward's Collected Poems, 1957‚Äì2004 (Black Moss Press, 2004) calls him, \\"in truth, a citizen, at heart, of both countries. At once a Canadian and American poet, one with a foot in both worlds, Sward also inhabits an enormous in-between.\\" Or, as Rainer Maria Rilke puts it, \\"Every artist is born in an alien country; he has a homeland nowhere but within his own borders.\\" Early years Born in 1933 and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Sward began writing poetry at the age of 15 when he became involved with a street gang and used rhyming couplets in his notes to the other gang members. He graduated from Von Steuben High School at 17 and quit his job as a soda jerk in a pharmacy to join the United States Navy. In 1952 he was stationed in Korea on an amphibious ship, LST 914. A Yeoman 3rd Class, Sward soon became the head of the ship's library, while serving in the combat zone during the Korean War. University He has taught at Cornell University, 1964‚Äì65, where he first experimented with computer-generated poetry and served on the editorial board of Epoch. He went on to teach at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, the University of Victoria, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. Working in media In the 1980s he worked for the CBC, where he interviewed and produced 60-minute radio features on Leonard Cohen, Margaret Atwood, Earle Birney, John Robert Colombo, Al Purdy, Gwendolyn MacEwen, and other leading Canadian figures. His Quill & Quire interview with Nobel prize winner, Saul Bellow, was widely read. Sward also worked as journalist, book reviewer and feature writer for The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, and The Financial Times in Toronto, Ontario while living on the Toronto Islands. He received a Canada Council grant to research and write The Toronto Islands (1983), a best- selling (Source: Dreadnaught Press publisher, 1983) illustrated history of a unique community, from prehistoric times to the present. Awards A Fulbright Scholar and Guggenheim Fellow, he was chosen by Lucille Clifton to receive a Villa Montalvo Literary Arts Award and is the author of 30 books of poetry, fiction and nonfiction. He has been published widely in numerous anthologies and traditional literary magazines, such as The New Yorker, Poetry Chicago, and The Hudson Review. Sward later worked as technical writer and editor for Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), and served as \\"bridge person\\" between traditional hard copy academic periodicals and literary eZines. In September 2016, at Second Annual Voices of the River Poetry Celebration, supported by a grant from Arts Council Santa Cruz County, sponsored by Bookshop Santa Cruz, Poetry Santa Cruz and the Coastal Watershed Council, Robert Sward was named Poet Laureate of Santa Cruz County, 2016‚Äì2018. The preceding Poets Laureate included Gary Young, David Swanger and Ellen Bass Internet publishing He began publishing on the Internet in the late 1980s and early 90s with appearances in Alsop Review, Blue Moon Review, Web de Sol, X-Connect, eSCENE, Fiction Online, Hawk, Realpoetik, and Zero City. His essay, \\"Why I Publish in e-Zines\\", appeared online in 1995 and has been widely reprinted.

It was followed by Kissing the Dancer (Cornell University Press, 1964), with an Introduction by Pulitzer Prize poet William Meredith. The Carleton Miscellany reviewed the book saying, \\"In the animal poems there is a bravery in the face of our limitations, a warmth for our absurdities, a way of life to be gleaned from our failings and ineptitudes... a self-critique that turns our freakishness into an ironic source of fulfillment and transcendence.\\" Source: Theodore Holmes in \\"The Carleton Miscellany\\" 1964. The poem, \\"Uncle Dog: The Poet At 9\\", has been frequently anthologized and Sward continues to write about exotic animals and dogs in particular. Animated videos of these works (mini-movies with poetry) employ avatars, digital representations of the poet and his subjects, and appear in DVD format and online at Blue's Cruzio Cafe. A key theme in his most recent books, Rosicrucian in the Basement (2001), Heavenly Sex (2002), The Collected Poems, 1957‚Äì2004 (2004), and God is in the Cracks (2006), is fathers and sons. Sward's father, Dr. Irving M. Sward, was a podiatrist and something of a mystic, combining his practice of Rosicrucianism with a study of the Kabbalah. Of Rosicrucian in the Basement, Robert Bly writes, 'There are many mysteries between father and son that people don't talk about... There's much leaping [in Sward's poetry], but each line, so to speak, steps on something solid.' In commenting on the father and son series Dana Gioia adds, \\"The CD is terrific...

As a young man, he joined the Albanian nationalist League of Prizren and participated in a battle against Ottoman forces. After this, he was temporarily loyal to the Ottoman sultan and built a power base in the Mitrovica area. He served as the commander of Ottoman palace guards in Istanbul for four years (1902‚Äì06), returning with a land grant, officer rank and the command of the local militia. In 1909 he and other Kosovo Albanian chieftains revolted against the Young Turk imposition of taxes on Muslims. Next, he took an important role in the 1910 revolt against Ottoman rule, while in the First Balkan War (1912) negotiated with both sides, then fought against the Montenegrin and Serbian armies in Kosovo. He participated in the Albanian Declaration of Independence in Vlor√´ (November 1912), and was then assigned as a diplomatic agent to the British (1913), and bodyguard of Prince William of Albania (1914). He was killed during a shoot-out in Podgorica under unclear circumstances in January 1916.  Biography  = Life = Isa Boletini was born in the village of Boletin near Mitrovi√ßa (Mitrovica), Ottoman Empire. Isa's family had migrated to Boletin from the village of Istiniƒá near De√ßan, due to a blood feud (gjakmarrja) though it ultimately hailed from Shala, in northern Albania. They adopted the surname Boletini (\\"of Boletin\\"). The Shala were the poorest tribe of Albania with a small exception of around 400 families who lived in Istiniƒá. They were in conflict with the Gashi tribe until they made peace in August 1879 on the sultan's orders. = Family = View of the \\"Isa Boletini Complex\\", and ruins of the original family house. Boletini had several sons, who are mentioned in 1924 as living with their women and other relatives in Boletini's kula (that had been destroyed by Ottoman artillery several times) near the Sokolica Monastery \\"as though feudal lords, frugally and ceremoniously, but with endlessly less authority\\". His son Mustafa was a rebel leader in the Balkan Wars. On 27 July 1936, his grandson, Ismet, was knife stabbed by two Albanian criminals while protecting his friends, three Serbs, in Kosovska Mitrovica. = Death = There are different stories about his death in Podgorica on 23 or 24 January 1916: *Boletini became seriously ill while defending Scutari, and in order to not be taken by the Montenegrins he sought to ask for protection at the French consulate in Cetinje. He was arrested in the Cetinje Hotel and immediately interred in Nik≈°iƒá, then in Podgorica. During the entering of the Austro-Hungarian army and chaos in Podgorica, the Montenegrin gendarmerie killed Boletini, his two sons, two grandsons, son-in-law, nephew and two loyal fellows, on the bridge over the Moraƒça river on 23 January 1916. It was believed that he went to meet the Austro-Hungarian army. According to the Albanian newspapers, the unit of Montenegrin Gendarmerie that killed Boletini was under command of Savo Lazareviƒá. *Historian Bogumil Hrabak mentioned that his death occurred \\"in the stir which he provoked with his threats that he would take over the city\\". *Owen Pearson claims that on 24 January 1916 he was killed while \\"virtually a prisoner\\" in Podgorica, after a dispute provoked by the Montenegrins led to fighting in the town. He managed to kill eight before he died. *A Belgrade press claimed that upon the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Montenegro, when citizens were to hand over weapons to the authorities, Isa Boletini, his son and six friends refused, entered the town courtroom where people had gathered, and tried to encourage them to resist the occupation, then shot a Montenegrin writer and two police officers (panduri). A manhunt followed, in which Boletini was killed.  Career  = 1878‚Äì1907 = After the rise of the Albanian nationalist League of Prizren (1878), he took part as a young man in the Battle of Slivova against Ottoman forces on 22 April 1881. Isa built a power base in his hometown and illegally seized property from fellow Muslims. By 1898‚Äì99, he received money for protecting the Serbian Orthodox community in the Mitrovica region, and was rewarded with a medal and supply of weapons by the Kingdom of Serbia. The Sokolica Monastery, located between Albanian villages, was protected by brothers Ahmed and Isa, who lived 800m and 100m, respectively, from the monastery. It was stated in 1899, by Serbian consul in Pristina Svetislav Simiƒá, that \\"not one Serb fell from his rifle, and where the power of his martini reached, the rayah was completely free from zulum\\". The time after 1900 was increasingly marked by ethnic tensions. Boletini and friend, ca. 1900. In the summer of 1901, organised atrocities on Serbs in Ibarski Kola≈°in were carried out under the command of Boletini, including massacres, rape, blackmail, looting and eviction of local ethnic Serbs. An earlier Ottoman investigation had uncovered arms smuggling from Serbia to Ibarski Kola≈°in, sent to protect the local Serb population from atrocities (constant since the 1897 war). The events led to Russia opening a consulate in Mitrovi√ßa (Mitrovica) on May 7, 1902. Schterbina was appointed consul. Boletini threatened that all Serb houses would be set upon fire if they worked with the consulate ‚Äì the consul could not enter Mitrovica until the Porte sent for Boletini to Istanbul. It is reported on 29 September, according to an Ottoman source, that Boletini had given himself up to the authorities, was to be pardoned and used by the Ottomans against Mustafa Aga and his supporters. He is reported on 24 November 1902 as having arrived in Istanbul. Four days later it was reported that the Porte promised to not return Boletini to Mitrovica, and that Schterbina was soon to arrive to the consulate. Sultan Abdul Hamid II, instead of crushing Boletini, brought him to Istanbul and appointed him head of the palace guard (t√ºfenkciler). To govern the sultan used patronage networks by awarding privileges and government positions to co opt local charismatic leaders such as Boletini into the Ottoman system. On 11 March 1903, the Porte denied that it planned to return Isa Boletini back to Mitrovica. Schterbina did not survive his assassination attempt on 31 May, during an Albanian riot, and died of his gunshot wounds in April 1903. After serving as the head of the Ottoman palace guard for four years, he returned to Kosovo with an imperial land grant and officer rank in the local Ottoman militia in March 1906. He was now the most famous and richest Albanian in Mitrovica. Boletini assembled a band of armed retainers and resumed his role as a local \\"protector\\". Weapons and financial assistance came from Serbia and Boletini also had a direct telegraph line to the Yildiz Palace functioning as the sultan's policeman in the region. = 1908‚Äì1911 = Isa Boletini and his men in 1911 During the Young Turk revolution (1908), a large gathering in Firzovik (Ferizaj) of local urban notables and Muslim clergy (ulema) backed restoration of the constitution while Boletini on the side of the chieftains viewed that position as disloyalty to the sultan. He withdrew his forces before a decision could be made realising the weakness of his position. During the revolution, rumors of the time had it that Abdul Hamid II asked Boletini for assistance to disperse the Firzovik gathering. He was loyal to the sultan though in 1908 Boletini had given his initial support to the Young Turks and later fought against their government. Boletini was deputy of Kosovo in the Ottoman Assembly between 1908 and 1912. The Committee of Union and Progress, within a month of the restoration of the constitution, decided to address blood feuding matters in Kosovo, sentencing Albanians engaged in killings. Toward the end of 1908 aggressive measures was pushed by locals ‚Äì Nexhip Draga and other notables in Kosovo viewed Isa Boletini as a nuisance, threat and loyalist of sultan Abdulhamid II and lobbied the new Young Turk (CUP) government for his arrest and destruction of his kulla (tower house). Class differences of Draga, a landowner wanting law and order and Boletini, a chieftain preferring maintenance of old privileges and autonomy along with the disagreement in Firzovik about the restoration of the constitution resulted in the rift. Unable to convince CUP members in Mitrovica to take action, Draga traveled to Salonika and pleaded his case to the local CUP committee who approved and got the Ottoman government to act against Boletini. The Ottoman government needing a pretext for action sent an officer with some soldiers to serve a court order to Boletini for illegally receiving land from the sultan that previously belonged to a local named Haxhi Ali. Boletini scoffed at the charges, cursed the Young Turk revolution and threw the Ottoman authorities out. Ottoman forces arrived at his stronghold shortly after, resulting in an attack and fierce firefight with Boletini escaping with a small group of men and his kulla was razed to the ground. Local Ottoman authorities like the mutasarrif of ƒ∞pek (Pej√´) advised the Young Turk government against action on Boletini on grounds it could produce larger troubles for the state and instead advocated for a show of force to make local chieftains submit. After the events with Boletini, the Ottoman army then went throughout Kosovo and razed other kullas of several chieftains involved in the deruhdecilik (protection \\"racket\\") system. During the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, Boletini along with several Kosovo Albanian chieftains offered the sultan military assistance. On 15 May 1909, the Young Turks, continuing their former policy of denying the Albanians national rights, sent a military expedition to the Kosovo Vilayet to stop the growth of hostile attitudes to the government and break resistance of the peasants, who refused to pay taxes which Istanbul had introduced. Cavid Pasha, the new commander of the division at Mitrovi√ßa, was ordered to carry out a succession of military operations against the Albanian mountaineers, in particular the capture of Boletini. The Young Turks expressed the view through their newspaper Tanin that most Albanians of the area had given their besa (pledge) not to go against the government apart from Boletini and a few supporters. Ottoman authorities placed a reward of 300 liras on Boletini for his capture. On account of the attempts of the authorities to collect taxes which hitherto had been paid almost entirely by the Christians, serious disturbances broke out among the war-like Muslim tribes of northern Albania. Isa Boletini, a prominent leader often honoured by the Sultan, and other chiefs of Pej√´ and Yakova (Gjakov√´), attacked the Ottoman army, and numerous fights led to much bloodshed, the Ottoman army also bombarding several villages. Boletini led fighting in Pristina, Prizren and elsewhere. Boletini took an important role in the Albanian Revolt of 1910. Early in 1910, he visited the Albanian highlanders who had fled into Montenegro where they were given additional weapons by King Nikolla. In Kosovo at ƒ∞pek, Boletini and the heads of twelve Albanian highland clans agreed for joint action against the Ottomans. Kosovo Albanians went on the offensive and with 2,000 men Boletini attacked Firzovik and Prizren. He resisted the Ottoman army at Crnoljeva (Caraleva) for two days. Boletini later escaped as the Ottomans put down the rebellion. In 1910, Nopcsa named him and the earlier Ali Pasha Draga the leading Albanian figures in Mitrovica. In 1910‚Äì11, the Montenegrin government encouraged northern Albanian tribes (Malissori) to revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Apart from the Catholic Malissori, also some Kosovo Albanian leaders were approached, among these were Boletini. Boletini intended to use Montenegro as a base for incursions into Ottoman Albania. At first, Montenegro ignored his presence, but on 15 June, after numerous protests from the Ottoman ambassador, escorted Boletini and his thirteen followers away from the Albanian border. = 1912 = Boletini's revolver, at the National Museum of Albania. Isa Boletini and Ismail Qemali in Vlore. In the prelude to revolt, the Serbian government worked with some Albanian guerilla bands to be in position of creating difficulties if the moment required it and to that end courted Isa Boletini through the Serb terrorist organisation the Black Hand. On April 23, Hasan Prishtina's rebels revolted in the Yakova mountains, which then spread. By 20 May, Boletini alongside other Albanian leaders were present at a meeting in Junik where a besa (pledge) was given to wage war on the Young Turk government through armed insurrection in Kosovo Vilayet. In springtime 1912, Boletini led a revolt in Kosovo, with surprising victories after victories against the Turks. During the 1912 uprising, while waiting for an Ottoman response to the demands of the rebels, Boletini and other leaders of the rebellion ordered their forces to advance toward √úsk√ºb (modern Skopje) which was captured during August 12‚Äì15. Albanian irregulars then threatened to march on Bitola and Thessaloniki, and the Ottomans sent troops against the rebels, who retired to the mountains but continued to protest against the government, and in the whole region between ƒ∞pek and Mitrovica they plundered military depots, opened prisons and collected taxes from the inhabitants for the Albanian chiefs. On August 18, the moderate faction led by Prishtina managed to convince Boletini, and other leaders Idriz Seferi, Bajram Curri and Riza Bey Gjakova of the conservative group to accept the agreement with the Ottomans for Albanian sociopolitical and cultural rights. The Ottomans then agreed on concessions that promised autonomy for the Albanian-inhabited vilayets of Kosovo, Scutari, Yanina and part of Monastir (Bitola). On 18 August 1912, the Porte replied that it was ready to concede a series of economic, political, administrative and cultural rights, but no formal autonomy. The Albanian side accepted, abandoned further national claims, and had Boletini pacified and returned to his home. The Ottoman side accepted on 4 September. This created a virtually autonomous Albanian state. While Muslim Kosovo Albanians were pleased, the Balkan neighbours and Catholic Albanians were not. The Balkan states envisaged the partition of Albania between them, and thus hastened to precipitate war. Montenegro won over the Malissori, supporting an autonomous northern Albanian Catholic entity. In August, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá \\"Apis\\", the head of the Serbian Black Hand organisation, sent a letter requesting Boletini and his men to assist the Serbs in fighting the Ottomans. The Black Hand stimulated and encouraged the Kosovo Albanians in their revolt, promising them help; Colonel Apis visited northern Albania several times in order to get in touch with the leaders of the Albanian uprising, especially Isa Boletini. Apis declared that the Serbs only wanted to liberate the Albanians from Ottoman subjection, and that the Serbs and Albanians both would benefit from liberating the country. Succeeding in persuading the Kosovo Albanians to fight against the Ottomans, however, Apis and his men committed political murders disguised as Albanians, and eventually the Montenegrin and Serbian armies massacred Albanians, and stopped the inflow of arms to the Albanians, in early September 1912. = Balkan Wars = Isa Boletini in the city of Vlor√´ (1912) In the beginning of the First Balkan War, the Ottoman army was supported by some Albanian volunteers and irregulars; the Ottoman authorities supplied Isa Boletini's men with 65,000 rifles and to protect Albanian lands within the empire he fought by their side which disappointed Serbia. It was reported in the Serbian press that during the surrender of Albanian rebels at Lum√´ on 16 November 1912, that Boletini and his men had managed to escape. On 28 November 1912 in Vlora the Albanian National Assembly proclaimed independence. Ismail Qemali refused to wait for Isa Boletini and other Albanian leaders of the Kosovo Vilayet and hastily made the declaration. The southern elite wanted to prevent Boletini's plans to assert himself as a key political figure and used him to suite their military needs. Isa Boletini contributed in the protection of Vlora government, while later was part of the Albanian delegation to the London Conference (1913) together with Ismail Qemali, Albanian head of government. The Albanian delegation wanted a Kosovo within the borders of the newly founded state of Albania, however the Great Powers said no and ceded the region to Serbia. In 1913, Boletini and Bajram Curri commanded rebels against the Serbian and Montenegrin armies. On 13 August 1913, an outbreak of hostilities took place on the Serbian-Albanian frontier. A tenacious Albanian band of fighters under the command of Isa Boletini, now Minister for War in the Provisional Government, made a successful attack on the frontier town of Debar and captured it from the small Serbian garrison, which had to retire after suffering severe losses. On 23 September 1913, the dissatisfaction of the Albanian population at finding themselves under Serbian rule led to an uprising in Macedonia of Albanian patriots who refused to accept the decision of the Ambassadors Conference on the Albanian borders. The Albanian government organised armed resistance to recover the lost areas and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces retook Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, in the direction of Ohrid, but another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. At Ohrid they set up a local government and held the hills towards Resen for four days. = 1914 = Prince Wilhelm, Isa Boletini, Duncan Heaton- Armstrong and Colonel Thomson in Durr√´s (1914). During the pro-Ottoman Muslim peasant uprising in central Albania which broke out in mid-May 1914, Isa Boletini and his troops defended Prince Wilhelm zu Wied. On 30 May, the loyalty of some northern Albanian tribes was unclear, however, the Lum√´ tribe was deemed to have been won over by the Albanian government, as they were under the influence of Isa Boletini and Bajram Curri, both having given their service to the government. It was reported on 5 June 1914 that the Mirdites and Malissori in Durazzo had fled and put down their weapons, and that also their leaders, among whom were Isa Boletini, had fled and stated that they were unfit to fight the more numerous enemy. The rebels had surrounded the town and stated that they would not withdraw until Prince Wilhelm left Durazzo; 300 Malissori were left dead and 250 wounded, out of whom 150 had drowned in the town's pond. When the revolt deteriorated in June 1914, Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, joined the Dutch International Gendarmerie in their fight against the pro-Ottoman rebels. It was reported on 28 June 1914 that Ismail Qemali arrived in Albania to impose order, with the plan of dividing the country into cantons: The northern parts, to the Mat river, managed by Prenk Bib Doda; the central Muslim parts, from the Mat to the Shkumbin, managed by Essad Pasha; from Shkumbin to Tepelena, Ismail Qemali; Orthodox parts, Zoografos. The next day Wilhelm held an assembly in Durazzo of notable Albanian citizens from across the country, numbering some 40, among whom were Prenk Bib Doda, Ismail Qemali and Isa Boletini. Some advised the Prince to ask the Great Powers for troops, others resisted that advice and instead advised to ask the Great Powers for guarantees for the Albanian borders set out in the London Conference of 1912‚Äì13. There were manifestations in support of Wilhelm, and Boletini is cited as having said: \\"Despite that we did not choose Prince Wilhelm, but Europe suggested him, we are today faithfully loyal to him, and in the case that Prince Wilhelm be forced to leave us, may no other receive that mandate, because Albanians are not children with whom you can play\\". The assembly was viewed of as successful, as the Muslim and Catholic representatives agreed to keep Prince Wilhelm. = World War I = During World War I, Boletini commanded guerrilla fighters against the Montenegrin and Serbian armies. On 20 October 1914, 1,000 Albanians, led by Bajram Curri, Isa Boletini, Bulgarian komite and Austrian officers, attacked a Montenegrin base near Djakovica, and took two hill artillery pieces with them. The Montenegrin army then surrounded and defeated them, and pushed them into Albanian territory.; On 23 June 1915, after Montenegrin forces entered Scutari, Isa Boletini and his men laid down their weapons and surrendered, traveling to Cetinje.  Legacy  Isa Boletini was tall, well-built, and strong, with great reputation, whose deeds of bravery and escapes from Turks and Serbs had become legends in Albania. He was noted for always wearing the traditional Albanian white cap (qeleshe) and national dress. He is considered one of Albania's greatest patriots and heroes. His ideas influenced the likes of Midhat Frash√´ri and prominent Albanian nationalists. During the airplane meeting in Podgorica on 24 June 1934, pilot Tadija Sondermajer wore a Montenegrin dress and the flintlock of Isa Boletini. In 2010, Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of the Republic of Kosova, awarded him the highest order, \\"Hero of Kosovo\\", along with Azem Galica, Shote Galica, Hasan Prishtina, and Bajram Curri. Isa Boletini statue in the centre of Mitrovica inaugurated during the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania. A statue of him was uncovered in Southern Mitrovica on the 100th anniversary of the Independence of Albania and Flag Day (28 November 2012). During the abandoned Serbia v Albania (UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying) match, on 14 October 2014, while the game was suspended, a small remote-controlled quadcopter drone with a flag suspended from it hovered over the stadium. The flag showed the faces of Ismail Qemali and Isa Boletini and a map of a Greater Albania. Boletini was killed in a fight in Montenegro in 1916 and buried in the capital Podgorica. In 1998, his remains were exhumed and brought to Mitrovica, where they were kept in the town's mosque. They were removed in 2011, largely for security reasons in Kosovo's troubled north, and sent to the department of forensics in Pristina, where they were kept until 2015. A decision to rebury Boletini in Vlore the city in which Albanian independence was proclaimed, made by Kosovo Foreign Minister Hashim Thaci and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, sparked negative reactions among Kosovo Albanians. The Boletini family first agreed to a reburial in Vlore but then refused. On 10 June 2015, Boletini was reburied at a ceremony in the village of Boletin. Hundreds of people attended the reburial which followed a public tribute at Mitrovica's football stadium. The honouring of Boletini was condemned by Serb minority MPs in Kosovo, who boycotted parliamentary session, calling it a provocation. The Isa Boletini Monument is a heroic statue of Isa Boletini in Shkod√´r, in northwestern Albania. It is high and was erected in 1986.  Quotes  *\\"When the spring comes, we will manure the plains of Kosovo with the bones of Serbs, for we Albanians have suffered too much to forget\\", 1913. *When Sir Edward Grey met Isa Boletini in London at the British Foreign Office after having his pistol belt's ammunition removed, he uttered: \\"General, the newspapers might record tomorrow that Isa Boletini, whom even Mahmut Shefqet Pasha could not disarm, was just disarmed in London.\\", upon which Isa replied \\"No, no, not in London either.\\", he then withdrew a second pistol from his pocket.

Constructed by building tycoon Minoru Mori, the mega-complex incorporates office space, apartments, shops, restaurants, caf√©s, movie theatres, a museum, a hotel, a major TV studio, an outdoor amphitheatre, and a few parks. The centerpiece is the 54-story Mori Tower. Mori's stated vision was to build an integrated development where high-rise inner-urban communities allow people to live, work, play, and shop in proximity to eliminate commuting time. He argued that this would increase leisure time, quality of life, and benefit Japan's national competitiveness. Seventeen years after the design's initial conception, the complex opened to the public on April 25, 2003. The architecture and use of space is documented in the book Six Strata: Roppongi Hills Redefined. The development Roppongi Hills cost over $4 billion and is built on a 27-acre (109,000 m¬≤) site. The site amalgamated more than 400 smaller lots Mori acquired over 14 years.Bremner, Brian. \\"Rethinking Tokyo.\\" BusinessWeek. November 4, 2002. Retrieved on May 11, 2009.

Artwork displayed at Tokyo‚Äôs Roppongi Hills: In 2005, the United Buddy Bears exhibition attracted 3 million visitors. The first six levels of Mori Tower contain retail stores and restaurants. The top six floors house the Mori Art Museum and the Tokyo City View with panoramic views of the city. A new exit from Roppongi Station empties into a glass atrium filled with large television screens and escalators, as well as several shops and restaurants. The rest of the building is office space. =Other buildings= Keyakizaka illumination Around the Mori Tower are several smaller buildings predominantly occupied by shops and restaurants, a cinema complex, and the Mori Garden. Behind the Mori Tower lies the Roppongi Keyakizaka Street which has cafes and luxury stores such as Louis Vuitton. Nearby are the four Roppongi Hills Residences towers, with a total of 793 luxurious and very expensive residential apartments. Large open spaces have been built into the design of Roppongi Hills. About half of the area consists of gardens, pavilions, and other open spaces. The Mohri Garden, an elaborate and authentic Japanese garden complete with a pond and trees is particularly popular. The Mohri Garden is a part of a lost mansion that housed members of the feudal Mohri clan. On Roppongi Hills the exhibition of the United Buddy Bears was shown in 2005 for the first time in Japan. The exhibition was opened by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Horst K√∂hler, together with the Prime Minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi. According to the Mori-Group, project partners in Tokyo, they were able to count three million visitors over the six weeks of the exhibition. The American School in Japan's Early Learning Center is housed in a residence building next to the Hills, the Roppongi Sakura-zaka Residence. A playground adjacent to the complex, near the school, is known in English as Robot Park and has robot-themed play equipment. Criticism and conflict in Roppongi Hills Roppongi Hills Arena is a facility with large outdoor speakers, in proximity to older housing. Since the construction of the Roppongi Hills development, complaints of noise pollution from older residents have been ignored by Mori Building management, according to residents. The building most directly suffering from noise is on top of an embankment opposite the Arena. Residents say several residents have been forced out by the noise. Henry Hilton of the Japan Today news aggregator website criticised the development when he argued: > Yet the truth is that the crowds are unlikely to return once they have been > exhausted by the charade of inconvenient walkways that appear almost > intentionally to confuse all but those with perfect map navigational skills. > The whole maze is far from being user friendly‚Äîdon't count on full > protection from autumn showers or sudden gusts of wind generated by the > buildings themselves. Financial issues Roppongi Hills residences Mori Building has financed the project with $800 million equity and $1.3 billion in debt from a syndicate of banks led by the Development Bank of Japan. As a result, the company's overall debts are $5.6 billion, secured by billions more in assets. Goldman Sachs & Co., the project's anchor tenant, attracted deep discounts in rental prices because of the large amount of space it occupies. Japan's sluggish economy, staff cuts by foreign companies, and the flow of new office space have put downward pressure on rents. Because of eminent domain law in Japan, several past residents of the site that would be Roppongi Hills have been given residential units in the complex in return for their agreement to vacate their prior homes, so that their prior homes would be demolished and the land used for the development of Roppongi Hills. Competition The Tokyo Midtown, a more recent mixed-use development project in Tokyo, is built less than a kilometer from the borders of Roppongi Hills. As it will incorporate Tokyo's tallest building, a sizable park, and a museum, in addition to a complex of residential and offices, it was expected that this project would increase the competition for customers upon the opening. However, as of January 2008, the Tokyo commercial real estate market is still suffering from insufficient capacity and occupancy rates throughout the city are at record highs.

In the past, it was widely used for a variety of indications, including pregnancy support for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency in women, treatment of prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women, and other uses. By 2007, it was only used in the treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In 2011, Hoover and colleagues reported on adverse health outcomes linked to DES including infertility, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, infant death, menopause prior to age 45, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and vaginal cancer. In 2020 the GoodRx and Walgreens' sites do not list diethylstilbestrol. While most commonly taken by mouth, DES was available for use by other routes as well, for instance, vaginal, topical, and by injection. DES is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a synthetic and nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group, and differs from the natural estrogen estradiol in various ways. Compared to estradiol, DES has greatly improved bioavailability when taken by mouth, is more resistant to metabolism, and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the liver and uterus. These differences result in DES having an increased risk of blood clots, cardiovascular issues, and certain other adverse effects. DES was discovered in 1938 and introduced for medical use in 1939. From about 1940 to 1971, the medication was given to pregnant women in the incorrect belief that it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In 1971, DES was shown to cause clear-cell carcinoma, a rare vaginal tumor, in girls and women who had been exposed to this medication in utero. The United States Food and Drug Administration subsequently withdrew approval of DES as a treatment for pregnant women. Follow-up studies have indicated that DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed. The United States National Cancer Institute recommends women born to mothers who took DES to undergo special medical exams on a regular basis to screen for complications as a result of the medication. Individuals who were exposed to DES during their mothers' pregnancies are commonly referred to as \\"DES daughters\\" and \\"DES sons\\". Since the discovery of the toxic effects of DES, it has largely been discontinued and is now mostly no longer marketed. Medical uses DES has been used in the past for the following indications: * Recurrent miscarriage in pregnancy * Menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy * Hormone therapy for hypoestrogenism (e.g., gonadal dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after oophorectomy) * Postpartum lactation suppression to prevent or reverse breast engorgement * Gonorrheal vaginitis (discontinued following the introduction of the antibiotic penicillin) * Prostate cancer and breast cancer * Prevention of tall stature in tall adolescent girls * Treatment of acne in girls and women * As an emergency postcoital contraceptive * As a means of chemical castration for hypersexuality and paraphilias in men and sex offenders * Prevention of the testosterone flare at the start of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist) therapy * Feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women DES was used at a dosage of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/day in menopausal hormone therapy. Interest in the use of DES to treat prostate cancer in men continues today. However, use of bioidentical parenteral estrogens like polyestradiol phosphate has been advocated in favor of oral synthetic estrogens like DES due to their much lower risk of cardiovascular toxicity. In addition to prostate cancer, some interest in the use of DES to treat breast cancer in women continues today as well. However, similarly to the case of prostate cancer, arguments have been made for the use bioidentical estrogens like estradiol instead of DES for breast cancer. Oral DES at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/day is effective in the treatment of hot flashes in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Side effects At more than 1 mg/day, DES is associated with high rates of side effects including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache, and bloating (incidence of 15‚Äì50%). =Breast changes and feminization= The pigmentation of the breast areolae are often very dark and almost black with DES therapy. The pigmentation that occurs with synthetic estrogens such as DES is much greater than with natural estrogens such as estradiol. The mechanism of the difference is unknown. Progestogens like hydroxyprogesterone caproate have been reported to reduce the nipple hyperpigmentation induced by high-dose estrogen therapy. In men treated with it for prostate cancer, DES has been found to produce high rates of gynecomastia (breast development) of 41 to 77%. =Blood clots and cardiovascular issues= In studies of DES as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy for men with prostate cancer, it has been associated with considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The risk is dose-dependent. A dosage of 5 mg/day DES has been associated with a 36% increase in non-cancer-related (mostly cardiovascular) deaths. In addition, there is an up to 15% incidence of venous thromboembolism. A 3 mg/day dosage of DES has been associated with an incidence of thromboembolism of 9.6 to 17%, with an incidence of cardiovascular complications of 33.3%. A lower dosage of 1 mg/day DES has been associated with a rate of death due to cardiovascular events of 14.8% (relative to 8.3% for orchiectomy alone). =Other long-term effects= DES has been linked to a variety of long-term adverse effects, such as increased risk of * vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma * vaginal adenosis * T-shaped uterus * uterine fibroids * cervical weakness * breast cancer * infertility * hypogonadism * intersexual gestational defects * depression, * and others, in women who were treated with it during pregnancy, and/or in their offspring. A comprehensive animal study in 1993 found a plethora of adverse effects from DES such as (but not limited to) * genotoxicity (due to quinone metabolite) * teratogenicity * penile and testicular hypoplasia * cryptorchidism (in rats and rhesus monkeys), * liver and renal cancer (in hamsters), ovarian papillary carcinoma (in canines), and * malignant uterine mesothelioma (in squirrel monkeys). Evidence was also found linking ADHD to F2 generations, demonstrating that there is at least some neurological and transgenerational effects in addition to the carcinogenic. Rodent studies reveal female reproductive tract cancers and abnormalities reaching to the F2 generation, and there is evidence of adverse effects such as irregular menstrual cycles intersexual in grandchildren of DES mothers. Additionally, evidence also points to transgenerational effects in F2 sons, such as hypospadias. At this time however, the extent of DES transgenerational effects in humans is not fully understood. Overdose DES has been assessed in the past in clinical studies at extremely high doses of as much as 1,500 to 5,000 mg/day. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Estrogenic activity DES is an estrogen; specifically, it is a highly potent full agonist of both of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has approximately 468% and 295% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. However, EC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM of DES for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively, have been reported, suggesting, in spite of its binding affinity for the two receptors, several- fold preference for activation of the ERŒ≤ over the ERŒ±. In addition to the nuclear ERs, DES is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), albeit with relatively low affinity (~1,000 nM). DES produces all of the same biological effects attributed to natural estrogens like estradiol. This includes effects in the uterus, vagina, mammary glands, pituitary gland, and other tissues. A dosage of 1 mg/day DES is approximately equivalent to a dosage of 50 ¬µg/day ethinylestradiol in terms of systemic estrogenic potency. Similarly to ethinylestradiol, DES shows a marked and disproportionately strong effect on liver protein synthesis. Whereas its systemic estrogenic potency was about 3.8-fold of that of estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), which has similar potency to micronized estradiol, the hepatic estrogenic potency of DES was 28-fold that of estropipate (or about 7.5-fold stronger potency for a dosage with equivalent systemic estrogenic effect). DES has at least three mechanisms of action in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. It suppresses gonadal androgen production and hence circulating androgen levels due to its antigonadotropic effects; it stimulates hepatic sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG) production, thereby increasing circulating levels of SHBG and decreasing the free fraction of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the circulation; and it may have direct cytotoxic effects in the testes and prostate gland. DES has also been found to decrease DNA synthesis at high doses. DES is a long-acting estrogen, with a nuclear retention of around 24 hours. Antigonadotropic effects Testosterone levels with no treatment and with various estrogens in men with prostate cancer. Determinations were made with an early radioimmunoassay (RIA). Source was Shearer et al. (1973). Testosterone levels with placebo and 0.2 to 5 mg/day diethylstilbestrol (DES) for 6 months in men with prostate cancer. Determinations were made with a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Source was Kent et al. (1973). Due to its estrogenic activity, DES has antigonadotropic effects. That is, it exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis), suppresses the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and suppresses sex hormone production as well as gamete production or maturation in the gonads. A study of ovulation inhibition in women found that 5 mg/day oral DES was 92% effective, with ovulation occurring in only a single cycle. DES consistently suppresses testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (<50 ng/dL) within 1 to 2 weeks at doses of 3 mg/day and above. Conversely, a dosage of 1 mg/day DES is unable to fully suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men, which instead often stabilize at just above castrate levels (>50 ng/dL). However, it has also been reported that 1 mg/day DES results in approximately 50% suppression of testosterone levels, albeit with wide interindividual variability. It has been said that doses of DES of less than 1 mg/day have no effect on testosterone levels. However, the addition of an \\"extremely low\\" dosage of 0.1 mg/day DES to cyproterone acetate has been found to result in a synergistic antigonadotropic effect and to suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men. DES at 3 mg/day has similar testosterone suppression to a dose of 300 mg/day, suggesting that suppression of testosterone levels is maximal by 3 mg/day. Other activities In addition to the ERs, an in vitro study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, at a variety of other steroid hormone receptors. Whereas the study found EC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM of DES for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively, the medication showed significant glucocorticoid activity at a concentration of 1 ŒºM that surpassed that of 0.1 nM dexamethasone, as well as significant antagonism of the androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, all at a concentration of 1 ŒºM). It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of PPARŒ≥ and LXRŒ± at a concentration of 10 ŒºM. The researchers stated that, to the best of their knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed). However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in animal models at pharmacologically relevant doses. DES has been identified as an antagonist of all three isotypes of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), the ERRŒ±, ERRŒ≤, and ERRŒ≥. =Pharmacokinetics= DES is well-absorbed with oral administration. With an oral dosage of 1 mg/day DES, plasma levels of DES at 20 hours following the last dose ranged between 0.9 and 1.9 ng/mL (3.4 to 7.1 nmol/L). Sublingual administration of DES appears to have about the same estrogenic potency of oral DES in women. Intrauterine DES has been studied for the treatment of uterine hypoplasia. The distribution half-life of DES is 80 minutes. It has no affinity for SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin, and hence is not bound to these proteins in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of DES is greater than 95%. Hydroxylation of the aromatic rings of DES and subsequent conjugation of the ethyl side chains accounts for 80 to 90% of DES metabolism, while oxidation accounts for the remaining 10 to 20% and is dominated by conjugation reactions. Conjugation of DES consists of glucuronidation, while oxidation includes dehydrogenation into (Z,Z)-dienestrol. The medication is also known to produce paroxypropione as a metabolite. DES produces transient quinone-like reactive intermediates that cause cellular and genetic damage, which may help to explain the known carcinogenic effects of DES in humans. However, other research indicates that the toxic effects of DES may simply be due to overactivation of the ERs. In contrast to estradiol, the hydroxyl groups of DES do not undergo oxidation into an estrone-like equivalent. The elimination half-life of DES is 24 hours. The metabolites of DES are excreted in urine and feces. Chemistry Chemical structures of estradiol and DES. Note the preservation of the two hydroxyl groups in DES and the similar distance between them relative to estradiol, which is notable when it is considered that DES was discovered serendipitously. DES belongs to the stilbestrol (4,4'-dihydroxystilbene) group of compounds. It is a nonsteroidal open-ring analogue of the steroidal estrogen estradiol. DES can be prepared from anethole, which also happens to be weakly estrogenic. Anethole was demethylated to form anol and anol then spontaneously dimerized into dianol and hexestrol, with DES subsequently being synthesized via structural modification of hexestrol. As shown by X-ray crystallography, the molecular dimensions of DES are almost identical to those of estradiol, particularly in regards to the distance between the terminal hydroxyl groups. History =Synthesis= DES was first synthesized in early 1938 by Leon Golberg, then a graduate student of Sir Robert Robinson at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory at the University of Oxford. Golberg's research was based on work by Wilfrid Lawson at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, (led by Sir Edward Charles Dodds at Middlesex Hospital Medical School now part of University College London). A report of its synthesis was published in Nature on 5 February 1938. DES research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds. Because it was not patented, DES was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide. =Clinical use= DES was first marketed for medical use in 1939. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 19, 1941 in tablets up to 5 mg for four indications: gonorrheal vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, menopausal symptoms, and postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement. The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the antibiotic penicillin became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial. In 1941, Charles Huggins and Clarence Hodges at the University of Chicago found estradiol benzoate and DES to be the first effective drugs for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. DES was the first cancer drug. Orchiectomy or DES or both were the standard initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the GnRH agonist leuprorelin was found to have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985. From the 1940s until the late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as estrogen replacement therapy for estrogen deficiency states such as ovarian dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after oophorectomy. In the 1940s, DES was used off-label to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage. On July 1, 1947, the FDA approved the use of DES for this indication. The first such approval was granted to Bristol-Myers Squibb, allowing use of 25 mg (and later 100 mg) tablets of DES during pregnancy. Approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year. The recommended regimen started at 5 mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy (from first day of last menstrual period), increased every other week by 5 mg per day through the 14th week, and then increased every week by 5 mg per day from 25 mg per day in the 15th week to 125 mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy. DES was originally considered effective and safe for both the pregnant woman and the developing baby. It was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed. Sales peaked in 1953. In the early 1950s, a double-blind clinical trial at the University of Chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive DES. The study showed no benefit of taking DES during pregnancy; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reduced in the women who were given DES. By the late 1960s, six of seven leading textbooks of obstetrics said DES was ineffective at preventing miscarriage. Despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of DES to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, DES continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s. In 1971, a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a probable link between DES and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug in utero. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use.; On February 5, 1975, the FDA ordered 25 mg and 100 mg tablets of DES withdrawn, effective February 18, 1975. The number of persons exposed to DES during pregnancy or in utero during the period of 1940 to 1971 is unknown, but may be as high as 2 million in the United States. DES was also used in other countries, most notably France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. From the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s, DES was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones. Despite its clear link to cancer, doctors continued to recommend the hormone for \\"excess height\\". In 1960, DES was found to be more effective than androgens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. DES was the hormonal treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women until 1977, when the FDA approved tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator with efficacy similar to DES but fewer side effects. Several sources from medical literature in the 1970s and 1980s indicate that DES was used as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women. In 1973, in an attempt to restrict off- label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in JAMA) to emergency situations such as rape, an FDA Drug Bulletin was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES. In 1975, the FDA said it had not actually given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in 1975.; To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25 mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5 mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: \\"This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive\\" in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.; ; In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive. In 1978, the FDA removed postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens.; In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, Eli Lilly, stopped making and marketing it in 1997. =Lawsuits= In the 1970s, the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of DES's long-term effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the United States against its manufacturers. These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the Supreme Court of California, Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, in which the court imposed a rebuttable presumption of market share liability upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff. A lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a Daubert hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial. The remaining litigants have received various settlements. The advocacy group DES Action USA helped provide information and support for DES-exposed persons engaged in lawsuits. Society and culture Alan Turing, the ground-breaking cryptographer, founder of computing science and programmable computers, who also proposed the actual theoretical model of biological morphogenesis, was forced onto this medication to induce chemical castration as a punitive \\"treatment\\" for homosexual behaviour, shortly before he died in ambiguous circumstances.. James Herriot describes a case regarding treating a small dog's testicular Sertoli cell tumor in his 1974 book All Things Bright and Beautiful. Herriot decided to prescribe a high dose of the new drug Stilboestrol for the recurring tumor, with the amusing side effect that the male dog became \\"attractive to other male dogs\\", who followed the terrier around the village for a few weeks. Herriot comments in the story that he knew \\"The new drug was said to have a feminising effect, but surely not to that extent.\\" Veterinary use =Canine incontinence= DES has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control. It is still available from compounding pharmacies, and at the low (1 mg) dose, does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans. It is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed. =Livestock growth promotion= The greatest usage of DES was in the livestock industry, used to improve feed conversion in beef and poultry. During the 1960s, DES was used as a growth hormone in the beef and poultry industries. It was later found to cause cancer by 1971, but was not phased out until 1979. Although DES was discovered to be harmful to humans, its veterinary use was not immediately halted. As of 2011, DES was still being used as a growth promoter in terrestrial livestock or fish in some parts of the world including China.

The Belgian Socialists recovered well; the liberal and nationalist parties increased their vote as well. The Flemish Greens lost all their seats. The Greens were attacked on two fronts: some, including their coalition partners, accused them of being too fundamentalist, while others said that they had betrayed their ideals. The resignation of a Walloon green minister (Isabelle Durant), one week before the elections, probably didn't do them much good either. Although it was predicted in some opinion polls, the gains of the Front National were surprising, considering that it seldom appeared in the media. The most important trend was the recovery of the Flemish social-democrats, led by the popular (some would say populist) Steve Stevaert. The fact that Elio Di Rupo was learning Dutch caused rumours that he hoped to become Prime Minister, if the social-democrats would turn out to be the largest political family. Themes that probably influenced the election results in some way or another were the government's opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the controversy around the nuisance around the airport of Zaventem, the controversy surrounding the banning of tobacco publicity, and unemployment, but a general dominating theme was lacking.

He was nicknamed the \\"Seawolf of the Confederacy\\" for his exploits and daring. Early life and career Charles Read was born in Satartia, Mississippi in 1840. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1856 and graduated in 1860. He served briefly aboard USS Powhatan after graduation. Civil War At the outbreak of the American Civil War Read resigned his commission with the United States Navy and accepted a position with the Confederate States Navy. Read was initially assigned to the at New Orleans, Louisiana as a midshipman and participated in the battle between batteries on Ship Island and the on July 9, 1861. On October 12, 1861, he participated in the attack on the Union blockading squadron at Head of the Passes on the Mississippi River. When the commander of the CSS McRae was wounded on April 24, 1862, Read took command of the ship. Read then served as executive officer of the during its actions against a blockading fleet of over 30 ships on the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi on 13 July 1862. Read served as acting commander of the Arkansas during her final battle supporting the Confederate Army assaulting Baton Rouge, Louisiana on 6 August 1862. After the sinking of the Arkansas, Read travelled by foot to Port Hudson, Louisiana and assisted with the emplacement of shore guns there. Read was soon ordered to Mobile, Alabama and was assigned to the which set sail on 15 January 1863. He transferred to the , a captured prize of the Florida, and set out on his own. During this raiding mission, which lasted from 6 June 1863 to 27 June 1863, Read transferred his command to prize vessels twice more, once to the and finally to the .Phil Leigh. Charles Read's Raider, The New York Times, May 10, 2013 At the end of the raid, Lieutenant Read had captured or destroyed twenty-two United States vessels. He and his crew were captured off Portland, Maine on June 27, 1863, while attempting to take the . Read was held at Fort Warren, Massachusetts, until he was exchanged at Cox Wharf, Virginia, on October 18, 1864. After his release, Read participated in naval and land operations on the James River, he commanded the and two other torpedo boats at the Battle of Trent's Reach. In January 1865, he was assigned to the at Shreveport, Louisiana with the intention that she become a raider in the Pacific Ocean. Read did not reach the Webb until 22 April 1865. Read attempted to break out to the Gulf of Mexico but grounded in shallow waters near New Orleans on April 23, 1865. Read fired the ship to prevent its capture by Federal forces. Read surrendered to Federal naval authorities in New Orleans and was transported again to Fort Warren. He was released on July 24, 1865. After the war In 1867, Read was second officer aboard a ship involved in an effort to help Cuban rebels overthrow the Spanish government of the island. Read and others were arrested by the US government but were quickly released. He was later hired by Charles Flynt to train Peru in the use of torpedoes. Read was commissioned as an Commander in the Peruvian Navy and much like John Randolph Tucker, received disdain from within the Peruvian Navy due to their jealousy of a foreigner being hired in a position of command. Read earned his nickname \\"Savvy\\" or \\"Savez\\" due to his constant use of the term. Charles Read died at Meridian, Mississippi, where he is buried.

History  In 1603 the principality of Anhalt-K√∂then was created, when the principality of Anhalt was split in five parts. In 1665 it merged with Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau, and in 1807 it became a duchy. 1847 it was divided between Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt-Bernburg, and in 1853 it was merged with Anhalt-Dessau to form the Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau-K√∂then. When in 1863 the various parts of Anhalt were reunited, the district was created. At first the district Dessau-K√∂then did cover the area surrounding the two district-free cities Dessau and K√∂then. In 1950 the city of K√∂then was added to the district, and it was renamed after its capital.

Six series were broadcast on ITV from 15 August 1973 to 7 April 1976. The series was considered daring at the time because it featured a man sharing a London flat with two single women. The show was made by Thames Television and recorded at its Teddington studio in Greater London. It is regularly repeated on ITV3. Two spin-off series were later made: George and Mildred and Robin's Nest. In 2004, Man About the House placed 69th in a poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom. The series was remade in the United States as Three's Company in 1977. A film version was released in 1974. Cast =Main stars= * Richard O'Sullivan as Robin Tripp * Paula Wilcox as Chrissy Plummer * Sally Thomsett as Jo =Co-stars= * Yootha Joyce as Mildred Roper * Brian Murphy as George Roper * Doug Fisher as Larry Simmonds =Recurring cast= * Roy Kinnear as Jerry (series 3 to 5) * Daphne Oxenford as Mrs Plummer (series 1, 4 and 6) Plot Chrissy and Jo live in a London flat together and work for the same firm. The women find a stranger, student chef Robin Tripp, asleep in their bath the morning after the farewell party for their departed flatmate Eleanor. When he meets the two girls, Robin has been in London two days, having moved from Southampton to attend college. The girls are unimpressed with Gabrielle (Helen Fraser) as a potential replacement for Eleanor, but they are impressed by Robin's culinary skills, as they cannot cook at all. Learning that Robin has been staying at the YMCA, they convince him to move in, on the understanding that it will be a platonic relationship. Chrissy tells landlord George Roper that Robin is gay to eliminate George's objections to the mixed-sex living arrangement. George, in truth a subletting landlord placed by the council, is a miserly, spiteful and unkempt man under the thumb of his domineering and sexually frustrated wife Mildred. In the second episode, Robin's true sexuality becomes known to Mildred. She takes out her frustrations with George's lack of class and sexual inadequacy by making suggestive remarks to Robin and frequently siding with the tenants against George. Mildred openly flirts with Robin, and Robin frequently flirts with Chrissy and Jo. The girls, adhering to their pledge to maintain a platonic relationship with Robin, spurn his mild advances and adapt to his presence in the flat. Chrissy occasionally shows attraction to Robin, but the two never pursue any romantic interaction. Robin's friend Larry, a lovable rogue, appears on a recurring basis throughout the series. In the third series, he moves into the loft apartment above the trio's apartment and is a frequent source of trouble. Another occasional cast member is George's friend, the dodgy builder Jerry (Roy Kinnear). Jerry is the only supporting character to reappear in the spin-off George and Mildred. Robin's brother Norman Tripp (Norman Eshley) appears in the final three episodes of the sixth and final series, and starts a romance with Chrissy. Eshley had a previous guest role in the episode \\"In Praise of Older Men\\" (Series 2, Episode 3). Episodes First airing on 15 August 1973, Man About the House ran until 7 April 1976, spanning 39 episodes in six series. In addition, on Christmas Day 1973, a short special aired as part of All-star Comedy Carnival. Theme music Written by Johnny Hawksworth and entitled \\"Up to Date\\", the theme song was not specially commissioned for the show, but rather was provided via the production music company De Wolfe Music.

When the potential difference between the conductors exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas within the gap, a spark forms, ionizing the gas and drastically reducing its electrical resistance. An electric current then flows until the path of ionized gas is broken or the current reduces below a minimum value called the \\"holding current\\". This usually happens when the voltage drops, but in some cases occurs when the heated gas rises, stretching out and then breaking the filament of ionized gas. Usually, the action of ionizing the gas is violent and disruptive, often leading to sound (ranging from a snap for a spark plug to thunder for a lightning discharge), light and heat. Spark gaps were used historically in early electrical equipment, such as spark gap radio transmitters, electrostatic machines, and X-ray machines. Their most widespread use today is in spark plugs to ignite the fuel in internal combustion engines, but they are also used in lightning arresters and other devices to protect electrical equipment from high-voltage transients. Breakdown voltage For air, the breakdown strength is about 30 kV/cm at sea level. Spark visibility The light emitted by a spark does not come from the current of electrons itself, but from the material medium fluorescing in response to collisions from the electrons. When electrons collide with molecules of air in the gap, they excite their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. When these excited electrons fall back to their original energy levels, they emit energy as light. It is impossible for a visible spark to form in a vacuum. Without intervening matter capable of electromagnetic transitions, the spark will be invisible (see vacuum arc). Applications Spark gaps are essential to the functioning of a number of electronic devices. =Ignition devices= A spark plug. The spark gap is at the bottom. A spark plug uses a spark gap to initiate combustion. The heat of the ionization trail, but more importantly, UV radiation and hot free electrons (both cause the formation of reactive free radicals) ignite a fuel-air mixture inside an internal combustion engine, or a burner in a furnace, oven, or stove. The more UV radiation is produced and successfully spread into the combustion chamber, the further the combustion process proceeds. The Space Shuttle Main Engine hydrogen oxygen propellant mixture was ignited with a spark igniter. =Protective devices= The switch contacts on a multimeter acting as a PCB spark gap. Spark gaps are frequently used to prevent voltage surges from damaging equipment. Spark gaps are used in high-voltage switches, large power transformers, in power plants and electrical substations. Such switches are constructed with a large, remote-operated switching blade with a hinge as one contact and two leaf springs holding the other end as second contact. If the blade is opened, a spark may keep the connection between blade and spring conducting. The spark ionizes the air, which becomes conductive and allows an arc to form, which sustains ionization and hence conduction. A Jacob's ladder on top of the switch will cause the arc to rise and eventually extinguish. One might also find small Jacob's ladders mounted on top of ceramic insulators of high-voltage pylons. These are sometimes called horn gaps. If a spark should ever manage to jump over the insulator and give rise to an arc, it will be extinguished. Smaller spark gaps are often used to protect sensitive electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits from the effects of lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from lead wire to lead wire across the gap left by the sawing process. These low-cost devices are often used to prevent damaging arcs between the elements of the electron gun(s) within a cathode ray tube (CRT). Small spark gaps are very common in telephone switchboards, as the long phone cables are very susceptible to induced surges from lightning strikes. Larger spark gaps are used to protect power lines. Spark gaps are sometimes implemented on Printed Circuit Boards in electronics products using two closely spaced exposed PCB traces. This is an effectively zero cost method of adding crude over-voltage protection to electronics products. Transils and trisils are the solid-state alternatives to spark gaps for lower-power applications. Neon bulbs are also used for this purpose. =High speed photography= A photo of a Smith & Wesson firing, taken with an air-gap flash. The photo was taken in a darkened room with the camera's shutter open, and the flash was triggered by the sound of the shot using a microphone. A triggered spark gap in an air-gap flash is used to produce photographic light flashes in the sub-microsecond domain. =Radio transmitters= Spark gap tube A spark radiates energy throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Nowadays, this is usually regarded as illegal radio frequency interference and is suppressed, but in the early days of radio communications (1880-1920), this was the means by which radio signals were transmitted, in the unmodulated spark-gap transmitter. Many radio spark gaps include cooling devices, such as the rotary gap and heat sinks, since the spark gap becomes quite hot under continuous use at high power. =Sphere gap for voltage measurement= A calibrated spherical spark gap will break down at a highly repeatable voltage, when corrected for air pressure, humidity and temperature. A gap between two spheres can provide a voltage measurement without any electronics or voltage dividers, to an accuracy of about 3%. A spark gap can be used to measure high voltage AC, DC, or pulses, but for very short pulses, an ultraviolet light source or radioactive source may be put on one of the terminals to provide a source of electrons.Ryan, Hugh M. (ed) High Voltage Engineering and Testing (2nd Edition), Institution of Engineering and Technology 2001, pages =Power-switching devices= Spark gaps may be used as electrical switches because they have two states with significantly different electrical resistance. Resistance between the electrodes may be as high as 10 ohms when the electrodes are separated by gas or vacuum which means that little current flows even when a high voltage exists between the electrodes. Resistance drops as low as a 10 ohms low when the electrodes are connected by plasma which means that power dissipation is low even at high current. This combination of properties has led to the use of spark gaps as electrical switches in pulsed power applications where energy is stored at high voltage in a capacitor and then discharged at high current. Examples include pulsed lasers, railguns, Marx generators, fusion, ultrastrong pulsed magnetic field research, and nuclear bomb triggering. When a spark gap consists of only two electrodes separated by gas, the transition between the non-conducting and conducting states is governed by Paschen's law. At typical pressure and electrode distance combinations, Paschen's law says that Townsend discharge will fill the gap between the electrodes with conductive plasma whenever the ratio of the electric field strength to the pressure exceeds a constant value determined by the composition of the gas. The speed with which pressure can be reduced is limited by choked flow, while increasing the electric field in a capacitor discharge circuit is limited by the capacitance in the circuit and the current available for charging the capacitance. These limitations on the speed with which discharge may be initiated mean that spark gaps with two electrodes typically have high jitter. Triggered spark gaps are a class of devices with some additional means of triggering to achieve low jitter. Most commonly, this is a third electrode, as in a trigatron. The voltage of the trigger electrode can be changed quickly because the capacitance between it and the other electrodes is small. In a triggered spark gap, gas pressure is optimized to minimize jitter while also avoiding unintentional triggering. Triggered spark gaps are made in permanently sealed versions with limited voltage range and in user-pressurized versions with voltage range proportional to the available pressure range. Triggered spark gaps share many similarities with other gas-filled tubes such as thyratrons, krytrons, ignitrons, and crossatrons. Triggered vacuum gaps, or sprytrons, resemble triggered spark gaps both in appearance and construction but rely on a different operating principle. A triggered vacuum gap consists of three electrodes in an airtight glass or ceramic envelope that has been evacuated. This means that, unlike a triggered spark gap, a triggered vacuum gap operates in the parameter space to the left of the Paschen minimum where breakdown is promoted by increasing pressure. Current between the electrodes is limited to a small value by field emission in the non-conducting state. Breakdown is initiated by rapidly evaporating material from a trigger electrode or an adjacent resistive coating. Once the vacuum arc is initiated, a triggered vacuum gap is filled with conductive plasma as in any other spark gap. A triggered vacuum gap has a larger operating voltage range than a sealed triggered spark gap because Paschen curves are much steeper to the left of the Paschen minimum than at higher pressures. Triggered vacuum gaps are also rad hard because in the non- conducting state they do not contain any gas that could be ionized by radiation. =Visual entertainment= A time exposure of a Jacob's ladder Jacob's ladder at work A Jacob's ladder (more formally, a high voltage traveling arc) is a device for producing a continuous train of large sparks that rise upwards. The spark gap is formed by two wires, approximately vertical but gradually diverging from each other towards the top in a narrow V shape. It was named for the \\"ladder to heaven\\" described in the Bible. When high voltage is applied to the gap, a spark forms across the bottom of the wires where they are nearest each other, rapidly changing to an electric arc. Air breaks down at about 30 kV/cm, depending on humidity, temperature, etc. Apart from the anode and cathode voltage drops, the arc behaves almost as a short circuit, drawing as much current as the electrical power supply can deliver, and the heavy load dramatically reduces the voltage across the gap. The heated ionized air rises, carrying the current path with it. As the trail of ionization gets longer, it becomes more and more unstable, finally breaking. The voltage across the electrodes then rises and the spark re-forms at the bottom of the device. This cycle leads to an exotic-looking display of electric white, yellow, blue or purple arcs, which is often seen in films about mad scientists. The device was a staple in schools and science fairs of the 1950s and 1960s, typically constructed out of a Model T spark coil or any other source of high voltage in the 10,000‚Äì30,000-volt range, such as a neon sign transformer (5‚Äì15 kV) or a television picture tube circuit (flyback transformer) (10‚Äì28 kV), and two coat hangers or rods built into a V shape. For larger ladders, microwave oven transformers connected in series, voltage multipliers and utility pole transformers (pole pigs) run in reverse (step-up) are commonly used. Health hazards Exposure to an arc-producing device can pose health hazards. An arc formed in air will ionize oxygen and nitrogen, which then can re-form into reactive molecules such as ozone and nitric oxide. These products can be damaging to the mucous membranes. Plants are also susceptible to ozone poisoning. These hazards are greatest when the arc is continuous and in an enclosed space such as a room. An arc that occurs outside is less of a hazard because the heated ionized gases will rise up into the air and dissipate into the atmosphere. Spark gaps which only intermittently produce short spark bursts are also minimally hazardous because the volume of ions generated is very small. Arcs can also produce a broad spectrum of wavelengths spanning the visible light and the invisible ultraviolet and infrared spectrum. Very intense arcs generated by means such as arc welding can produce significant amounts of ultraviolet radiation which is damaging to the cornea of the observer. These arcs should only be observed through special dark filters which reduce the arc intensity and shield the observer's eyes from the ultraviolet rays.

It is named after Joseph Capgras (1873‚Äì1950), a French psychiatrist. The Capgras delusion is classified as a delusional misidentification syndrome, a class of delusional beliefs that involves the misidentification of people, places, or objects. It can occur in acute, transient, or chronic forms. Cases in which patients hold the belief that time has been \\"warped\\" or \\"substituted\\" have also been reported. The delusion most commonly occurs in individuals diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but has also been seen in brain injury, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other dementia. It presents often in individuals with a neurodegenerative disease, particularly at an older age. It has also been reported as occurring in association with diabetes, hypothyroidism, and migraine attacks. In one isolated case, the Capgras delusion was temporarily induced in a healthy subject by the drug ketamine. It occurs more frequently in females, with a female to male ratio of approximately 3 to 2. Signs and symptoms The following two case reports are examples of the Capgras delusion in a psychiatric setting: The following case is an instance of the Capgras delusion resulting from a neurodegenerative disease: Causes It is generally agreed that the Capgras delusion has a complex and organic basis (caused by structural damage to organs) and can be better understood by examining neuroanatomical damage associated with the syndrome. In one of the first papers to consider the cerebral basis of the Capgras delusion, Alexander, Stuss and Benson pointed out in 1979 that the disorder might be related to a combination of frontal lobe damage causing problems with familiarity and right hemisphere damage causing problems with visual recognition.Alexander, M.P., Stuss, D.T., & Benson, D.F. (1979). Capgras syndrome: A reduplicative phenomenon. Neurology, 29, 334-339 Further clues to the possible causes of the Capgras delusion were suggested by the study of brain-injured patients who had developed prosopagnosia. In this condition, patients are unable to recognize faces consciously, despite being able to recognize other types of visual objects. However, a 1984 study by Bauer showed that even though conscious face recognition was impaired, patients with the condition showed autonomic arousal (measured by a galvanic skin response measure) to familiar faces, suggesting that there are two pathways to face recognition‚Äîone conscious and one unconscious. In a 1990 paper published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, psychologists Hadyn Ellis and Andy Young hypothesized that patients with Capgras delusion may have a \\"mirror image\\" or double dissociation of prosopagnosia, in that their conscious ability to recognize faces was intact, but they might have damage to the system that produces the automatic emotional arousal to familiar faces. This might lead to the experience of recognizing someone while feeling something was not \\"quite right\\" about them. In 1997, Ellis and his colleagues published a study of five patients with Capgras delusion (all diagnosed with schizophrenia) and confirmed that although they could consciously recognize the faces, they did not show the normal automatic emotional arousal response. The same low level of autonomic response was shown in the presence of strangers. Young (2008) has theorized that this means that patients with the disease experience a \\"loss\\" of familiarity, not a \\"lack\\" of it. Further evidence for this explanation comes from other studies measuring galvanic skin responses (GSR) to faces. A patient with Capgras delusion showed reduced GSRs to faces in spite of normal face recognition. This theory for the causes of Capgras delusion was summarised in Trends in Cognitive Sciences in 2001. William Hirstein and Vilayanur S. Ramachandran reported similar findings in a paper published on a single case of a patient with Capgras delusion after brain injury. Ramachandran portrayed this case in his book Phantoms in the Brain and gave a talk about it at TED 2007. Since the patient was capable of feeling emotions and recognizing faces but could not feel emotions when recognizing familiar faces, Ramachandran hypothesizes that the origin of Capgras syndrome is a disconnection between the temporal cortex, where faces are usually recognized (see temporal lobe), and the limbic system, involved in emotions. More specifically, he emphasizes the disconnection between the amygdala and the inferotemporal cortex. In 2010, Hirstein revised this theory to explain why a person with Capgras syndrome would have the particular reaction of not recognizing a familiar person. Hirstein explained the theory as follows: Furthermore, Ramachandran suggests a relationship between the Capgras syndrome and a more general difficulty in linking successive episodic memories because of the crucial role emotion plays in creating memories. Since the patient could not put together memories and feelings, he believed objects in a photograph were new on every viewing, even though they normally should have evoked feelings (e.g., a person close to him, a familiar object, or even himself). Others like Merrin and Silberfarb (1976) have also proposed links between the Capgras syndrome and deficits in aspects of memory. They suggest that an important and familiar person (the usual subject of the delusion) has many layers of visual, auditory, tactile, and experiential memories associated with them, so the Capgras delusion can be understood as a failure of object constancy at a high perceptual level. Most likely, more than just an impairment of the automatic emotional arousal response is necessary to form the Capgras delusion, as the same pattern has been reported in patients showing no signs of delusions. Ellis suggested that a second factor explains why this unusual experience is transformed into a delusional belief; this second factor is thought to be an impairment in reasoning, although no definitive impairment has been found to explain all cases. Many have argued for the inclusion of the role of patient phenomenology in explanatory models of the Capgras syndrome in order to better understand the mechanisms that enable the creation and maintenance of delusional beliefs. Capgras syndrome has also been linked to reduplicative paramnesia, another delusional misidentification syndrome in which a person believes a location has been duplicated or relocated. Since these two syndromes are highly associated, it has been proposed that they affect similar areas of the brain and therefore have similar neurological implications. Reduplicative paramnesia is understood to affect the frontal lobe, and thus it is believed that Capgras syndrome is also associated with the frontal lobe. Even if the damage is not directly to the frontal lobe, an interruption of signals between other lobes and the frontal lobe could result in Capgras syndrome. Diagnosis Because it is a rare and poorly understood condition, there is no definitive way to diagnose the Capgras delusion. Diagnosis is primarily made on a psychiatric evaluation of the patient, who is most likely brought to a psychiatrist's attention by a family member or friend believed to be an imposter by the person under the delusion. Treatment Treatment has not been well studied and so there is no evidence-based approach. Treatment is generally therapy, often with support of antipsychotic medication. History Capgras syndrome is named after Joseph Capgras, a French psychiatrist who first described the disorder in 1923 in his paper co-authored by Jean Reboul-Lachaux, on the case of a French woman, \\"Madame Macabre,\\" who complained that corresponding \\"doubles\\" had taken the places of her husband and other people she knew. Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux first called the syndrome \\"l'illusion des sosies\\", which can be translated literally as \\"the illusion of look-alikes.\\"\\"Approche clinique du syndrome de Capgras ou ¬´ illusion des sosies ¬ª illustr√©e par un cas\\", Ga√´l Le Vacon, 2006; rough translation: \\"Clinical approach to Capgras syndrome or 'illusion of doubles' illustrated by a case\\" The syndrome was initially considered a purely psychiatric disorder, the delusion of a double seen as symptomatic of schizophrenia, and purely a female disorder (though this is now known not to be the case) often noted as a symptom of hysteria. Most of the proposed explanations initially following that of Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux were psychoanalytical in nature. It was not until the 1980s that attention was turned to the usually co-existing organic brain lesions originally thought to be essentially unrelated or accidental. Today, the Capgras syndrome is understood as a neurological disorder, in which the delusion primarily results from organic brain lesions or degeneration.

Later in his life he disputed Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and other accepted theories in modern physics. Biography In 1939, when Beckmann was 14, his family fled their home in Prague, Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. From 1942 to 1945, he served in a Czech squadron of the Royal Air Force. He worked as a radar mechanic on the newly invented radar systems that helped Britain win the Battle of the Atlantic.Access to Energy, Vol. 20, no. 2; October 1992 He received a B.Sc. in 1949, a Ph.D. in 1955, and a D.Sc. in 1962, all from Prague's Czech Academy of Sciences in electrical engineering. He defected to the United States in 1963 and became a Professor (later, Emeritus) of electrical engineering at the University of Colorado. In the United States, he became acquainted with novelist Ayn Rand, a contributing editor to a publication devoted to her ideas, The Intellectual Activist, and a speaker at The Thomas Jefferson School, an intellectual conference of similar purpose. Beckmann was a prolific author; he wrote several electrical engineering textbooks and non-technical works. By 1968 he had founded Golem Press, which published most of his books, including The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear (1976), which argued in favor of nuclear power during the height of the anti-nuclear movement by contrasting the cost, in human terms, with the equivalent costs of the alternatives available. Beckmann also wrote A History of , documenting the history of the calculation of . He published his own monthly newsletter, Access to Energy, which since September 1993 has been written by biochemist Arthur B. Robinson. In 1981, he took early retirement with Emeritus status, in order to devote himself fully to what he saw as the defense of science, technology and free enterprise, through his newsletter, Access to Energy. He founded the Golem Press in 1967, publishing more than nine books. These included The History of , Einstein Plus Two, and The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear (with an Introduction by Edward Teller). He wrote some 60 scientific papers and eight technical books.

Comrade and successor of the Great Cond√©, he was one of the most accomplished military commanders of the early modern period and is particularly noted for his exploits in the Franco-Dutch War and War of the Grand Alliance. Not imposing physically, as he was a slight man and hunchbacked, Luxembourg was nonetheless one of France's greatest generals. He never lost a battle in which he held command. Early years Fran√ßois Henri de Montmorency was born at Paris. His father, the Fran√ßois de Montmorency-Bouteville, had been executed six months before his birth for participating in a duel against the Marquis de Beuvron. His aunt, Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, Princess of Cond√©, took charge of him and educated him with her son, the Duke of Enghien. The young Montmorency (or Bouteville as he was then called) attached himself to his cousin, and shared his successes and reverses throughout the troubles of the Fronde. He returned to France in 1659 and was pardoned, and Cond√©, then much attached to the Duchess of Ch√¢tillon, Montmorency's sister, contrived the marriage of his adherent and cousin to the greatest heiress in France, Madeleine de Luxembourg, Princess of Tingry and heiress of the Luxembourg dukedom (1661), after which he was created Duke of Luxembourg and peer of France. Luxembourg as general =War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War= At the opening of the War of Devolution (1667‚Äì68), Cond√©, and consequently Luxembourg, had no command, but during the second campaign he served as Cond√©'s lieutenant general in the conquest of Franche-Comt√©. During the four years of peace which followed, Luxembourg cultivated the favour of Louvois, and in 1672 held a high command against the Dutch during the Franco- Dutch War (1672‚Äì1678). He defeated a counterattack by the Prince William III of Orange at Woerden but was blocked by the Dutch Water Line. On 27 December the inundations were frozen over and he began to cross over the ice, but a sudden thaw cut his force in half. Retreating, de Luxembourg found the fortress town of Bodegraven abandoned by its garrison and ordered the entire civilian population to be burned alive with their houses. The Dutch anti- French propaganda quickly exploited this massacre and when de Luxembourg bragged to Louis XIV that he had roasted any Dutchman he could find in the town, he was surprised to find that some at court considered such cruelties unnecessary. In 1673 he made his famous retreat from Utrecht to Maastricht with only 20,000 men in face of 70,000, an exploit which placed him in the first rank of generals. In 1674 he was made captain of the Garde du Corps, and in 1675 Marshal of France. In 1676 he was placed at the head of the Army of the Rhine replacing Cond√©, who was in bad health. However, he could not relieve the siege of Philippsburg. This fortress had been invested by Imperial troops under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine on 1 May. Luxembourg could neither break through the defenses of Wissembourg established by the Imperials, nor draw them out to do battle. Philippsburg fell on 17 September. In 1677 he stormed Valenciennes, defeated William of Orange again at Cassel and in 1678, repulsed another of his assault at Saint-Denis after the signature of the Peace of Nijmegen. His reputation was now high and it is reputed that he quarrelled with Louvois, who managed to involve him in the \\"Affair of the Poisons\\" and get him sent to the Bastille. Rousset in his Histoire de Louvois has shown that this quarrel is probably apocryphal. Luxembourg doubtlessly spent some months of 1680 in the Bastille, but on his release took up his post at court as capitaine des gardes. =War of the Grand Alliance 1688-97= Dutch engraving of Montmorency; in the background his troops massacre Dutch civiliansBy 1690, during the War of the Grand Alliance, Luxembourg was entrusted with the command of King Louis' army in the Spanish Netherlands, superseding Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humi√®res. On 1 July 1690, he won his greatest victory over William's allied commander, the Prince of Waldeck, at Fleurus. In the following year he was again victorious at Leuze on 18 September 1691. In the next campaign he covered the king's 1692 Siege of Namur, and defeated William at Steenkerque in 1692; and again on 29 July 1693, won the most famous of his battles over his eternal adversary at Neerwinden, after which he was called \\"Le Tapissier de N√¥tre Dame\\" (The Upholsterer of Notre Dame) due to the number of captured enemy flags that he sent to the cathedral. He was received with enthusiasm at Paris by all but the king, who looked coldly on a relative and adherent of the Cond√©s. St-Simon describes in the first volume of his Memoirs how, instead of ranking as eighteenth peer of France according to his patent of 1661, he claimed through his wife to be duc de Piney of an old creation of 1571, which would place him second on the roll. The affair is described with St-Simon's usual interest in the peerage, and was chiefly checked through his assiduity. In the campaign of 1694, Luxembourg did little in Flanders, except conducting a famous march from Vignemont to Tournai in face of the enemy. Death On his return to Versailles for the winter he fell ill, and died. In his last moments he was attended by the famous Jesuit priest Bourdaloue, who said on his death, \\"I have not lived his life, but I would wish to die his death.\\" Luxembourg was considered immoral, even in those times, but as a general he was Cond√©'s grandest pupil. Though slothful like Cond√© in the management of a campaign, at the moment of battle he seemed seized with happy inspirations, against which no ardour of William's and no steadiness of Dutch or English soldiers could stand. His death and Catinat's disgrace close the second period of the military history of the reign of Louis XIV. Reputation St-Simon said of Luxembourg: > ...in his final calculations no one was ever more conscientious than M. de > Luxembourg; no one more brilliant, prudent and far-sighted in the face of > the enemy or in battle. He had daring and confidence, and at the same time a > cool-headedness that allowed him to observe and foresee in the midst of the > fiercest cannonade, in dangerously critical moments. That was when he was > truly great. At all other times he was idleness itself; no exercise, except > where absolutely necessary; gambling; conversing with intimates; every night > a small supper party; nearly always with the same company, and, if they > happened to be near a town, an agreeable mingling of the sexes.Historical > Memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, edited and translated by Lucy > Norton,(London, Hamish Hamilton, 1974), Volume 1, at pages 56-57 He was distinguished for a pungent wit. One of his retorts referred to his deformity. \\"I never can beat that cursed humpback\\", William was reputed to have said of him. \\"How does he know I have a hump?\\" retorted Luxembourg, \\"he has never seen my back.\\" He left four sons, the youngest of whom was a marshal of France as Marechal de Montmorency.

He attended Selwyn House School from 1939 to 1946,Selwyn House School Yearbook 1946 followed by Trinity College School from 1946 to 1949,TCS to present prestigious awards on Reunion Weekend and began his undergraduate education at McGill University where he received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in history in 1952. He continued his studies at the University of Oxford, first as a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, receiving a BA degree with first-class honours in philosophy, politics and economics in 1955, and then as a postgraduate student, receiving a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1961 under the supervision of Sir Isaiah Berlin. As an undergraduate student, he started one of the first campaigns to ban thermonuclear weapons in the United Kingdom in 1956, serving as the first president of the Oxford Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He succeeded John Plamenatz as Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at the University of Oxford and became a Fellow of All Souls College. For many years, both before and after Oxford, he was Professor of Political Science and Philosophy at McGill University in Montreal, where he is now professor emeritus. Taylor was also a Board of Trustees Professor of Law and Philosophy at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, for several years after his retirement from McGill. Taylor was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 1991, Taylor was appointed to the Conseil de la langue fran√ßaise in the province of Quebec, at which point he critiqued Quebec's commercial sign laws. In 1995, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 2000, he was made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 2003, he was awarded the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council's Gold Medal for Achievement in Research, which had been the council's highest honour. He was awarded the 2007 Templeton Prize for progress towards research or discoveries about spiritual realities, which included a cash award of US$1.5 million. In 2007 he and G√©rard Bouchard were appointed to head a one-year commission of inquiry into what would constitute reasonable accommodation for minority cultures in his home province of Quebec. In June 2008, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in the arts and philosophy category. The Kyoto Prize is sometimes referred to as the Japanese Nobel. In 2015, he was awarded the John W. Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity, a prize he shared with philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas. In 2016, he was awarded the inaugural $1-million Berggruen Prize for being \\"a thinker whose ideas are of broad significance for shaping human self-understanding and the advancement of humanity\\". Views Despite his extensive and diverse philosophical oeuvre, Taylor famously calls himself a \\"monomaniac\\", concerned with only one fundamental aspiration: to develop a convincing philosophical anthropology. In order to understand Taylor's views, it is helpful to understand his philosophical background, especially his writings on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Taylor rejects naturalism and formalist epistemology. He is part of an influential intellectual tradition of Canadian idealism that includes John Watson, Paxton Young, C. B. Macpherson, and George Grant. In his essay \\"To Follow a Rule\\", Taylor explores why people can fail to follow rules, and what kind of knowledge it is that allows a person to successfully follow a rule, such as the arrow on a sign. The intellectualist tradition presupposes that to follow directions, we must know a set of propositions and premises about how to follow directions. Taylor argues that Wittgenstein's solution is that all interpretation of rules draws upon a tacit background. This background is not more rules or premises, but what Wittgenstein calls \\"forms of life\\". More specifically, Wittgenstein says in the Philosophical Investigations that \\"Obeying a rule is a practice.\\" Taylor situates the interpretation of rules within the practices that are incorporated into our bodies in the form of habits, dispositions, and tendencies. Following Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michael Polanyi, and Wittgenstein, Taylor argues that it is mistaken to presuppose that our understanding of the world is primarily mediated by representations. It is only against an unarticulated background that representations can make sense to us. On occasion we do follow rules by explicitly representing them to ourselves, but Taylor reminds us that rules do not contain the principles of their own application: application requires that we draw on an unarticulated understanding or \\"sense of things\\"‚Äîthe background. Taylor's critique of naturalism Taylor defines naturalism as a family of various, often quite diverse theories that all hold \\"the ambition to model the study of man on the natural sciences\\". Philosophically, naturalism was largely popularized and defended by the unity of science movement that was advanced by logical positivist philosophy. In many ways, Taylor's early philosophy springs from a critical reaction against the logical positivism and naturalism that was ascendant in Oxford while he was a student. Initially, much of Taylor's philosophical work consisted of careful conceptual critiques of various naturalist research programs. This began with his 1964 dissertation The Explanation of Behaviour, which was a detailed and systematic criticism of the behaviourist psychology of B. F. Skinner that was highly influential at mid- century. From there, Taylor also spread his critique to other disciplines. The essay \\"Interpretation and the Sciences of Man\\" was published in 1972 as a critique of the political science of the behavioural revolution advanced by giants of the field like David Easton, Robert Dahl, Gabriel Almond, and Sydney Verba. In an essay entitled \\"The Significance of Significance: The Case for Cognitive Psychology\\", Taylor criticized the naturalism he saw distorting the major research program that had replaced B. F. Skinner's behaviourism. But Taylor also detected naturalism in fields where it was not immediately apparent. For example, in 1978's \\"Language and Human Nature\\" he found naturalist distortions in various modern \\"designative\\" theories of language, while in Sources of the Self (1989) he found both naturalist error and the deep moral, motivational sources for this outlook in various individualist and utilitarian conceptions of selfhood. Taylor and hermeneutics Taylor in 2012 Concurrent to Taylor's critique of naturalism was his development of an alternative. Indeed, Taylor's mature philosophy begins when as a doctoral student at Oxford he turned away, disappointed, from analytic philosophy in search of other philosophical resources which he found in French and German modern hermeneutics and phenomenology.\\"Interview with Charles Taylor: The Malaise of Modernity\\" by David Cayley, The hermeneutic tradition develops a view of human understanding and cognition as centred on the decipherment of meanings (as opposed to, say, foundational theories of brute verification or an apodictic rationalism). Taylor's own philosophical outlook can broadly and fairly be characterized as hermeneutic and has been called engaged hermeneutics. This is clear in his championing of the works of major figures within the hermeneutic tradition such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Heidegger, Merleau- Ponty, and Gadamer. It is also evident in his own original contributions to hermeneutic and interpretive theory. Communitarian critique of liberalism Taylor (as well as Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel) is associated with a communitarian critique of liberal theory's understanding of the \\"self\\". Communitarians emphasize the importance of social institutions in the development of individual meaning and identity. In his 1991 Massey Lecture The Malaise of Modernity, Taylor argued that political theorists‚Äîfrom John Locke and Thomas Hobbes to John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin‚Äîhave neglected the way in which individuals arise within the context supplied by societies. A more realistic understanding of the \\"self\\" recognizes the social background against which life choices gain importance and meaning. Philosophy and sociology of religion Taylor's later work has turned to the philosophy of religion, as evident in several pieces, including the lecture \\"A Catholic Modernity\\" and the short monograph \\"Varieties of Religion Today: William James Revisited\\".A Catholic Modernity?: Charles Taylor's Marianist Award Lecture, ed. James Heft (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999); Varieties of Religion Today (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002). Taylor's most significant contribution in this field to date is his book A Secular Age which argues against the secularization thesis of Max Weber, Steve Bruce, and others. In rough form, the secularization thesis holds that as modernity (a bundle of phenomena including science, technology, and rational forms of authority) progresses, religion gradually diminishes in influence. Taylor begins from the fact that the modern world has not seen the disappearance of religion but rather its diversification and in many places its growth. He then develops a complex alternative notion of what secularization actually means given that the secularization thesis has not been borne out. In the process, Taylor also greatly deepens his account of moral, political, and spiritual modernity that he had begun in Sources of the Self. Politics Taylor was a candidate for the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP) in Mount Royal on three occasions in the 1960s, beginning with the 1962 federal election when he came in third behind Liberal Alan MacNaughton. He improved his standing in 1963, coming in second. Most famously, he also lost in the 1965 election to newcomer and future prime minister, Pierre Trudeau. This campaign garnered national attention. Taylor's fourth and final attempt to enter the House of Commons of Canada was in the 1968 federal election, when he came in second as an NDP candidate in the riding of Dollard. In 1994 he coedited a paper on human rights with Vitit Muntarbhorn in Thailand. In 2008, he endorsed the NDP candidate in Westmount‚ÄîVille-Marie, Anne Lagac√© Dowson. He was also a professor to Canadian politician and former leader of the New Democratic Party Jack Layton. Taylor served as a vice president of the federal NDP (beginning ) and was president of its Quebec section. In 2010, Taylor said multiculturalism was a work in progress that faced challenges. He identified tackling Islamophobia in Canada as the next challenge. In his 2020 book Reconstructing Democracy he, together with Patrizia Nanz and Madeleine Beaubien Taylor, uses local examples to describe how democracies in transformations might be revitalized by involving citizenship.

He was the brother of le Grand Cond√© and Anne Genevi√®ve, Duchess of Longueville. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a Prince du Sang.  Early life  The title of Prince of Conti was revived in his favour in 1629 (his birth). With the title, Armand also inherited the Ch√¢teau de L'Isle-Adam and its estate, which had been passed down to his mother Charlotte Marguerite after the death of her brother, Henri II de Montmorency. He was destined for the church and studied theology at the university of Bourges, but although he received several benefices, included the abbeys of Cluny and Saint Denis, he did not take orders. He played a conspicuous part in the intrigues and fighting of the Fronde, became in 1648 commander-in-chief of the rebel army, and in 1650 was with his brother (Cond√©) and brother-in-law (Longueville) imprisoned at Vincennes.  Life in prison  Said to be \\"mystic\\" and \\"full of strange ideas\\", Conti turned slightly mad while in prison. Having a secret passion for his sister the Duchess of Longueville, he invented tricks to make her notice him. He tried alchemy and potions for some time and eventually bruised himself with a spatula. This episode was ultimately fortunate for him because he could no longer be refused external help from physicians, some of whom would pass letters and pleas to the outside world which speeded up his eventual release.  Later life  Released when Cardinal Mazarin went into exile, he wished to marry Charlotte-Marie de Lorraine (1627‚Äì1652), the second daughter of Madame de Chevreuse, the confidante of the queen, Anne of Austria (wife of King Louis XIII of France), but was prevented from doing so by his brother Cond√©, who was now supreme in the state. He was concerned in the Fronde of 1651, but soon afterwards became reconciled with Cardinal Mazarin, and in 1654, married the cardinal's niece, Anne Marie Martinozzi, as well as secured the government of Guienne. They had two sons, Louis Armand and Fran√ßois Louis. He took command of the army, which in 1654, invaded Spain through Catalonia, where he captured three towns from the Spanish. He afterwards led the French forces in Italy, but after his defeat before Alessandria in 1657, he retired to Languedoc, where he devoted himself to study and mysticism until his death. At Clermont, Conti had been a fellow student of Moli√®re's, from whom he secured an introduction to the court of King Louis XIV, but afterwards, when writing a treatise against the stage entitled, Trait√© de la com√©die et des spectacles selon les traditions de l'√âglise (Paris, 1667), he charged the dramatist with keeping a school of atheism. Conti also wrote Lettres sur la gr√¢ce, and Du devoir des grands et des devoirs des gouverneurs de province. Conti died on 26 February 1666 at P√©zenas in Languedoc, France. Issue Armand married Anne Marie Martinozzi, the daughter of Girolamo Martinozzi and Laura Margherita Mazzarini, elder sister of Cardinal Mazarin. They had the following children: #Louis de Bourbon (1658), died in infancy. #Louis Armand I, Prince of Conti (1661‚Äì1685), married Marie Anne de Bourbon, the eldest legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV and his mistress, Louise de La Valli√®re, and died childless. # Fran√ßois Louis, Prince of Conti (1664‚Äì1709), known as \\"le Grand Conti\\", married Marie Th√©r√®se de Bourbon, daughter of Henri Jules, Prince of Cond√© (Armand's nephew), and had issue.

On the left is Marie Louise, Gr√§fin Larisch von Moennich, the cousin of Crown Prince Rudolf who arranged assignations between him and Vetsera. Marie Alexandrine Freiin von Vetsera (19 March 1871 - 30 January 1889) was a member of Austrian \\"second society\\" (new nobility) and one of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria's mistresses. Vetsera and Rudolf were found dead by suicide, at his hunting lodge, Mayerling (see Mayerling Incident), in January 1889. Early life Known by the English form of her name, \\"Mary\\" (her maternal grandfather's second wife was English), she was the youngest child of Albin Freiherr von Vetsera, a diplomat in foreign service at the Austrian court,Markus, George, Crime at Mayerling: The Life and Death of Mary Vetsera, Ariadne Press, 1995, p. 23. and his much younger wife, H√©l√®ne (also known as Eleni) , member of a wealthy Greek noble family from Chios island, then part of the Ottoman Empire.Constantinople, Philip Mansel, Penguin Books Ltd, 1997, A woman of Vienna, Joachim von K√ºrenberg, Cassell, 1955, ASIN B001882BM8 Albin, who was made a Freiherr (Baron) in 1870 by the Emperor Franz Joseph, was 22 years older than his young and socially ambitious wife.The Androom Archives: Baltazzi, Alexander, Christopher Aidan LongBaron Albin Vetsera Mary had three siblings: Johanna (known as Hannah), Ladislaus, and Franz Albin. Both of H√©l√®ne's sisters had married a Graf (count), and Mary and her sister were expected to raise the family's social status by continuing the tradition of marrying into families of importance.Tosoni, Peter, The Mayerling Tragedy: How and Why did Prince Rudolf and Mary Vetsera Die?, The Durham University Journal 84, no. 2, 1992, p. 204. Mary Freiin (Baroness) von Vetsera attended a finishing school for nobility. These exclusive boarding schools, for girls of noble birth between the ages of 12 and 17, were geared to a moral education, not an academic one (which was thought to give a young woman \\"intellectual pretensions\\"). Those institutes emphasized social graces: French, music, drawing, dancing, and handicrafts, preparing young women for their roles in society as aristocratic wives and mothers. \\"Smart Society\\", made up of parvenu elements, who were \\"poor in pedigree\\", but full in purse, now began to command more attention from the leaders in more aristocratic circles of the beau monde.Grant, Hamil, ed., The Last Days of Archduke Rudolph, Dodd, Mead & Co, 1916, p. 114 The Vetsera family occupied this niche, and H√©l√®ne Freifrau von Vetsera held lavish parties in attempts to socialize with the upper echelons of the Austrian court, all in order to introduce her daughter to the most eligible men. Famous for \\"her elegance and taste in dress\\", the attractive and vivacious young Baroness soon acquired the nickname \\"The Turf Angel\\" for her love of horserace meets at the Freudenau course.Morton, Frederick, A Nervous Splendor, Penguin Press, 1980 It was very apparent to the Imperial family, that Vetsera was being blatantly groomed by her mother for an advantageous marriage; Empress Elisabeth noted in 1877: \\"Madame Vetsera wants to come to Court and gain recognition for her family.\\" Gr√§fin Larisch von Moennich, a niece of the Empress and one of Vetsera's closest friends, claimed she had confided: \\"Mamma has no love for me. ... Ever since I was a little girl she has treated me like something she means to dispose of to the best advantage.\\"Larisch, Marie, My Past, p. 241. Relationship with Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria The young Mary Freiin von Vetsera met Crown Prince Rudolf in November 1888 and began a three-month-long affair with him. Other accounts, however, describe their relationship as being one of three years' duration, which would have made Vetsera about 15 when they met. > [At Ambassador Reuss's reception in late January 1889] Rudolph noticed me > and leaving St√©phanie came straight up to me. \\"She is there,\\" he said > without any preamble, \\"ah, if somebody would only deliver me from her!\\" > \\"She\\" was Mary Vetsera, his mistress of the ardent face. I, too, glanced at > the seductress. Two brilliant eyes met mine. One word will describe her. > Mary was an imperial sultana, one who feared no other favourite, so sure was > she of the power of her full and triumphant beauty, her deep black eyes, her > cameo-like profile, her throat of a goddess, and her arresting sensual > grace. She had altogether taken possession of Rudolph, and she longed for > him to be able to marry her. Their liaison had lasted for three years...At > the soir√©e I was struck by my brother-in-law's state of nervous exhaustion > but I thought it well to try and calm him by saying a word or two about Mary > which would please him, so I remarked quite simply: \\"She is very > beautiful\\"...Rudolph left me without replying. An instant later he returned > and murmured: \\"I simply cannot tear myself away from her.\\" ‚Äì Louise of > CoburgLouise of Coburg, My Own Affairs, George H. Doran Co., 1921, p.120 Given her mother's ambitions for her and the fact that Rudolf was married to Princess Stephanie of Belgium, her family and friends found this liaison to be not only foolish, but potentially socially compromising for the family as well. When H√©l√®ne discovered that Vetsera had sent Rudolf a personally engraved cigarette case, she raged: \\"She is compromising herself when she is scarcely 17 years old and so is ruining not only her life but also that of her brothers and sisters and mother...\\"Markus, George, Crime at Mayerling: The Life and Death of Mary Vetsera: With New Expert Opinions Following the Desecration of Her Grave, Ariadne Press, 1995, p. 30. Maureen Allen, an American friend of Vetsera, recalled that she did not take the affair ‚Äì or any of her earlier ones ‚Äì frivolously: \\"[she] was very serious...people gave her credit for not taking love lightly, but rather quite seriously.\\" While Rudolf had not only a wife and child, but other lovers as well, Vetsera did not pursue any other eligible men, but instead focused all her attention on the crown prince. She appears to have thought she could be a credible threat to Princess Stephanie, perhaps even to usurping her position and title,Larisch, Marie, My Past, p. 237: \\"[T]hat stupid Crown Princess knows I am her rival.\\" but seems to have been ignorant of the fact that Rudolf was simultaneously having a serious affair with the actress Mizzi Kaspar.Serge Schmemann \\"Mayerling Journal; Lurid Truth and Lurid Legend: A Hapsburg Tale\\" in New York Times dated 10 March 1989 online at nytimes.com, Retrieved 10 April 2009: \\"According to Mrs Hamann's research, Prince Rudolf had in fact contemplated suicide for at least a half year before his death. He initially asked the first love of his life, one Mitzi Kaspar, to share his fate, but the 24-year- old woman declined. By contrast, 17-year-old Mary Vetsera, the dark and pudgy daughter of an Hungarian-Armenian baron (Vecsera), was madly in love and willing to do anything for Rudolf. So on Jan. 29, 1889, he took her to his favorite hunting lodge, and the next morning shot her and himself in their bedroom\\" Rudolf is reported to have proposed a similar suicide pact to the 24-year-old Kaspar a month before his death at Mayerling, which she rejected, presuming it to be a joke.Morton, Frederick, A Nervous Splendour, Penguin Press, 1980, p. 219 Vetsera may have been Rudolf's second choice in his search for a partner in death, but it appears she did not interpret his proposal as a notion of a desperate man not wanting to die alone. Her family and friends took pains to emphasize that the emperor and the Vatican would never countenance the dissolution of Rudolf's marriage, and Vetsera no doubt realized that at some point she would have to fulfill her obligation to her family and marry someone who was Rudolf's inferior. > ‚Äú[I]f I could give him my life I should be glad to do it, for what does life > mean for me?‚ÄùMarkus, Georg, Crime at Mayerling: The Life and Death of Mary > Vetsera: With New Expert Opinions Following the Desecration of Her Grave, > Ariadne Press, 1995, p. 28 One of his secretaries is quite emphatic that while Vetsera, whom he saw as a \\"somewhat superficial and emotional maid\\"Grant, Hamil, ed., The Last Days of Archduke Rudolph, Dodd, Mead & Co, 1916, p. 110 who, while displaying \\"a vivacity and sparkle that would have done justice to a very bright Frenchwoman\\",Grant, Hamil, ed., The Last Days of Archduke Rudolph, Dodd, Mead & Co, 1916, p. 111 was \\"a woman without serious thought\\" and was not the type of woman who usually appealed to the intellectually inclined Rudolf, although he acknowledged that Rudolf was interested in the political opinions of his other lovers to the extent that they were known to be reflections of what their male relatives thought.Grant, Hamil, ed., The Last Days of Archduke Rudolph, Dodd, Mead & Co, 1916, p. 112 Rudolf's close friend, Professor Udel, further explained his master's \\"strange choice\\": He said that Vetsera shared a certain \\"mystic temperament\\" with the archduke, who could be \\"the most mystical of men\\" in that he displayed a \\"strong vein of superstition\\".

Vetsera\\" Vetsera's letter of farewell to her mother Without a judicial inquiry, Freiin von Vetsera's uncles were summoned to remove their niece's body from Mayerling as secretly as possible, and to bury it just as discreetly. Her mother was forbidden to attend. One account posits that this was accomplished that night, with the body of their niece sitting in the carriage between them, propped up by a broomstick pushed up the back of her dress. Vetsera's body was taken to a cemetery at the Cistercian monastery a few miles away in Heiligenkreuz, but because her death was thought at that time to be a suicide, her uncles had to persuade the Abbot to give his permission for a Christian burial on the grounds that she \\"had committed suicide because of a temporary loss of her senses\\". It was only later that the official version of the story surfaced, affirming that Rudolf had shot Vetsera and then himself. On 16 May 1889, Freifrau von Vetsera had her daughter's grave opened and reburied her a few yards away in a more permanent site. The wooden coffin was replaced by a copper one, and a simple monument was erected by the family. The official story of murder-suicide was unchallenged until just after the Second World War. In 1946, occupying Soviet troops, perhaps hoping to loot the jewels and other valuable items they presumed were interred within, dislodged the granite plate covering the grave and broke into Vetsera's coffin at the Heiligenkreuz Abbey. This was not discovered until 1955, when the Red Army withdrew from Austria. When the fathers of the monastery repaired the grave, they saw a small skeleton inside the damaged copper coffin. They observed the skull, which seemed to have no bullet holes in it. In 1959, a young physician named Gerd Holler, who was stationed in the area, accompanied by a member of the Vetsera family as well as specialists in funereal preservation, inspected her remains. The bones were in total disarray, but Vetsera's shoes and a quantity of long black hair were found in the coffin. Dr. Holler carefully examined the skull and other bones for traces of a bullet hole, but stated that he found no such wound. The skull cavity did show an area of trauma, which could have been inflicted by Red Army soldiers, but also potentially indicated that Vetsera had died from a blow to her skull. This would support the theory that she was not murdered by the Crown Prince. Intrigued, Holler claimed he petitioned the Holy See to inspect their 1889 archives of the incident, in which the investigation of the affair by the Papal Nuncio's (Luigi Galimberti) found that only one bullet was fired. Lacking forensic evidence of a second bullet, Holler advanced the theory that Vetsera died accidentally, probably as the result of an abortion, and it was Rudolf who consequently shot himself.Holler, Gerd, Mayerling: Die Loesung des Ratsels [Mayerling: The Solution to the Riddle], Molden, 1983 Holler witnessed the body's re-interment in a new coffin in 1959. In 1991, Vetsera's remains were disturbed again, this time by Helmut Flatzelsteiner, a Linz furniture dealer who was obsessed with the Mayerling affair. It was initially reported that her bones were strewn round the churchyard for the authorities to retrieve, but Flatzelsteiner actually removed them at night for a private forensic examination at his expense, which finally took place in February 1993.Pannell, Robert, Murder at Mayerling?, in History Today, Volume 58, No. 11, November 2008, p. 67. Flatzelsteiner told the examiners that the remains were those of a relative killed some one hundred years earlier who may have been shot in the head or stabbed. One expert thought that this might be possible, but since the skull was in a state of advanced decomposition, it could not be confirmed. When Flatzelsteiner approached a journalist at the Kronen Zeitung to sell both the story and Vetsera's skeleton, the police became involved. Flatzelsteiner confessed and surrendered Vetsera's remains, which were sent to the Legal Medical Institute in Vienna for further examination. Forensic experts found the bones were indeed a hundred years old and those of a young woman around twenty, but since part of the skull was missing, it could not be determined if there had ever been a bullet hole present or not.Markus, Georg, Crime at Mayerling: The Life and Death of Mary Vetsera: With New Expert Opinions Following the Desecration of Her Grave, Ariadne Press, 1995 Vetsera's bones were re-interred on the morning of 28 October 1993, under the supervision of Abbot Gerhard Hradil. After a court case, Flatzelsteiner paid the abbey some ‚Ç¨2,000 by way of incurred damages to the deceased's grave. In his book Crime at Mayerling, The Life and Death of Mary Vetsera, Georg Markus claims that what happened at Mayerling was never seriously investigated, and the few investigations that were made were falsified ‚Äì manipulated by the Imperial monarchy. However, on 31 July 2015 the Austrian National Library issued copies of Vetsera's letters of farewell to her mother and other family members. These letters, previously believed lost or destroyed, were found in a safe deposit box in an Austrian bank, where they had been deposited in 1926. The letters, written in Mayerling shortly before the deaths, state clearly and unambiguously that Vetsera was preparing to commit suicide alongside Rudolf, out of \\"love\\". They will be made available to scholars and were likely to be exhibited in public in 2016.Press release from the Austrian National Library, 31 July 2015 (German) Further reading * References External links The Vetsera Collection * Eulogy on Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary 1871 births 1889 deaths Austrian baronesses Mistresses of Austrian royalty Burials at Heiligenkreuz Abbey Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria Joint suicides Nobility from Vienna Austrian people of Greek descent Female suicides ","title":"Baroness Mary Vetsera"},{"id":"295005","text":"Bowen therapy may refer to: * Bowen technique, a remedial massage technique founded by Tom Bowen * Bowen therapy, a psychoanalytic therapy devised by Murray Bowen ","title":"Bowen therapy"},{"id":"295010","text":"Wonalancet (16191697) also spelled Wannalancet and Wannalancit and probably Wanaloset and Wanalosett ‚Äî was a sachem or sagamore of the Penacook Indians.

She was famously widowed in 1889 when Rudolf and his mistress, Mary Vetsera, were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide pact at the Imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling in the Vienna Woods. Her grandfather Leopold I of Belgium was the country's first king. Her aunt, Charlotte of Belgium, the future ill-fated Empress of Mexico, was married to Maximilian, the brother of her future father-in law, the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph.  Early life  St√©phanie Clotilde Louise Herminie Marie Charlotte was born at the Royal Palace of Laeken in the Kingdom of Belgium. Her mother, Queen Marie Henriette, was an Archduchess of Austria by birth and aunt to the Queen of Spain. Her father, Leopold II of Belgium, finally became King of the Belgians in December 1865. The royal couple were ill-suited for each other and had an unhappy marriage. The contradictory Leopold II was serious and delicate. Marie Henriette was undisciplined, outspoken, and boisterous. Leopold was openly abrasive to her, and tried to dominate her with his criticisms and frequent infidelity. While her natural charm made Marie Henriette more popular with her Belgian subjects than her husband, she eventually retired from court life to escape him, and lived the rest of her life in Spa near the Ardennes.Aronson, Theo, The Coburgs of Belgium, Cassell & Company Ltd., 1968 Leopold had little interest in St√©phanie and her older sister Princess Louise, and the education of his daughters was neglected as he focused all his doting attention on his son, Prince L√©opold, Duke of Brabant, the future of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty in Belgium. Tragically, when he was nine Prince Leopold caught pneumonia and died. His father never recovered. He reconciled briefly with Marie Henriette solely in the hope of producing another male heir, but the result was the birth of Princess Cl√©mentine in 1872. Leopold thereafter lost interest in his family. He turned his attentions to the notorious creation of the Congo Free State, which was his personal fiefdom and not a Belgian colonial territory, and as such its ruthless exploitation amassed him a vast private fortune.Hochschild, Adam, King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa, Mariner Books, 1999 Leopold also rejected his family for his mistresses; he had so many scandalous liaisons that he was known to his subjects as Le Roi des Belges et des Belles (‚ÄúThe King of the Belgians and of the Beauties‚Äù). In 1909, on his deathbed, he married his favorite mistress in an attempt to expunge the sin of infidelity.  Crown Princess of Austria  Official engagement photograph of the Imperial couple, 1881 = Engagement = Brought up in the unhappy life that was the product of their parents' arranged marriage, St√©phanie and her sister did no better in their own. Louise married her second cousin, Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg, a harsh man who was fourteen years her senior. After she eloped with her lover, Leopold had her committed to a mental asylum. She was finally granted a divorce in 1907. In March 1880, Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria was invited to the Belgian court at the insistence of Leopold II. Rudolf arrived in Brussels on 5 March. After meeting the fifteen-year-old Princess St√©phanie, he wrote to his mother, Empress Elisabeth that \\"[he had] found what [he] sought,\\" noting that she was \\"pretty, good, [and] clever\\". Having refused Princess Mathilde of Saxony, as well as several Infantas of Portugal and Spain, he found that St√©phanie was one of the few available Catholic princesses in Europe. Under pressure by his parents to marry as soon as possible, the Crown Prince was satisfied with her and by the 7th of March, he asked for her hand and announced their engagement. Rudolf's mother was deeply disappointed with the match as the Belgian monarchy dated only from 1830 and did not compare to the Habsburgs in terms of seniority, even though its royal house was a branch of that of Saxony (one of the oldest ruling houses in Europe). Rudolf's father was pleased, however, and approved the marriage. = Wedding = The Crown Princess with her daughter in 1885 St√©phanie was despatched to Vienna to be taught Imperial court etiquette in preparation for her marriage but a month after her arrival, the ladies-in- waiting realized that she had not yet reached puberty. When the obvious questions were put to her, it became clear that she had no idea what was meant; she had been left completely ignorant of the facts of life. The wedding had to be postponed, and the humiliated girl was sent back to Belgium for a time.Schiel, Irmgard. Stephanie. Kronprinzessin im Schatten von Mayerling. Stuttgart: Deutsche-Verlags Anstalt, 1978. The emperor bestowed Walthere Frere-Orban the grand Cross of Saint-Stephen and the Empress bestowed multiple Ladies the honour of the Starry Cross.Handelsblad (Het) 07-05-1881 On 10 May 1881, a little over a week before her seventeenth birthday, Princess St√©phanie of Belgium married the Crown Prince in the Saint Augustine's Church in Vienna. Her parents walked her down the aisle. Among the illustrious attendees were the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and his nephew, the future German Emperor Wilhelm II. The nuptials were celebrated lavishly throughout Austria, and the Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa named asteroid 220 Stephania in her honour in 1881. After the ceremony, the couple honeymooned at Laxenburg outside the capital. On 18 May the couple was welcomed in Budapest.Handelsblad (Het) 19-05-1881 Crown Princess St√©phanie of Austria- Hungary, mid 1890s =Crown Princess= The marriage was happy at first, but difficulties reportedly developed. Though intelligent, Rudolf was highly strung, unconventional, impulsive and very liberal, while St√©phanie's very conservative upbringing left her conventional, formal, and reactionary. Their only child, Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria, was born at Laxenburg Castle on 2 September 1883. She was known within the family as \\"Erzsi,\\" short for \\"Erzs√©bet,\\" the Hungarian form of \\"Elisabeth.\\" Stephanie received little support from the Imperial family during her marriage. Empress Elisabeth avoided St√©phanie and disdained her, believing her to be an inadequate match for her son. The relationship between Stephanie and Rudolf broke down quickly. In 1886, Rudolf infected Stephanie with gonorrhea which made further pregnancies impossible, and they reportedly discussed divorce. Both began to seek consolation outside their marriage. During a visit to Galicia (presently, a region divided between Poland and Ukraine) in 1887, St√©phanie fell in love with a Polish Count. During the next eighteen months, she did not try to hide her affections for the count from her husband, who continued his own liaisons. In 1889 Rudolf and Baroness Mary Vetsera, his lover, were found dead. Their murder-suicide pact is known as the Mayerling incident.  Later life  Elem√©r L√≥nyay, St√©phanie's second husband St√©phanie married again on 22 March 1900 at Miramare. The groom was Prince L√≥nyay de Nagy-L√≥nya et V√°s√°rosnam√©ny (Bodrogolaszi, 24 August 1863 - Budapest, 20 July 1946), a Hungarian nobleman of unequal rank who, in 1917, was elevated by the Emperor of Austria to the rank of F√ºrst. Her father was so furious at the marriage that he forbade St√©phanie to see her dying mother. She settled with her new husband in his castle Oroszv√°r - Rusovce in western Hungary, modern-day Slovakia, until the advancing Red Army forced them to flee their estate. They found sanctuary in Pannonhalma Archabbey, near Gy√∂rszentm√°rton, Hungary. In 1935 she wanted to publish her memoir to set the record straight, but this caused a scandal and a court forbade their distribution. Police visited every bookshop in Vienna in order to seize the copies already on sale. In it she published Rudolf's last letter to her, and proclaimed that (in her view) he and the Baronness had made a suicide pact. Her memoir was eventually published outside of Austria in 1937 as Ich sollte Kaiserin werden (I Was To Be Empress). St√©phanie died at Pannonhalma on 23 August 1945.

Discovered and imprisoned in Paris, he wrote his play Caton d'Utique (1794) during his imprisonment. In 1803 he won the Institut de France's poetry prize. √âl√©onore de Bavi√®re and Les Templiers were accepted by the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Les Templiers was produced in 1805, and, over the opposition of Geoffroy, was a great success. Elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1807, elected to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1816, Raynouard was admitted secr√©taire perp√©tuel of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1817.Tyrt√©e Taster, Histoire des quarante fauteuils de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, √âditions Lacroix, 1855. From 1806 to 1814 he represented the department of Var in the Corps l√©gislatif. Raynouard wrote other plays, one of which, Les √âtats de Blois (acted 1810), offended Napoleon by its freedom of speech. Realizing that the public taste had changed and that Romanticism would triumph, Raynouard abandoned the stage and devoted himself to linguistic studies. His researches into Proven√ßal were to an extent inaccurate, but his enthusiasm and perseverance opened the way for the study of the subject. Raynouard is sometimes called the founder of Romance linguistics, although his contribution was marked by a fundamental misconception: he believed that the Romance languages were derived from a common post-Latin language, which he called le roman,This term he more or less equates with Old Proven√ßal. Raynouard's contemporary August Schlegel (Obs√©rvations sur la langue et la litt√©rature proven√ßales, pp. 39‚Äì) puts forward his own correction of this point. and not directly from Latin, as is in fact the case.Iordan-Orr, An Introduction to Romance Linguistics: Its Schools and Scholars, revised by R.

It was once the heart of the city: Seattle's founders settled there in 1852, following a brief six-month settlement at Alki Point on the far side of Elliott Bay. The early structures in the neighborhood were mostly wooden, and nearly all burned in the Great Seattle Fire of 1889.

It is bounded roughly by Alaskan Way S. on the west, beyond which are the docks of Elliott Bay; by S. King Street on the south, beyond which is SoDo; by 5th Avenue S. on the east, beyond which is the International District; and it extends between one and two blocks north of Yesler Way, beyond which is the rest of Downtown. Because Yesler Way marks the boundary between two different plats, the street grid north of Yesler does not line up with the neighborhood's other streets (nor with the compass), so the northern border of the district zigzags along numerous streets.

Much of the neighborhood is on landfill: in pioneer times, the area roughly between First and Second Avenue, bounded on the south by Jackson Street, and extending north almost to Yesler Way (about two-and-a-half city blocks) was a low-lying offshore island. The mainland shore roughly followed what is now Yesler Way to about Fourth Avenue, then ran southeast, at an angle of about 45 degrees to the current shoreline. Slightly inland were steep bluffs, which were largely smoothed away by regrading in the late 19th and early 20th century. =\\"Below the Line\\"= Yesler Way, originally Mill Street, is the main east-west street through the Pioneer Square neighborhood. Immediately south of the square itself, it was the dividing line between Maynard's original claim (to the south) and Boren's (to the north). It became Deadline, the northern border of the Great Restricted District, Maynardtown, Down on the Sawdust, the Lava Beds, the Tenderloin, White Chapel, or Wappyville, (after Charles Wappenstein, after a particularly corrupt police chief.), where low entertainment and vice were long tolerated. One of the earliest names, and one that stuck well into second half of the 20th century, was \\"Skid Row\\". Source for \\"South of the Slot\\" and \\"Below the Line\\". 1st Ave S, Pioneer Square district, 1901 Henry Broderick, approaching his 80th birthday in 1959, wrote of the neighborhood south of Yesler, \\"[P]erhaps never in all history, certainly not in America, has there ever existed such a massive collection of the demimonde grouped in a restricted area.\\" There were \\"parlor houses\\" with marquees, celebrity madames‚Äîamong them Lou Graham, Lila Young, and Raw McRoberts‚Äîand piano \\"professors\\". Scrupulous in their dealings, the parlor houses were completely tolerated by the city at the time, but there were also the far more controversial \\"crib houses\\" such as the Midway, the Paris and Dreamland near the corner of Sixth Avenue South and King Street. Each had a hundred or more cubicles‚Äî\\"cribs\\"‚Äîand they were not known for any particular honesty in their dealings. The city health department conducted inspections and attempted to keep venereal disease under control, but the state of medicine at the time was not such as to give them any great chance of success. Besides the brothels there were \\"an ungodly mixture of dives, dumps... pawnshops, hash houses, dope parlors and... the et cetera that kept the police guessing.\\" Box houses prospered, part theater, part bar, part brothel, as did all sorts of gambling. Police only dared enter the neighborhood in teams. Perhaps the only safe haven in the neighborhood was the saloon \\"Our House\\", which rented out safe deposit boxes. In 1870, Father Francis Xavier Prefontaine founded Seattle's first Catholic Church, the Church of Our Lady of Good Help in the heart of this district, at Third Avenue South and Washington Street. Two decades later, Lou Graham opened the city's most famous parlor house diagonally across the street. Father Prefontaine is commemorated by a street in the neighborhood, Prefontaine Place.Junius Rochester, Prefontaine, Father Francis Xavier (1838-1909), HistoryLink, December 2, 1998.

That same year, the Great Seattle Fire resulted in the complete destruction of Pioneer Square. However, the economy was strong at the time, so Pioneer Square was quickly rebuilt. Many of the new buildings show the influence of the Romanesque Revival architectural mode, although influence of earlier Victorian modes is also widespread. Because of drainage problems new development was built at a higher level literally burying the remains of old Pioneer Square. Anticipating the planned regrade, many buildings were built with two entrances, one at the old, low level, and another higher up. Visitors can take the Seattle Underground Tour to see what remains of the old storefronts. Just before the fire, cable car service was instituted from Pioneer Square along Yesler Way to Lake Washington and the Leschi neighborhood. =20th century= Pioneer Square, March 17, 1917. In the upper-right is the Smith Tower. Below it is the Seattle Hotel. On the left are the Pioneer Building and the pergola. During the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 and 1898, Seattle was a center for travel to Alaska. Thousands of so-called \\"stampeders\\" passed through Seattle making the city's merchants prosperous. Pioneer Square totem pole in 2008 In 1899, a group of businessmen stole a Tlingit totem pole and placed it in Pioneer Place Park. When an arsonist destroyed the pole in 1938, the city sent the pieces back to the Tlingit tribe who carved a new one and gave it to Seattle (after finally getting paid for the one that was originally stolen). In addition to the totem pole, a wrought-iron Victorian pergola designed by Julian F. Everett (Pioneer Square pergola), originally known as a comfort station and highly touted in tourism marketing, and a bust of Chief Seattle were added to the park in 1909. 1914 saw the completion of the Smith Tower, which at the time was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. However, by that time, the heart of Downtown Seattle had moved north.

The cable car line serving the area was shut down on August 10, 1940. 1960s In the 1960s, Pioneer Square became a target of urban renewal. One proposal was to replace the buildings with parking garages to serve Downtown Seattle. In 1962, the historic Seattle Hotel was replaced with one such parking garage, commonly referred to as the \\"Sinking Ship\\" garage because of its appearance when viewed from 1st and Yesler; it stands to this day. Another proposal was to build a ring road which would have required destroying many of Pioneer Square's buildings. Many buildings were saved by the \\"benign neglect\\" of landowner Sam Israel.Paul Dorpat, An Art-full Restoration, Pacific Northwest Magazine, a Sunday supplement to the Seattle Times, January 26, 2003.

Accessed online December 3, 2007. In 1970, preservationists such as Bill Speidel, Victor Steinbrueck, and others succeeded in listing the neighborhood as historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Later that year, Pioneer Square became a city preservation district. 1980s Streetcar service returned to Pioneer Square on May 29, 1982, with the opening of the Waterfront Streetcar. The streetcar discontinued service on November 19, 2005 since its carbarn was razed to make room for the Olympic Sculpture Park. =21st century= Today, Pioneer Square is home to art galleries, internet companies, caf√©s, sports bars, nightclubs, bookstores, and a unit of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, the other unit of which is located in Skagway, Alaska. Fallen Firefighters Memorial Each spring since 1989, on the weekend nearest June 6, the city has celebrated the Pioneer Square Fire Festival with a parade and display of antique and modern fire apparatus, demonstrations of fire fighter skills, food and craft booths, and a party. On June 6, 1998, the anniversary of the 1889 fire, fell on a Saturday. This year the Festival took on additional meaning when the Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial was dedicated. Thanks to the work of Battalion Chief Wes Goss and his Memorial Committee the bronze sculpture was now in place. On a granite block is inscribed the name of each Seattle fire fighter who died in the line of duty.SFD History:The 1990s. SFD History:The 1990s. Seattle Firefighters IAFF Local 27.

He was born at Rennes, and educated there and at the Coll√®ge Louis le Grand in Paris. He took orders and for some time was a mere usher, eventually becoming professor of rhetoric at the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations. His tragedy, Caton, was accepted at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais, but was never performed. On the death of √âlie Fr√©ron in 1776 the other collaborators in the Ann√©e litt√©raire asked Geoffroy to succeed him, and he conducted the journal until its closure in 1792. Geoffroy was a bitter critic of Voltaire and his followers, and made for himself many enemies. An enthusiastic royalist, he published, with Fr√©ron's brother-in-law, the abb√© Thomas Royou (1741‚Äì1792), a journal, L'Ami du roi (1790‚Äì1792), which possibly did more harm than good to the king's cause by its ill-advised partisanship. During the Reign of Terror, Geoffroy hid in the neighbourhood of Paris, only returning in 1799. An attempt to revive the Ann√©e litt√©raire failed, and Geoffroy undertook the position of theatre critic of the Journal des D√©bats. His scathing criticisms had a success of notoriety, but their popularity was ephemeral, and the publication of them (5 vols., 1819‚Äì1820) as Cours de litt√©rature dramatique proved a failure. He was also the author of a perfunctory Commentaire on the works of Jean Racine prefixed to Lenormant's edition (1808).

While early messaging systems used a variety of formats for addressing, today, email addresses follow a set of specific rules originally standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the 1980s, and updated by RFC 5322 and RFC 6854. An email address, such as john.smith@example.com, is made up from a local-part, the symbol @, and a domain name. Although the standard requires the local part to be case-sensitive, it also urges that receiving hosts deliver messages in a case-independent manner, e.g., that the mail system in the domain example.com treat John.Smith as equivalent to john.smith; some mail systems even treat them as equivalent to johnsmith.\\"...you can add or remove the dots from a Gmail address without changing the actual destination address; and they'll all go to your inbox...\\", Google.com Mail systems often limit the users' choice of name to a subset of the technically permitted characters. With the introduction of internationalized domain names, efforts are progressing to permit non-ASCII characters in email addresses. Message transport The general format of an email address is local- part@domain, and a specific example is jsmith@example.com. Thus, an address consists of two principal parts, a username and a domain name. The domain name is used to transport a mail message to the host of the recipient's mail system. The transmission of electronic mail from the author's computer and between mail hosts in the Internet uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), defined in , and extensions such as RFC 6531. The mailboxes may be accessed and managed by user applications on personal computers or mobile devices, as well as with webmail, with the Post Office Protocol (POP) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). When transmitting email messages, mail user agents (MUAs) and mail transfer agents (MTAs) use the domain name system (DNS) to look up a Resource Record (RR) for the recipient's domain. A mail exchanger resource record (MX record) contains the name of the recipient's mailserver. In absence of an MX record, an address record (A or AAAA) directly specifies the mail host. The local part of an email address has no significance for intermediate mail relay systems other than the final mailbox host. Email senders and intermediate relay systems must not assume it to be case-insensitive, since the final mailbox host may or may not treat it as such. A single mailbox may receive mail for multiple email addresses, if configured by the administrator. Conversely, a single email address may be the alias to a distribution list to many mailboxes. Email aliases, electronic mailing lists, sub-addressing, and catch-all addresses, the latter being mailboxes that receive messages regardless of the local part, are common patterns for achieving a variety of delivery goals. The addresses found in the header fields of an email message are not directly used by mail exchanges to deliver the message. An email message also contains a message envelope that contains the information for mail routing. While envelope and header addresses may be equal, forged email addresses are often seen in spam, phishing, and many other Internet-based scams. This has led to several initiatives which aim to make such forgeries easier to spot. Syntax The format of an email address is local-part@domain, where the local part may be up to 64 octets long and the domain may have a maximum of 255 octets. The formal definitions are in RFC 5322 (sections 3.2.3 and 3.4.1) and RFC 5321‚Äîwith a more readable form given in the informational RFC 3696 and the associated errata. An email address also may have an associated display name for the recipient, which precedes the address specification, now surrounded by angled brackets, for example: John Smith . Earlier forms of email addresses for other networks than the Internet included other notations, such as that required by X.400, and the UUCP bang path notation, in which the address was given in the form of a sequence of computers through which the message should be relayed. This was widely used for several years, but was superseded by the Internet standards promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). = Local-part = The local-part of the email address may be unquoted or may be enclosed in quotation marks. If unquoted, it may use any of these ASCII characters: * uppercase and lowercase Latin letters \`A\` to \`Z\` and \`a\` to \`z\` * digits \`0\` to \`9\` * printable characters \`!#$%&'*+-/=?^_\`{}~\` * dot \`.\`, provided that it is not the first or last character and provided also that it does not appear consecutively (e.g., \`John..Doe@example.com\` is not allowed). If quoted, it may contain Space, Horizontal Tab (HT), any ASCII graphic except Backslash and Quote and a quoted-pair consisting of a Backslash followed by HT, Space or any ASCII graphic; it may also be split between lines anywhere that HT or Space appears. In contrast to unquoted local-parts, the addresses \`\\".John.Doe\\"@example.com\`, \`\\"John.Doe.\\"@example.com\` and \`\\"John..Doe\\"@example.com\` are allowed. The maximum total length of the local- part of an email address is 64 octets. Note that some mail servers support wildcard recognition of local parts, typically the characters following a plus and less often the characters following a minus, so fred+bah@domain and fred+foo@domain might end up in the same inbox as fred+@domain or even as fred@domain. This can be useful for tagging emails for sorting (see below), and for spam control. Braces \`{\` and \`}\` are also used in that fashion, although less often. * space and special characters \`\\"(),:;<>@[\\\\]\` are allowed with restrictions (they are only allowed inside a quoted string, as described in the paragraph below, and in addition, a backslash or double-quote must be preceded by a backslash); * comments are allowed with parentheses at either end of the local-part; e.g., \`john.smith(comment)@example.com\` and \`(comment)john.smith@example.com\` are both equivalent to \`john.smith@example.com\`. In addition to the above ASCII characters, international characters above U+007F, encoded as UTF-8, are permitted by RFC 6531, though even mail systems that support SMTPUTF8 and 8BITMIME may restrict which characters to use when assigning local-parts. A local part is either a Dot-string or a Quoted-string; it cannot be a combination. Quoted strings and characters, however, are not commonly used. RFC 5321 also warns that \\"a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where the Local- part requires (or uses) the Quoted-string form\\". The local-part \`postmaster\` is treated specially‚Äîit is case-insensitive, and should be forwarded to the domain email administrator. Technically all other local-parts are case- sensitive, therefore \`jsmith@example.com\` and \`JSmith@example.com\` specify different mailboxes; however, many organizations treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. Indeed, RFC 5321 warns that \\"a host that expects to receive mail SHOULD avoid defining mailboxes where ... the Local-part is case- sensitive\\". Despite the wide range of special characters which are technically valid, organisations, mail services, mail servers and mail clients in practice often do not accept all of them. For example, Windows Live Hotmail only allows creation of email addresses using alphanumerics, dot (\`.\`), underscore (\`_\`) and hyphen (\`-\`).. However, the phrase is hidden, thus one has to either check the availability of an invalid ID, e.g., me#1, or resort to alternative displaying, e.g., no-style or source view, in order to read it. Common advice is to avoid using some special characters to avoid the risk of rejected emails. = Domain = The domain name part of an email address has to conform to strict guidelines: it must match the requirements for a hostname, a list of dot-separated DNS labels, each label being limited to a length of 63 characters and consisting of: * uppercase and lowercase Latin letters \`A\` to \`Z\` and \`a\` to \`z\`; * digits \`0\` to \`9\`, provided that top-level domain names are not all-numeric; * hyphen \`-\`, provided that it is not the first or last character. This rule is known as the LDH rule (letters, digits, hyphen). In addition, the domain may be an IP address literal, surrounded by square brackets \`[]\`, such as \`jsmith@[192.168.2.1]\` or \`jsmith@[IPv6:2001:db8::1]\`, although this is rarely seen except in email spam. Internationalized domain names (which are encoded to comply with the requirements for a hostname) allow for presentation of non-ASCII domains. In mail systems compliant with RFC 6531 and RFC 6532 an email address may be encoded as UTF-8, both a local-part as well as a domain name. Comments are allowed in the domain as well as in the local-part; for example, \`john.smith@(comment)example.com\` and \`john.smith@example.com(comment)\` are equivalent to \`john.smith@example.com\`.  Reserved domains  specifies that certain domains, for example those intended for documentation and testing, should not be resolvable and that as a result mail addressed to mailboxes in them and their subdomains should be non- deliverable. Of note for e-mail are example, invalid, example.com, example.net, and example.org. = Examples = ; Valid email addresses : \`simple@example.com\` : \`very.common@example.com\` : \`disposable.style.email.with+symbol@example.com\` : \`other.email-with- hyphen@example.com\` : \`fully-qualified-domain@example.com\` : \`user.name+tag+sorting@example.com\` (may go to \`user.name@example.com\` inbox depending on mail server) : \`x@example.com\` (one-letter local-part) : \`example-indeed@strange-example.com\` : \`admin@mailserver1\` (local domain name with no TLD, although ICANN highly discourages dotless email addresses) : \`example@s.example\` (see the List of Internet top-level domains) : \`\\" \\"@example.org\` (space between the quotes) : \`\\"john..doe\\"@example.org\` (quoted double dot) : \`mailhost!username@example.org\` (bangified host route used for uucp mailers) : \`user%example.com@example.org\` (% escaped mail route to user@example.com via example.org) ; Invalid email addresses : \`Abc.example.com\` (no @ character) : \`A@b@c@example.com\` (only one @ is allowed outside quotation marks) : \`a\\"b(c)d,e:f;gi[j\\\\k]l@example.com\` (none of the special characters in this local-part are allowed outside quotation marks) : \`just\\"not\\"right@example.com\` (quoted strings must be dot separated or the only element making up the local-part) : \`this is\\"not\\\\allowed@example.com\` (spaces, quotes, and backslashes may only exist when within quoted strings and preceded by a backslash) : \`this\\\\ still\\\\\\"not\\\\\\\\allowed@example.com\` (even if escaped (preceded by a backslash), spaces, quotes, and backslashes must still be contained by quotes) : \`1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234+x@example.com\` (local part is longer than 64 characters) : \`i_like_underscore@but_its_not_allow_in_this_part.example.com\` (Underscore is not allowed in domain part)  Common local-part semantics  According to RFC 5321 2.3.11 Mailbox and Address, \\"...the local-part MUST be interpreted and assigned semantics only by the host specified in the domain of the address.\\" This means that no assumptions can be made about the meaning of the local-part of another mail server. It is entirely up to the configuration of the mail server. = Local-part normalization = Interpretation of the local part of an email address is dependent on the conventions and policies implemented in the mail server. For example, case sensitivity may distinguish mailboxes differing only in capitalization of characters of the local-part, although this is not very common.Are Email Addresses Case Sensitive? by Heinz Tschabitscher Gmail ignores all dots in the local-part of a @gmail.com address for the purposes of determining account identity. = Subaddressing = Some mail services support a tag included in the local-part, such that the address is an alias to a prefix of the local part. For example, the address joeuser+tag@example.com denotes the same delivery address as joeuser@example.com. RFC 5233, refers to this convention as sub-addressing, but it is also known as plus addressing, tagged addressing or mail extensions. Addresses of this form, using various separators between the base name and the tag, are supported by several email services, including Andrew Project (plus), Runbox (plus), Gmail (plus), Rackspace (plus), Yahoo! Mail Plus (hyphen), Apple's iCloud (plus), Outlook.com (plus), ProtonMail (plus), Fastmail (plus and Subdomain Addressing), postale.io (plus), Pobox (plus), MeMail (plus), MMDF (equals), Qmail and Courier Mail Server (hyphen). Postfix and Exim allow configuring an arbitrary separator from the legal character set. The text of the tag may be used to apply filtering, or to create single-use, or disposable email addresses.Gina Trapani (2005) \\"Instant disposable Gmail addresses\\" In practice, the form validation of some web sites may reject characters such as \\"+\\" in an email address ‚Äì treating them, incorrectly, as invalid characters. This can lead to an incorrect user receiving an e-mail if the \\"+\\" is silently stripped by a website without any warning or error messages. For example, an email intended for the user-entered email address foo+bar@example.com could be incorrectly sent to foobar@example.com. In other cases a poor user experience can occur if some parts of a site, such as a user registration page, allow the \\"+\\" character whilst other parts, such as a page for unsubscribing from a site's mailing list, do not.  Validation and verification  Email addresses are often requested as input to website as validation of user existence. Other validation methods are available, such as cell phone number validation, postal mail validation, and fax validation. An email address is generally recognized as having two parts joined with an at-sign (@), although technical specification detailed in RFC 822 and subsequent RFCs are more extensive. Syntactically correct, verified email addresses do not guarantee that an email box exists. Thus many mail servers use incorrectly other techniques and check the mailbox existence against relevant systems such as the Domain Name System for the domain or using callback verification to check if the mailbox exists. Callback verification is an imperfect solution, as it may be disabled to avoid a directory harvest attack. Several validation techniques may be utilized to validate an user email address. For example, * Verification links: Email address validation is often accomplished for account creation on websites by sending an email to the user-provided email address with a special temporary hyperlink. On receipt, the user opens the link, immediately activating the account. Email addresses are also useful as means of delivering messages from a website, e.g., user messages, user actions, to the email inbox. * Formal and informal standards: RFC 3696 provides specific advice for validating Internet identifiers, including email addresses. Some websites instead attempt to evaluate the validity of email addresses through arbitrary standards, such as by rejecting addresses containing valid characters, such as + and /, or enforcing arbitrary length limitations. Email address internationalization provides for a much larger range of characters than many current validation algorithms allow, such as all Unicode characters above U+0080, encoded as UTF-8. * Algorithmic tools: Large websites, bulk mailers and spammers require efficient tools to validate email addresses. Such tools depend upon heuristic algorithms and statistical models.Verification & Validation Techniques for Email Address Quality Assurance by Jan Hornych 2011, University of Oxford * Sender reputation: An email sender's reputation may used to attempt to verify whether the sender is trustworthy or a potential spammer. Factors that may be incorporated into an assessment of sender reputation include the quality of past contact with or content provided by, and engagement levels of, the sender's IP address or email address. * Browser-based verification: HTML5 forms implemented in many browsers allow email address validation to be handled by the browser. Some companies offer services to validate an email address, often using an Application programming interface, but there is no guarantee that it will provide accurate results.  Internationalization  The IETF conducts a technical and standards working group devoted to internationalization issues of email addresses, entitled Email Address Internationalization (EAI, also known as IMA, Internationalized Mail Address). This group produced , and continues to work on additional EAI-related RFCs. The IETF's EAI Working group published RFC 6530 \\"Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email\\", which enabled non-ASCII characters to be used in both the local-parts and domain of an email address. RFC 6530 provides for email based on the UTF-8 encoding, which permits the full repertoire of Unicode. RFC 6531 provides a mechanism for SMTP servers to negotiate transmission of the SMTPUTF8 content. The basic EAI concepts involve exchanging mail in UTF-8. Though the original proposal included a downgrading mechanism for legacy systems, this has now been dropped. The local servers are responsible for the local-part of the address, whereas the domain would be restricted by the rules of internationalized domain names, though still transmitted in UTF-8. The mail server is also responsible for any mapping mechanism between the IMA form and any ASCII alias. EAI enables users to have a localized address in a native language script or character set, as well as an ASCII form for communicating with legacy systems or for script-independent use. Applications that recognize internationalized domain names and mail addresses must have facilities to convert these representations.

Thus Fr√©ron, in recruiting young writers to counter the literary establishment became central to the movement now called the Counter- Enlightenment. Biography Fr√©ron was born at Quimper in Brittany and educated by the Jesuits. He made such rapid academic progress that he was appointed professor at the college of Louis-le-Grand before he turned twenty. He became a contributor to the Observations sur les √©crits modernes of the abb√© Guyot Desfontaines. The very fact of his collaboration with Desfontaines, one of Voltaire's bitterest enemies, was sufficient to arouse the latter's hostility, and although Fr√©ron had begun his career as one of his admirers, his attitude towards Voltaire soon changed. Fr√©ron in 1746 founded a similar journal of his own, entitled Lettres de la Comtesse de ... It was suppressed in 1749, but he immediately replaced it by Lettres sur quelques √©crits de ce temps, which, with the exception of a short suspension in 1752, on account of an attack on the character of Voltaire, was continued till 1754, when it was succeeded by the more ambitious Ann√©e litt√©raire. His death at Paris in 1776 is said to have been hastened by the temporary suppression of this journal. Legacy Fr√©ron is now remembered solely for his attacks on Voltaire and the Encyclopaedists, and for the retaliation from Voltaire, who, besides attacking Fr√©ron in epigrams, and even incidentally in some of his tragedies, directed against him a virulent satire, Le Pauvre diable, and made him the principal personage in a comedy L'Ecossaise, in which the journal of Fr√©ron is designated L'√Çne litt√©raire, \\"the Literary Ass\\". Fr√©ron is also mentioned in Voltaire's famous novel Candide, in reference to a rude critic the title character meets at a theater. A further attack on Fr√©ron entitled Anecdotes sur Fr√©ron ... (1760), published anonymously, is generally attributed to Voltaire. Fr√©ron was the author of an Ode sur la bataille de Fontenoy (1745) Histoire de Marie Stuart (1742, 2 vols.); and Histoire de l'empire d'Allemagne (1771, 8 vols.). He was the father of Stanislas Fr√©ron, revolutionary politician.

Peter Victor Ueberroth (; born September 2, 1937) is an American sports and business executive known for his involvement in the Olympics and in Major League Baseball. A Los Angeles- based businessman, he was the chairman of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee which brought the games to Los Angeles in 1984. After the conclusion of the games, he was named as the sixth Commissioner of Baseball, a role he held from 1984 to 1989. He later served as the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee from 2004 to 2008. Early life Ueberroth was born in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Laura (Larson) and Victor Ueberroth. His father was of German and Austrian descent, and his mother was of Swedish and Irish ancestry. He caddied at Sunset Ridge Country Club, in Northfield, Illinois.Êó∂‰ª£Âë®ÂàäÈ£é‰∫ë‰∫∫Áâ©ÂõûÈ°æ1984. docin.com He grew up in northern California. While attending Fremont High School, Ueberroth excelled in football, baseball, and swimming. After graduating from high school, Ueberroth attended San Jose State University on an athletic scholarship. While attending San Jose State he joined Delta Upsilon. He competed in the 1956 United States Olympic water polo trials but failed to make the team. Ueberroth ultimately graduated from San Jose State in 1959 with a degree in business. =Trans International Airlines= After college, Ueberroth became a vice president and shareholder in Trans International Airlines (he was 22 years old at the time). Ueberroth worked at Trans International until 1963, when he founded his own travel company, which would become First Travel Corporation. By the time he sold First Travel in 1980, it was the second largest travel business in North America. Sports career =1984 Olympics= For five years Ueberroth served as the organizer of the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. He was a prominent figure in the games, receiving the Olympic Order in gold at its conclusion. Due to the success of the games, he was named Time magazine's Man of the Year in 1984. Under Ueberroth's leadership and management, the first privately financed Olympic Games resulted in a surplus of nearly US$250 million. This was subsequently used to support youth and sports activities throughout the United States. Coincidentally, he was born on the day on which the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, died. Ueberroth created a committee of over 150 members (mostly business people and entrepreneurs) to generate ideas, opportunities and solve problems. His aggressive recruiting of sponsors for the 1984 Olympics is credited as the genesis for the current Olympic sponsorship program. Due to recruiting competitors between the Los Angeles Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), after 1984 all Olympics in the US had their local organizing committees enter into recruitment agreements with the USOC to jointly recruit sponsors and share revenues. =Baseball commissioner= Ueberroth was elected to succeed Bowie Kuhn on March 3, 1984, and took office on October 1 of that year. As a condition of his hiring, Ueberroth increased the commissioner's fining ability from US$5,000 to $250,000. His salary was raised to a reported $450,000, nearly twice what Kuhn was paid. Just as Ueberroth was taking office, the Major League Umpires Union was threatening to strike the postseason. Ueberroth managed to arbitrate the disagreement and had the umpires back to work before the League Championship Series were over. The next summer, Ueberroth worked behind the scenes to limit a players' strike to one day before a new labor agreement was worked out with the Players Association. During the course of his stint as commissioner, Ueberroth reinstated two Hall of Famers, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, who had been banned from working for Major League Baseball by Kuhn because of their associations with gambling casinos. Also, Ueberroth suspended numerous players because of cocaine use, negotiated a $1.8 billion television contract with CBS,Joseph Durso, A Billion-Dollar Bid By CBS Wins Rights To Baseball Games The New York Times. December 15, 1988. Retrieved March 13, 2008. and initiated the investigation against Pete Rose's betting habits. In 1985, Ueberroth's first full year in office, the League Championship Series expanded from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven series. At his urging, the Chicago Cubs chose to install lights at Wrigley Field rather than reimburse the leagues for lost night-game revenues. Ueberroth then found a new source of income in the form of persuading large corporations to pay for the privilege of having their products endorsed by Major League Baseball. However, Ueberroth, with the assistance of the owners, also facilitated collusion between the owners in violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players. Players entering free agency in the 1985, 1986 and 1987 offseasons were, with few exceptions, prevented from both signing equitable contracts and joining the teams of their choice during this period. The roots of the collusion lay in Ueberroth's first owners' meeting as commissioner, when he called the owners \\"damned dumb\\" for being willing to lose money in order to win a World Series. Later, he told the general managers that it was \\"not smart\\" to sign long-term contracts. Former Major League Baseball Players Association president Marvin Miller later described this as \\"tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series.\\" The MLBPA, under Miller's successor, Don Fehr, filed collusion charges and won each case, resulting in \\"second look\\" free agents, and over $280 million in fines. Peter Ueberroth and Collusion Fay Vincent, who followed Ueberroth's successor in the commissioner's office, laid the crippling labor problems of the early 1990s (including the 1994‚Äì95 strike) directly at the feet of Ueberroth and the owners' collusion, holding that the collusion years constituted theft from the players. Under Ueberroth, Major League Baseball enjoyed \\"increased attendance (record attendance four straight seasons), greater awareness of crowd control and alcohol management within ballparks, a successful and vigilant anti-drug campaign, significant industry-wide improvement in the area of fair employment, and a significantly improved financial picture for the industry. When Ueberroth took office, 21 of the 26 clubs were losing money; in Ueberroth's last full season ‚Äì 1988 ‚Äì all clubs either broke even or finished in the black. In 1987, for example, baseball as an industry showed a net profit of $21.3 million, its first profitable year since 1973.\\" Nonetheless, following the announcement of the first of three large awards to the players following the collusion findings, Ueberroth stepped down as commissioner before the start of the 1989 regular season; his contract was to have run through the end of the season. He was succeeded by National League president A. Bartlett Giamatti. Post-baseball activities Ueberroth has been a director of The Coca-Cola Company since 1986. Ueberroth is an investor and chairman of the Contrarian Group, Inc., a business management company, and has held this position since 1989. He is also co- chairman of Pebble Beach Company. He is a director of Hilton Hotels Corporation and previously served as director of Adecco S.A. from 2004 to 2008. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Aircastle since 2012 and been on the Board since 2006.Aircastle Ltd (AYR) Reuters. In 1989, Ueberroth considered purchasing Eastern Air Lines, then crippled by a strike and bankruptcy from Texas Air. However, a management dispute with Texas Air CEO Frank Lorenzo led to the deal falling through. Three years after leaving office, he led the Rebuild Los Angeles project after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1999, Ueberroth, along with Arnold Palmer and Clint Eastwood, bought the Pebble Beach golf course. Ueberroth ran for Governor of California in the 2003 California recall election as an independent, though he was a registered Republican. His campaign focused on California's economic and budget crisis, avoiding social issues. With polls indicating only a low level of support, he pulled out of the race on September 9, 2003, though his name still appeared on the ballot and received a small but significant number of votes. He placed 6th in a field of 135 candidates. Ueberroth was chairman of Ambassadors International, Inc. but was replaced by his son, Joseph Ueberroth in April 2006. Ueberroth resigned from the board in November 2008. Ueberroth was also the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee Board of Directors. Ueberroth was inducted into the USA Water Polo Hall of Fame in 2010. Ueberroth is a Life Trustee of the University of Southern California.Board of Trustees , University of Southern California, Retrieved April 13, 2008.

Bush, from July 2001 until August 2005. He is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. Feith has been described as an architect of the Iraq War. A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Feith's office had \\"developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.\\" Personal Feith was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of three children of Rose (n√©e Bankel) and Dalck Feith. His father was a member of the Betar, a Revisionist Zionist youth organization, in Poland, and a Holocaust survivor who lost his parents and seven siblings in the Nazi concentration camps. Dalck came to the United States during World War II and became a businessman, a philanthropist, and a donor to the Republican party.October 27, 2005 Feith grew up in Elkins Park, part of Cheltenham Township, a Philadelphia suburb. He attended Philadelphia's Central High School, and later attended Harvard University, where he obtained his undergraduate degree and graduated magna cum laude in 1975. He continued on to the Georgetown University Law Center, receiving his J.D. magna cum laude in 1978. After graduation, he worked for three years as an attorney with the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP. Career =Work as a Democrat= Feith worked on the staff of senator Henry M. Jackson in 1975 before going on to work on Elmo Zumwalt's campaign against segregationist senator Harry Byrd, Jr. Byrd, an independent since 1970, defeated Zumwalt, a Democrat, 57‚Äì38%.http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=51&year;=1976&f;=0&elect;=0&off;=3 =Reagan Administration= At Harvard, Feith had studied under Richard Pipes, who joined the Reagan administration's National Security Council, in 1981, to help carry out a private intelligence project called Team B that Pipes and his students had conceived. Feith joined the NSC as a Middle East specialist that same year, working under Pipes. He transferred from the NSC staff to the Pentagon, in 1982, to work as special counsel for Richard Perle, who was then serving as assistant secretary to the United States Secretary of Defense. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger promoted Feith, in 1984, to deputy assistant secretary of defense for negotiations policy and when Feith left the Pentagon, in 1986, Weinberger awarded him the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the department's highest civilian award. During his time in the Pentagon in the Reagan administration, Feith helped to convince the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz all to recommend against ratification of changes to the Geneva Conventions. The changes, known as the \\"Additional Protocols\\", grant armed non-state actors prisoner of war status under certain circumstances even if they fail to distinguish themselves from the civilian population to the same extent as members of the armed forces of a high contracting party. Reagan informed the United States Senate in 1987 that he would not ratify Additional Protocol I. At the time, both The Washington Post and The New York Times editorialized in favor of Reagan's decision to reject Additional Protocol I as a revision of humanitarian law that protected terrorists. =Private practice= Feith began his career as an attorney in private practice with the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP for 3 years, after which he joined the Reagan Administration (see previous section). Upon leaving the Pentagon, Feith co-founded, with Marc Zell, the Washington, DC law firm of Feith & Zell. The firm engaged in lobbying efforts for, among others, the Turkish, Israeli and Bosnian governments, in addition to representing defense corporations Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Feith left the firm in 2001, following his nomination as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. =Bush administration= Feith joined the administration of President George W. Bush as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy in 2001. His appointment was facilitated by connections he had with other neoconservatives, including Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. With his new appointment in hand, Feith proved influential in having Richard Perle chosen as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. Feith was criticized during the first term of the Bush administration for creating the Office of Strategic Influence. This office came into existence to support the War on Terror. The office's aim was to influence policymakers by submitting biased news stories into the foreign media. Feith played a significant role in the buildup to the Iraq War. Feith has been characterized as an architect of the Iraq War. As part of his portfolio, he supervised the Pentagon Office of Special Plans, a group of policy and intelligence analysts created to provide senior government officials with raw intelligence, unvetted by the intelligence community.Alexandrovna, Larisa. \\"Senate Intelligence Committee Stalling Prewar Intelligence,\\" The Raw Story, December 2, 2005. Retrieved May 22, 2007. The office was responsible for hiring Lawrence Franklin, who was later convicted along with AIPAC employees Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman for passing classified national defense information to an Israeli diplomat Naor Gilon. The office, eventually dismantled, was later criticized in Congress and the media for analysis that was contradicted by CIA analysis and investigations performed following the invasion of Iraq. In response to the allegedly poor work of Feith's Office of Special Plans, General Tommy Franks, who led both the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the Iraq War called Feith \\"the dumbest fucking guy on the planet\\".Black, Simon (2011-04-09) And This Year‚Äôs Nobel Prize in Goes To‚Ä¶, LewRockwell.com Douglas Feith and General-Colonel Yuriy Nikolayevich Baluyevskiy hold a joint press conference at the Pentagon on Jan. 16, 2002.

Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone. New York: Vintage Books, 2006. pp 79-80Kaplan, Fred Daydream Believers. Hoboken: J. Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.152 In February 2007, the Pentagon's inspector general issued a report that concluded that Feith's office \\"developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al-Qaeda relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.\\" This repeated Feith's earlier involvement with Team B as a postgraduate, when alternative intelligence assessments exaggerating threats to the United States turned out to be wrong on nearly every point. The report found that these actions were \\"inappropriate\\" though not \\"illegal.\\" Senator Carl Levin, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that \\"The bottom line is that intelligence relating to the Iraq-al-Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense to support the administration's decision to invade Iraq. The inspector general's report is a devastating condemnation of inappropriate activities in the DOD policy office that helped take this nation to war.\\" At Senator Levin's insistence, on April 6, 2007, the Pentagon's Inspector General's Report was declassified and released to the public. Responding to criticism of a report that linked Al-Qaeda with Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Feith called the office's report a much-needed critique of the CIA's intelligence. \\"It's healthy to criticize the CIA's intelligence\\", Feith said. \\"What the people in the Pentagon were doing was right. It was good government.\\" Feith also rejected accusations he attempted to link Iraq to a formal relationship with Al Qaeda. \\"No one in my office ever claimed there was an operational relationship\\", Feith said. \\"There was a relationship.\\"Feller, Ben, \\"Ex-Pentagon Official Defends Iraq Stance\\", Associated Press, ABC News, February 11, 2007. Feith stated that he \\"felt vindicated\\" by the report of the Pentagon inspector general. He told the Washington Post that his office produced \\"a criticism of the consensus of the intelligence community, and in presenting it I was not endorsing its substance.\\" Feith was the first senior Pentagon official to leave the administration after Bush was re-elected. There was some speculation when Feith announced he was leaving as to why he was stepping down. Some believed he was pressured to leave because of problems over his performance and his increasing marginalization. =Post-government career= Following his government service, Feith was employed by the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, where he taught a course on the Bush administration's anti-terrorism policy. He came to Georgetown's School of Foreign Service after leaving Stanford's Hoover Institution and was appointed by School of Foreign Service dean, Robert Gallucci. However, his hiring \\"caused an uproar among the Foreign Service school faculty.\\" Two years later, Feith's contract was not renewed, causing continuing hostility between the Georgetown Law Center faculty and alumni and the Foreign Service school faculty. In 2008, Feith became a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, where he is the director of its Center for National Security Strategies.Official Bio , Hudson Institute website. Views and publications Feith is a Republican, and has contributed money to various party candidates over the years. He has been described as a neoconservative. One of Feith's controversial views was his argument that increasing the number of political appointees equated to more democracy, which would help align government policy to the promises politicians make before they get into office. Feith's writings have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Commentary, and The New Republic. He has contributed chapters to a number of books, including James W. Muller's Churchill as Peacemaker, Raphael Israeli's The Dangers of a Palestinian State and Uri Ra'anan's Hydra of Carnage: International Linkages of Terrorism, as well as serving as co-editor for Israel's Legitimacy in Law and History. Feith is an ardent supporter of Israel. Along with Richard Perle and David Wurmser, he was a member of the study group which authored a controversial report entitled A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, a set of policy recommendations for the newly elected Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The report was published by the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies without an individual author being named. According to the report, Feith was one of the people who participated in roundtable discussions that produced ideas that the report reflects. Feith pointed out in a September 16, 2004 letter to the editor of The Washington Post that he was not the co-author and did not clear the report's final text. He wrote, \\"There is no warrant for attributing any particular idea [in the report], let alone all of them, to any one participant.\\" Feith was on the board of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), a think tank that promotes a military and strategic alliance between the United States and Israel. Feith was interviewed by the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes in a segment that was aired on April 6, 2008.Insider: Iraq Attack Was Preemptive During this interview he promoted his newly released memoir, War and Decision and defended the decision making that led to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. =War and Decision= On April 8, 2008, Feith's memoir, War and Decision: Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism, was published by HarperCollins. War crimes investigation In 2009, Feith became one of several Bush Administration officials under consideration for investigation of possible war crimes in a Spanish court, headed by Baltasar Garz√≥n under claims of universal jurisdiction. The case had reportedly still been active as of 2011.

Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 and 8, but it can occur in children between the ages of 2 and 15. It can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which affects only the hip. Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Signs and symptoms The condition is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4-10. Common symptoms include pain in the hip, knee, or ankle (since hip pathology can cause pain to be felt in a normal knee or ankle), or in the groin; this pain is exacerbated by hip or leg movement, especially internal hip rotation (with the knee flexed 90¬∞, twisting the lower leg away from the center of the body). The range of motion is reduced, particularly in abduction and internal rotation, and the patient presents with a limp. Pain is usually mild. Atrophy of thigh muscles may occur from disuse and an inequality of leg length. In some cases, some activity can cause severe irritation or inflammation of the damaged area, including standing, walking, running, kneeling, or stooping repeatedly for an extended period of time. In cases exhibiting severe femoral osteonecrosis, pain is usually a chronic, throbbing sensation exacerbated by activity. The first signs are complaints of soreness from the child, which are often dismissed as growing pains, and limping or other guarding of the joint, particularly when tired. The pain is usually in the hip, but can also be felt in the knee (referred pain). In some cases, pain is felt in the unaffected hip and leg, due to the children favoring their injured side and placing the majority of their weight on their \\"good\\" leg. It is predominantly a disease of boys (4:1 ratio). Perthes is generally diagnosed between 5 and 12 years of age, although it has been diagnosed as early as 18 months. Typically, the disease is only seen in one hip, but bilateral Perthes is seen in about 10% of children diagnosed.Legg-Calv√©-Perthes Disease Imaging Author: Ali Nawaz Khan. Chief Editor: Felix S Chew. Updated: May 28, 2008 Cause Perthes disease is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the head of the femur. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. Legg believed the cause was impairment of blood supply to the femoral epiphysis, Calv√© believed rickets, and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, a number of factors have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics. Risk factors are not limited to impaired and disproportionate growth, low birth weight, delayed skeletal maturity, short stature, systemic hormonal changes, and low economic index. Although no one has identified the cause of Perthes disease, a reduction in blood flow to the joint is known. The disease is theorized to include the artery of the ligmentum teres femoris being constricted or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year-old child, but lacking the bone strength of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics do not appear to be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research. Pathology Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. The bone loss leads to some degree of collapse and deformity of the femoral head and sometimes secondary changes to the shape of the hip socket. It is also referred to as idiopathic avascular osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head since the cause of the interruption of the blood supply of the head of the femur in the hip joint is unknown. Perthes can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which only affects the hip, although other forms of osteochondritis can affect elbows, knees, ankles, and feet. Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated thoroughly to rule out multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Diagnosis X-rays of the hip may suggest and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually demonstrate a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI may be useful in making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed 6 weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97 to 99% against 88 to 93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral epiphysis (the developing femoral head). Treatment The goals of treatment are to decrease pain, reduce the loss of hip motion, and prevent or minimize permanent femoral head deformity so that the risk of developing a severe degenerative arthritis as adult can be reduced. Assessment by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon is recommended to evaluate risks and treatment options. Younger children have a better prognosis than older children. Treatment has historically centered on removing mechanical pressure from the joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, with an average of 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination.http://www.nih.gov These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45¬∞. Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. Most functional bracing is achieved using a waist belt and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis. These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow. While running and high-impact sports are not recommended during treatment for Perthes disease, children can remain active through a variety of other activities that limit mechanical stress on the hip joint. Swimming is highly recommended, as it allows exercise of the hip muscles with full range of motion while reducing the stress to a minimum. Cycling is another good option as it also keeps stress to a minimum. Physiotherapy generally involves a series of daily exercises, with weekly meetings with a physiotherapist to monitor progress. These exercises focus on improving and maintaining a full range of motion of the femur within the hip socket. Performing these exercises during the healing process is essential to ensure that the femur and hip socket have a perfectly smooth interface. This will minimize the long-term effects of the disease. Use of bisphosphonate such as zoledronate or ibandronate is currently being investigated, but definite recommendations are not yet available. Perthes disease is self-limiting, but if the head of femur is left deformed, long-term problems can occur. Treatment is aimed at minimizing damage while the disease runs its course, not at 'curing' the disease. It is recommended not to use steroids or alcohol as these reduce oxygen in the blood which is needed in the joint. As sufferers age, problems in the knee and back can arise secondary to abnormal posture and stride adopted to protect the affected joint. The condition is also linked to arthritis of the hip, though this appears not to be an inevitable consequence. Hip replacements are relatively common as the already damaged hip suffers routine wear; this varies by individual, but generally is required any time after age 50. Prognosis X ray of deformity by Legg‚ÄìCalv√©‚ÄìPerthes disease of the right hip (left side of X-ray) Children younger than 6 have the best prognosis, since they have time for the dead bone to revascularize and remodel, with a good chance that the femoral head will recover and remain spherical after resolution of the disease. Children who have been diagnosed with Perthes' disease after the age of 10 are at a very high risk of developing osteoarthritis and coxa magna. When an LCP disease diagnosis occurs after age 8, a better outcome results with surgery rather than nonoperative treatments. Shape of femoral head at the time when Legg-Calv√© Perthes disease heals is the most important determinant of risk for degenerative arthritis; hence, the shape of femoral head and congruence of hip are most useful outcome measures. Epidemiology Perthes' disease is one of the most common hip disorders in young children, occurring in roughly 5.5 of 100,000 children per year. The lifetime risk of a child developing the disease is about one per 1,200 individuals. Boys are affected about three to five times more often than girls. New cases of Perthes' disease rarely occur after age 14 years (if diagnosed after 14 years of age, then it is usually old disease from early in childhood or avascular necrosis from an alternative cause). White northern Europeans appear to be affected more frequently than other races, though a paucity of reliable epidemiology exists in the Southern Hemisphere. Children of sufferers of the disease themselves may have a very slightly increased risk, though it is unclear if this is because of a genetic predisposition, or a shared environmental factor. It is most commonly seen in persons aged three to 12 years, with a median of six years of age. The UK incidence rates show an intriguing pattern with low incidence rates in London, and a progressive increase in disease in more northerly areas (maximal in Scotland). Some evidence suggests, at least in developed countries, more socioeconomically deprived communities have a greater risk of disease (a similar trend to diseases such as adult heart disease), though the reason for this remains unknown.Perry DC, Bruce CE, Pope D et al. Perthes' disease of the hip: socioeconomic inequalities and the urban environment. Arch Dis Child 2012; One possible explanation that has been considered is tobacco smoke exposure, though this is significantly confounded by the strong socioeconomic gradient common to both smoking and Perthes' disease. History * 1897: The disease was first described by Karel Maydl (1853‚Äì1903). * 1909: Henning Waldenstr√∂m (1877‚Äì1972) described the disease, attributing it to tuberculosis. * 1910: The disease was recognized as being unrelated to tuberculosis by three physicians working independently. Legg‚ÄìCalv√©‚ÄìPerthes is named after these three doctors: Arthur Legg (1874‚Äì1939), Jacques Calv√© (1875‚Äì1954), and Georg Perthes (1869‚Äì1927). Research directions In the UK in 2016, a nationwide study began collecting details of every case of Perthes' disease as part of the British Orthopaedic Surgery Surveillance Study. This aims to get core information about the disease, prior to starting extensive clinical trials about the best forms of treatment. Every hospital in England, Scotland, and Wales which treats Perthes' disease is collecting details of new cases. This study is supported by the Perthes' Association (UK). The study is nationally approved by the UK ethics committee and NHS research approval teams in England, Scotland, and Wales. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research and the Alder Hey Charity. Dogs LCP disease is an avascular necrosis of the femoral head in small-breed dogs, usually those weighing up to 25 lbs. LCP disease was first described in veterinary literature by Tutt in 1935. Tutt described the disease as almost exactly what Waldenstromin (1909) described in humans. as tuberculosis of the hip. Small breeds, particularly Toy Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, Pugs, Jack Russell Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, and Dachshunds can be affected. No sex predilection is seen in the dog as contrasted to humans, in whom an 80% male incidence of the disease is evident. Similar to children, however, the condition is usually unilateral, with only about 10% to 15% incidence of bilateral disease. The age of onset varies between 4 and 12 months, with a peak incidence around 7 months.http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/saortho/chapter_82/82mast.htm The pathology of avascular necrosis followed by revascularization and bony remodeling of the femoral head in the dog certainly suggests a vascular etiology, though the cause of the condition is not completely understood. Hip pain is usually seen by the age of 6 to 8 months. The disease is bilateral in 12 to 16% of cases. X-rays are necessary to make the diagnosis and show increased opacity and focal lysis in the head of the femur, and later in the disease, collapse and fracture of the neck of the femur. The recommended treatment is surgical removal of the head of the femur, but conservative treatment (rest, exercise restriction, and pain medication) may be effective in a limited number of cases (less than 25%, according to some studies). In dogs, the prognosis is excellent with surgery. Prednisolone tablets may also be helpful.

In the LDS Church, compliance with the Word of Wisdom is currently a prerequisite for baptism, service in full-time missionary work, attendance at church schools, and entry into the church's temples; however, violation of the code is not considered to be grounds for excommunication or other disciplinary action.\\"When a Membership Council Is Not Normally Necessary\\", General Handbook (LDS Church, 2020) ¬ß 32.6.4. The text discourages \\"strong drink\\" and wine (in some cases this includes sacramental wine, which has been replaced with sacramental water in some sects), the non-medicinal use of tobacco, \\"hot drinks\\", and meat used more than \\"sparingly\\". The scripture also recommends the consumption of herbs, fruits, and grains, as well as grain-based \\"mild drinks\\". As practiced by the LDS Church, there is no firm restriction relating to meat consumption, but all alcoholic beverages are forbidden, including beer. The LDS Church interprets \\"hot drinks\\" to mean coffee and tea. Origin and publication According to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Word of Wisdom was received in 1833 as a revelation from God. After Smith's death, Brigham Young stated that the revelation was given in response to problems encountered while conducting meetings in the Smith family home: > When they assembled together in this room after breakfast, the first they > did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk about the great > things of the kingdom, and spit all over the room, and as soon as the pipe > was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often > when the Prophet [Joseph Smith] entered the room to give the school > instructions he would find himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. This, and > the complaints of his wife at having to clean so filthy a floor, made the > Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the > conduct of the Elders in using tobacco, and the revelation known as the Word > of Wisdom was the result of his inquiry.Brigham Young, Journal of > Discourses, vol. 12, p. 158. The Word of Wisdom was first published as a stand-alone broadsheet in December 1833. In 1835, it was included as Section LXXX in the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. Word of Wisdom revelation The revelation contains four parts: #an introduction;. #a list of substances that should not be ingested, including wine, strong drink, tobacco and \\"hot drinks\\";. #a list of foods that should be used, some with certain limitations;. and #a divine promise to those who follow the guidelines. =Introduction= The introduction and explanation as presented by Smith is: > A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled > in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion‚Äî To be sent > greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word > of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation > of all saints in the last days‚Äî Given for a principle with a promise, > adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are > or can be called saints. =Prohibitions= Among the substances which the revelation indicates should not be ingested, the first is \\"wine or strong drink\\", which the revelation says should not be drunk. (An exception is allowed for the use of \\"pure wine of your own make\\" as part of the sacrament ordinance, though the LDS Church today uses water in place of wine.) The revelation also advises against the consumption of tobacco and \\"hot drinks\\". The Word of Wisdom revelation also suggests proper uses for some prohibited substances. While \\"strong drinks\\" are not to be ingested, they are appropriate when used \\"for the washing of your bodies\\"; likewise, while human ingestion of tobacco is forbidden, tobacco is said to be \\"an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill\\". =Prescriptions= The list of foods and substances which the revelation encourages includes \\"wholesome herbs [and] every fruit in the season thereof\\" and \\"that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground\\". It also prescribes the use of \\"all grain\\", which is described as \\"the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field\\". Barley and other grains are recommended for use in making \\"mild drinks\\". The \\"beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth\\" may be used as food \\"sparingly\\" and \\"with thanksgiving\\". The revelation states that it is pleasing to God if these recommendations are not used, \\"only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\\" and times of \\"excess of hunger\\". =Divine promise= The Word of Wisdom states that it comprises a \\"principle with promise\\". The promise given to those who followed the advice of the word of wisdom is as follows: > And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in > obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and > marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of > knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall > walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the > destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay > them. Application by Joseph Smith Originally, abiding by the recommendations and prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom was not considered mandatory: it explicitly declares itself to be \\"not by commandment or constraint\\".. In February 1834, however, Joseph Smith proposed a resolution before the high council of the church that stated, \\"No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office after having the word of wisdom properly taught him; and he, the official member, neglecting to comply with and obey it.\\"Joseph Fielding Smith (ed.) (1938). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 117, n. 9. This resolution was accepted unanimously by the council. In 1842, Smith's brother Hyrum, who was the Assistant President of the Church and its presiding patriarch, provided an interpretation of the Word of Wisdom's proscription of \\"hot drinks\\": > And again \\"hot drinks are not for the body, or belly;\\" there are many who > wonder what this can mean; whether it refers to tea, or coffee, or not. I > say it does refer to tea, and coffee.Hyrum Smith, \\"The Word of Wisdom\\", > Times and Seasons, 1 June 1842, vol. 3, p. 800. According to a book written by LDS missionary and hymnographer Joel H. Johnson in 1881, Joseph Smith shared Hyrum's interpretation: > I understand that some of the people are excusing themselves in using tea > and coffee, because the Lord only said \\"hot drinks\\" in the revelation of the > Word of Wisdom .... Tea and coffee ... are what the Lord meant when He said > \\"hot drinks\\".In Joel H. Johnson (1881).

There is a report he also smoked tobacco: according to Amasa Lyman, a member of the First Presidency under Smith, Smith once finished preaching a sermon on the Word of Wisdom and immediately afterward rode through the streets smoking a cigar.Diary of Abraham H. Cannon, vol. 19 (October 1895 entry); cited in Gary Dean Guthrie, Joseph Smith As An Administrator, M.A. thesis, Brigham Young University, May 1969, p. 161. According to Lyman, this was just one of many instances in which Smith \\"tried the faith of the Saints ... by his peculiarities\\". (One modern commentator has suggested that this may have been done by Smith to ensure that his followers' faith was based on the Latter Day Saint religion and not on Smith's personality or leadership.)Gary Dean Guthrie, \\"Joseph Smith As An Administrator\\", M.A. thesis, Brigham Young University, May 1969, p. 161. On August 19, 1835, Almon W. Babbitt was brought before the church's high council on three charges. On the charge of \\"not keeping the Word of Wisdom\\", Babbitt stated \\"that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong.\\"Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts (ed.)), History of the Church, vol. 2, p. 252. In 1838, Smith was operating a hotel/tavern in Far West, Missouri. In June 1838, the high council of Far West felt compelled to remind Smith's family that there was a ban on the sale and consumption of \\"ardent spirits in the place\\".Donald Q. Cannon, Lyndon W. Cook. Far West Record: Minutes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1830‚Äì1844, p. 191 Interpretation by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints =Emphasized by Brigham Young= After Smith's death, several factions emerged from the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these groups, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was led by Brigham Young. At a general conference of the church held on September 9, 1851, Young called on the attendees to \\"leave off the use of\\" items mentioned in the Word of Wisdom: > The Patriarch [John Smith] again rose to speak on the Word of Wisdom, and > urging on the brethren to leave off using tobacco, &c.; President Young rose > to put the motion and called on all the sisters who will leave off the use > of tea, coffee, &c.;, to manifest it by raising the right hand; seconded and > carried. And then put the following motion; calling on all the boys who were > under ninety years of age who would covenant to leave off the use of > tobacco, whisky, and all things mentioned in the Word of Wisdom, to manifest > it in the same manner, which was carried unanimously.\\" The Patriarch then > said, may the Lord bless you and help you to keep all your covenants. Amen. > President Young amongst other things said he knew the goodness of the > people, and the Lord bears with our weakness; we must serve the Lord, and > those who go with me will keep the Word of Wisdom, and if the High Priests, > the Seventies, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever > them from the Church. I will draw the line, and know who is for the Lord and > who is not, and those who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will cut off > from the Church; I throw out a challenge to all men and women.\\"Minutes of > the General Conference\\", Tuesday, Sep. 9, 1851, afternoon session; > Millennial Star, 1 February 1852, vol. 14, p. 35. Though Young encouraged Mormons to follow the Word of Wisdom code, the church was tolerant of those who did not follow it. In 1860, he counseled those chewing tobacco in church meetings to at least be discreet and not excessive, but did not charge users with sin.Journal of Discourses, vol. 8, p. 361. By 1870, however, he ended the practice of chewing and spitting tobacco in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.Journal of Discourses, vol. 13, p. 344. Young also recognized a separation between using tobacco (which was discouraged), and selling it to non-Mormons as a business (which was encouraged).Journal of Discourses, vol. 9, p. 35 (encouraging Mormons to raise and sell tobacco). He also owned and maintained a bar in Salt Lake City for the sale of alcoholic beverages to non-Mormon travelers, on the theory that it was better for LDS Church authorities to run such establishments than for outsiders.Hubert Howe Bancroft, History of Utah, p. 540, n. 44. =Meat= The Word of Wisdom states that \\"flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air ... are to be used sparingly\\", and that \\"it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.\\" Unlike the injunctions against tobacco, alcohol, and hot drinks, however, compliance with this injunction has never been made mandatory. Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat. In 1868, church president Brigham Young counseled, \\"Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold.\\"Brigham Young, \\"The True Church of Christ‚Äîthe Living Testimony‚ÄîWord of Wisdom\\", Journal of Discourses 12:209, May 10, 1868. In 1868, apostle George Q. Cannon said, \\"We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter.\\"George Q. Cannon, \\"Word of Wisdom‚ÄîFish Culture‚ÄîDietetic\\", Journal of Discourses 12:221‚Äì22, April 7, 1868. From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then church president Lorenzo Snow repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith's teaching that animals have spirits. In 1895, Snow stated, \\"Unless famine or extreme cold is upon us we should refrain from the use of meat.\\"Dennis B. Horne, ed., An Apostle‚Äôs Record: The Journals of Abraham H. Cannon (Clearfield, Utah: Gnolaum Books, 2004) p. 424. Apostle George Teasdale taught the same thing, and held that eating pork was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee. When Joseph F. Smith succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the \\"unnecessary destruction of life\\", and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them .Joseph F. Smith, \\"Humane Day\\", Juvenile Instructor 53 no. 4 (April 1918):182‚Äì83. Despite these statements, restricting meat consumption was not made an explicit requirement for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the Word of Wisdom were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century.Paul H. Peterson, An Historical Analysis of the Word of Wisdom (M.A. thesis, Brigham Young University, August 1972). The increased emphasis on the Word of Wisdom took place during the presidency of Heber J. Grant, a long-time enthusiastic promoter of the Word of Wisdom. Although Grant did not make restricting meat consumption an explicit part of the standard, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the Word of Wisdom. In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours \\"without fatigue and without feeling the least injury\\". He attributed his excellent health, in part, to eating very little meat.Heber J. Grant, Conference Report (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, April 1937) p. 15. Since Grant's presidency, the emphasis on limiting the consumption of meat has lessened, but there have been some church leaders who have taught on the subject. In a 1948 LDS general conference address, apostle Joseph F. Merrill emphasized the importance of not eating meat as \\"freely as many Americans are doing\\".Joseph F. Merrill, \\"Eat Flesh Sparingly\\", Conference Report, April 1948, p. 75. In 1950, apostle and plant scientist John A. Widtsoe wrote, in relation to meat consumption, \\"they who wish to be well and gain the promised reward stated in the Word of Wisdom must obey all of the law, not just part of it as suits their whim or their appetite, or their notion of its meaning.\\"Widstoe, John A., The Word of Wisdom: A Modern Interpretation (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1950). As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson Michael Otterson stated \\"the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.Tumulty, Karen. \\"Mormonism good for the body as well as the soul?\\", Washington Post, June 20, 2012. To this day, the LDS Church's hymnal includes a hymn with the following lyrics: > That the children may live long / And be beautiful and strong, / Tea and > coffee and tobacco they despise, / Drink no liquor, and they eat / But a > very little meat; / They are seeking to be great and good and wise.\\"In Our > Lovely Deseret\\", Hymns, no. 307. A student manual published by the church has suggested that the suggestion that the consumption of meat be limited to wintertime may to some degree be a historical relic of the time in which the \\"Word of Wisdom\\" was delivered by Smith: > This verse has caused some to ask if meat should be eaten in the summer. > Meat has more calories than fruits and vegetables, which some individuals > may need fewer of in summer than winter. Also, before fruits and vegetables > could be preserved, people often did not have enough other food to eat in > winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled > more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make > it possible to preserve meat in any season. The key word with respect to the > use of meat is sparingly.\\"Section 89 The Word of Wisdom\\", Doctrine and > Covenants Student Manual (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) pp. > 206‚Äì11. =Beer= The Word of Wisdom states in part, > 16\\\\. All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; > that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground‚Äî 17\\\\. > Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, > and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and > barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.. The revelation suggests that barley-based mild drinks (such as beer) may be permissible. As recently as 1901, apostles Brigham Young, Jr. and John Henry Smith argued that the revelation did not prohibit beer.Thomas G. Alexander, \\"The Word of Wisdom: From Principle to Requirement\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 14:3 (1981) pp. 78‚Äì88. However, LDS Church leaders now teach that consumption of any form of alcohol, including beer, violates the Word of Wisdom.LDS Church (2002, 2d ed.) \\"Chapter 27: The Word of Wisdom\\", Gospel Fundamentals (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) p. 150.Gordon B. Hinckley, \\"The Body Is Sacred\\", New Era, November 2006, pp. 2‚Äì5.Thomas S. Monson, \\"Standards of Strength\\", New Era, October 2008, pp. 2‚Äì5. =Refined grain products= In a pamphlet written in 1930 called The Word of Wisdom, apostle John A. Widtsoe taught that refined flour was contrary to the Word of Wisdom. The church, however, has never prohibited the use of refined flour. =Standards of adherence= Adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom was not made a requirement for entry into LDS Church temples until 1902. However, even then, church president Joseph F. Smith encouraged stake presidents to be liberal with old men who used tobacco and old ladies who drank tea. Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that were excluded from the temple. Around the turn of the century, the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom were not strictly adhered to by such notable church leaders. Anthon H. Lund, a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank beer and wine; apostle Matthias F. Cowley drank beer and wine; Charles W. Penrose, who also served as a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank wine; Relief Society general president Emmeline B. Wells drank coffee; and church president George Albert Smith drank brandy for medicinal purposes. In 1921, church president Heber J. Grant made adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom an absolute requirement for entering the temple. Today, adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom is required for baptism\\"To this day those regulations [of the Word of Wisdom] apply to every member and to everyone who seeks to join the Church. They are so compelling that no one is to be baptized into the Church without first agreeing to live by them.\\": Boyd K. Packer, \\"The Word of Wisdom: The Principle and the Promises\\", Ensign, May 1996, p. 17. and for entry into temples of the LDS Church.LDS Church (2009). \\"Chapter 29: The Lord‚Äôs Law of Health\\", Gospel Principles (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) p. 167. BYU historian Thomas G. Alexander points out that while the original Word of Wisdom as a \\"principle with promise\\" was given by revelation, there is no evidence that any church leader has claimed a separate new revelation, or even a spiritual confirmation, of changing the Word of Wisdom from \\"a principle with promise\\" to a commandment. =Official modern interpretation= The church's official statement on the interpretation of the Word of Wisdom is short: it reaffirms the long-standing meaning of \\"hot drinks\\" and extends the substances covered by prohibition: > The only official interpretation of \\"hot drinks\\" (D&C; 89:9) in the Word of > Wisdom is the statement made by early Church leaders that the term \\"hot > drinks\\" means tea and coffee. Members should not use any substance that > contains illegal drugs. Nor should members use harmful or habit-forming > substances except under the care of a competent physician. Although avoiding the prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom is a requirement for admission to LDS Church temples, violation of the Word of Wisdom no longer results in church discipline, as it once did; the church instructs its leaders that church discipline \\"should not be [used] to discipline or threaten members who do not comply with the Word of Wisdom\\". LDS Church leaders have counseled church members that they should not have personal interpretations of, or become extreme in their observance of the Word of Wisdom. One church leader specifically warned that adding additional unauthorized requirements, emphasizing it with excess zeal, or making it a \\"gospel hobby\\" is a sign of spiritual immaturity and sometimes apostasy. Popular application A 2019 study of attitudes among Latter-day Saints within the U.S. said that a quarter to a half of such individuals interpret the Word of Wisdom in variance with the official interpretation by the Church in some manner, many of these more idiosyncratic of interpretations in addition varying from the rough generalizations that follow. =Alcohol= The prohibition of \\"wine or strong drink\\" is widely interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all alcoholic beverages, regardless of the level of alcoholic content of the drink. =Hot drinks= Generally, members of the church view the prohibition on \\"hot drinks\\" as covering coffee and tea, whether or not the drinks are hot. There is generally thought to be no prohibition against drinking boiling or hot water,http://www.ldsliving.com/Recent-Studies-from-WHO-Back-Up-One-of-the- Most-Contested-Parts-of-the-Word-of-Wisdom/s/82418 herbal tea, hot chocolate, coffee substitutes such as Postum or malt drinks such as Ovaltine or Milo. Other members choose to prohibit themselves from drinking any beverage that contains caffeine. =Cola and other caffeinated beverages= A longstanding issue among members of the church is whether it is permissible to ingest drinks containing caffeine that are not coffee or tea. In 1918, Frederick J. Pack, a Latter-day Saint professor at the University of Utah, published an article in an official church magazine in which he reasoned that because Coca- Cola contained caffeine, which is also present in tea and coffee, Latter-day Saints should abstain from Coca-Cola in the same way that they abstain from the Word of Wisdom \\"hot drinks\\".Frederick J. Pack, \\"Should Latter-Day Saints Drink Coca-Cola?\\" Improvement Era 21:5 (March 1918). Since Pack's article, many Latter-day Saints have come to believe that the reason tea and coffee are proscribed is the presence of caffeine in the drinks. However, the church has never stated that this is the reason for the prohibition. The church does not have an official position on the consumption of caffeinated beverages, apart from the general statement that the Word of Wisdom does not specifically mention it. In 2012, in response to a report on Mormonism on NBC‚Äôs Rock Center with Brian Williams, which claimed that LDS faithful were prohibited from drinking caffeine, the church wrote: > Despite what was reported, the Church revelation spelling out health > practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. > The Church‚Äôs health guidelines prohibits alcoholic drinks, smoking or > chewing of tobacco, and \\"hot drinks\\"‚Äîtaught by Church leaders to refer > specifically to tea and coffee. In the past, a number of church leaders have discouraged the use of such products. For example, in 1922, church president Heber J. Grant counseled the Latter-day Saints: > I am not going to give any command, but I will ask it as a personal, > individual favor to me, to let coca-cola alone. There are plenty of other > things you can get at the soda fountains without drinking that which is > injurious. The Lord does not want you to use any drug that creates an > appetite for itself.Conference Report, April 1922, p. 165. Two years after making this statement, Grant met with a representative of The Coca-Cola Company to discuss the church's position on Coca-Cola; at the conclusion of their second meeting, Grant stated that he was \\"sure I have not the slightest desire to recommend that the people leave Coca-Cola alone if th[e] amount [of caffeine in Coca-Cola] is absolutely harmless, which they claim it is.\\" Grant never again spoke out against the use of cola drinks. Approximately fifty years later, the church issued an official statement which stated: > With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a > position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we > do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful > habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the > habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be > avoided.LDS Church, \\"Priesthood Bulletin\\", February 1972, p. 4; quoted in > \\"Section 89 The Word of Wisdom\\", Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (Salt > Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) p. 209. Because of such statements, some adherents believe that caffeine is officially prohibited under the Word of Wisdom.David A. Erickson, \\"Caffeine not prohibited\\" (letter to the editor), Deseret Morning News, 3 January 2008. In the mid-1950s, the director of the food services for Brigham Young University, a college owned by the LDS Church, decided not to sell caffeine on campus. This changed in September 2017 when the current director of BYU Dining Services announced that caffeinated beverages would be sold on campus. Wright said this was the result of a change in customer preferences. Official church publications have occasionally published articles by medical practitioners that warn of the health risks of consuming caffeine. However, in November 2010, the Salt Lake Tribune noted that in the 2010 church Handbook, which sets out the official position of the church on health and social issues, no position on drinking Coca-Cola or caffeinated drinks is included. The Salt Lake Tribune concluded that the church \\"takes no official position on caffeine\\". =Other areas= In 2019 the LDS Church clarified in New Era that medical marijuana should only be used \\"under the care of a competent physician.\\" Speculation also exists concerning the use of alcohol as a cooking ingredient or the use of decaffeinated coffee or tea. The LDS Church has taken no official stance on either.  Health studies regarding Latter-day Saints  A 14-year selective study conducted by UCLA epidemiologist James E. Enstrom tracked the health of 10,000 moderately active LDS Church members in California and ended in 1987. Of these non-smoking, monogamous non-drinkers, Enstrom concluded from the study \\"that LDS Church members who follow religious mandates barring smoking and drinking have one of the lowest death rates from cancer and cardiovascular diseases--about half that of the general population. ... Moreover, the healthiest LDS Church members enjoy a life expectancy eight to eleven years longer than that of the general white population in the United States.\\" The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for whites in the general population is defined as 100. For males in the study, the SMRs \\"are 47 for all cancers, 52 for cardiovascular diseases, and 47 for all causes; the SMRs for females are 72 for all cancers, 64 for cardiovascular diseases, and 66 for all causes\\". For LDS high priests who exercised, had proper sleep, and never smoked cigarettes, the mortality rate was less. The results were largely duplicated in a separate study of an LDS-like subgroup of white non-smoking churchgoers in Alameda County, California.Enstrom, 1989.

By making the aretaic turn in legal theory, virtue jurisprudence focuses on the importance of character and human excellence or virtue to questions about the nature of law, the content of the law, and judging. The topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence Among the topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence are: # Virtue ethics has implications for an account of the proper ends of legislation. If the aim of law is to make citizens virtuous (as opposed to maximizing utility or realizing a set of moral rights), what are the implications for the content of the laws? # Virtue ethics has implications for legal ethics. Current approaches to legal ethics emphasize deontological moral theory, i.e. duties to clients and respect for client autonomy, and these deontological approaches are reflected in the various codes of professional conduct that have been devised for lawyers, judges, and legislators. # Accounts of the virtue of justice (in particular, Aristotle and Aquinas's theories of natural justice) have implications for debates between natural lawyers and legal positivists over the nature of law. # A virtue-centered theory of judging, which describes the particular excellences required by judges.Lawrence B. Solum, \\"Legal Theory Blog: Legal Theory Lexicon: Virtue Jurisprudence,\\" available online at https://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2018/01/legal-theory-lexicon-virtue- jurisprudence.html Aretaic theories of judging =The judicial virtues= The most developed aspect of virtue jurisprudence is its distinctive theory of judging. A virtue-centered theory of judging offers an account of the characteristics or excellences that make for a good judge. These include: judicial temperance, judicial courage, judicial temperament, judicial intelligence, judicial wisdom, and justice. Although every theory of judging can incorporate some account of judicial virtue, a virtue-centered theory of judging makes the distinctive claim that the judicial virtues are central, i.e. that they have basic explanatory and normative significance. =Criticisms of a virtue-centered theory of judging= Many of the criticisms of virtue jurisprudence are parallel to those offered in the context of debates over virtue ethics. Some of these include: * The charge that virtue jurisprudence does not provide sufficient guidance for making legal decisions. Advocates of virtue-centered theories of judging urge, \\"Do as a virtuous judge would do!\\" This formula provides little instruction to an ordinary decision maker, and it may encourage unedifying debates about the character--or lack thereof--of judges with whom one disagrees. Such virtue-centered standards may be too abstract to provide clear guidance, and may invite inappropriate personal attacks on judges' characters. * The argument that virtue jurisprudence requires inordinate trust in the capacities of judges. In a democratic society, the rightness or wrongness of legal decisions should be decided by criteria that are public and accessible to all citizens. Judges who make decisions based on their own individual view of what an (ideally?) virtuous judge would do, may violate this publicity requirement by relying on a personal ideal of judging, rather than on established legal norms. * The claim that in modern liberal societies there is significant disagreement about what virtues a good or exemplary judge must possess. Some putative judicial virtues (e.g., impartiality, wisdom, open-mindedness, integrity, fairness, industriousness, and good temper) are relatively uncontroversial, while others (such as judicial restraint or sympathy for the underprivileged) are more contentious. Other common criticisms of virtue jurisprudence include: * The claim that rules play a more important role in law than they do in ethics. In law, for example, respect for the rule of law may require judges to decide cases primarily by invoking legal rules and other well-established legal norms. In ethics, there may be more scope for individualized judgment and discretion, as well as a greater focus on issues of personal character and flourishing. * The argument that virtue jurisprudence, in virtue of its commitment to human flourishing as the proper aim of the law, can easily lead to illiberal values and misguided attempts to legislate morality.For a compact discussion of standard objections to virtue jurisprudence, together with possible replies, see Amalia Amaya and Ho Hock Lai, \\"Of Law, Virtue and Justice--An Introduction,\\" in Amalia Amaya and Ho Hock Lai, eds. Law, Virtue and Justice (Portland, OR: Hart Publishing, 2013), p. 9. Virtue as the proper end of law Aristotle argued that the promotion of virtue was the proper end of law. Aquinas argued that true laws (which are rational) can teach virtue by being internalized by those who already possess sufficient virtue to grasp the purpose of the law. Even those who have not yet achieved this level of virtue can be coerced into obedience to the law, and this may enable them to become more virtuous. A contemporary restatement of this view is found in the writings of Robert George. In his book, Making Men Moral, George argues for the promotion of virtue as the end of law and against the contrary views that the purpose of law is either the protection of rights or the general happiness. Law and virtue outside the Western tradition The phrase \\"virtue jurisprudence\\" is usually applied in the context of contemporary Western philosophical thinking about law. There are, however, important ideas about the relationship between law and virtue in other intellectual traditions. One example is provided by Confucian ideas about virtue. In the Analects, Confucius argues that a society in which people are virtuous would have no need of judges, rules, or jurisprudence because people would be able to resolve social conflicts by themselves. Thus, it is argued that the idea of virtue is opposed to the idea of law. It can be argued that even virtuous citizens might disagree about the application of the law, especially where their own interests or ideological commitments are at stake. However, this argument is rather foreign to both traditional and modern Chinese political thought. Chinese political theory tends to assume that the truly virtuous are selfless to the point of martyrdom and would not consider their own personal interests and that the virtuous are able to transcend ideology. At the same time, traditional Chinese political thought regards those with absolute virtue to be historically extremely rare, and that most people, including the Emperor and his officials, are prone to both corruption and error. Consequently, there is a belief that law and indeed government is an unfortunate necessity in dealing with an imperfect world and with imperfect people. The view that the inculcation of virtue is the proper end of legislation contrasts markedly with traditional Chinese thinking on the subject, which argues that laws exist because men are lacking in virtue. Confucianism places very little faith on the ability of law or external pressure to make men moral but rather believes that virtue must come from introspection and education. Throughout Chinese political and intellectual history, the Confucian view on law was frequently contrasted in discourse and practice with Chinese Legalist philosophy.

Positioned as the gateway to Cape Breton just minutes from the Canso Causeway, the town's nickname is \\"Cape Breton's Front Porch.\\"  History  The end of glaciation began 13,500 years ago[5] and ended with the region becoming largely ice free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation.[6] Several thousand years ago the territory of the province became known a part of the territory of the Mi'kmaq nation of Mi'kma'ki. Mi'kma'ki includes what is now the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gasp√© Peninsula. The town of Port Hawkesbury is in the traditional Mi'kmaw district of Unama'ki. In 1605, French colonists established the first permanent European settlement in the future Canada (and the first north of Florida) at Port Royal, founding what would become known as Acadia.[7][8] While the French established the first European settlements on √éle Royale (as the French called Unama'ki) at present day Englishtown in 1629 and the following year at St. Peter's, just 40 kilometres away from present-day Port Hawkesbury, neither settlement lasted past 1659. European settlers did not return to the island until Louisbourg were re-established by the French in 1713. By 1763 most of Acadia, including what had now become Cape Breton Island had come under British control. Port Hawkesbury waterfront, 1890 Founded in 1789 as Ship Harbour, Port Hawkesbury was renamed in honour of Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, who commanded the ship that brought Governor Edward Cornwallis to Halifax.https://archive.org/details/navalchronologyo01schoiala/page/258?q=%22governor+cornwallis%22 Incorporated in 1889, the community built ships for the timber export trade in the early and mid 19th century, such as the brig James, the subject of one of the earliest ship portraits in Canada.[4] Schooners and fishing boats were also built for the inshore and banks fishery by firms such as the noted boat builder H.W. Embree and Sons. Today the town is largely a service centre for western Cape Breton Island, with many of its residents working in large industries, particularly the pulp and paper plant in the industrial park located in the adjacent community of Point Tupper, Richmond County.  Government  Canso Causeway at Port Hawkesbury The Town of Port Hawkesbury is governed by a Council composed of a Mayor and four Councillors elected at- large. [23] The mayor is Brenda Chisholm-Beaton. Day to day activities are managed by a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) who is accountable to Council.[25]Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place on October 15, 2016.[26] The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act.[27] Municipal Council is responsible for all facets of the municipal government, including directly delivered and shared or regional services. Directly delivered services include services such fire, public works, roads, as well as the municipally owned and operated electrical and water utilities. The municipality participates in shared services, such as library services and policing. The town's municipal operating budget was $7.8 million in the 2018/19 fiscal year.[28] Port Hawkesbury is represented in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly by Alana Paon, elected to the riding of Cape Breton-Richmond, and in Canada's House of Commons by Mike Kelloway, elected to represent the riding of Cape Breton‚ÄîCanso.  Economy  In 2006 the Port of Port Hawkesbury was the second largest by annual tonnage in Canada, second only to Vancouver, British Columbia, due to large volumes of crushed rock and gravel shipments and oil trans-shipments. It handled 31.6 million metric tonnes in 2006, of which 21.6 million tonnes was crude petroleum. By 2011, the volume of annual tonnage had dropped to 23.7 million tonnes, making it the 7th largest port in Canada. The port is served by tugs of Svitzer Towing such as the tug Point Chebucto.Mac Mackay, \\"The Announcement\\", Tugfax, July 23, 2010 Historically it was a stop for American coastal steam ships. Located in neighbouring Point Tupper, the Port Hawkesbury Mill began operation in 1962. The overwhelming majority of the paper produced is exported to the United States. The mill has the capability to produce nearly 400,000 tons of supercalendered paper, or 25‚Äì20% of the market for that type of paper. The mill was closed for a year 2011-12, following the 2008 financial crisis, but by 2018 the company reported its annual order book was once again full.  Geography  NASA landsat photo of Cape Breton Island Port Hawkesbury is located inside Inverness County. The land area of the municipality is 8.1 square kilometres with a population density (2016) of just 396.6 persons per square kilometre. This compares to the provincial land area of 52,940 square kilometres and population density of 17.4 persons per square kilometre.\\"Focus on Geography Series, 2011 Census ‚Äì Census subdivision of Cape Breton, RGM ‚Äì Nova Scotia\\" = Climate = Port Hawkesbury experiences a Humid continental climate (Dfb). Due to the proximity to surrounding bodies of water, seasons tend to be delayed when compared to areas further inland. Precipitation is high, with the fall and winter being the wettest time of year and summer being the driest. Winters are cold, snowy and stormy with frequent snowstorms. Summer is the most pleasant time of year, with significantly less precipitation and warm temperatures. The highest (reliable) temperature ever recorded in the strait area was on 7 July 1912 and 19 July 1975. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 7 February 1993.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Port Hawkesbury recorded a population of 3,214 living in 1,345 of its 1,554 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 3,366. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.  Media  *101.5 (FM) - The Hawk *SAERC FM - 93.9 *SAERC TV * The Reporter, community newspaper  Notable people  *Lynn Coady is an author.

A running back (RB) is a member of the offensive backfield in gridiron football. The primary roles of a running back are to receive handoffs from the quarterback to rush the ball, to line up as a receiver to catch the ball, and block.http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/what-the-running-backs-do-in-a- football-game.html There are usually one or two running backs on the field for a given play, depending on the offensive formation. A running back may be a halfback (in certain contexts also referred to as a tailback), a wingback or a fullback. A running back will sometimes be called a \\"feature back\\" if he is the team's starting running back. Halfback/tailback A running back turns up the field in an attempt to reach the end zone. The halfback (HB) or tailback (TB) position is responsible for carrying the ball on the majority of running plays, and may frequently be used as a receiver on short (or sometimes long, depending on the system) passing plays. In the modern game, an effective halfback must have a blend of both quickness and agility as a runner, as well as sure hands and good vision up-field as a receiver. Quarterbacks depend on halfbacks as a safety valve receiver when primary targets downfield are covered or when they are under pressure. Occasionally, halfbacks line up as additional wide receivers. When not serving either of these functions, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football. If a team uses a Wildcat formation, often the halfback is the one who receives the snap directly instead of the quarterback. As a trick play, running backs are occasionally used to pass the ball on a halfback option play or halfback pass. The difference between halfback and tailback is the position of the player in the team's offensive formation. In historical formations, the halfback lined up approximately halfway between the line of scrimmage and the fullback (similarly, quarterbacks lined up a quarter of the distance between the line of scrimmage and the fullback). Because the halfback is usually the team's main ball carrier (while the fullback is primarily a blocker), modern offensive formations have positioned the halfback behind the fullback (at the \\"tail end\\" of the formation), to take advantage of the fullback's blocking abilities. As a result, some systems or playbooks will call for a tailback as opposed to a halfback. In Canadian football, the term tailback is often used interchangeably with running back, while the use of the term halfback is often exclusively reserved for the defensive halfback, which refers to the defensive back halfway between the linebackers and the cornerbacks. Fullback John Riggins In most modern college and professional football schemes, fullbacks (FB) carry the ball infrequently, instead using their stronger physiques as primary \\"lead blockers.\\" On most running plays, the fullback leads the halfback, attempting to block potential tacklers before they reach the ball carrier. When fullbacks are called upon to carry the ball, the situation typically calls for gaining a short amount of yardage, such as scoring from the goal line, as the fullback can use his bulkiness to avoid being tackled early. Fullbacks are sometimes receivers for passing plays, although most plays call for the fullback to remain in the backfield and block any defensive players that make it past the offensive line, a skill referred to as \\"blitz pickup\\". Fullbacks are technically running backs, but today the term \\"running back\\" is usually used in referring to the halfback or tailback. Although modern fullbacks are rarely used as ball carriers, in previous offensive schemes fullbacks would be the designated ball carriers. In high school football, where player sizes vary greatly, fullbacks are still frequently used as ball carriers. In high school and college offenses, the triple option scheme uses the fullback as a primary ball carrier. The fullback plays a unique role by establishing an inside running threat on every play. College teams such as Georgia Tech and Air Force have employed the triple option scheme. While in years past the fullback lined up on the field for almost every offensive play, teams often opt to replace the fullback with an additional wide receiver or a tight end in modern football. Fullbacks in the National Football League today rarely carry or catch the ball since they are used almost exclusively as blockers. Fullbacks are also still used occasionally as rushers on plays when a short gain is needed for a first-down or touchdown or to surprise the defense since they are usually not expecting a full back to run or catch the ball. Pro Football Hall of Fame members Jim Brown, Marion Motley, Franco Harris, John Riggins, and Larry Csonka were fullbacks. Characteristics of a running back =Height and weight= Darren Sproles, a \\"scat back\\" There is a diversity in those who play at the running back position. At one extreme are smaller (5'4\\"‚Äì5'10\\"), shiftier players. These quick, agile, and elusive running backs are often called \\"scat backs\\" because their low center of gravity and maneuverability allow them to dodge tacklers. Running backs known for their elusiveness include Red Grange, Hugh McElhenny, Gale Sayers, and Barry Sanders. At the other extreme are \\"power backs:\\" bigger, stronger players who can break through tackles using brute strength and raw power. They are usually slower runners compared to other backs, and typically run straight ahead (or \\"North-and-South\\" in football terminology) rather than dodging to the outside edges of the playing field. Hall of Famers Earl Campbell, Bronko Nagurski, John Riggins, and Larry Csonka, as well as NFL all-time leading rusher Emmitt Smith, were considered power running backs. More recently the NFL has turned to running backs who combine those traits such as Atlanta Falcons' Todd Gurley, Dallas Cowboys‚Äô All-Pro Ezekiel Elliott, and New York Giants‚Äô Saquon Barkley. These backs combine elusiveness with power and patience as well as receiving ability and blocking to become an all around, three-down backs. =Receiving ability= Over the years, NFL running backs have been used as receivers out of the backfield. On passing plays, a running back will often run a \\"safe route,\\" such as a hook or a flat route, that gives a quarterback a target when all other receivers are covered or when the quarterback feels pressured. Hall of Famer Lenny Moore was a halfback who played primarily as a pass receiver. Some teams have a specialist \\"third down back\\", who is skilled at catching passes or better at pass blocking and \\"picking up the blitz,\\" and thus is often put in the game on third down and long. It can also be used to fool the defense by making them think it is being put into the game for a pass play, when the play is actually a run. James White of the New England Patriots is used as a third- down back, or as an extra wide receiver. His receiving statistics exceed his rushing statistics, with 2,164 yards and 19 touchdowns on 248 receptions, compared to just 856 yards and 7 touchdowns on only 207 carries. =Blocking= Running backs are also required to help the offensive line in passing situations, and, in the case of the fullback, running plays. Running backs will often block blitzing linebackers or safeties on passing plays when the offensive line is occupied with the defensive linemen. On running plays, the fullback will often attempt to create a hole in the offensive line for the running back to run through. Effective blocking backs are usually key components for a running back's success. On passing plays, a running back will stay back to help block and pick up the blitz =Goal line backs= Many teams also have a running back designated as a \\"goal line back\\" or \\"short yardage specialist\\". This running back comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only a little bit of yardage to get a first down or a touchdown. Normally when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line it sends in its goal line formation, which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a running back, and a fullback. The closer it is to the goal line the more likely it is to use this formation. If a certain running back is used often near the goal line he may be called the \\"goal line back.\\" Short yardage and goal line backs often are power backs who are not prone to fumbling, who muscle through or push a large mass of defenders to get the first down or touchdown. =As kick and punt returners= Running backs are sometimes called upon to return punts and kickoffs, a role usually filled by wide receivers and defensive backs, such as cornerbacks, who are generally among the fastest players on the team. A running back, Brian Mitchell, currently holds the NFL records for career kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and career punt return yards (4,999 yards).

They found success as the writers of such crossover hit songs as \\"Hound Dog\\" (1952) and \\"Kansas City\\" (1952). Later in the 1950s, particularly through their work with The Coasters, they created a string of ground-breaking hits‚Äîincluding \\"Young Blood\\" (1957), \\"Searchin'\\" (1957), and \\"Yakety Yak\\" (1958)‚Äîthat used the humorous vernacular of teenagers sung in a style that was openly theatrical rather than personal. They were the first to surround black music with elaborate production values, enhancing its emotional power with the Drifters in \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (1958), which influenced Phil Spector, who studied their productions while playing guitar on their sessions. Leiber and Stoller wrote hits for Elvis Presley, including \\"Love Me\\" (1956), \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" (1957), \\"Loving You\\", \\"Don't\\", and \\"King Creole\\". They also collaborated with other writers on such songs as \\"On Broadway\\", written with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil; \\"Stand By Me\\", written with Ben E. King; \\"Young Blood\\", written with Doc Pomus; and \\"Spanish Harlem\\", co-written by Leiber and Phil Spector. They were sometimes credited under the pseudonym Elmo Glick. In 1964, they launched Red Bird Records with George Goldner and, focusing on the \\"girl group\\" sound, released some of the greatest classics of the Brill Building period. In all, Leiber and Stoller wrote or co-wrote over 70 chart hits. They were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1985 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. Biography =1950s= Both born to Jewish families, Leiber came from Baltimore, Maryland, and Stoller from Long Island, New York, but they met in Los Angeles, California in 1950, where Stoller was a freshman at Los Angeles City College while Leiber was a senior at Fairfax High. Stoller had graduated from Belmont High School. After school, Stoller played piano and Leiber worked in Norty's, a record store on Fairfax Avenue, and when they met, they found they shared a love of blues and rhythm and blues. In 1950, Jimmy Witherspoon recorded and performed their first commercial song, \\"Real Ugly Woman\\". Stoller's name at birth was Michael Stoller, but he later changed it legally to \\"Mike\\". Their first hit composition was \\"Hard Times\\", recorded by Charles Brown, which was a rhythm and blues hit in 1952. \\"Kansas City\\", first recorded in 1952 (as \\"K. C. Loving\\") by rhythm & blues singer Little Willie Littlefield, became a No. 1 pop hit in 1959 for Wilbert Harrison. In 1952, the partners wrote \\"Hound Dog\\" for blues singer Big Mama Thornton, which became a hit for her in 1953. The 1956 Elvis Presley rock version, which was a takeoff of the adaptation that Presley picked up from Freddie Bell's lounge act in Las Vegas, was an even bigger hit. Presley's showstopping mock-burlesque version of \\"Hound Dog\\", playfully bumping and grinding on the Milton Berle Show, created such public excitement that on The Steve Allen Show they slowed down his act, with an unhappy Presley in a tuxedo and blue suede shoes singing his hit to a basset hound. Allen pronounced Presley \\"a good sport\\", and the Leiber-Stoller song would be forever linked to Presley. Leiber and Stoller's later songs often had lyrics more appropriate for pop music, and their combination of rhythm and blues with pop lyrics revolutionized pop, rock and roll, and punk rock. They formed Spark Records in 1953 with their mentor, Lester Sill. Their songs from this period include \\"Smokey Joe's Cafe\\" and \\"Riot in Cell Block #9\\", both recorded by The Robins. The label was later bought by Atlantic Records, which hired Leiber and Stoller in an innovative deal that allowed them to produce for other labels. This, in effect, made them the first independent record producers. At Atlantic, they revitalized the careers of The Drifters and wrote a number of hits for The Coasters, a spin- off of the Robins. Their songs from this period include \\"Charlie Brown\\", \\"Searchin'\\", \\"Yakety Yak\\", \\"Stand By Me\\" (written with Ben E. King), and \\"On Broadway\\" (written with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil). For the Coasters alone, they wrote twenty-four songs that appeared in the US charts. In 1955, Leiber and Stoller produced a recording of their song \\"Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots\\" with a white vocal group, the Cheers. Soon after, the song was recorded by √âdith Piaf in a French translation titled, \\"L'Homme √† la Moto\\". The European royalties from another Cheers record, \\"Bazoom (I Need Your Lovin')\\", funded a 1956 trip to Europe for Stoller and his first wife, Meryl, on which they met Piaf. Their return to New York was aboard the ill-fated SS Andrea Doria, which was rammed and sunk by the Swedish liner MS Stockholm. The Stollers had to finish the journey to New York aboard another ship, the Cape Ann. After their rescue, Leiber greeted Stoller at the dock with the news that \\"Hound Dog\\" had become a hit for Elvis Presley. Stoller's reply was, \\"Elvis who?\\" They would go on to write more hits for Presley, including the title songs for three of his movies‚ÄîLoving You, Jailhouse Rock, and King Creole‚Äîas well as the rock and roll Christmas song, \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", for Presley's first Christmas album. In March 1958 both men appeared on the tv show What's my Line as Rock and Roll Composers of Hounddog, Jailhouse Rock and Don't. =Post-1950s= In the beginning of the 1960s, they started Daisy Records and recorded Bob Moore and The Temps (w/Roy Buchanan) on their label. In the early 1960s, Phil Spector served an apprenticeship of sorts with Leiber and Stoller in New York City, developing his record producer's craft while observing and playing guitar on their sessions, including the guitar solo on The Drifters' \\"On Broadway\\". After leaving the employ of Atlantic Records‚Äîwhere they produced, and often wrote, many classic recordings by The Drifters with Ben E. King‚ÄîLeiber and Stoller produced a series of records for United Artists Records, including hits by Jay and the Americans (\\"She Cried\\"), The Exciters (\\"Tell Him\\"), and The Clovers (\\"Love Potion #9\\", also written by Leiber and Stoller). In the 1960s, Leiber and Stoller founded and briefly owned Red Bird Records, which issued The Shangri-Las' \\"Leader of the Pack\\" and The Dixie Cups' \\"Chapel of Love\\". After selling Red Bird, they continued working as independent producers and songwriters. Their best known song from this period is \\"Is That All There Is?\\" recorded by Peggy Lee in 1969; it earned her a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy. Earlier in the decade, they had had a hit with Lee with \\"I'm a Woman\\" (1962). Their last major hit production was \\"Stuck in the Middle With You\\" by Stealers Wheel, taken from the band's 1972 eponymous debut album, which the duo produced. In 1975, they recorded Mirrors, an album of art songs with Peggy Lee. A remixed and expanded version of the album was released in 2005 as Peggy Lee Sings Leiber and Stoller. Also in 1975, they produced the Procol Harum album Procol's Ninth, which included the UK Top 20 single \\"Pandora's Box\\" and a version of Leiber and Stoller's \\"I Keep Forgettin'\\". In the late 1970s, A&M; Records recruited Leiber and Stoller to write and produce an album for Elkie Brooks; Two Days Away (1977) proved a success in the UK and most of Europe. Their composition \\"Pearl's a Singer\\" (written with Ralph Dino & John Sembello) became a hit for Brooks, and remains her signature tune. In 1978, mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her pianist-composer husband William Bolcom recorded an album, Other Songs by Leiber and Stoller, featuring a number of the songwriters' more unusual (and satiric) works, including \\"Let's Bring Back World War I\\", written specifically for (and dedicated to) Bolcom and Morris; and \\"Humphrey Bogart\\", a tongue-in- cheek song about obsession with the actor.Joan Morris and William Bolcom, Other Songs by Leiber and Stoller, Nonesuch Records H-71346, 1978 In 1979, Leiber and Stoller produced another album for Brooks: Live and Learn. In 1982, Steely Dan member Donald Fagen recorded their song \\"Ruby Baby\\" on his album The Nightfly. That same year, former Doobie Brothers member Michael McDonald released \\"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)\\", inspired by Leiber and Stoller's \\"I Keep Forgettin'\\" for which they were eventually given a 50% songwriting credit. 2000s In 2009, Simon & Schuster published Hound Dog: The Leiber and Stoller Autobiography, written by Leiber and Stoller with David Ritz. As of 2007, their songs are managed by Sony/ATV Music Publishing. With collaborator Artie Butler, Stoller wrote the music to the musical The People in the Picture, with book and lyrics by Iris Rainer Dart. Stoller and Butler's music received a 2011 Drama Desk Award nomination.

Leiber and Stoller affected the course of modern popular music in 1957, when they wrote and produced the crossover double-sided hit by The Coasters, \\"Young Blood\\"/\\"Searchin'\\". They released \\"Yakety Yak\\", which was a mainstream hit, as was the follow-up, \\"Charlie Brown\\". This was followed by \\"Along Came Jones\\", \\"Poison Ivy\\", \\"Shoppin' for Clothes\\", and \\"Little Egypt (Ying-Yang)\\". They produced and co-wrote \\"There Goes My Baby\\", a hit for The Drifters in 1959, which introduced the use of strings for saxophone-like riffs, tympani for the Brazilian baion rhythm they incorporated, and lavish production values into the established black R&B; sound, laying the groundwork for the soul music that would follow.

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas southeast of Mount Everest, on the border between Nepal and Tibet Autonomous Region, China. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak whose shape is a four-sided pyramid. Makalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II () lies about north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (). Climbing history The first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu. They attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray). Makalu was first summited on May 15, 1955 by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coup√©, Pierre Leroux and Andr√© Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route. An ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed. =Notable ascents= Glacier on Makalu Makalu Makalu 3D * 1955 North Face to Northeast Ridge FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France. * 1970: Southeast Ridge FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954, was made by Y.

It would be fair however to confine Cao's birth date to between 1715 and 1724, as attested by the elegiac poems by his friends ‚Äì Duncheng (Êï¶Ë™†) and Zhang Yiquan (ÂºµÂÆúÊ≥â) ‚Äì which stated Cao was forty and nearly fifty respectively when he died. A much fuller discussion can be found under the relevant sections in Chen Weizhao's Hongxue Tongshi (\\"A History of Redology\\"), Shanghai People's Publishing Press, 2005, pp. 194‚Äì197; 348‚Äì349; 657‚Äì662.Briggs, Asa (ed.)

He is best known as the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. His given name was C√°o ZhƒÅn () and his courtesy name was M√®ngru«én (). Family Cao Xueqin was born to a Han Chinese clan that was brought into personal service (as booi aha or bondservants of Cigu Niru) to the Manchu royalty in the late 1610s.This section summarises the more salient facts on Cao Xueqin's family as unearthed by 20th-century Redologists like Zhou Ruchang (Âë®Ê±ùÊòå) and Feng Qiyong (È¶ÆÂÖ∂Â∫∏), which formed the basis of modern Redology. A detailed summary into the researches on Cao Xueqin's genealogy can be found, once again, in Chen, pp. 362‚Äì366; 681‚Äì687. His ancestors distinguished themselves through military service in the Plain White Banner () of the Eight Banners and subsequently held posts as officials which brought both prestige and wealth. After the Plain White Banner was put under the direct jurisdiction of the Qing emperor, Cao's family began to serve in civil positions of the Imperial Household Department. During the Kangxi Emperor's reign, the clan's prestige and power reached its height. Cao Xueqin's grandfather, Cao Yin (), was a childhood playmate to Kangxi while Cao Yin's mother, Lady Sun (), was Kangxi's wet nurse. Two years after his ascension, Kangxi appointed Cao Xueqin's great-grandfather, Cao Xi (), as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles () in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing), and the family relocated there. When Cao Xi died in 1684, Cao Yin, as Kangxi's personal confidant, took over the post. Cao Yin was one of the era's most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector. Jonathan Spence notes the strong Manchu element in the lives of these Imperial Household bond servants. They balanced the two cultures: Cao Yin took pleasure in horse riding and hunting and Manchu military culture, but was at the same time a sensitive interpreter of Chinese culture to the Manchus. By the early 18th century, the Cao clan had become so rich and influential as to be able to play host four times to the Kangxi Emperor in his six separate itinerant trips south to the Nanjing region. In 1705, the emperor ordered Cao Yin, himself a fluent poet, to compile all surviving shi (lyric poems) from the Tang dynasty, which resulted in The Complete Poems of the Tang.Jonathan D. Spence. Ts'ao Yin and the K'ang-Hsi Emperor: Bondservant and Master. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965), esp. pp. 53‚Äì54, 157‚Äì165. When Cao Yin died in 1712, Kangxi passed the office over to Cao Yin's only son, Cao Yong (). Cao Yong died in 1715. Kangxi then allowed the family to adopt a paternal nephew, Cao Fu (), as Cao Yin's posthumous son to continue in that position. Hence the clan held the office of Imperial Textile Commissioner at Jiangning for three generations. The family's fortunes lasted until Kangxi's death and the ascension of the Yongzheng Emperor to the throne. Yongzheng severely attacked the family and in 1727 confiscated their properties, while Cao Fu was thrown in jail. This was ostensibly for their mismanagement of funds, though perhaps this purge was politically motivated. When Cao Fu was released a year later, the impoverished family was forced to relocate to Beijing. Cao Xueqin, still a young child, lived in poverty with his family. Life Cao Xueqin Memorial Museum in Nanjing. Almost no records of Cao's early childhood and adulthood have survived. Redology scholars are still debating Cao's exact date of birth, though he is known to have been around forty to fifty at his death.See Note 1. Cao Xueqin was the son of either Cao Fu or Cao Yong.Chen, pp. 190; 681‚Äì684 It is known for certain that Cao Yong's only son was born posthumously in 1715; some Redologists believe this son might be Cao Xueqin. In the clan register (), however, Cao Yong's only son was recorded as a certain Cao Tianyou (). Further complicating matters for Redologists is the fact that neither the names Cao Zhan nor Cao Xueqin‚Äînames that his contemporaries knew him by‚Äîcan be traced in the register.Chen, pp. 345‚Äì346 Most of what we know about Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends.This paragraph is largely a summary of Chen, pp. 72‚Äì74. Cao eventually settled in the countryside west of Beijing where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings. Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker. Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent, highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been Dream of the Red Chamber. They praised both his stylish paintings, particularly of cliffs and rocks, and originality in poetry, which they likened to Li He's. Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764, leaving his novel in a very advanced stage of completion. (At least the first draft had been completed, some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives.) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son. Cao achieved posthumous fame through his life's work. The novel, written in \\"blood and tears\\", as a commentator said, is a vivid recreation of an illustrious family at its height and its subsequent downfall. A small group of close family and friends appeared to have been transcribing his manuscript when Cao died quite suddenly in 1763‚Äì4, apparently out of grief owing to the death of a son. Extant handwritten copies of this work‚Äîsome 80 chapters‚Äîhad been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao's death and scribal copies soon became prized collectors' items. In 1791, Cheng Weiyuan () and Gao E (), who claimed to have access to Cao's working papers, edited and published a \\"complete\\" 120-chapter version. This was its first woodblock print edition. Reprinted a year later with more revisions, this 120-chapter edition is the novel's most printed version. Many modern scholars question the authorship of the last 40 chapters of the novel, whether it was actually completed by Cao Xueqin. To this very day, Cao continues to be influential on new generations of Chinese novelists and poets, such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to him in her poem To Cao Xueqin.

He brought multitasking to personal computers in 1985 with the creation of the Amiga Computer operating system kernel,Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Exec and he is the designer of the REBOL computer language, REBOL/IOS collaboration environment, the Safeworlds AltME private messaging system, and other products. Carl is currently a Principal Engineer at Roku, Inc. Background Carl Sassenrath was born in 1957 to Charles and Carolyn Sassenrath in California. His father was a chemical engineer involved in research and development related to petroleum refining, paper production, and air pollution control systems. In the late 1960s his family relocated from the San Francisco Bay Area to the small town of Eureka, California. From his early childhood Sassenrath was actively involved in electronics, amateur radio, photography, and filmmaking. When he was 13, Sassenrath began working for KEET a PBS public broadcasting television station. A year later he became a cameraman for KVIQ (American Broadcasting Company affiliate then) and worked his way up to being technical director and director for news, commercials, and local programming. In 1980 Sassenrath graduated from the University of California, Davis with a B.S. in EECS (electrical engineering and computer science). During his studies he became interested in operating systems, parallel processing, programming languages, and neurophysiology. He was a teaching assistant for graduate computer language courses and a research assistant in neuroscience and behavioral biology. His uncle, Dr. Julius Sassenrath, headed the educational psychology department at UC Davis, and his aunt, Dr. Ethel Sassenrath, was one of the original researchers of THC at the California National Primate Research Center. Career =Hewlett-Packard= During his final year at the university, Sassenrath joined Hewlett Packard's Computer Systems Division as a member of the Multi-Programming Executive (MPE) file system design group for HP3000 computers. His task was to implement a compiler for a new type of control language called Outqueue‚Äîa challenge because the language was both descriptive and procedural. A year later, Sassenrath became a member of the MPE-IV OS kernel team and later part of the HPE kernel group. Carl Sassenrath at south pole, 1982 While at HP Sassenrath became interested in minimizing the high complexity found in most operating systems of that time and set out to formulate his own concepts of a microkernel-based OS. He proposed them to HP, but found the large company complacent to the \\"smaller OS\\" ideas. In late 1981 and early 1982 Sassenrath took an academic leave to do atmospheric physics research for National Science Foundation at Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station. Upon returning, Sassenrath reached an agreement with HP to pursue independent research into new areas of computing, including graphical user interfaces and remote procedure call methods of distributed computing. Later in 1982, impressed by the new computing ideas being published from Xerox PARC, Sassenrath formed an HP project to develop the modern style of window-based mouse-driven GUIs. The project, called Probus (for professional business workstation) was created on a prototype Sun Microsystems workstation borrowed from Andy Bechtolsheim while he was at Stanford University. Probus clearly demonstrated the power of graphical user interfaces, and the system also incorporated hyperlinks and early distributed computing concepts. At HP, Sassenrath was involved with and influenced by a range of HP language projects including Ada, Pascal, Smalltalk, Lisp, Forth, SPL, and a variety of experimental languages. =Amiga Computer= Amiga Team, 1985 (Sassenrath in plaid shirt to right of sign) In 1983, Carl Sassenrath joined Amiga Computer, Inc., a small startup company in Silicon Valley. As Manager of Operating Systems he was asked to design a new operating system for the Amiga, an advanced multimedia personal computer system that later became the Commodore Amiga. As a sophisticated computer for its day (Amiga used 25 DMA channels and a coprocessor), Sassenrath decided to create a preemptive multitasking operating system within a microkernel design. This was a novel approach for 1983 when other personal computer operating systems were single tasking such as MS-DOS (1981) and the Macintosh (1984). The Amiga multitasking kernel was also one of the first to implement a microkernel OS methodology based on a real-time message passing (inter-process communication) core known as Exec (for executive) with dynamically loaded libraries and devices as optional modules around the core. This design gave the Amiga OS a great extensibility and flexibility within the limited memory capacity of computers in the 1980s. Sassenrath later noted that the design came as a necessity of trying to integrate into ROM dozens of internal libraries and devices including graphics, sound, graphical user interface, floppy disc, file systems, and others. This dynamic modular method also allowed hundreds of additional modules to be added by external developers over the years. After the release of the Amiga in 1985, Sassenrath left Commodore- Amiga to pursue new programming language design ideas that he had been contemplating since his university days. =Apple Computer= In 1986, Sassenrath was recruited to Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) to invent the next generation of operating systems. He was part of the Aquarius project, a quad-core CPU project (simulated on Apple's own Cray XMP-48) that was intended to become a 3D-based successor to the Macintosh. During that period the C++ language had just been introduced, but Sassenrath, along with many other Apple researchers, preferred the more pure OO implementation of the Smalltalk language. Working at ATG with computing legends like Alan Kay, Larry Tessler, Dan Ingalls, Bill Atkinson and others provided Sassenrath with a wealth of resources and knowledge that helped shape his views of computing languages and systems. =Sassenrath Research= In 1988, Sassenrath left Silicon Valley for the mountains of Ukiah valley, 2 hours north of San Francisco. From there he founded multimedia technology companies such as Pantaray, American Multimedia, and VideoStream. He also implemented the Logo programming language for the Amiga, managed the software OS development for CDTV, one of the first CD-ROM TV set-top boxes, and wrote the OS for Viscorp Ed, one of the first Internet TV set-top boxes. =REBOL Technologies= In 1996, after watching the growth and development of programming languages like Java, Perl, and Python, Sassenrath decided to publish his own ideas within the world of computer languages. The result was REBOL, the relative expression-based object language. REBOL is intended to be lightweight, and specifically to support efficient distributed computing. Sassenrath describes REBOL as a balance between the concepts of context and symbolism, allowing users to create new relationships between symbols and their meanings. By doing so, he attempts to merge the concepts of code, data, and metadata. Sassenrath considers REBOL experimental because it provides greater control over context than most other programming languages. Words can be used to form different grammars in different contexts (called dialecting). Sassenrath claims REBOL is the ultimate endpoint for the evolution of markup language methodologies, such as XML. In 1998, Sassenrath founded REBOL Technologies, a company he still runs. The company has released several versions of REBOL and produced additional products such as REBOL/View, REBOL/Command, REBOL/SDK, and REBOL/IOS. Sassenrath implemented REBOL V3.0 and released it to GitHub on December 12, 2012: https://github.com/rebol/r3. =Roku= Sassenrath is now a principal engineer at Roku, Inc. Personal Sassenrath lives in Ukiah, California, where he grows grapes and makes wine, and is interested in amateur radio, video production, quantum electrodynamics, and boating. He volunteers with the Television Improvement Association, a community organization that brings free, over-the-air television broadcasts into the Ukiah area.

The aircraft was named for its bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, in reference to his bombing talents. It flew 12 training and practice missions in which it bombed Japanese-held Pacific islands and dropped pumpkin bombs on targets in Japan. It was the only aircraft to participate in both the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, albeit as an observation aircraft on each mission. After the war ended it returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. It was scrapped in September 1949 after being heavily damaged in an accident at Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, the year before. Aircraft history Built at the Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Plant at Omaha, Nebraska, The Great Artiste (B-29-40-MO 44-27353) was a Silverplate B-29 Superfortress bomber. It was accepted by the Army Air Forces on 20 April 1945, and flown to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by its assigned crew C-15, commanded by First Lieutenant Charles D. Albury, in May. It departed Wendover for North Field, Tinian on 22 June. It was originally assigned Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 9, but on 1 August it was given the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and it had its Victor number changed to 89 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft. Its nose art was painted after the Nagasaki mission. The name purportedly referred to the talents of the bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, with both the Norden bombsight and with women. In addition to its use on the nuclear bomb missions, The Great Artiste was flown by five different crews on 12 training and practice missions. It flew bombing missions against Rota on 4 July, Truk on 8 July, and Marcus on 9 July. It returned to bomb Rota again on 12 and 14 July, and bombed Guguan on 18 and 19 July. It was flown by Albury and crew C-15 on two combat missions, one of which was aborted, and the other in which it used a pumpkin bomb to attack the railroad yards at Kobe on 24 July. Captain Bob Lewis and crew B-9 flew it to drop a pumpkin bomb on an industrial target in Koriyama on 29 July. Flown by 393d commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, it was assigned to the Hiroshima mission on 6 August 1945, as the blast measurement instrumentation aircraft. On the mission to bomb Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, it was to have been the aircraft carrying the bomb, but the mission schedule had been moved forward two days because of weather considerations, and the instrumentation had not yet been removed from the aircraft. To avoid delaying the mission, Sweeney traded airplanes with the crew of Bockscar to carry the Fat Man atomic bomb to Nagasaki. Captain Frederick C. Bock and his C-13 crew flew The Great Artiste to Nagasaki on its instrument support mission, and landed with it on Okinawa at the conclusion of the mission. It was the only aircraft to directly participate in both missions. Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target on the Nagasaki flight. Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura. In November 1945 it returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, where it remained for the rest of its flying career, except for a brief period when it was assigned to Task Force 1.5 for Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946. It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.

Born in London, Ontario, Chambers' painting style shifted from surrealist-influenced to photo-realist-influenced. He used the term \\"Perceptual Realism\\" and later \\"perceptualism\\" to describe his style. He began working with film in the 1960s, completing six by 1970. Stan Brakhage proclaimed Chambers' The Hart of London as \\"one of the greatest films ever made.\\"Brakhage, 123 Biography Born John Richard Chambers in London, Ontario, Chambers signed his name as John until 1970 and thereafter was known as Jack professionally and posthumously. Chambers spent eight years (1953-1961) studying and working in Europe after studying at H.B. Beal Secondary School and the University of Western Ontario. While in Europe he met Pablo Picasso, who suggested he continue his studies in Barcelona. He called his own work \\"perceptual realism,\\"Chambers, \\"Perceptual Realism\\", p. 34 a kind of surrealism based on his own dreams and memories and the existentialist philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. When he returned to London Chambers worked with fellow London native Greg Curnoe.Elder, p. 7 In 1969 he was diagnosed with leukemia. For the rest of his life he painted more realistically, often depicting sites in London and the surrounding area. An example of this is 401 Towards London No. 1 (1968‚Äì1969), a view of Highway 401 heading westward towards London. In 1968 he founded Canadian Artists' Representation (CARFAC), now a national organization of artists, after an argument with the National Gallery of Canada over reproduction rights and fees. His work is in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada,Artist Gallery, National Gallery of Canada the Art Gallery of Ontario,AGO Contemporary Collection and Museum London. An elementary school Jack Chambers Public School (and the streets surrounding it) are named for him in London, and a tree was planted in his memory in Gibbons Park after his death. The 2012 retrospective of his work at the Art Gallery of Ontario has helped introduce his oeuvre to a new audience. Perceptual Realism Chambers evolved his theory of Perceptual Realism in the late 1960s in an essay of the same name. He argued for different types of realism and believed that his approach was unique. Art historian Mark Cheetham calls it \\"a fully articulated position that detailed art‚Äôs profound and spiritual relationship with primary sensory experience\\" and applies to his most notable films and paintings.Cheetham, p. 7 Perceptual Realism showed the essence of matter through light and material. Chambers called it \\"a faculty of inner vision where the object appears in the splendour of its essential namelessness.Chambers quoted in Cheetham, p. 12 Paintings The foundations of Chambers‚Äô painting technique were laid during his training in Spain. Many of his paintings from that period show the influence of Surrealism. After his return to Canada in 1961 he experimented with paint application and vibrant colour. By the mid-1960s his style changed again as he worked a sense of temporal movement into his paintings.Cheetham, pp. 35-36 Forms were fragmented in these paintings: \\"A painting gets put together just like an experience ‚Äì in particles.\\"Chambers quoted in Cheetham, p. 12 In the mid-1960s Chambers also produced his silver paintings using aluminum pigment. Other artists, including Andy Warhol, also experimented with this unusual metallic colour.Cheetham, p. 37 Films Still of The Hart of London (1970) Between 1964 and 1970, Chambers completed six films varying in length between nine minutes and 79 minutes. Working in both black and white and colour film, his works were montages dealing on the surface with his domestic life and images of London, Ontario.

The Paris Peace Conference was the formal meeting in 1919 and 1920 of the victorious Allies after the end of World War I to set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers. Dominated by the leaders of Britain, France, the United States and Italy, it resulted in five controversial treaties that rearranged the map of Europe and imposed financial penalties. Germany and the other losing nations had no voice which gave rise to political resentments that lasted for decades. The conference involved diplomats from 32 countries and nationalities, and its major decisions were the creation of the League of Nations and the five peace treaties with the defeated states; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as \\"mandates,\\" chiefly to Britain and France, the imposition of reparations upon Germany, and the drawing of new national boundaries, sometimes with plebiscites, to reflect ethnic boundaries more closely. The main result was the Treaty of Versailles with Germany; Article 231 of the treaty placed the whole guilt for the war on \\"the aggression of Germany and her allies.\\" That provision proved to be very humiliating for Germany and set the stage for the expensive reparations that Germany was intended to pay (it paid only a small portion before its last payment in 1931). The five great powers (France, Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States) controlled the Conference. The \\"Big Four\\" were French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, US President Woodrow Wilson, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. They met informally 145 times and made all major decisions before they were ratified.Rene Albrecht-Carrie, Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna (1958) p. 363 The conference began on 18 January 1919. With respect to its end, Professor Michael Neiberg noted, \\"Although the senior statesmen stopped working personally on the conference in June 1919, the formal peace process did not really end until July 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne was signed.\\" It is often referred to as the \\"Versailles Conference,\\" but only the signing of the first treaty took place there, in the historic palace, and the negotiations occurred at the Quai d'Orsay, in Paris. Overview and direct results The Conference formally opened on 18 January 1919 at the Quai d‚ÄôOrsay in Paris.Erik Goldstein The First World War Peace Settlements, 1919‚Äì1925 p49 Routledge (2013) This date was symbolic, as it was the anniversary of the proclamation of William I as German Emperor in 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, shortly before the end of the Siege of Paris \\\\- a day itself imbued with significance in its turn in Germany as the anniversary of the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. The Delegates from 27 nations (delegates representing 5 nationalities were for the most part ignored) were assigned to 52 commissions, which held 1,646 sessions to prepare reports, with the help of many experts, on topics ranging from prisoners of war to undersea cables, to international aviation, to responsibility for the war. Key recommendations were folded into the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, which had 15 chapters and 440 clauses, as well as treaties for the other defeated nations. The five major powers (France, Britain, Italy, the U.S., and Japan) controlled the Conference. Amongst the \\"Big Five\\", in practice Japan only sent a former prime minister and played a small role; and the \\"Big Four\\" leaders dominated the conference. The four met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by other attendees. The open meetings of all the delegations approved the decisions made by the Big Four. The conference came to an end on 21 January 1920 with the inaugural General Assembly of the League of Nations.Antony Lentin, \\"Germany: a New Carthage?\\" History Today (2012) 62#1 pp. 22‚Äì27 onlinePaul Birdsall, Versailles Twenty Years After (1941) is a convenient history and analysis of the conference. Longer and more recent is Margaret Macmillan, Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War (2002), also published as Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World (2003); a good short overview is Alan Sharp, The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking after the First World War, 1919‚Äì1923 (2nd ed. 2008) Five major peace treaties were prepared at the Paris Peace Conference (with, in parentheses, the affected countries): * the Treaty of Versailles, 28 June 1919 (Germany) * the Treaty of Saint-Germain, 10 September 1919 (Austria) * the Treaty of Neuilly, 27 November 1919 (Bulgaria) * the Treaty of Trianon, 4 June 1920 (Hungary) * the Treaty of S√®vres, 10 August 1920; subsequently revised by the Treaty of Lausanne, 24 July 1923 (Ottoman Empire/Republic of Turkey). The major decisions were the establishment of the League of Nations; the five peace treaties with defeated enemies; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as \\"mandates\\", chiefly to members of the British Empire and to France; reparations imposed on Germany, and the drawing of new national boundaries (sometimes with plebiscites) to better reflect the forces of nationalism. The main result was the Treaty of Versailles, with Germany, which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on \\"the aggression of Germany and her allies\\". This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for very high reparations Germany was supposed to pay (it paid only a small portion before reparations ended in 1931). As the conference's decisions were enacted unilaterally and largely on the whims of the Big Four, Paris was effectively the center of a world government during the conference, which deliberated over and implemented the sweeping changes to the political geography of Europe. Most famously, the Treaty of Versailles itself weakened the German military and placed full blame for the war and costly reparations on Germany's shoulders, and the later humiliation and resentment in Germany is often sometimes considered by historians to be one of the direct causes of Nazi Party's electoral successes and one of the indirect causes of World War II. The League of Nations proved controversial in the United States since critics said it subverted the powers of the US Congress to declare war; the US Senate did not ratify any of the peace treaties and so the United States never joined the League. Instead, the 1921-1923 Harding administration concluded new treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. The German Weimar Republic was not invited to attend the conference at Versailles. Representatives of White Russia but not Communist Russia were at the conference. Numerous other nations sent delegations to appeal for various unsuccessful additions to the treaties, and parties lobbied for causes ranging from independence for the countries of the South Caucasus to Japan's unsuccessful proposal for racial equality to the other great powers. Mandates A central issue of the conference was the disposition of the overseas colonies of Germany. (Austria-Hungary did not have major colonies, and the Ottoman Empire was a separate issue.)Alan Sharp, The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking After the First World War, 1919‚Äì1923 (2nd ed. 2008) ch 7Andrew J. Crozier, \\"The Establishment of the Mandates System 1919‚Äì25: Some Problems Created by the Paris Peace Conference,\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1979) 14#3 pp 483‚Äì513 in JSTOR. The British dominions wanted their reward for their sacrifice. Australia wanted New Guinea, New Zealand wanted Samoa, and South Africa wanted South West Africa. Wilson wanted the League to administer all German colonies until they were ready for independence. Lloyd George realized he needed to support his dominions and so he proposed a compromise: there be three types of mandates. Mandates for the Turkish provinces were one category and would be divided up between Britain and France. Mandates of the League of Nations The second category, of New Guinea, Samoa, and South West Africa, were located so close to responsible supervisors that the mandates could hardly be given to anyone except Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Finally, the African colonies would need the careful supervision as \\"Class B\\" mandates, which could be provided only by experienced colonial powers: Britain, France, and Belgium although Italy and Portugal received small amounts of territory. Wilson and the others finally went along with the solution. The dominions received \\"Class C Mandates\\" to the colonies that they wanted. Japan obtained mandates over German possessions north of the Equator.Paul Birdsall, Versailles Twenty Years After (1941) pp. 58‚Äì82Macmillan, Paris 1919, pp. 98‚Äì106 Wilson wanted no mandates for the United States, but his main advisor, Colonel House, was deeply involved in awarding the others.Scot David Bruce, Woodrow Wilson's Colonial Emissary: Edward M. House and the Origins of the Mandate System, 1917‚Äì1919 (University of Nebraska Press, 2013) Wilson was especially offended by Australian demands and had some memorable clashes with Hughes, this the most famous: : British approach The British Air Section at the conference The maintenance of the unity, territories, and interests of the British Empire was an overarching concern for the British delegates to the conference, but they entered the conference with more specific goals with this order of priority: * Ensuring the security of France * Removing the threat of the German High Seas Fleet * Settling territorial contentions * Supporting the League of Nations The Racial Equality Proposal, put forth by the Japanese did not directly conflict with any core British interest, but as the conference progressed, its full implications on immigration to the British dominions, with Australia taking particular exception, would become a major point of contention within the delegation. Ultimately, Britain did not see the proposal as being one of the fundamental aims of the conference. Its delegation was, therefore, willing to sacrifice the proposal to placate the Australian delegation and thus help to satisfy its overarching aim of preserving the empire's unity.Shimazu (1998), pp. 14‚Äì15, 117. Britain had reluctantly consented to the attendance of separate dominion delegations, but the British managed to rebuff attempts by the envoys of the newly proclaimed Irish Republic to put its case to the conference for self-determination, diplomatic recognition, and membership of the proposed League of Nations. The Irish envoys' final \\"Demand for Recognition\\" in a letter to Clemenceau, the chairman, was not answered. Britain planned to legislate for two Irish Home Rule states, without dominion status, and accordingly passed the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Irish nationalists were generally unpopular with the Allies in 1919 because of their anti-war stance during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. David Lloyd George commented that he did \\"not do badly\\" at the peace conference \\"considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon.\\" This was a reference to the great idealism of Wilson, who desired a lenient peace with Germany, and the stark realism of Clemenceau, who was determined to see Germany punished. =Dominion representation= The Australian delegation, with Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes in the center The dominion governments were not originally given separate invitations to the conference but were expected to send representatives as part of the British delegation. Convinced that Canada had become a nation on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the conference. That was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw a Dominion delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men than the 50,000 American men list, it had at least the right to the representation of a \\"minor\\" power. Lloyd George eventually relented, and persuaded the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa and that those countries receive their own seats in the League of Nations. Canada, despite its huge losses in the war, did not ask for either reparations or mandates.Margaret McMillan, \\"Canada and the Peace Settlements,\\" in David Mackenzie, ed., Canada and the First World War (2005) pp. 379‚Äì408 The Australian delegation, led by Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes fought greatly for its demands: reparations, the annexation of German New Guinea, and the rejection of the Racial Equality Proposal. He said that he had no objection to the proposal if it was stated in unambiguous terms that it did not confer any right to enter Australia. He was concerned by the rise of Japan. Within months of the declaration of war in 1914, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand had seized all of Germany's possessions in the Far East and the Pacific Ocean. Japan occupied German possessions with the blessings of the British, but Hughes was alarmed by the policy. French approach Woodrow Wilson, Georges Clemenceau, and David Lloyd George confer at the Paris Peace Conference (No√´l Dorville, 1919) French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau controlled his delegation, and his chief goal was to weaken Germany militarily, strategically, and economically.MacMillan, Paris 1919 pp 26‚Äì35David Robin Watson, Georges Clemenceau (1974) pp 338‚Äì65 Having personally witnessed two German attacks on French soil in the last 40 years, he was adamant for Germany not to be permitted to attack France again. Particularly, Clemenceau sought an American and British joint guarantee of French security in the event of another German attack. Clemenceau also expressed skepticism and frustration with Wilson's Fourteen Points and complained: \\"Mr. Wilson bores me with his fourteen points. Why, God Almighty has only ten!\\" Wilson won a few points by signing a mutual defense treaty with France, but he did not present it to the Senate for ratification and so it never took effect. Another possible French policy was to seek a rapprochement with Germany. In May 1919 the diplomat Ren√© Massigli was sent on several secret missions to Berlin. During his visits, he offered, on the behalf of his government, to revise the territorial and economic clauses of the upcoming peace treaty. Massigli spoke of the desirability of \\"practical, verbal discussions\\" between French and German officials that would lead to a \\"Franco-German collaboration.\\" Furthermore, Massagli told the Germans that the French thought of the \\"Anglo- Saxon powers\\" (the United States and the British Empire) to be the major threat to France in the post-war world. He argued that both France and Germany had a joint interest in opposing \\"Anglo-Saxon domination\\" of the world, and he warned that the \\"deepening of opposition\\" between the French and the Germans \\"would lead to the ruin of both countries, to the advantage of the Anglo-Saxon powers.\\"Trachtenberg (1979), p. 43. The Germans rejected the French offers because they considered the French overtures to be a trap to trick them into accepting the Treaty of Versailles unchanged; also, German Foreign Minister, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau thought that the United States was more likely to reduce the severity of the peace treaty than France was. Eventually, it became Lloyd George who pushed for better terms for Germany. Italian approach From left to right: Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Clemenceau, Lloyd George and the Italians Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and Sidney Sonnino In 1914, Italy remained neutral despite the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria- Hungary. In 1915, it joined the Allies to gain the territories promised by the Triple Entente in the secret Treaty of London: Trentino, the Tyrol as far as Brenner, Trieste, Istria, most of the Dalmatian Coast (except Fiume), Valona, a protectorate over Albania, Antalya (in Turkey), and possibly colonies in Africa. Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando tried to obtain full implementation of the Treaty of London, as agreed by France and Britain before the war. He had popular support because of the loss of 700,000 soldiers and a budget deficit of 12,000,000,000 Italian lire during the war made both the government and people feel entitled to all of those territories and even others that not mentioned in the Treaty of London, particularly Fiume, which many Italians believed should be annexed to Italy because of the city's Italian population.Macmillan, ch 22 Orlando, unable to speak English, conducted negotiations jointly with his Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino, a Protestant of British origins who spoke the language. Together, they worked primarily to secure the partition of the Habsburg Monarchy. At the conference, Italy gained Istria, Trieste, Trentino, and South Tyrol. Most of Dalmatia, however, was given to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Fiume remained disputed territory, causing a nationalist outrage. Orlando obtained other results, such as the permanent membership of Italy in the League of Nations and the promise by the Allies to transfer British Jubaland and the French Aozou strip to Italian colonies. Protectorates over Albania and Antalya were also recognized, but nationalists considered the war to be a mutilated victory, and Orlando was ultimately forced to abandon the conference and to resign. Francesco Saverio Nitti took his place and signed the treaties. H. James Burgwyn, Legend of the Mutilated Victory: Italy, the Great War and the Paris Peace Conference, 1915‚Äì1919 (1993) There was a general disappointment in Italy, which the nationalists and fascists used to build the idea that Italy was betrayed by the Allies and refused what had been promised. That was a cause for the general rise of Italian fascism. Orlando refused to see the war as a mutilated victory and replied to nationalists calling for a greater expansion, \\"Italy today is a great state... on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.\\" American approach \\"The Big Four\\" made all the major decisions at the Paris Peace Conference (from left to right, David Lloyd George of Britain, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Woodrow Wilson of the United States). Until Wilson's arrival in Europe in December 1918, no sitting American president had ever visited the continent.MacMillan (2001), p. 3. Wilson's 1917 Fourteen Points, had helped win many hearts and minds as the war ended in America and all over Europe, including Germany, as well as its allies in and the former subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Wilson's diplomacy and his Fourteen Points had essentially established the conditions for the armistices that had brought an end to World War I. Wilson felt it to be his duty and obligation to the people of the world to be a prominent figure at the peace negotiations. High hopes and expectations were placed on him to deliver what he had promised for the postwar era. In doing so, Wilson ultimately began to lead the foreign policy of the United States towards interventionism, a move that has been strongly resisted in some domestic circles ever since. Once Wilson arrived, however, he found \\"rivalries, and conflicting claims previously submerged.\\"US Dept of State; International Boundary Study, Jordan ‚Äì Syria Boundary, No. 94 ‚Äì 30 December 1969, p.10 He worked mostly trying to sway the direction that the French, led by Georges Clemenceau, and the British, led by David Lloyd George, towards Germany and its allies in Europe and the former Ottoman Empire in the Middle East. Wilson's attempts to gain acceptance of his Fourteen Points ultimately failed after France and Britain had refused to adopt some of their specific points and core principles. In Europe, several of his Fourteen Points conflicted with the other powers' desires. The United States did not encourage or believe that the responsibility for the war, which Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, placed on Germany alone, was fair or warranted.MacMillan, Paris 1919 (2001), p. 6. It would not be until 1921, under US President Warren Harding, that the United State finally signed peace treaties with the Central Powers, separately, with Germany,Wikisource Austria, and Hungary respectively. In the Middle East, negotiations were complicated by competing aims and claims, and the new mandate system. The United States hoped to establish a more liberal and diplomatic world, as stated in the Fourteen Points, in which democracy, sovereignty, liberty and self-determination would be respected. France and Britain, on the other hand, already controlled empires, wielded power over their subjects around the world, and still aspired to be dominant colonial powers. In light of the previously-secret Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement and following the adoption of the mandate system on the Arab provinces of the former Ottoman Empire, the conference heard statements from competing Zionists and Arabs. Wilson then recommended an international commission of inquiry to ascertain the wishes of the local inhabitants. The idea, first accepted by Great Britain and France, was later rejected but became the purely-American King‚ÄìCrane Commission, which toured all Syria and Palestine during the summer of 1919, took statements, and sampled opinion. Its report, presented to Wilson, was kept secret from the public until The New York Times broke the story in December 1922. A pro-Zionist joint resolution on Palestine was passed by Congress in September 1922. France and Britain tried to appease Wilson by consenting to the establishment of his League of Nations. However, because isolationist sentiment was strong, and some of the articles in the League Charter conflicted with the US Constitution, the United States never ratified the Treaty of Versailles or joined the LeagueMacMillan (2001), p. 83. that Wilson had helped to create to further peace by diplomacy, rather than war, and the conditions that can breed peace. Japanese approach The Japanese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference The Japanese delegation at the Conference, with (seated left to right) former Foreign Minister Baron Makino Nobuaki, former Prime Minister Marquis Saionji Kinmochi, and Japanese Ambassador to Great Britain Viscount Chinda Sutemi Japan sent a large delegation, headed by the former Prime Minister, Marquis Saionji Kinmochi. It was originally one of the \\"big five\\" but relinquished that role because of its slight interest in European affairs. Instead, it focused on two demands: the inclusion of its Racial Equality Proposal in the League's Covenant and Japanese territorial claims with respect to former German colonies: Shantung (including Kiaochow) and the Pacific islands north of the Equator (the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Mariana Islands, and the Carolines). The former Foreign Minister Baron Makino Nobuaki was de facto chief, and Saionji's role was symbolic and limited because history of his ill health. The Japanese delegation became unhappy after it had received only half of the rights of Germany, and it then walked out of the conference.Macmillan, ch 23 =Racial equality proposal= Japan proposed the inclusion of a \\"racial equality clause\\" in the Covenant of the League of Nations on 13 February as an amendment to Article 21.: > The equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, > the High Contracting Parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all > alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment > in every respect making no distinction, either in law or in fact, on account > of their race or nationality. Wilson knew that Great Britain was critical to the decision and, as Conference chairman, ruled that a unanimous vote was required. On 11 April 1919, the commission held a final session and the Racial Equality Proposal received a majority of votes, but Britain and Australia did not support it. The Australians had lobbied the British to defend Australia's White Australia policy. Wilson also knew that domestically, he needed the support of the West, which feared Japanese and Chinese immigration and the South, which feared the rise of their black citizens. The defeat of the proposal influenced Japan's turn from co-operation with the Western world into more nationalist and militarist policies and approaches.Macmillan, Paris 1919 p. 321 =Territorial claims= The Japanese claim to Shantung faced strong challenges from the Chinese patriotic student group. In 1914, at the outset of the war, Japan had seized the territory that had been granted to Germany in 1897 and also seized the German islands in the Pacific north of the equator. In 1917, Japan had made secret agreements with Britain, France, and Italy to guarantee their annexation of these territories. With Britain, there was an agreement to support British annexation of the Pacific Islands south of the Equator. Despite a generally pro-Chinese view by the American delegation, Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles transferred German concessions in the Jiaozhou Bay, China, to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China. The leader of the Chinese delegation, Lou Tseng-Tsiang, demanded for a reservation to be inserted before he would sign the treaty. After the reservation was denied, the treaty was signed by all the delegations except that of China. Chinese outrage over that provision led to demonstrations known as the May Fourth Movement. The Pacific Islands north of the equator became a class C mandate, administered by Japan.Fifield, Russell. \\"Japanese Policy toward the Shantung Question at the Paris Peace Conference,\\" Journal of Modern History (1951) 23:3 pp 265‚Äì272. in JSTOR reprint primary Japanese sources Greek approach Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos took part in the conference as Greece's chief representative. Wilson was said to have placed Venizelos first for personal ability among all delegates in Paris.Chester, 1921, p. 6 Venizelos proposed the Greek expansion on Thrace and Asia Minor, which had been in the defeated Kingdom of Bulgaria and Ottoman Empire; Northern Epirus, Imvros; and Tenedos for the realization of the Megali Idea. He also reached the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement with the Italians on the cession of the Dodecanese. For the Pontic Greeks, he proposed a common Pontic- Armenian state. As a liberal politician, Venizelos was a strong supporter of the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations. Chinese approach The Chinese delegation was led by Lou Tseng-Tsiang, who was accompanied by Wellington Koo and Cao Rulin. Before the Western powers, Koo demanded for Germany's concessions on Shandong to be returned to China. He also called for an end to imperialist institutions such as extraterritoriality, legation guards, and foreign leaseholds. Despite American support and the ostensible spirit of self-determination, the Western powers refused his claims but instead transferred the German concessions to Japan. That sparked widespread student protests in China on 4 May, later known as the May Fourth Movement, which eventually pressured the government into refusing to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Thus, the Chinese delegation at the conference was the only one not to sign the treaty at the signing ceremony.MacMillan, Paris of 1919 pp 322‚Äì45 Other nations' approach =All-Russian Government (Whites)= While Russia was formally excluded from the ConferenceSeth P. Tillman, Anglo- American Relations at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, p. 136, Princeton University Press (1961) although it had fought against the Central Powers for three years, the Russian Provincial Council (chaired by Prince LvovJohn M. Thompson Russia, Bolshevism, and the Versailles peace, p. 76 Princeton University Press (1967)), the successor to the Russian Constitutional Assembly and the political arm of the Russian White movement attended the conference and was represented by the former tsarist minister Sergey Sazonov, who, if the Tsar had not been overthrown, would most likely have attended the conference anyway. The Council maintained the position of an indivisible Russia, but some were prepared to negotiate over the loss of Poland and Finland.John M. Thompson Russia, Bolshevism, and the Versailles peace p78 Princeton University Press (1967) The Council suggested for all matters relating to territorial claims or demands for autonomy within the former Russian Empire to be referred to a new All-Russian Constituent Assembly. =Ukraine= Map of Ukraine presented by the Ukrainian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in a bid that was ultimately rejected, which led to the incorporation of Ukraine into the Soviet Union. The Kuban was then mostly Ukrainian. Ukraine had its best opportunity to win recognition and support from foreign powers at the conference.Laurence J. Orzell, \\"A 'Hotly Disputed' Issue: Eastern Galicia At The Paris Peace Conference, 1919,\\" Polish Review (1980): 49‚Äì68. in JSTOR At a meeting of the Big Five on 16 January, Lloyd George called Ukrainian leader Symon Petliura (1874‚Äì1926) an adventurer and dismissed Ukraine as an anti- Bolshevik stronghold. Sir Eyre Crowe, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, spoke against a union of East Galicia and Poland. The British cabinet never decided whether to support a united or dismembered Russia. The United States was sympathetic to a strong, united Russia, as a counterpoise to Japan, but Britain feared a threat to India. Petliura appointed Count Tyshkevich as his representative to the Vatican, and Pope Benedict XV recognized Ukrainian independence, but Ukraine was effectively ignored. =Belarus= A delegation of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, under Prime Minister Anton ≈Åuckieviƒç, also participated in the conference, and attempted to gain international recognition of the independence of Belarus. On the way to the conference, the delegation was received by Czechoslovak President Tom√°≈° Masaryk in Prague. During the conference, ≈Åuckieviƒç had meetings with the exiled foreign minister of Admiral Alexander Kolchak's Russian government, Sergey Sazonov, and Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Jan Paderewski. =Minority rights= right At the insistence of Wilson, the Big Four required Poland to sign a treaty on 28 June 1919 that guaranteed minority rights in the new nation. Poland signed under protest and made little effort to enforce the specified rights for Germans, Jews, Ukrainians, and other minorities. Similar treaties were signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria and later by Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Estonia had already given cultural autonomy to minorities in its declaration of independence. Finland and Germany were not asked to sign a minority treaty. In Poland, the key provisions were to become fundamental laws, which would override any national legal codes or legislation. The new country pledged to assure \\"full and complete protection of life and liberty to all individuals... without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race, or religion.\\" Freedom of religion was guaranteed to everyone. Most residents were given citizenship, but there was considerable ambiguity on who was covered. The treaty guaranteed basic civil, political, and cultural rights and required all citizens to be equal before the law and enjoy identical rights of citizens and workers. Polish was to be the national language, but the treaty provided for minority languages to be freely used privately, in commerce, in religion, in the press, at public meetings, and before all courts. Minorities were to be permitted to establish and control at their own expense private charities, churches, social institutions, and schools, without interference from the government, which was required to set up German-language public schools in districts that had been German before the war. All education above the primary level was to be conducted exclusively in the national language. Article 12 was the enforcement clause ans gave the Council of the League of Nations the responsibility to monitor and enforce the treaties.Fink, \\"The Paris Peace Conference and the Question of Minority Rights\\" =Caucasus= European Theatre of the Russian Civil War and three South Caucasian republics in the summer of 1918 The three South Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus all sent a delegation to the conference. Their attempts to gain protection from threats posed by the ongoing Russian Civil War largely failed since none of the major powers was interested in taking a mandate over the Caucasian territories. After a series of delays, the three South Caucasian countries ultimately gained de facto recognition from the Supreme Council of the Allied powers but only after all European troops had been withdrawn from the Caucasus, except for a British contingent in Batumi. Georgia was recognized de facto on 12 January 1920, followed by Azerbaijan the same day and Armenia on 19 January 1920. The Allied leaders decided to limit their assistance to the Caucasian republics to the supply of arms, munitions, and food. The Armenian delegation included Avetis Aharonyan, Hamo Ohanjanyan, and Armen Garo. The Azerbaijan mission was headed by Alimardan Topchubashev. The Georgian delegation included Nikolay Chkheidze, Irakli Tsereteli, and Zurab Avalishvili. =Korean delegation= After a failed attempt by the Korean National Association to send a three-man delegation to Paris, a delegation of Koreans from China and Hawaii made it there. It included a representative from the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai, Kim Kyu-sik.Hart-Landsberg, Martin (1998). Korea: Division, Reunification, & U.S. Foreign Policy Monthly Review Press. P. 30. They were aided by the Chinese, who were eager for the opportunity to embarrass Japan at the international forum. Several top Chinese leaders at the time, including Sun Yat-sen, told US diplomats that the conference should take up the question of Korean independence. However, the Chinese, already locked in a struggle against the Japanese, could do little else for Korea.Manela, Erez (2007) The Wilsonian Moment pp. 119‚Äì135, 197‚Äì213. Other than China, no nation took the Koreans seriously at the conference because of its already had the status of a Japanese colony.Kim, Seung-Young (2009). American Diplomacy and Strategy Toward Korea and Northeast Asia, 1882‚Äì1950 and After pp 64‚Äì65. The failure of Korean nationalists to gain support from the conference ended their hopes of foreign support.Baldwin, Frank (1972). The March First Movement: Korean Challenge and Japanese Response =Palestine= After the conference's decision to separate the former Arab provinces from the Ottoman Empire and to apply the new mandate-system to them, the World Zionist Organization submitted its draft resolutions for consideration by the conference on 3 February 1919. The Zionist state claimed at the conference British memorandum on Palestine before the conference The statement included five main points:Statement of the Zionist Organization regarding Palestine , 3 February 1919 # Recognition of the Jewish people's historic title to Palestine and their right to reconstitute their National Home there. # Declaration of Palestine's borders were to be declared, including a request for land from the Litani River, now in Lebanon, to al-arish, now in Egypt. # Sovereign possession of Palestine to be vested in the League of Nations with a government entrusted to the British as the League's mandatory. # Insertion of other provisions by the High Contracting Parties relating to the application of any general conditions attached to mandates that were suitable for Palestine. # Additional conditions, including: #* The promotion of Jewish immigration and close settlement on the land and safeguarding rights of the present non-Jewish population #* A Jewish Council representative for the development of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, and offer to the council in priority any concession for public works or for the development of natural resources #* The self-government for localities #* Freedom of religious worship, with no discrimination in the inhabitants on citizenship and civil rights on the grounds of religion or race #* Control of the Holy Places However, despite those attempts to influence the conference, the Zionists were instead constrained by Article 7 of the resulting Palestine Mandate to having the mere right of obtaining Palestinian citizenship: \\"The Administration of Palestine shall be responsible for enacting a nationality law. There shall be included in this law provisions framed so as to facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews who take up their permanent residence in Palestine.\\" Citing the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the Zionists suggested it meant the British had already recognized the historic title of the Jews to Palestine. The preamble of the British Mandate of 1922 in which the Balfour Declaration was incorporated, stated, \\"Whereas recognition has thereby been given to the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country....\\"Avalon Project, The Palestine Mandate Women's approach An unprecedented aspect of the conference was concerted pressure brought to bear on delegates by a committee of women, who sought to establish and entrench women's fundamental social, economic, and political rights, such as that of suffrage, within the peace framework. Although they were denied seats at the Paris Conference, the leadership of Marguerite de Witt-Schlumberger, the president of the French Union for Women's Suffrage, caused an Inter-Allied Women's Conference (IAWC) to be convened, which met from 10 February to 10 April 1919. The IAWC lobbied Wilson and then also the other delegates of the Paris Conference to admit women to its committees, and it was successful in achieving a hearing from the conference's Commissions for International Labour Legislation and then the League of Nations Commission. One key and concrete outcome of the IAWC's work was Article 7 of the Covenant of the League of Nations: \\"All positions under or in connection with the League, including the Secretariat, shall be open equally to men and women.\\" More generally, the IAWC placed the issue of women's rights at the center of the new world order that was established in Paris. Historical assessments The remaking of the world map at the conferences gave birth to a number of critical conflict-prone contradictions internationally that would become some of the causes of World War II.First World War ‚Äì Willmott, H. P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003, pp. 292‚Äì307. The British historian Eric Hobsbawm claimed: Hobsbawm and other left-wing historians have argued that Wilson's Fourteen Points, particularly the principle of self-determination, were measures that were primarily against the Bolsheviks and designed, by playing the nationist card, to tame the revolutionary fever that was sweeping across Europe in the wake of the October Revolution and the end of the war: The right-wing historian John Lewis Gaddis agreed: \\"When Woodrow Wilson made the principle of self-determination one of his Fourteen Points his intent had been to undercut the appeal of Bolshevism.\\" That view has a long history and can be summarised by Ray Stannard Baker's famous remark: \\"Paris cannot be understood without Moscow.\\". The British historian Antony Lentin viewed Lloyd George's role in Paris as a major success: Cultural references * British official artists William Orpen and Augustus John were present at the Conference. * World's End (1940), the first novel in Upton Sinclair's Pulitzer Prize-winning Lanny Budd series, describes the political machinations and consequences of the Paris Peace Conference through much of the book's second half, with Sinclair's narrative including many historically accurate characters and events. * The first two books of novelist Robert Goddard's The Wide World trilogy (The Ways of the World and The Corners of the Globe) are centered around the diplomatic machinations which form the background to the conference. * Paris 1919 (1973), the third studio album by Welsh musician John Cale, is named after the Paris Peace Conference, and its title song explores various aspects of early-20th-century culture and history in Western Europe. * A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia (1992) is a British television film starring Ralph Fiennes as T. E. Lawrence and Alexander Siddig as Emir Faisal, depicting their struggles to secure an independent Arab state at the conference. * \\"Paris, May 1919\\" is a 1993 episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, written by Jonathan Hales and directed by David Hare, in which Indiana Jones is shown working as a translator with the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference.

Personal life Landry was born on March 9, 1937, in Saint-Jacques, Quebec, (near Joliette), the son of Th√©r√®se Granger and Bernard Landry. On June 26, 2004, he married script writer and former y√©- y√© singer Chantal Renaud. Landry was classically trained by the clergy and retained some Latin. A native speaker of French, he also spoke fluent English and Spanish. Landry received a degree in law from the Universit√© de Montr√©al, and a degree in economics and finance from Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris. From September 2005, he was a professor at UQAM in the business strategy department. On February 9, 2008, Landry hosted the final round of the Finance Quiz at the 2008 Financial Open at UQAM. Landry died on November 6, 2018 from complications of pulmonary fibrosis at the age of 81. He is to be given a state funeral at Basilique Notre-Dame de Montr√©al. Politics Landry ran unsuccessfully in Joliette in the 1970 election and in Joliette-Montcalm in 1973. He was a practising lawyer and a partner in the Montreal law firm of Lapointe Rosenstein when he was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the 1976 general election in Fabre. Under the Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) government of Ren√© L√©vesque, he served as Minister of State of Economic Development from February 2, 1977, to March 12, 1981. Re-elected in the riding of Laval-des- rapides at the 1981 general election, he was again Minister of State of Economic Development until September 9, 1982, when he was made Delegate Minister to Exterior Commerce. He was later Minister of International Relations and Exterior Commerce, and Minister of Finance in the same government. During the 1988 Canadian federal election, Landry backed the Free Trade Agreement. His support, along with Jacques Parizeau played a role in Brian Mulroney's dominance in Quebec during the election. After the defeat of Parti Qu√©b√©cois in the 1985 general election, he taught in the Department of Administrative Sciences at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al until 1994. After the victory of the PQ in the 1994 general election, the newly elected Premier, Jacques Parizeau, made him his Deputy Premier, a position he held from September 26, 1994, to December 15, 1998. As finance minister, Landry reduced program expenditures to balance the budget. The PQ and sovereignty lost public support and has not been restored to previous levels since. It was reported in the Montreal Gazette, and picked up by the New York Times that Landry spoke disparagingly of immigrants on the night of the 1995 referendum. In an unconfirmed article by The Gazette, an English-language paper in Montreal, it was reported that two employees at the Inter-Continental hotel in the city planned to file a complaint against Mr. Landry with the Quebec Human Rights Commission. Anita Martinez, a night clerk at the hotel, said that Mr. Landry told her, \\"It was because of you immigrants that the 'no' won,\\" and added, \\"Why is it that we open the doors to this country so you can vote 'no' \\" to Quebec sovereignty?. Landry himself firmly denied having ever been either impolite to the two women, nor having ever made the comments regarding immigrants. Landry became Premier of Quebec on March 8, 2001, following the resignation of Lucien Bouchard. He was a Quebec sovereigntist advocating a supranational confederation of Quebec and Canada, inspired by the institutions of the European Union. As such, he was one of the most faithful followers of Ren√© L√©vesque and the other sovereignty-associationists. In 2001, Landry was critical about Quebec receiving an extra $1.5 billion in equalization payments calling it degrading Quebec status and accused Ottawa for short-changing the province for decades by stating \\"Receiving equalization payments for more than 40 years in a row is clear evidence that the central government failed in redistributing real wealth,\\". During the Parti Qu√©b√©cois leadership race of 2001, Landry criticized the federal government's policy of prominently displaying the maple leaf on federal government buildings and programs by saying, \\"\\"Le Qu√©bec ne ferait pas le trottoir pour un bout de chiffon rouge.\\" (\\"Quebec does not prostitute itself for a piece of red cloth\\"). Landry's aggressive remarks were widely criticized for insulting the Canadian flag, particularly among English-language media which rendered chiffon as \\"rag\\".Larousse Advanced French-English/English French Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Landry subsequently apologized but insisted that his words had been mistranslated. Landry's opponents used the controversy to undermine his national political cachet. In 2003, Landry lost the Quebec general election to Jean Charest's Quebec Liberal Party. A renowned documentary named √Ä Hauteur d'homme about his viewpoint of the election was produced in 2003. At the August 2004 Parti Qu√©b√©cois National Council, after a long period of reflection that began the day after the election, he announced on August 27, 2004, that he would remain president of the party, and lead the PQ to the next election in order to bring Quebec to independence. However, on June 4, 2005, Landry announced he would resign as party leader after gaining only 76.2% approval in a leadership confidence vote at a party convention in Quebec City. After retirement Landry stayed active in politics as a critic and to encourage young people to be involved in politics.

In 1953, Kaiser merged with Willys-Overland to form Willys Motors Incorporated, moving its production operations to the Willys plant at Toledo, Ohio. The company changed its name to Kaiser Jeep Corporation in 1963. History The Kaiser-Frazer Corporation was established in August 1945 as a joint venture between the Henry J. Kaiser Company and Graham-Paige Motors Corporation. Both Henry J. Kaiser, a California-based industrialist and Joseph W. Frazer, CEO of Graham-Paige, wanted to get into the automobile business and pooled their resources and talents to do so.Kaiser-Frazer 1945 Annual Report Less than a year after Kaiser-Frazer's formation, the first Kaiser and Frazer branded automobiles were being produced at the Willow Run, Michigan, headquarters for both Kaiser- Frazer and Graham-Paige. By the end of 1946, over 11,000 cars (total Kaiser and Frazer) went out to dealers and distributors; many of them sold to retail owners.Kaiser-Frazer 1946 Annual Report During the summer of 1948, the 300,000th car came off the production line.Kaiser-Frazer 1948 Annual Report In 1950, Kaiser-Frazer began production of a new compact car, the Henry JKaiser- Frazer 1950 Annual Report and ended production of the Frazer automobile;Kaiser-Frazer Corporation Operating Report for the 10 months ending October 31, 1950 and factory production counts for calendar year 1950 both makes were 1951 model year automobiles. In 1952 and 1953, Kaiser-Frazer provided Sears, Roebuck and Company with Allstate-branded automobiles that retailer sold through selected Sears Auto Centers. The cars, based on the Henry J models that Kaiser-Frazer dealers were selling, were in the Sears catalog, but the car could not be purchased by mail order.Kaiser-Frazer 1951 annual report and memo from Edgar Kaiser to all distributors and dealers dated 16 November 1951 At the 1953 New York Auto Show, Kaiser-Frazer announced it would produce a fiberglass bodied sports car, called the Kaiser-Darrin-Frazer 161 (the car had a 161 cubic inch six-cylinder engine and was designed by stylist Howard \\"Dutch\\" Darrin, who also did the 1947‚Äì48 Kaiser & Frazer as well as the 1951 Kaiser automobiles).Memo to All Distributors and Dealers from Edgar Kaiser dated January 20, 1953 This vehicle went into production during January 1954 and was sold as the Kaiser Darrin.Kaiser-Willys Sales Corporation Trade Letter KW 54-1, dated January 27, 1954 Production of the Allstate ended during 1953, the last Henry J automobiles were built in late 1953 as 1954 model year cars. The sports car was in production only during the 1954 model year and the last Kaisers were produced in America during the 1955 model year.factory production counts years 1952-1955 Close to 760,000 cars were produced, all makes and models, between May 1946 and September 1955.factory production counts While sales were initially strong because of a car-starved public, the company did not have the resources to survive long-term competition with the \\"Big Three\\" automakers: GM, Ford, and Chrysler. The original Kaiser-Frazer design was distinctive and fresh but the company was unable to maintain the price point it needed for long-term success. However, the company's problems started as early as 1948. That year, Joseph Frazer resigned as president of Kaiser-Frazer, but stayed in the position as a \\"lame duck\\" until April 1949 when Henry J. Kaiser's oldest son, Edgar, took Frazer's place as K-F's president.ruling of Justice Frank Picard, PERGAMENT et al., Vs FRAZER et al., Westlaw cite 93 F.Supp. 13 This was in part because Frazer's had warned Kaiser not to tool up for 200,000 cars for the 1949 model year, realizing that they could not compete against the new cars from the big three coming out that year. Unfortunately, Kaiser did not heed the warning, saying \\"The Kaisers never retrench.\\" Only 58,000 cars were sold that year. The Frazer marque was discontinued after the 1951 models.previously cited Joseph Frazer remained as a sales consultant and vice-chairman of the Kaiser-Frazer board until 1953. At the 1953 annual stockholders' meeting, Kaiser-Frazer Corporation's name was changed by stockholder vote to Kaiser Motors Corporation.Kaiser Motors Corporation 1953 Annual Report Shortly before meeting, Kaiser-Frazer's Kaiser Manufacturing Corporation division worked out a deal to purchase certain assets (and assume certain liabilities) of the Willys-Overland Corporation, makers of Willys cars and Jeep vehicles.Kaiser- Frazer 1952 Annual Report & Kaiser Motors 1953 Annual Report The purchase was made by Kaiser-Frazer's wholly owned subsidiary company, Kaiser Manufacturing Corporation.

The deal was contingent on Olds being able to expand its Lansing, MI engine production facility; that expansion was cancelled due to factory expansion restrictions put in place by the government due to military needs during the Korean War.various sections, BUILT TO BETTER THE BEST published by MT Publishing, 2005 K-F had their own V8 engine development program that ran through 1949 but, as the lead engineers on the team stated to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) they found their work was leading down a \\"blind alley\\" and would not work as a production engine.SAE paper \\"Design of the New American Motors V-8 by John Adamson, Carl Burke and David Potter\\" unabridged version only Frazer cars ended up suffering as a luxury and upper medium priced models due to changing market conditions, just as Hudson and Studebaker experienced during the 1950s.

A line of \\"Traveler\\" sedans with the trunk connected to the interior of the car were an improvised attempt at marketing a model to compete with standard station wagon designs. At the end of 1955, the management team of the Henry J. Kaiser Company used Kaiser Motors Corporation to create a new holding company encompassing the various Kaiser industrial activities. Kaiser Motors' name was changed to Kaiser Industries Corporation, and functioned as a holding company for various Kaiser business holdings including Willys Motors Incorporated.Kaiser Industries Corporation 1955 Annual Report U.S. production of Kaiser and Willys passenger cars ceased during the 1955 model year, but production of Willys Jeeps in Toledo, Ohio, continued. Kaiser continued automobile production in Argentina under the Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) company established in Santa Isabel, C√≥rdoba and Willys passenger cars moved to Brazil under the Willys-Overland do Brasil company, using the dies formerly employed in the U.S. well into the 1960s. The company changed its name to Kaiser Jeep in 1963. By 1969, Kaiser Industries decided to leave the auto business, which was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1970. As part of the transaction, Kaiser acquired a 22% interest in AMC, which it later divested. Included in the sale was the General Products Division, which Kaiser had purchased from Studebaker in 1964 as it prepared to leave the auto business itself. AMC renamed the division AM General, which still operates today, and is best known as the manufacturer of the Humvee and civilian Hummer H1.

The strait connects Chedabucto Bay on the Atlantic Ocean to St. George's Bay on the Northumberland Strait, a sub basin of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The strait is extremely deep (200+ feet) with two major communities at Port Hawkesbury on the eastern side facing Mulgrave on the western side, both ports. The strait is crossed by the Canso Causeway for vehicular and rail traffic, opened in 1955. The Canso Canal allows ships to pass through the causeway, and this can accommodate any vessel capable of transiting the St. Lawrence Seaway. An account of early settlement in the area is given in the letters of local resident Henry Nicholas Paint (1830-1921), Member of Parliament for Richmond county and merchant, whose father Nicholas secured valuable land grants and settled in a stone-built house at Belle Vue in 1817. Port Hawkesbury, at first known as Ship Harbour, emerged as a shipbuilding and boatbuilding port on the Strait in the 19th century with firms such as H.W. Embree and Sons producing distinctive fishing boats that came to be known as \\"Canso Boats\\" after the Strait.

The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or alumnus of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past include a particular subcultural speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms and etiquette, reflective of an upper-class upbringing.  Definition  The term preppy derives from the private, university-preparatory or prep schools that some American upper class and upper middle class children attend. The term preppy is commonly associated with the Ivy League and broader group of oldest universities in the Northeast as well as the prep schools which brought students to them, since traditionally a primary goal in attending a prep school was admittance into one of these institutions. Preppy fashion derives from the fashions of these old Northeastern colleges in the early to mid-twentieth century. Lisa Birnbach's 1980 book Official Preppy Handbook, which was written to poke fun at the rich lives of privileged Ivy League and socially elite liberal arts college students but ended up glamorizing the culture, portrays the preppy social group as well-educated, well-connected, and although exclusive, courteous to other social groups without fostering serious relationships with them. Being well-educated and well-connected is associated with an upper-class socioeconomic status that emphasizes higher education and high-income professional success.  Fashion  Clint Eastwood wearing white golfing V neck sweater and racing green polo shirt with oversized collar, 1981 For men, preppy fashion has its roots in the Ivy League style of dress, which started around 1912 and became more established in the late 1950s. J. Press represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of Ivy League schools. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and Brooks Brothers both had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as polo, sailing, hunting, fencing, crew rowing, lacrosse, golf, tennis, rugby, squash and swimming. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. Thus, the sportswear, casual lifestyle apparel and outdoor gear offered by L. L. Bean in the Northeast, and Eddie Bauer in the Pacific Northwest, forms another important component of preppy style. Both outfitters, along with Vermont-based Orvis, were featured in The Official Preppy Handbook. The mostly tongue-in-cheek guide published in 1980 described L. L. Bean as \\"nothing less than Prep mecca.\\" Their catalog was said to be \\"the biggest seller of the rugged New England Prep look.\\"Birnbach, Lisa (ed.) (1980). The Official Preppy Handbook. Workman Publishing. pp. 151, 154. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as Lacoste, Daniel Cremieux, Izod, and Dooney & Bourke became associated with preppy style in many areas of the US and Canada. For women, preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as Perry Ellis and Lilly Pulitzer, influenced by designers such as Oleg Cassini, and popularized by female students at the Seven Sisters Colleges, sister institutions to the Ivy League. These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details. The Official Preppy Handbook points to daughters \\"borrowing the clothes her mother wore in Prep school. Before long, they share a charge account at The Talbots.\\" The handbook also stated that \\"Behind the red door on every Talbots catalog cover is the best selection of women's Prep fashions anywhere.\\" And that \\"the clothes here are a rare combination of Preppy, tasteful, and sophisticated.\\"Birnbach, Lisa (ed.) (1980). The Official Preppy Handbook. Workman Publishing. pp. 128, 154-155. Though traditional interest in preppy style fell in the 1990s, some of the newer outfitters such as Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Tommy Hilfiger, Vineyard Vines, Gant, and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as Marc Jacobs and Luella Bartley adding the preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s. Examples of preppy attire include argyle sweaters, crewneck sweaters, grosgrain or woven leather belts, chinos, madras, Nantucket Reds, button down Oxford cloth shirts, pearl necklaces and earrings, gold bangle or large chain bracelets, penny loafers, polo shirts (often with a popped collar), Madras plaid Bermuda shorts, and boat shoes.

Often it refers to those submerged ridges, banks, or bars that rise near enough to the surface of a body of water as to constitute a danger to navigation. Shoals are also known as sandbanks, sandbars, or gravelbars. Two or more shoals that are either separated by shared troughs or interconnected by past or present sedimentary and hydrographic processes are referred to as a shoal complex.D Rutecki, E Nestler, T Dellapenna, and A Pembroke, 2014.

Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. The term shoal is also used in a number of ways that can be either similar or quite different from how it is used in the geologic, geomorphic, and oceanographic literature. Sometimes, this term refers to either any relatively shallow place in a stream, lake, sea, or other body of water; a rocky area on the sea floor within an area mapped for navigation purposes; a growth of vegetation on the bottom of a deep lake that occurs at any depth; and as a verb for the process of proceeding from a greater to a lesser depth of water.  Description  Shoals are characteristically long and narrow (linear) ridges. They can develop where a stream, river, or ocean current promotes deposition of sediment and granular material, resulting in localized shallowing (shoaling) of the water. Marine shoals also develop either by the in place drowning of barrier islands as the result of episodic sea level rise or by the erosion and submergence of inactive delta lobes. Shoals can appear as a coastal landform in the sea, where they are classified as a type of ocean bank, or as fluvial landforms in rivers, streams, and lakes. A shoal‚Äìsandbar may seasonally separate a smaller body of water from the sea, such as: * Marine lagoons * Brackish water estuaries * Freshwater seasonal stream and river mouths and deltas. The term bar can apply to landform features spanning a considerable range in size, from a length of a few metres in a small stream to marine depositions stretching for hundreds of kilometers along a coastline, often called barrier islands. = Composition = They are typically composed of sand, although they could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important.  Formation  Wave shoaling is the process when surface waves move towards shallow water, such as a beach, they slow down, their wave height increases and the distance between waves decreases. This behavior is called shoaling, and the waves are said to shoal. The waves may or may not build to the point where they break, depending on how large they were to begin with, and how steep the slope of the beach is. In particular, waves shoal as they pass over submerged sandbanks or reefs. This can be treacherous for boats and ships. Shoaling can also diffract waves, so the waves change direction. For example, if waves pass over a sloping bank which is shallower at one end than the other, then the shoaling effect will result in the waves slowing more at the shallow end. Thus the wave fronts will refract, changing direction like light passing through a prism. Refraction also occurs as waves move towards a beach if the waves come in at an angle to the beach, or if the beach slopes more gradually at one end than the other. =Types= Sandbars and longshore bars Amanohashidate in Miyazu, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan White Island in Camiguin, Philippines Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, USA, August 2006. Sandbars, also known as a trough bars, form where the waves are breaking, because the breaking waves set up a shoreward current with a compensating counter-current along the bottom. Sometimes this occurs seaward of a trough (marine landform). Sand carried by the offshore moving bottom current is deposited where the current reaches the wave break.W. Bascom, 1980. Waves and Beaches. Anchor Press/Doubleday, Garden City, New York. 366 p Other longshore bars may lie further offshore, representing the break point of even larger waves, or the break point at low tide. Harbour and river bars The Doom Bar sand bank extends across the River Camel estuary in Cornwall, England, UK A harbor or river bar is a sedimentary deposit formed at a harbor entrance or river mouth by: the deposition of freshwater sediment, or the action of waves on the sea floor or up-current beaches. Where beaches are suitably mobile, or the river's suspended or bed loads are large enough, deposition can build up a sandbar that completely blocks a river mouth and damming the river. It can be a seasonally natural process of aquatic ecology, causing the formation of estuaries and wetlands in the lower course of the river. This situation will persist until the bar is eroded by the sea, or the dammed river develops sufficient head to break through the bar. The formation of harbor bars can prevent access for boats and shipping, can be the result of: *construction up-coast or at the harbor ‚Äî e.g.: breakwaters, dune habitat destruction. *upriver development ‚Äî e.g.: dams and reservoirs, riparian zone destruction, river bank alterations, river adjacent agricultural land practices, water diversions. *watershed erosion from habitat alterations ‚Äî e.g.: deforestation, wildfires, grading for development. *artificially created/deepened harbors that require periodic dredging maintenance. =Nautical navigation= In a nautical sense, a bar is a shoal, similar to a reef: a shallow formation of (usually) sand that is a navigation or grounding hazard, with a depth of water of or less. It therefore applies to a silt accumulation that shallows the entrance to or course of a river, or creek. A bar can form a dangerous obstacle to shipping, preventing access to the river or harbour in unfavourable weather conditions or at some states of the tide. Shoals as geological units Shoals in the Mississippi River at Arkansas and Mississippi, USA. In addition to longshore bars discussed above that are relatively small features of a beach, the term shoal can be applied to larger geological units that form off a coastline as part of the process of coastal erosion. These include spits and baymouth bars that form across the front of embayments and rias. A tombolo is a bar that forms an isthmus between an island or offshore rock and a mainland shore. In places of re-entrance along a coastline (such as inlets, coves, rias, and bays), sediments carried by a longshore current will fall out where the current dissipates, forming a spit. An area of water isolated behind a large bar is called a lagoon. Over time, lagoons may silt up, becoming salt marshes. In some cases, shoals may be precursors to beach expansion and dunes formation, providing a source of windblown sediment to augment such beach or dunes landforms.Mirko Ballarini, Optical Dating of Quartz from Young Deposits, IOS Press, 2006 146 pages, Human habitation Since prehistoric times humans have chosen some shoals as a site of habitation. In some early cases the locations provided easy access to exploit marine resources.C.Michael Hogan (2008) Morro Creek, ed. by Andy Burnham In modern times these sites are sometimes chosen for the water amenity or view, but many such locations are prone to storm damage.Dick Morris (2008) FleecedJefferson Beale Browne (1912) Key West: The Old and the New, published by The Record company See also  ‚Äî 1982 U.S. law  The References External links Coastal and oceanic landforms Fluvial landforms Hydrology Coastal geography Physical oceanography .

Para 4.18-19 The 1962 document, approved by Pope John XXIII and signed by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, Secretary of the Holy Office, was addressed to \\"all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite\\". It was an internal document for use by the Curia,Ottaviani, A. \\"On the Manor of Proceeding in Causes of Solicitation\\", CDF, 16 March 1962 describing how the rules in the Code of Canon Law:Codex Iuris Canonici (1917), Liber quartus: De processibus on dealing with such cases, were to be implemented, and directed that the same procedures be used when dealing with denunciations of homosexual, paedophile or zoophile behaviour by clerics. Dioceses were to use the instruction for their own guidance and keep it in their archives for confidential documents; The rules concerning the secret archives, distinct from the general archives and the historical archives, are explained in John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, A New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, 642-644. they were not to publish the instruction nor produce commentaries on it.\\"Servanda diligenter in archivio secreto curiae pro norma interna. Non publicanda nec ullis commentariis augenda\\" (heading of the Instruction). Crimen sollicitationis remained in effect until 18 May 2001, when it was replaced by new norms promulgated by the papal motu proprio Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela of 30 April of the same year.Thomas Doyle, The 1922 Instruction and the 1962 Instruction Crimen sollicitationis , section 2An English translation of the papal document and of the new norms can be consulted at this site and a guide to procedures regarding accusations of clerical sexual abuse is available on the Holy See website. Normally it would have ceased to have effect with the entry into force of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which replaced the 1917 Code on which the 1962 document was based, but it continued in use, with some necessary adaptations, while a review of it was carried out.De delictis gravioribus, second paragraphDoyle, sections 4-6 Applicability and scope In line with the opening words of the document, 70 of the 74 paragraphs of which it was composed dealt with cases concerning sexual advances during the sacrament of Penance, repeatedly referring to the complainant or injured party as \\"the penitent\\" (the person confessing sins); the final four paragraphs laid down that its contents applied also to crimen pessimum (the foulest crime), namely a homosexual act, with which were equated, for penal effects, any perpetrated or attempted externally obscene act with pre-adolescent children or brute animals. Charges concerning these crimes also were to be handled according to the norms of the document, even if committed without any connection with Penance.Thomas Doyle, The 1922 instruction and the 1962 instruction \\"Crimen sollicitationis\\" promulgated by the Vaticanunofficial translation of the document from Vatican https://www.vatican.va/resources/resources_crimen-sollicitationis-1962_en.html Media accounts sometimes presented the instruction as not concerned principally with sexual solicitation in Confession, but with denunciations of paedophilia. While it is true that such acts were covered by Crimen sollicitationis, canon lawyers have argued that the secrecy provisions of the document \\"would not have tied the hands of a bishop, or anyone else, who wanted to report a crime by a priest to the police\\". Canon law on cases of solicitation in confession The Code of Canon Law in force when Crimen sollicitationis was issuedThe law in force under the 1983 Code of Canon Law is as follows: Canon 1387. Sacerdos, qui in actu vel occasione vel praetextu confessionis paenitentem ad peccatum contra sextum Decalogi praeceptum sollicitat, pro delicti gravitate, suspensione, prohibitionibus, privationibus puniatur, et in casibus gravioribus dimittatur e statu clericali. Canon 1387. A priest who in confession, or on the occasion or under the pretext of confession, solicits a penitent to commit a sin against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue [i.e. adultery], is to be punished, according to the gravity of the offence, with suspension, prohibitions and deprivations; in the more serious cases he is to be dismissed from the clerical state. obliged anyone whom a priest solicited in confession to denounce him within one month and ordered that any such priest be subjected to a serious ecclesiastical punishment: Crimen sollicitationis indicated the procedure to be followed between a denunciation and the possible infliction of a penalty. Outline of the letter Crimen sollicitationis * Preliminaries (sections 1‚Äì14) * Title One: First intimation of the crime (15-28) * Title Two: The trial (29‚Äì60) ** Chapter I: Investigation (29‚Äì41) ** Chapter II: Canonical regulations and cautioning of the accused (42‚Äì46) ** Chapter III: Summoning the accused (47‚Äì54) ** Chapter IV: Conduct of the trial, verdict and appeal (55‚Äì60) * Title Three: Penalties (61‚Äì65) * Title Four: Official communication (66‚Äì70) * Title Five: The most evil crime (71‚Äì74) * Approval by Pope John XXIII on 16 March 1962 * Appendices: ** Formula A: oath of office ** Formula B: abjuration of errors ** Formula C: absolution from excommunication ** Formula D: delegating a person to receive a denunciation ** Formula E: receiving a denunciation ** Formula F: delegating a person to examine witnesses ** Formula G: full examination of a witness (about the priest and the accuser) ** Formula H: partial examination of a witness (about the accuser only) ** Formula I: general examination of the accuser ** Formula L: conclusions and proposal of the Promoter of Justice ** Formula M: decision of the Local Ordinary ** Formula N: admonition of the accused ** Formula O: decree of arraignment ** Formula P: examination of the accused ** Formula Q: conclusions and proposal of the Promoter of Justice ** Formula R: sentencing a convicted accused person who denies guilt ** Formula S: sentencing a convicted accused person who admits guilt ** Formula T: communication of the sentence to the accused  Contents  The document's title, \\"Instructio de modo procedendi in causis sollicitationis\\" (Instruction on procedure in solicitation cases), indicates that it was composed to indicate how to carry out a canonical investigation into accusations of solicitation. It described the procedures to be followed in each phase: reception of a denunciation; the course of the investigation, summoning the accused, sentencing, and the possibility of appeal. The result of the investigation could vary: * if the accusation appeared to be unfounded, this was stated in the record and the documents containing the accusation were destroyed; * if only vague evidence emerged, the case was filed away for use if fresh evidence appeared; * if the evidence was strong but insufficient for arraigning the accused, he was given an admonition and the records were preserved with a view to any further developments; * if the evidence was strong enough, the accused person was summoned and a canonical trial took place. Quoting canon 2368 ¬ß1 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, then in force, Crimen sollicitationis, 61 indicated the penalties that could be imposed after conviction. These penalties, such as suspension a divinis, deprivation of an office or rank, and reduction to the lay state, were of public character, even if the trial itself had been conducted with all due secrecy. The same part of the document laid down that, in addition to those penalties, penances should be imposed on guilty priests, and those in danger of repeating their crime should be subjected to particular vigilance (64). Except in connection with the sacrament of Penance, canon law imposed no legal obligation ‚Äì though a moral one might exist ‚Äì to denounce clerics guilty of engaging in or attempting a homosexual act; but the procedure described in Crimen sollicitationis was to be followed also in dealing with such accusations (71‚Äì72). And any gravely sinful external obscene act with prepubescent children of either sex or with animals engaged in or attempted by a cleric was to be treated, for its penal effects, as equivalent to an actual or attempted homosexual act (73). Unless solicitation in connection with Confession was involved, not only the local bishop but also superiors of religious orders exempt from the jurisdiction of the local bishop could proceed, either by formal trial or non-judicially (\\"modo administrativo\\"), against members of those orders who had committed such crimes; superiors of non-exempt religious orders could also do so, but only non-judicially (74).  Trial confidentiality  Since \\"Crimen sollicitationis\\" was primarily concerned with offenses committed in the confessional, this \\"...presented particular problems of investigation, because in most cases the priest could not be interrogated fully without putting the seal of confession in danger.\\"Thavis, John. \\"Vatican fills in blanks on history of sex abuse procedures\\", Catholic News Service, July 16, 2010 Section 11 of Crimen sollicitationis outlines the required confidentiality of the investigation into accusations of the crime of solicitation. The document imposed absolute confidentiality on the trial's proceedings (explicitly excepting \\"what may happen to be lawfully published when this process is concluded and put into effect\\", the term \\"published\\" meaning \\"publication of the evidence\\" in Canon Law, or the conclusion of the \\"discovery phase\\" in a civil trial, before the verdict is rendered), both during its conduct and after any concluding verdict had been put into effect: An oath of secrecy was to be taken by all members of the tribunal; violation incurred a penalty of automatic excommunication. The ecclesiastical penalty for violation of secrecy by the accused priest was automatic suspension a divinis, although he was free to discuss with his defence counsel (Section 13). Unless violation of secrecy occurred after an explicit procedural warning given in the course of their examination (Section 13; and cf. Section 23 concerning the person denouncing solicitation: \\"before the person is dismissed, there should be presented to the person, as above, an oath of observing the secret, threatening the person, if there is a need, with an excommunication reserved to the Ordinary or to the Holy See\\"), no ecclesiastical penalties were to be imposed on the accusers and witnesses. The oath of office to be taken by the members of the tribunal was given as Formula A: Interviewed for a television programme in 2006, canon lawyer Thomas Doyle is quoted as saying that the tight secrecy demanded for the procedure as \\"an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy, to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by churchmen\\".Sex Crimes and the Vatican (an October 2006 BBC documentary However, regarding the programme transcript, the BBC \\"cannot vouch for its accuracy\\". Not long after the broadcast, Doyle said, \\"Although I was a consultant to the producers of the documentary I am afraid that some of the distinctions I have made about the 1962 document have been lost. I do not believe now nor have I ever believed it to be proof of an explicit conspiracy, in the conventional sense, engineered by top Vatican officials, to cover up cases of clergy sexual abuse.\\"Allen Jr., John L., \\"Fr. Tom Doyle on 'Crimen Sollicitationis'\\", Nationall Catholic Reporter, 13 October 2006 In the study of the instruction that he revised less than two years later he stated: \\"According to the 1922 and 1962 documents, accusers and witnesses are bound by the secrecy obligation during and after the process but certainly not prior to the initiation of the process. There is no basis to assume that the Holy See envisioned this process to be a substitute for any secular legal process, criminal or civil. It is also incorrect to assume, as some have unfortunately done, that these two Vatican documents are proof of a conspiracy to hide sexually abusive priests or to prevent the disclosure of sexual crimes committed by clerics to secular authorities.\\"Doyle, paragraph 23 He also remarked: \\"To fully understand the overriding concern for secrecy one must also understand the traditional canonical concept known as the 'Privilege of the Forum' privilegium fori which has its roots in medieval Canon Law. Basically this is a traditional privilege claimed by the institutional church whereby clerics accused of crimes were tried before ecclesiastical courts and not brought before civil or secular courts. Although this privilege is anachronistic in contemporary society, the attitude or mentality which holds clerics accountable only to the institutional church authorities is still active. This does not mean that the official Church believes that clerics accused of crimes should not to be held accountable. It means that during certain periods in history the Church has believed that it alone should have the right to subject accused clerics to a judicial process.\\"Doyle, paragraph 24 John L. Allen, Jr. has said the secrecy was aimed rather at the protection of all involved, the accused, the victim/denouncer and the witnesses, before the verdict was passed, and for free finding of facts. Involvement of the Holy See Ratzinger Cardenal Dar√≠o Castrillon A New York Times article published on 1 July 2010 said that the 1962 instruction was a restatement of that of 1922, giving the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office authority to prosecute clergy accused of sexual abuse. (\\"Church Office Failed to Act on Abuse Scandal\\", New York Times, 1 July 2010). According to Canon law expert Nicholas P. Cafardi, the CDF itself didn't know it had this power under Ratzinger, until 2001. \\"From what can be deduced from published reports, there seems to have been a power struggle going on between Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy and Ratzinger at the CDF over which congregation had competency in the matter of clergy who had sexually abused minors.\\" Brown, Andrew, \\"The secret secret of the Vatican\\", The Guardian, 22 July 2010 At a meeting in Rome in 2000, Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, drew Vatican officials‚Äô attention to the long forgotten Crimen sollicitationis which gave CDF jurisdiction. Pope John Paul II subsequently issued Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela directing that all cases of sexual abuse by priests be handled by the CDF. Crimen sollicitationis repeated that, under pain of grave sin, any ordinary (bishop or equivalent) who received a denunciation of the crime of solicitation was to inform immediately the Holy See and the ordinary of the place of residence of the accused priest.Articles 66-70 It was for the ordinary of the place of residenceAlthough the vicar general also is classified as a local ordinary, article 3 of the document excluded him from authority in this matter. to investigate the charge at the first level (in prima instantia); the Holy See reserved to itself the right to intervene at this level only \\"for particular and grave reasons\\".Article 2 The defendant did not lose the right that all members of the Church have to ask that their cases, at any level, be submitted to the Holy See; but once the trial had begun, such a recourse did not suspend the jurisdiction of the local judge, unless he learned that the Holy See had actually accepted the recourse. After sentence was passed, the defendant could appeal to the Holy See against it within ten days. If he did, any suspension from hearing confessions or exercising sacred ministry remained in force, but any other penalties imposed on him were suspended, until a decision was made on the appeal. The \\"promoter of justice\\" (the official Church prosecutor) could likewise appeal to the Holy See against a verdict in favour of the accused.Article 58 This constituted an exception to the normal procedure whereby appeals against a first-level sentence are made to a designated second-level tribunal, with the case going to Rome only if the first two tribunals give discordant verdicts.

Several figures integral to the reformation of the Prussian Army participated at Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt, including Gebhard von Bl√ºcher, Carl von Clausewitz, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, and Hermann von Boyen. Opposing armies Both armies were split into separate parts. The Prussian army was in a very poor state. Brunswick was 71 years old, while his field commanders were in their 60s. The Prussian army was still using tactics and training from the time of Frederick the Great. Its greatest weakness was its staff organization. Most of the divisions were poorly organized and did not communicate well with each other. The Prussians had three forces: *60,500 under Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick *38,000 under Friedrich Ludwig, F√ºrst zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen *15,000 under Ernst von R√ºchel The Grande Arm√©e loved their Emperor and their generals. The army was very experienced and was very well led, with a good mix of older, more experienced Marshals, and younger, upcoming Marshals. Napoleon's main force at Jena consisted of about 116,000 menJena%E2%80%93Auerstedt campaign order of battle in total: *Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult's IV Corps *Jean Lannes' V Corps *Michel Ney's VI Corps *Pierre Augereau's VII Corps *The cavalry of Joachim Murat Further north, in the vicinity of Auerstedt, the French forces were Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's I Corps (20,000 strong) and Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps (27,000). Overview The battles began when elements of Napoleon's main force encountered Hohenlohe's troops near Jena. Initially only 48,000 strong, the Emperor took advantage of his carefully planned and flexible dispositions to rapidly build up a superior force of 96,000 men. The Prussians were slow to grasp the situation, and slower still to react. Before Ruchel's 15,000 men could arrive from Weimar, Hohenlohe's force of 38,000 was routed, with 10,000 killed or wounded and 15,000 captured. Nevertheless, it was a fierce battle, with 5,000 French losses, and Napoleon mistakenly believed that he had faced the main body of the Prussian army. Further north at Auerstedt, both Davout and Bernadotte received orders to come to Napoleon's aid. Davout attempted to comply via Eckartsberga, Bernadotte via Dornburg. Davout's route south, however, was blocked by the Prussian main force of 60,500 men, including the Prussian King, the Duke of Brunswick and Field Marshals von M√∂llendorf and von Kalckreuth. A savage battle ensued. Although outnumbered two to one, Davout's superbly trained and disciplined III Corps endured repeated attacks before it eventually took the offensive and put the Prussians to flight. Though within earshot of both battles, Marshal Bernadotte controversially took no steps to come to Davout's aid, refusing to take the initiative and instead adhering to the last written set of Napoleon's orders.Barton, Sir Dunbar Plunkett (1921).

Battle of Jena Situation ‚Äì 10 a.m., 14 October =Plan= The Prussian army was divided into three armies drawn from across Prussia. Prussia's main weakness in 1806 was its senior command structure, which included command positions being held by multiple officers. One such example is the position of Chief of Staff, held by three different officers: General Phull, Colonel Gerhard von Scharnhorst and Colonel Rudolf Massenbach. The confusing system led to delays and complexities that resulted in over a month's delay before the final order of battle was prepared. Another obstacle facing the Prussians was the creation of a unified plan of battle. Five main plans emerged for discussion; however, protracted planning and deliberating shifted the initiative to the French. Thus, the Prussian plans became mere reactions to Napoleon's movements. Although Prussia had begun its mobilization almost a month before France, Napoleon had kept a high state of readiness after the Russian refusal to accept defeat after the War of the Third Coalition. Napoleon conceived a plan to force Prussia into a decisive battle, like Austerlitz, and pre-empt the Prussian offensive. Napoleon had a major portion of his Grande Arm√©e in position in present-day Baden-W√ºrttemberg in southwest Germany and thus decided on a northeast advance into Saxony and on to Berlin. The Battle of Jena. =Battle of Jena= French dragoon with captured Prussian flag at the battle of Jena The battle commenced on the morning of 14 October 1806, on the grassy fields near Jena. The first movements of the French Army were attacks on either flank of the Prussian lines. That gave the supporting armies (making up the central attack) time to get into position. The skirmishes had little decisive success, save for a breakthrough by the French General Saint-Hilaire, who attacked and isolated the Prussian left flank. At that time, Marshal Michel Ney had completed his maneuvers and had taken up position as ordered by Napoleon. However, once in position, Ney decided to attack the Prussian line despite having no orders to do so, a move that proved to be almost disastrous. Ney's initial assault was a success, but he found himself overextended and under heavy fire from Prussian artillery. Recognizing the distressed salient, the Prussian general ordered a counterattack and enveloped Ney's forces; Ney formed them into a square to protect all their flanks. Napoleon recognized Ney's situation and ordered Marshal Jean Lannes to shift from the centre of attack to help Ney. That action left the French centre weak. However, Napoleon deployed the Imperial Guard to hold the French center until Ney could be rescued. That adaptability was one of Napoleon's greatest strengths. He kept the Imperial Guard under his direct command and could order them to take positions depending on the situation that the battle presented him. The rescue worked, and Ney's units were able to retreat from the battle. Although the French were then in a troubling situation, the Prussian commanders did not take the initiative to push at the French weaknesses. That was later considered to have been their undoing. The inactivity of the Prussian infantry left them open to artillery and light infantry fire. One Prussian general later wrote that \\"the area around the entrance of the village was the scene of the most terrible blood-letting and slaughter\\". Marshal Joachim Murat, the most famous of many daring and charismatic French cavalry commanders of the era, leads a charge during the battle. It was at that time, around 1 p.m., that Napoleon decided to make the decisive move. He ordered his flanks to push hard and try to break through the Prussian flanks and encircle the main center army while the French center attempted to crush the Prussian centre. The attacks on the flanks proved to be a success and caused many of the Prussian divisions on the flanks to flee the battlefield. With its flanks broken, the Prussian army was forced to withdraw and Napoleon had won another battle. In total the Prussian army lost 10,000 men killed or wounded, had 15,000 prisoners of war taken as well as 150 guns. Battle of Auerstedt Situation ‚Äì 2 p.m., 14 October General √âtienne Gudin's Division were on the move from Naumburg before 6:30 a.m. By 7 a.m. the 1st Chasseurs were stopped cold in their tracks outside of Poppel by Prussian cavalry and artillery. There was a heavy fog, which had lifted just as they approached the village. Once Davout became aware of the Prussian force, he ordered Gudin to deploy his force at Hassenhausen. The Prussian commander on the field was Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau. His division was actually under orders to proceed down the very road that Davout was on, to block his advance in the K√∂sen Pass. While Schmettau's troops were deploying to attack Hassenhausen, Bl√ºcher arrived with his cavalry and deployed on his left. Together, they attacked Gudin's troops and pushed them back to the village. Prussian wounded and stragglers leaving the double battle by Richard Kn√∂tel. Wartensleben arrived at 8:30 a.m. with the Duke of Brunswick, who ordered his infantry to the left flank and his cavalry to the right. The rest of the French cavalry arrived at 9 a.m. and was placed on Gudin's left. General Louis Friant's Division and the 12-pound artillery arrived at 9:30 a.m. and moved in squares on Gudin's right. The advance of the French squares forced Bl√ºcher's cavalry back. Seeing no other option available he ordered his cavalry to attack. At that very moment, two of Wartensleben's regiments attacked Hassenhausen. Everything failed: three Prussian cavalry regiments were routed and the infantry fell back. At this critical point, the Duke needed to take drastic action. Shortly before 10 a.m., he ordered a full assault on Hassenhausen. By 10 a.m., the Duke of Brunswick was carried from the field mortally wounded along with Schmettau who was also badly wounded. With the loss of both commanders, the Prussian command broke down. The Prussian army was in danger of collapse. Oswald's infantry and the Prince of Orange, the later William I of the Netherlands, arrived about 10:30 a.m., and the King made his only decision of the day: to split Orange's command in two, half to each flank. On the French side, Morand's Division arrived and was sent to secure Gudin's left. Davout could now see that the Prussians were wavering and so at 11 a.m. he ordered his infantry to counter-attack. By noon Schmettau's center was broken and forced back over the Lissbach Stream, Bl√ºcher's cavalry was blown, and Wartensleben was trying to reposition his troops. The Prussians realized all was now lost and the King ordered a withdrawal. Davout's corps had lost 7,052 officers and men killed or wounded, while Prussian casualties were 13,000. Aftermath Napoleon after the Battle of Jena. Napoleon initially did not believe that Davout's single Corps had defeated the Prussian main body unaided and responded to the first report by saying \\"Your Marshal must be seeing double!\\", a reference to Davout's poor eyesight. As matters became clearer, however, the Emperor was unstinting in his praise. Davout was made Duke of Auerstedt. Lannes, the hero of Jena, was not so honored. Bernadotte's lack of action was controversial within a week of the twin battles. Bernadotte had last received positive written orders on the day before the battle in which his I Corps, along with Davout's III Corps, were to lay astride the Prussians' projected line of retreat. He was the only Marshal not to receive updated, written orders on the night of 13 October.Barton. (1921) Pp. 133. In the early hours of October 14th, Davout received a courier from Berthier in which he wrote: \\"If the Prince of Ponte Corvo [Bernadotte] is with you, you may both march together, but the Emperor hopes that he will be in the position which had been indicated at Dornburg.\\" Davout thence relayed this order to Bernadotte when the next met at 0400 the same morning.Gallaher. (2000) Pp. 134-135. Bernadotte later cited the poorly written, equivocal nature of the verbal order, as discretionary and complied with Napoleon's wish to be at Dornburg instead of accompanying Davout. Moreover, when told of Davout's difficulties, Bernadotte did not believe that the Prussian main force was before III Corps as Napoleon had claimed the main body was at Jena. As a consequence, he failed to aid Davout and instead fulfilled the Emperor's orders to position I Corps in the Prussian rear on the Heights of Apolda, which, incidentally, did have the effect intended as the Prussians at Jena withdrew once they saw French troops occupy their line of retreat.Barton (1921). Pp. 138-146. Davout and Bernadotte later became bitter enemies as the result of Bernadotte's perceived indifference at the fate of a fellow Marshal.Gallaher. (2000) P. 215. For his part, Napoleon later stated on St. Helena that Bernadotte's behavior (though he was complying with Napoleon's orders) was disgraceful and that but for his attachment to Bernadotte's wife, Napoleon's own former fianc√©e, Desiree Clary, he would have had Bernadotte shot.Petre. (1914) 170-173. However, contemporary evidence indicates that far from scenes of recriminations and insults alleged by Davout and his aides-de- Camp against Bernadotte the night of the battles, Napoleon was unaware anything was amiss, insofar as I Corps had played the part assigned to it by the Emperor, until days later. Napoleon later sent a severely worded reprimand to Bernadotte but took no further action.Barton (1921) Pp. 152-158. French troops entering Berlin. On the Prussian side, Brunswick was mortally wounded at Auerstedt, and over the next few days, the remaining forces were unable to mount any serious resistance to Murat's ruthless cavalry pursuit. In the Capitulation of Erfurt on 16 October, a large body of Prussian troops became prisoners with hardly a shot being fired. Bernadotte crushed Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of W√ºrttemberg's Prussian Reserve Army on the 17th in the Battle of Halle, partially redeeming himself in Napoleon's eyes.Barton, D. Plunkett (1921). Pp 148-150. In recognition of his glorious victory at Auerstadt, Napoleon gave Davout the honor of entering Berlin first. Davout led his exhausted III Corps into Berlin in triumph on 25 October. Hohenlohe's force surrendered on 28 October after the Battle of Prenzlau, followed soon after by the Capitulation of Pasewalk. The French ran down and captured several small Prussian columns at Boldekow on 30 October, Anklam on 1 November, Wolgast on 3 November, and Wismar on 5 November. 21,000 Prussian field troops remained at large west of the Oder as November began under the command of Gebhard Bl√ºcher. French advances prevented his corps from crossing the Oder, or moving toward Stettin to seek waterborne transport to East Prussia. Bernadotte began a relentless pursuit of Bl√ºcher, with the two forces engaging in several holding actions, and was later joined by Murat and Soult in \\"The Pursuit of the Three Marshals.\\" Bl√ºcher then moved west to cross into neutral Denmark but the Danes placed their army on the border with the intent of attacking any force that tried to cross it. The Prussians then violated the neutrality of the Hanseatic City of L√ºbeck and fortified it with the intent of joining forces with an allied Swedish contingent there on its way home, and commandeering ships in the hopes of reaching a safe harbor. However, Bl√ºcher and Winning's corps was surrounded and destroyed in what became the Battle of L√ºbeck on 6 and 7 November after Bernadotte's I Corps, still smarting from the Emperor's censure, stormed the fortified city gates, poured into the streets and squares breaking hasty attempts at resistance and captured Bl√ºcher's command post (and his Chief of Staff Gerhard von Scharnhorst) as Soult's troops blocked all escape routes. The Prussians lost 3000 killed and wounded. On the morning of 7 November, with all hope of escape extinguished, Bl√ºcher surrendered personally to Bernadotte and went into captivity with 9,000 other Prussian prisoners of war.Petre, F. Lorraine (1907) Pp. 285-289.Barton (1921). Pp.164-167. The Siege of Magdeburg ended on 11 November with Ney's capture of the fortress. Isolated Prussian resistance remained, but Napoleon's primary foe was now Russia, and the Battle of Eylau and the Battle of Friedland awaited.

Influence The Pont d'I√©na in Paris was built to commemorate the Battle of Jena. The battle proved most influential in demonstrating the need for reforms in what was a very much feudal Prussian state and army. Important Prussian reformers like Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Clausewitz served at the battle. Their reforms, together with civilian reforms instituted over the following years, began Prussia's transformation into a modern state, which took the forefront in expelling France from Germany and eventually assumed a leading role on the continent. The German philosopher Hegel, who was then a professor at the University of Jena, is said to have completed his chef d'≈ìuvre, the Phenomenology of Spirit, while the battle raged. Hegel considered this battle to be \\"the end of the history\\", in terms of evolution of human societies towards what would be called the \\"universal homogeneous state\\"The argument is discussed in depth in Francis Fukuyama's book The End of History and the Last Man. Napoleon built a bridge in Paris which he named after the battle. When he was defeated, the Prussian contingent of the allied forces of occupation was so incensed by its name that they wished to destroy the bridge. Talleyrand temporarily renamed the bridge after the French Grand Army, which dissuaded them from doing so. The station of the Paris Metro at the bridge has the same name.

She was known to the family as \\"Erzsi\\", a diminutive of her name in Hungarian. Later nicknamed \\"The Red Archduchess\\", she was famous for becoming a socialist and a member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party. Early life Archduchess Elisabeth, nicknamed 'Erzsi', was born at Schloss Laxenburg on 2 September 1883 to Crown Prince Rudolf and St√©phanie, daughter of King Leopold II of Belgium. She was named after her grandmothers, Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Queen Marie Henriette of Belgium. The only child of his only (deceased) son, Erzsi was Franz Joseph's favorite granddaughter. In 1889, when Erzsi was a little over five years old, her father and Baroness Mary von Vetsera, his mistress, were found dead in what was assumed to be a murder-suicide pact at the Imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling. Her father's death interrupted the dynastic succession within the Austrian imperial family, fractured her grandparents' already tenuous marriage and was a catalyst in Austria-Hungary's gradual destabilization, which culminated in the First World War and the subsequent disintegration of the Habsburg Empire. Erzsi and dog, c. 1895 After Rudolf's death, Franz Joseph took over guardianship of Erzsi; by his order, she was forbidden to leave Austria with her mother.Moore, George Greville, Society recollections in Paris and Vienna, 1879‚Äì1904, D. Appleton and Co., 1908, p. 236 At a young age she displayed a strong personality, as well as an opposition to the Viennese court. Her grandmother, the capricious Empress Elisabeth, did not enjoy being identified as a grandmother and was therefore not close to any of her grandchildren. However, after her assassination in 1898, her will specified that outside a large bequest of the sale of her jewels to benefit charities and religious orders, all of her personal property was bequeathed to Erzsi, her namesake and Rudolf's only child. The Empress made no secret of her dislike of her daughter-in-law prior to the scandal, and after the Mayerling incident, blamed St√©phanie's jealous behavior for her son's depression and suicide. The crown princess herself was entirely dependent on the Emperor's charity, and following her husband's death the resulting lack of imperial support towards St√©phanie negatively impacted her relationship with her daughter; the parent and child were never close.Anonymous, At the Austrian Court: Recollections of a Royal Governess, D. Appleton & Co., 1915, p. 299 In 1900 St√©phanie renounced her title of Crown Princess to marry the Protestant Hungarian Count, later Prince Elem√©r L√≥nyay von Nagy-L√≥nya und V√°s√°ros-Nam√©ny. Although Franz Joseph provided her with a dowry and L√≥nyay eventually converted,Anonymous, At the Austrian Court: Recollections of a Royal Governess, D. Appleton & Co., 1915, p.299 Elisabeth broke off all contact with her mother as she disapproved of the marriage, feeling it a betrayal of her father's memory. Later, following her marriage, St√©phanie retaliated by disinheriting Elisabeth in 1934.Weissensteiner, Friedrich, Elisabeth, Die rote Erzherzogin Elisabeth, the red Archduchess, Vienna, 1982, p.142 First marriage Elisabeth was considered a potential bride for several princes in Europe; among them was her cousin Prince Albert, heir presumptive to the throne of Belgium. However, King Leopold II vehemently disapproved of St√©phanie's recent morganatic marriage to Count L√≥nyay and thus refused to give Albert his permission. Albert's sister Henriette was horrified at her brother's choice, feeling Elisabeth's background was too unstable for the marriage to be a success. Elisabeth Marie and Prince Otto zu Windisch- Gr√§tz In 1900 Elisabeth met Prince Otto Weriand of Windisch-Graetz (1873‚Äì1952) at a court ball, son of Prince Ernst Ferdinand Weriand of Windisch-Graetz (1827-1918) and Princess Kamilla Amalia Caroline Notgera of Oettingen- Oettingen und Oettingen-Spielberg (1845-1888). Ten years her senior, he was below her in rank. Nonetheless she importuned her grandfather to be allowed to marry him. Franz Joseph resisted at first, having intended for Elisabeth to marry the German Crown Prince, but eventually relented. By many accounts it was Elisabeth alone who wanted the marriage, as Otto was already engaged to a Countess von Sch√∂nborn and was reportedly dumbfounded when Franz Joseph informed him of his new engagement. Ordered by the Emperor to break his \\"lesser\\" engagement to marry his granddaughter, he complied.Anonymous, At the Austrian Court: Recollections of a Royal Governess, D. Appleton & Co., 1915, p. 310 In order to avoid future succession issues, the Emperor made the marriage conditional on Elisabeth's renouncing her right to succession, although he allowed her to keep her personal title and provided her with a generous dowry. Since his family was officially listed in the Habsburg list of families which were allowed to make an equal marriage with an Imperial family, they still regarded Otto's Mediatized House and the marriage as a m√©salliance and wanted the marriage to be treated as morganatic. As it was a case of the Emperor's favorite granddaughter and Otto's family was legally considered equal for dynastic purposes, as were marriages with all other mediatized Princely families, the marriage was officially treated as equal and his family would have grounds for pressing Elisabeth to become empress should the succession become interrupted again.Weissensteiner, Friedrich, Elisabeth, Die rote Erzherzogin [Elisabeth, the red Archduchess], Vienna, 1982, p. 142. The couple married at the Hofburg on 23 January 1902. They had three sons: Prince Franz Joseph (1904‚Äì1981), Prince Ernst (1905‚Äì1952) and Prince Rudolf (1907‚Äì1939). Their last child and only daughter, Princess Stephanie (1909‚Äì2005), was born at Ploschkowitz. The marriage, however, was troubled, and led to unwelcome reminders for the Emperor of his son's death, and possible further scandal for the family: \\"The Red Archduchess\\" Throughout their marriage both Elisabeth and Otto were open in having affairs, most notably the former's liaison with Egon Lerch, an Austrian submarine captain during World War I. Only after the death of Franz Joseph in 1916 and the end of the monarchy in 1918 did the couple officially separate. In 1921 Elisabeth joined the Social Democratic Party, where she met Leopold Petznek from Bruck an der Leitha, then president of the audit office, at one of the election meetings. A teacher and a committed Social Democratic politician who became president of the Lower Austrian Landtag (state parliament) after the war, Petznek came from a modest background, but was highly cultivated. He was also married; his wife, with whom he had a son, was institutionalized at a psychiatric hospital in Mauer-Ohling, where she died on 9 June 1935. The lengthy legal process dragged on, and it was not until March 1924 that Elisabeth was able to obtain a judicial separation. A sensational custody battle for their four children ensued. Originally the court granted Elisabeth custody of the two elder sons, while their younger son and daughter were to live with Otto. She is supposed to have prevented this either by presenting Otto with a house full of armed Socialists when he came to remove them, or else by threatening him with suicide should she have to give them up. In any event, Elisabeth ultimately retained custody of all four children. Elisabeth doted on her children when they were young, but her relationship with them deteriorated as they grew older. Rudolf, in accordance with her socialist views, was reportedly taken out of school and put to work in a factory. Elisabeth and her daughter Stephanie did not have a good relationship; she reportedly stated that she married her first husband based on the fact that her mother did not like him. Elisabeth moved to the H√ºtteldorf district of Vienna and bought a villa in 1929, where she lived with Petznek for the next twenty years. She was at his side at Social Democratic marches and meetings, where she was accepted and accorded great respect. Leopold, however, due to his \\"haughty\\" character, was not welcome in aristocratic circles. In 1934 her husband and son made a legal motion to place her under a conservatorship on the grounds that she had squandered profits from the sale of the couple's property in numerous donations, made in order to join the Social Democrats. The motion was later dropped. Although divorce became legal in 1938, when Austria became part of Germany and adopted German law after the Anschluss, Elisabeth was not able to divorce her husband until after the end of the war. Second marriage In late 1933 Petznek was arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian government until July 1934. In 1944, he was arrested by the Nazis and sent to Dachau concentration camp until the camp was liberated by the Americans in March 1945. After the war he became the first President of the Austrian Federal Court of Audit. As Elisabeth renounced her official title of Archduchess to the House of Habsburg at the time of her first marriage, the new Habsburg Laws did not apply to her; she was allowed to stay in Austria and retain her personal possessions. She formally divorced Prince Otto in early 1948, and on 4 May 1948 she and Leopold married in a registry office in Vienna. When Vienna was occupied by the Red Army, Elisabeth's villa was commandeered and then ransacked by Soviet soldiers. When H√ºtteldorf became part of the French occupied zone, the villa was occupied by General Bethouart; Elisabeth and Leopold were not allowed to return until 1955, when the Allied occupation ended. By then both were in poor health: Petznek died in July 1956 from a heart attack, while Elisabeth‚Äîwho was confined to a wheelchair due to gout‚Äîbred German Shepherds, but became reclusive until her death in 1963. Aftermath Unmarked grave of Elisabeth Marie and Leopold Petznek: Grave 29, Group 22. On her deathbed, she ordered her staff to close her villa against her two surviving children and call for a police detail to secure her belongings until the Ministry of Education could remove them. Only her daughter was allowed to see her for a few moments, in the presence of her servants. She had willed some 500 heirlooms, owned by the Habsburg Imperial family, to the Republic of Austria. Over the objections of her first husband, who thought they should go to their children, she wanted all art and books to \\"be put back in their former places\\", as she did not believe Imperial property should be sold at auction or come into the possession of foreigners; these pieces are in museums in Vienna today. She died in Vienna, aged 79. According to her wishes, she was buried in an unmarked grave at the H√ºtteldorfer Friedhof in Vienna with her second husband, close to the house where she spent her last years. Since 1995, the villa has been in the possession of the international (Buddhist) community Soka Gakkai International.

He is widely known as the author of many film \\"making of\\" books, including those for the Harry Potter series and The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.  Early life  Brian was born in Wandsworth, London,Author Page (shelfari) http://www.shelfari.com/authors/a17432/Brian-Sibley/ to Eric George Sibley, an architectural draughtsman, and Doris Alice Sibley (n√©e Summers).

Fiume and Su≈°ak would have a joint administration of the port facilities. Both towns are now in the city of Rijeka, Croatia. Background Fiume County (orange), as well as the strip of land (yellow), became the Free State of Fiume by the Treaty of Rapallo. After Fiume was under Gabriele D'Annunzio's Italian Regency of Carnaro, the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) created the independent Free State of Fiume, which was immediately recognised by other states, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The state survived only one year de facto and four years de jure. The joint administration of the port was never created. On 24 April 1921, the first general elections for its parliament occurred, and it elected President Riccardo Zanella, the leader of the Autonomist Fiuman Movement. On 3 March 1922, a movement directed by the fascist deputy Francesco Giunta forced Zanella to resign. On 17 September 1923, Gaetano Giardino, an Italian general, was sent by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini with the task of restoring public order. In the meantime, negotiations started between Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to dissolve the Free State of Fiume. All parties ratified the agreement in Rome on 22 February 1924, and it became effective the same day. It was registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on 7 April 1924.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 24, pp. 32‚Äì89.  Terms  The Treaty of Rome revoked parts of the Treaty of Rapallo. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes asserted its sovereignty over the delta of the Rjeƒçina River, including the seaport of Su≈°ak (Porto Barros) and the north of Fiume County. Italy was given the city of Fiume, some surrounding land and a coastal corridor to connect it to the Italian mainland. Aftermath The exact definition of the borders were the object of a joint commission, whose results were agreed upon on 20 July 1925 in the Treaty of Nettuno.

Life  Although christened Gisella (with a double L), after a 10th-century Habsburg ancestress, she only ever wrote her name with one L. Just like her older sister Archduchess Sophie (died 1857) and her brother Crown Prince Rudolf, Gisela was raised by her paternal grandmother, Princess Sophie of Bavaria. A sober nature like her father, she kept a reserved attitude towards her mother. She had a very close relationship with her brother, whose suicide hit her hard. Her father collected some of the family's personal items, such as the first pair of shoes worn by each of his children. Among these keepsakes was a poem written for him by a young Gisela one Christmas - the poem was said to be the most treasured item among this collection. Archduchess Gisela was also known to paint in her later years.  Marriage and family  On 20 April 1873, at the age of 16, Gisela was married to Prince Leopold of Bavaria in Vienna. Prince Leopold was a son of Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria and Auguste Ferdinande of Austria and Gisela's second cousin. Leopold had initially fallen for Princess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who Empress Elisabeth's younger brother Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria intended to marry. The empress therefore arranged an encounter of Leopold and Gisela at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë Palace and the prince knew he could not refuse her offer. According to a letter to his mother written in 1872, Emperor Franz Josef wanted the match between his daughter and the Wittelsbach prince, as there were so few Catholic princes available at that time. It seems he felt he had to secure the only viable candidate to whom he could give Gisela (whom he called \\"our darling girl\\" during the wedding rites) with confidence. Prince Leopold received the immense dowry of a half a million guilders and soon overcame his former infatuation with Princess Amalie. Gisela's mother remained absent during the wedding celebrations. The young couple was made welcome in Munich by her husband's family, and went on to live in the Palais Leopold residence in Schwabing. The street opposite the Palais was renamed Giselastra√üe in her honor in 1873.  Issue  Gisela and Leopold with their children, about 1885 A year after her wedding, she gave birth to her first child and even Empress Elisabeth was present during the baptism. Gisela and Leopold had four children in total: * Princess Elisabeth Marie of Bavaria (1874‚Äì1957), who married Otto Ludwig Philipp Graf von Seefried auf Buttenheim * Princess Auguste Maria of Bavaria (1875‚Äì1964), who married Joseph August, Archduke of Austria * Prince Georg of Bavaria (1880‚Äì1943), who married Archduchess Isabella of Austria * Prince Konrad of Bavaria (1883‚Äì1969), who married Princess Bona Margherita of Savoy-Genoa  Charity works and World War I  Especially after the death of her brother, Gisela was deeply involved in a variety of social and political issues and founded charities to support the poor, blind and deaf people where she took an active role herself. During World War I she ran a military hospital in her Palais while her husband was a field marshal on the eastern front. When the Revolution broke out in 1918, the rest of her family fled the city, but Gisela remained and took part in the 1919 elections for the Weimar National Assembly where women above the age of 20 were allowed to vote for the first time. Such was the esteem in which she was held that she was commonly known as the Good Angel from Vienna and became patron for a number of institutions, such as the Giselabahn (a train running from Salzburg to Tirol), the still active paddle steamer Gisela on the Traunsee and the Gisela Gymnasium in Munich.  Widowhood and death  Gisela and her husband celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1923. Her husband died in 1930, and Gisela only survived him by two years. She died aged 76 in Munich on 27 July 1932, and is buried next to Prince Leopold in the Colombarium at the St.Michaelskirche, Munich.

She died aged two. Life Within two months of her marriage to Franz Joseph, Elisabeth was obviously pregnant. On 5 March 1855, the 17-year-old Empress of Austria delivered a daughter who was christened the same day, without Elisabeth's knowledge, Sophie Friederike Dorothea Maria Josepha, after Franz Joseph's mother. On both her mother and her father's side, Sophie descended from King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, as her parents were first cousins. On her father's side, she descended from the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II. During the next year, Elisabeth delivered another daughter, Archduchess Gisela, a younger sister to Sophie. Although they were both girls and did not need to be educated for duties a monarch would be obliged to fulfill, both infants right after being baptised were taken away from Elisabeth by Archduchess Sophie, nee Princess Sophie of Bavaria (who was both Elisabeth's aunt and mother-in-law) on account of the Empress being too young to raise two children. Elisabeth later commented: No matter how long Elisabeth begged Franz Joseph to discuss the matter with his mother, her cries went unheard. Eventually, Franz Joseph did discuss the problem with his mother and Elisabeth eventually began to openly express her wishes to her mother-in-law and even took the little girls with her as she travelled. Death Archduchess Sophie lying in rest, 1857 Empress Elisabeth adored Hungary and its people and proposed to her husband that they take a trip to her favourite country, perhaps even tour it. This was a desire she would regret for the rest of her life. Franz Joseph accepted and they left in early spring 1857. While in Budapest, both Sophie and her sister Archduchess Gisela fell ill with diarrhea and had a very high fever. 10-month-old Gisela recovered quickly. However, two-year-old Sophie's body could not take it. At : in the evening, after eleven hours of struggling to survive, Sophie died in her mother's arms, probably from dehydration due to the diarrhea or from convulsions due to the high fever. It was later theorized that Sophie died from typhus fever, but this is yet to be proven. Aftermath Sophie's body was brought back to Vienna and buried in the Imperial Crypt, in Ferdinandsgruft (literally, Ferdinand's Vault), within the southwest pier. The death of her oldest child would haunt Empress Elisabeth for her entire life. Elisabeth was held indirectly responsible for Sophie's death by her mother-in- law, Archduchess Sophie (n√©e Princess Sophie of Bavaria). She suffered a breakdown and would lock herself in her apartments for days at a time or go riding until she reached a state of exhaustion, just to avoid having to think. Sophie's death also settled who got the children. Princess Sophie indisputably took the children as soon as they were born. Elisabeth also started to neglect her surviving daughter, and their relationship was not a close one. One of Elisabeth's ladies-in-waiting, Marie Festetics, commented in her diary that the Empress did not even take the time to attend Gisela's wedding preparations. Elisabeth also behaved in a similar manner to her only son, Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria. For the rest of her remaining days, Elisabeth would wear a bracelet with a likeness of her dead daughter and kept a portrait of her in her apartments.

History = Location = The main campus is on the former summer estate (built in 1899) of the millionaire George Jay Gould, son of the railroad tycoon Jay Gould. The Goulds named their home Georgian Court, probably after George or the Georgian-revival architecture. The estate was designed by Bruce Price, a New York architect, and was one of his most important residential works. He also designed three of the campus's gardens: the Italian Gardens, the Sunken Garden, and the Formal Garden. Takeo Shiota designed the Japanese Garden. In addition to the gardens, GCU has maintained much of the original architecture and the Sister Mary Grace Burns Arboretum.

It lies on the northwest corner of the Shandong Peninsula on the southern coast of the Gulf of Bohai. The city is famous for its mirages out at sea, which are frequent during May and June. Geography Penglai is entirely surrounded by other divisions of Yantai: Fushan District is to the east, Longkou City to the west, and Qixia City to the south. Its limits in geographic coordinates are 37¬∞ 25'‚Äì37¬∞ 50' N, 120¬∞ 35'‚Äì121¬∞ 09' E. History The Red Cliffs () of the area are reputed to have been the site where the Eight Immortals set out for the land of the immortals and where Qin Shi Huang later sent off five hundred boys and five hundred girls on ships to search for them. Chinese legends held that a mystic dolphin was seen from the cliffs above and, missing it with his spear, the emperor knew that his days were numbered. The Martial Emperor of Han (Han Wudi) later also visited the area while searching for the elixir of immortality. The old city walls incorporate guard towers of three stories (rather than the usual two) because the uncle of the first emperor of the 6th-century Sui dynasty had been prince of the area. Under the Ming, the harbor was fortified and used by the war junks of the imperial navy. During the early years of the Manchu invasion of China, Portuguese artillerists were instructing Ming forces at Dengzhou when it was besieged by a mutinous army under Kong Youde in February 1632. Captain Gon√ßalo Teixeiro was killed during its sack, but the 70-year-old Jesuit linguist Jo√£o Rodrigues escaped by jumping from the city walls into the sea. Kong's forces then seized the Portuguese cannon and used them to pillage the countryside before joining the Manchu invaders who eventually established China's Qing Dynasty. Following the Second Opium War, Dengzhou became the first port opened to foreigners on the Shandong Peninsula in 1858.Brown, Arthur Judson (1904) New forces in old China: an unwelcome but inevitable awakening F.H. Revell Co., New York, Chapter IV OCLC 2177558 Christian missions were quickly established. The harbor was found inadequate for the traders, however, and Zhifu (now central Yantai) was developed away to function as Dengzhou's port. Penglai is mentioned in the fictional stories about Judge Dee by Robert van Gulik, first mentioned in the book The Chinese Gold Murders.

It was built under the Ming in 1376China Daily article on Penglai Water City and housed a fleet of warjunks. It is now a protected historical monument being renovated at a cost of 500m RMB (more than $60m). There is a plank walk along the cliffs nearby. More than US$25 million has also been invested into developing the Penglai Pavilion and other sites. The Penglai Pavilion is a large park of ancient buildings, palaces and temples, that have been restored and rebuilt. It has been a tourist goal for more than a thousand years, and the site features inscriptions from famous poets and calligraphers like Su Shi and Dong Qichang. Among other cultural attractions of Penglai are the Naval Museum with exhibits of ancient ships and the restored residence of the famous patriotic general Qi Jiguang. Penglai also has the largest ocean aquarium in Asia. It includes a polar area, a shark hall, a tropical rainforest, and a theater with mermaids, dolphins and sea lions. A picturesque festival takes place in January for the birthday of Tianhou, a local sea goddess. While tourism is the mainstay of Penglai's economy, bringing more than two million tourists annually, in fact the entire center of the town around the harbour was walled off and completely razed in 2006. = Wine industry = The production of wine is the second largest industry in the province. Agriculture is first. However, in Penglai, tourism is the primary industry, and wine-making is second. The hills south of Penglai have an average elevation of , while the coastal areas are relatively flat. Most of the soil is loose, well-aerated, and rich in minerals and organic matters that enable full development of the root systems. The wineries are located mainly in the Nanwang Grape Valley and along the Yan-Peng Sightseeing Highway.

It is part of New Jersey's public system of higher education. Kean University is best known for its programs in the humanities and social sciences and in education, graduating the most teachers in the state of New Jersey annually. Kean University was founded in 1855 in Newark, New Jersey, as the Newark Normal School. Initially established for the exclusive purpose of being a teacher-education college it became New Jersey State Teachers College in 1937. In 1958, following a post-war boom of students and increasing demands for a more comprehensive curriculum, the college was relocated from Newark to Union Township, site of the Kean family's ancestral home at Liberty Hall. After its move to the historic Livingston-Kean Estate, which includes the entire Liberty Hall acreage, the historic James Townley House, and Kean Hall, which historically housed the library of United States Senator Hamilton Fish Kean and served as a political meeting place, the school became Newark State College, a comprehensive institution providing a full range of academic programs and majors. Renamed Kean College of New Jersey in 1973, the institution earned university status on September 26, 1997, becoming Kean University of New Jersey. Kean University has subsequently grown to become the third largest institution of higher education in New Jersey and currently comprises five undergraduate colleges and the Nathan Weiss Graduate College. Kean University also hosts numerous research institutions, perhaps most prominently the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology and Mathematics, the Kean University Human Rights Institute, the Holocaust Resource Center, the Wynona Moore Lipman Ethnic Studies Center, and Liberty Hall. In recent years Kean has expanded to a satellite campus in Toms River, New Jersey, a campus in the Skylands of New Jersey and has a foreign campus in Wenzhou, China. History =Livingston-Kean Estate= Liberty Hall, the ancestral home of the Livingston and Kean families and an important center of Revolution-era American politics and culture, was built in 1760 by New Jersey's first governor, William Livingston. The mansion and grounds, on Kean's Liberty Hall Campus in Union, now serve as an American history museum and center for historic research. Livingston, Hamilton, and the American Revolution The building of the estate on which Kean University is situated was begun in 1760, when lawyer William Livingston, who would become New Jersey's first elected governor (on August 31, 1776) and a Revolutionary War patriot and signer of the United States Constitution, bought in then-Connecticut Farms and Elizabethtown, New Jersey, across the river from his New York home, in hopes of establishing a country residence. By 1772 extensive grounds, gardens and orchards had been developed and a 14-room Georgian-style house had been built under the supervision of Livingston. In its first year of occupancy the new house, christened Liberty Hall, was resided in by Livingston and Alexander Hamilton. In 1773 Livingston moved to the home with his wife, Susannah French of New Brunswick, and their children, full-time. Governor William Livingston supervised the construction of Liberty Hall, initially a home that quickly became a key place in the shaping of America. Alexander Hamilton, Founding Father and the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, resided at Liberty Hall with Livingston while attending academy in Elizabethtown. Liberty Hall suffered damage from the Revolutionary War by both British and American troops, the property having been central to the major Revolutionary development, the Battle of Connecticut Farms. The property was restored and Livingston continued to maintain the gardens and grounds as governor until his 1790 death. The estate passed to Livingston's son, future Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Henry Brockholst Livingston. In 1798 the house was sold to George Belasise, Lord Bolingbroke and his wife Isabella. The new owners established an English boxwood maze that still stands today and made extensive additions to the principal outbuildings of the property, established or improved a large hot house, and developed the gardens, introducing rare shrubs and trees to the grounds, and possibly laying out the grounds west of the mansion. In 1811, the Kean family acquired the Livingston estate when Peter Kean purchased Liberty Hall in trust for his mother Susan Livingston Kean Niemcewicz (women not being eligible to own property in their own right at the time). Susan Livingston Kean, a niece of Governor Livingston, was the widow of John Kean, a Continental Congress delegate and advocate for the ratification of the Constitution in South Carolina who served as the first cashier of the Bank of the United States. Having died from a respiratory disease that developed as a result of being held prisoner of war at sea during the Revolution, Kean died at 39 and Susan Livingston Kean remarried to Count Julian Niemcewicz, a Polish nobleman who fled Poland after fighting unsuccessfully for Polish independence from Russia but returned in the wake of Napoleon's successful campaigns. To honor her second husband Susan Kean changed the name of Liberty Hall to Ursino, the name of Niemcewicz's Polish estate. Peter Kean, the only son of Susan and John Kean, who married Sarah Sabina Morris, a granddaughter of Lewis Morris, the first royal governor of New Jersey, and served as colonel of the Fourth Regiment of New Jersey and an escort of Lafayette on his tour of New Jersey predeceased his mother. His son, John Kean II, inherited Liberty Hall. John Kean II, who served on the staff of Governor Pennington with the rank of colonel, was an original stockholder of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, served as the first president of the Elizabeth and Somerville Railroad, as a vice president of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, as president of the National Bank of New Jersey, as president of the Elizabethtown Gaslight Company (later known as Elizabethtown Gas Company) and Elizabethtown Water Company lived at Liberty Hall for 60 years and made the most dramatically significant changes to the house and property in its history, transforming the house into a 50-room Victorian Italianate structure. Another John Kean, son of John Kean II and Lucinetta Halsted Kean (\\"Lucy Kean\\"), inherited the estate after their deaths. John Kean served in the United States House of Representatives from 1883 to 1885, and again from 1887‚Äì1889, and in the United States Senate from 1899 to 1911. Senator kean lived at Liberty Hall when not in Washington, D.C. and held annual New Year's receptions for his political supporters at the estate. After the death of Senator John Kean the house passed to his nephew, Captain John Kean, a National Guard cavalryman and president of the National State Bank, the Elizabethtown Water Company, and the Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Company. Captain John Kean was the son of Katharine Winthrop Kean and United States Senator Hamilton Fish Kean whose library was housed at Kean Hall, a building constructed for that specific purpose in 1912. A frequent political meeting place in the first years of its life, Kean Hall now houses the undergraduate admissions office and administrative offices including the Presidential Suite and the conference room for the Kean University Board of Trustees. Captain John Kean's wife, Mary Alice Barney Kean, a historian and preservationist, was the last resident of Liberty Hall and was responsible for much of its preservation. Historic non-residents associated with Liberty Hall Liberty Hall has had many distinguished visitors, including Martha Washington, who stayed at Liberty Hall during her husband's inauguration and President George Washington who visited his wife there not long after his swearing-in in New York City. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay was married to Governor Livingston's daughter Sarah at Liberty Hall. Other guests included Lewis Morris, Lafayette, Elias Boudinot, and several presidents after Washington, including Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. =Newark Normal School= Newark, New Jersey was a growing, increasingly diverse metropolis in the late 19th century, largely due to the arrival of European immigrants. Kean University was founded in April 1855 in Newark, New Jersey as the Newark Normal School, a Saturday morning school initially established for the exclusive purpose of being a teacher-education college for the educators of the city of Newark. The university was founded by Stephen Congar, Newark's Superintendent of Schools, who founded the Newark Normal School with the goal of ensuring the continued improvement of the city's schools through quality teaching. The academy was designed to improve the skills of teachers that Congar correctly viewed as lacking in formal training. Newark Normal School was the first Normal School created in New Jersey, and one of the earliest in the nation, with an inaugural class of 85 students, mostly women and primarily Newark High School alumni. Most of the college's first students were white, middle class, Protestants. Classes continued during the Civil War, but the numbers of men enrolled declined as young men joined the Union Army. Following the Union victory in the war, increasing numbers of Catholics, largely the children of immigrants, began to enroll beginning the school's theme of a diverse student body that would continue to evolve over the next 150 years; by 1911 the children of immigrants exceeded thirty percent of the student body; since that time, Kean University has become one of the nation's most diverse schools. In 1863 the Normal School students became formally required to teach in Newark Public Schools after graduation. In 1879 the Normal School program was extended to one year, and in 1888 to two years. The first classes of the Normal School met at Newark High School, then located on Washington and Linden Streets in Newark. In 1878, the Normal School moved to the Market Street School for about two decades before moving back to Newark High School in 1899. In 1898 the curriculum of the college was radically revised in an effort to have teachers \\"professionalized\\" and enhance the status of the institution. =New Jersey State Normal School= In 1913 the state took control of the college and the School was renamed the New Jersey State Normal School at Newark. The School moved to a new building at Fourth Street and Belleville Avenue (later Broadway Avenue) that year. In 1917, during World War I, the Normal School faculty and students worked in war-related fundraising and relief efforts. In the following decade the Normal School raised its standards further, as evidenced by a 1925 announcement that \\"students who are deficient in spelling...will be dropped from the school\\" and by the 1928 extension of the Normal School program to three years. The Great Depression brought challenges for the School as enrollment and the overall number of teachers hired in New Jersey declined sharply. In 1934 a great milestone was reached when the Normal School became a four-year college and the State Board of Education authorized the Normal School to grant bachelor's degrees ‚Äì Bachelor of Science in Education. =New Jersey State Teachers College= In 1937 the college was renamed the New Jersey State Teachers College at Newark and remained in the Broadway building until 1958, when it moved to the current Union Township, New Jersey campus. Impact of World War II The Second World War brought sweeping changes to the College with some 300 students serving in the armed forces and seven Newark State students losing their lives on active duty. During the war, President Roy L. Shaffer pledged to keep the College \\"rolling\\" as part of the \\"moral and intellectual defense\\" of the nation. The accelerating changes during World War II altered the nature of the College as its students, faculty, and curriculum became more diverse, the campus underwent physical changes, and the student body changed dramatically. One young veteran, writing home from occupied Germany, predicted that the College would see a lot more men's faces after the war, which turned out to be very accurate; the education benefits offered under the GI Bill of Rights drove men to apply at unprecedented levels, including more African-American students. As the post-war Baby Boom generated a large demand for new teachers, the College found itself broadening in the face of student desires for a broader curriculum that quickly expanded to encompass the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, and graduate education. While the college maintained a focus on educating teachers it was quickly developing itself into a comprehensive institution. By the early 1950s, post-war growth had severely strained the College's facilities, causing a need for a new campus. =Newark State College= The purchase of the Kean Estate in Union Township, then called the \\"Green Lane Farm\\", allowed for a new campus in 1958 at the site of the Kean family's ancestral home at Liberty Hall. The following year the institution changed its name to Newark State College, completing its transformation from a college of education to a comprehensive institute of higher education. President Eugene Wilkins retired in 1969, following the successful transition of the College from Newark to Union and the successful inaugural years of Newark State College. Wilkins was succeeded by Dr. Nathan Weiss, for whom the Nathan Weiss Graduate College is named. Weiss was committed to wide access to higher education, especially for first-generation college students, while fostering vastly expanded new programs in the sciences, health cares, business, and academic and administrative computing. Weiss led the school to its status as a multi-purpose institution. =Kean College of New Jersey= In 1973, Newark State College was renamed Kean College of New Jersey for the Kean family whose members include Congressman Robert Winthrop Kean; U.S. Congressman and U.S. Senator John Kean of New Jersey; former New Jersey Governor and 9/11 Commission (Kean Commission) Chairman Thomas Kean, Sr.; U.S. Senator Hamilton Fish Kean; Julia Kean, the wife of US Secretary of State and New York Governor Hamilton Fish; First Lady of the United States Anna Symmes Harrison; New Jersey State Senator and United States Senate nominee Thomas Kean, Jr.; and John Kean of South Carolina, delegate to the Continental Congress. Dr. Elsa Gomez became the first female president of Kean College in 1989 and served until 1994. By the 1990s the student body of Kean College was among the most diverse in New Jersey. The academic quality of the institution improved towards the end of the 20th century as more members of the faculty, in rapidly escalating numbers, pursued teaching innovations, original scholarship and research, and external grants and funding. By the time Kean College of New Jersey became a university in 1997, under President Ronald L. Applbaum, the institution had achieved a higher level of academic and public recognition. =Kean University= Becoming Kean University of New Jersey on September 26, 1997, Kean soon added the Nathan Weiss Graduate College.Keanalumni.org In 2003, Dawood Farahi was elected president of Kean University by the unanimous vote of the board of trustees. Kean University has grown to become the third largest institution of higher education in the State of New Jersey, after Rutgers University and Montclair State University. In recent years, besides its campuses in Union and Hillside, New Jersey, the University has recently completed additional expansions to Toms River, New Jersey, which houses an Ocean County satellite campus, as well as the People's Republic of China. In 2006, the University announced that it was seeking approval from the Chinese and U.S. educational governing bodies to be the first American university to open an extensive University campus on Chinese soil. The new campus is located in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, one of the richest, fastest growing Chinese provinces.

After hiring an independent law firm to review Dr. Farahi's who found errors on the resume, the Board of Trustees of Kean University voted 7-4 (with one abstention) to retain Dr. Farahi as President of the University. The following year, in April 2012, the NCAA accused the university of \\"major violations\\" and placed all of its sports teams on probation. This turmoil attracted the attention of the university's regional accreditor who initially demanded answers from the university in 2011 and briefly placed the university on probation in 2012.

The blunderbuss is a firearm with a short, large caliber barrel which is flared at the muzzle and frequently throughout the entire bore, and used with shot and other projectiles of relevant quantity or caliber. The blunderbuss is commonly considered to be an early predecessor of the modern shotgun, with similar military and defensive use. It was effective only at short range, lacking accuracy at long distances. A blunderbuss in handgun form was called a dragon, and it is from this that the term dragoon evolved. Etymology An English flintlock blunderbuss. The term \\"blunderbuss\\" is of Dutch origin, from the Dutch word donderbus, which is a combination of donder, meaning \\"thunder\\", and bus, meaning \\"Pipe\\" (Middle Dutch: busse, box, tube, from Late Latin, buxis, box, from Ancient Greek pyxŒØs (œÄœÖŒæŒØœÇ), box: esp. from boxwood). The transition from donder to blunder is thought by some to be deliberate; the term blunder was originally used in a transitive sense, synonymous with to confuse, and this is thought to describe the stunningly loud report of the large-bore, short-barreled blunderbuss. The term dragon is taken from the fact that early versions were decorated with a carving in the form of a mythic dragon's head around the muzzle; the muzzle blast would then give the impression of a fire-breathing dragon. Construction A French blunderbuss, called an espingole, 1760, France. Musketoon, blunderbuss and coach gun from the American Civil War era. The flared muzzle is the defining feature of the blunderbuss, differentiating it from large caliber carbines; the distinction between the blunderbuss and the musketoon is less distinct, as musketoons were also used to fire shot, and some had flared barrels. The muzzle (and often the bore) was flared with the intent not only to increase the spread of the shot, but also to funnel powder and shot into the weapon, making it easier to reload on horseback or on a moving carriage; modern experiments corroborated the dramatic improvement in shot spread, going from a 21 inch spread diameter from a straight barrel to an average of 38 inch spread at 10 yards. Blunderbusses were typically short, with barrels under in length, at a time when a typical musket barrel was over long.See Brown Bess., page 324, from a letter dated March 7, 1778 One source, describing arms from the early to middle 17th century, lists the barrel length of a wheel lock dragon at around , compared to a length for a blunderbuss. The blunderbuss could be considered an early shotgun, and served in similar roles. While various old accounts often list the blunderbuss as being loaded with various scrap iron, rocks, or wood, resulting in damage to the bore of the gun, it was typically loaded with a number of lead balls smaller than the bore diameter. Barrels were made of steel or brass. battlefield in Cerro Gordo, Veracruz, Mexico An 1808 Harper's Ferry blunderbuss, of the type carried on the Lewis and Clark Expedition A pair of early blunderbuss pistols from Poland fitted with the miquelet lock A recreation of one of Lewis and Clark's pirogues with a blunderbuss mounted to the bow with a pintle. The blunderbuss, and especially the dragon, was typically issued to troops such as cavalry, who needed a lightweight, easily handled firearm. The dragon became so associated with cavalry and mounted infantry that the term dragoon became synonymous with mounted infantry. In addition to the cavalry, the blunderbuss found use for other duties in which the shotgun-like qualities were desirable, such as for guarding prisoners or defending a mail coach, and its use for urban combat was also recognized. Blunderbusses were also commonly carried by officers on naval warships, privateers and by pirates for use in close-quarters boarding actions. The Portuguese marines used it widely in the 17th century. Many types of ammunition, including gravel and sand, could be shot in a pinch, but most of the time they were shot using traditional lead balls. The blunderbuss used by the British Royal Mail during the period of 1788‚Äì1816 was a flintlock with a long flared brass barrel, brass triggerguard, and an iron trigger and lock. A typical British mail coach would have a single postal employee on board, armed with a blunderbuss and a pair of pistols, to guard the mail from highwaymen., see items OB1995.338 and OB1995.344 One 18th century coaching blunderbuss in another British collection had a brass barrel long, flaring to at the muzzle; it was also provided with a spring-loaded bayonet, which was held along the barrel by a catch and would spring forward into place when released. Spring-loaded bayonet blunderbusses were also used by the Nottingham Police after its formation around 1840., see section \\"1836 ‚Äì Protection of Royal Palaces\\" While the blunderbuss is often associated with the Plymouth Colony Pilgrims of 1620, evidence suggests that the blunderbuss was relatively scarce in the American colonies. After the Battle of Lexington in 1775, British General Thomas Gage occupied Boston, Massachusetts, and upon negotiating with the town committee, Gage agreed to let the inhabitants of Boston leave town with their families and effects if they surrendered all arms. While most of the residents of Boston stayed, those who left under the agreement surrendered 1,778 long arms, 634 pistols, 273 bayonets, and only 38 blunderbusses. The blunderbuss did still have its civilian applications, however; the Lewis and Clark Expedition carried a number of blunderbusses, some of which were mounted and used as small swivel guns on the pirogues. By the middle 19th century, the blunderbuss was replaced for military use by the carbine, but still found use by civilians as a defensive firearm.Number 704, page 2 See also * Coach gun * Combat shotgun * Musketoon * Riot shotgun * Sawed-off shotgun References Muskets Early firearms 18th-century weapons 19th-century weapons it:Spingarda ","title":"Blunderbuss"},{"id":"295210","text":"Monmouth University is a private university in West Long Branch, New Jersey.

Created in New Jersey during the Great Depression, Monmouth Junior College was intended by Schlaefer to provide an opportunity for higher education to high school graduates in Monmouth County who could not afford to go away to college. The junior college did not have its own campus at the time of its founding and was housed at Long Branch High School in Long Branch. Due to sharing a building with a high school, classes were taught during evening hours after the high school students had departed. Monmouth Junior College opened to students on November 21, 1933. The junior college's first student enrollment was reported at 325, all graduates from Monmouth County high schools, with a faculty of 12 instructors. Federal reemployment funds financed the junior college, with approximately $18,000 approved by New Jersey Director of Emergency Relief John Colt. In 1947, the school received full college accreditation from the New Jersey Board of Education to award associate degrees to students. 100 students became the first recipients of associate degrees from Monmouth Junior College the following year. Support from students and the community are credited with helping the school continue to teach classes and become a privately-funded institution. =New location and four-year status= Monmouth Junior College acquired its own campus in 1955 when it relocated from Long Branch to the estate of Shadow Lawn in West Long Branch. The estate was purchased from Eugene H. Lehman for $350,000. In addition to the monetary cost, Lehman signed over the estate under the provision that he serve as the school's president for one year. A year later, the school was renamed Monmouth College when it was accredited by the state to offer four-year programs that would award bachelor degrees to students. Through the agreement that granted Shadow Lawn to the school, Lehman became the first president of Monmouth College from 1956 to 1957. Schlaefer resumed leadership after Lehman's tenure, serving as president from 1957 to 1962. Monmouth's first commencement was held at Shadow Lawn the same year that Schlaefer assumed the presidency and the first bachelor's degrees were awarded the year after, in 1958. The 1960s saw further growth for Monmouth in campus size, athletics, student life, and academics. At the start of the decade, the Murry and Leonie Foundation transferred ownership of the Murry Guggenheim House to Monmouth, which became the school's library. The transfer also included a stable and carriage house that would be converted into the Lauren K. Woods Theatre. Elmwood and Pinewood, Monmouth's first campus residence halls, opened in 1963, while the William T. Boylan Gymnasium was built in 1965 as a new home for the basketball team. Additional property was acquired by the college in 1969 when Monmouth was granted ownership of Maurice Pollak's home, the site of what would become Pollak Theatre. Amid the campus expansion, Monmouth College received authorization from the state to offer graduate programs and award master degrees in 1967. Monmouth's 50th anniversary in 1983 was coincided by its athletics program being granted Division I status from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Teams representing Monmouth competed in the Northeast Conference for the next three decades. The 50th anniversary also saw the first Founders' Day at Monmouth, which would become an annual tradition. Four years later, the school's Athletics Hall of Fame was established. =University charter= A significant development occurred for Monmouth in 1995 when it was granted university status by the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education, resulting in the school being renamed Monmouth University. The university status was obtained under the leadership of Rebecca Stafford, the school's first female president, who described Monmouth as being \\"on the move\\". The College Center, constructed in the 1970s, would be renamed the Rebecca Stafford Student Center in her honor. During the 1990s, the school's athletic program was joined by a football team, which began play in 1993. The athletic teams would continue to compete in the Northeast Conference until 2013 when they moved to the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). As the MAAC did not sponsor collegiate football, Monmouth's football team became part of the Big South Conference as an associate member. The 21st century saw the completion of a pedestrian underpass on campus in 2001. By the end of the decade, the Multipurpose Activity Center replaced the William T. Boylan Gymnasium as the home of the men's and women's basketball teams in 2009. The new facility, which cost $57 million, was described by then-Senior Associate Athletic Director Jeff Stapleton as \\"probably the biggest undertaking that the institution has done\\". The facility was renamed OceanFirst Bank Center in 2016 after Monmouth University and OceanFirst Bank reached a $4 million agreement through 2036 that included the naming rights of the facility. Buildings =Great Hall at Shadow Lawn= Shadow Lawn The centerpiece of the Monmouth University campus is Shadow Lawn. Originally, it was the site of the Shadow Lawn mansion, constructed in 1903 and housed 52 rooms. After the original Shadow Lawn was destroyed by a fire in 1927, the current building that would become was built as a residence for Mr. and Mrs. Hubert Templeton Parson. Mr. Parson was the former head of F.W. Woolworth Company. The building was designed by Horace Trumbauer and Julian Abele. Abele is regarded as the first professional African American architect.*Abele, Julian (1881‚Äì1950) ‚Äì Philadelphia Architects and Buildings biographyThe Twilight of Splendor: Chronicles of the Age of American Palaces (1975) by James T. Maher Shadow Lawn became municipal property during the Great Depression and until Monmouth acquired ownership, it was home to Highland Manor Junior College, a private girls' school. Today, it is a National Historic Landmark. Some classrooms and the administrative offices are inside of the building. Shadow Lawn was named to the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1978. It was named a National Historic Landmark on February 4, 1985. Shadow Lawn has also been a host of the film version of Annie,History of Wilson Hall, Monmouth University starring Aileen Quinn. Some of the scenes in this movie were filmed inside and outside of the building along with the rest of the Monmouth University campus. Shadow Lawn was used as Daddy Warbucks' mansion. Following Monmouth's acquisition of the estate, Shadow Lawn was renamed Woodrow Wilson Hall after United States President Woodrow Wilson, who stayed in the original mansion during his campaign in summer of 1916. The current mansion was renamed to Great Hall in 2020, with the university citing racist policies of Wilson for the change. =Murry and Leonie Guggenheim Memorial Library= Guggenheim Library In 1903, Murry Guggenheim (1858‚Äì1939), son of Meyer Guggenheim, bought property in West Long Branch to build a summer residence for himself and his wife, Leonie. The original structure of the Beaux-Arts mansion, designed by Carr√®re and Hastings is now the Murry and Leonie Guggenheim wing of the Monmouth University Library. It was also added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1978. =Lauren K. Woods Theater= Lauren K. Woods Theatre The Guggenheim estate also included a stable and carriage house across the road on Cedar Avenue. This has been converted into the Lauren K. Woods Theatre.

Leahy Academics Monmouth University's placement on the U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges Ranking increased during the 2010s, moving from 76 in 2005 to 37 in 2012 and 30 in 2013 among regional universities in the Northern United States. By 2018, Monmouth ranked at 28 among northern regional universities, its highest spot at the time from U.S. News & World Report. The ranking also made Monmouth the highest private regional university in New Jersey and the state's second-highest regional university behind The College of New Jersey. Despite moving up in the U.S. News & World Report ranking, however, Monmouth University has not appeared on Forbes Magazine's List of America's Best Colleges. Mark Blackmon, the director of News and Public Affairs at Monmouth, attributed the school's omission in 2016 to Forbes relying \\"on some information that can be highly subjective\\", with schools \\"[losing] points for awarding grants and scholarships\\". In response to Forbes allegedly lowering a school's ranking for providing financial support, Blackmon commented that, \\"We are actually quite proud that we can assist so many students in getting an education\\", and concluded, \\"Even though Monmouth failed to make the Forbes list, I think that it doesn't reflect the quality of its teachers and the type of school that Monmouth is. I think it should have definitely made it.\\" Monmouth University has held multiple academic symposia on the work of Bruce Springsteen and houses the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music.https://www.monmouth.edu/springsteen-archives-and- center-for-american-music/ Student life =Activities= Monmouth University has a variety of on-campus clubs and organizations, including the campus television station HawkTV; the college radio station WMCX-FM, one of the last media outlets to interview Bob Marley and the first media outlet in America to announce his death; and the student-run newspaper The Outlook, which has been published since 1933. The Department of Art and Design is an active participant in the arts of Monmouth. It maintains multiple galleries for exhibiting creative works of students, faculty, and staff, as well as practicing artists and designers. Monmouth University also has its own independent, student run record label, Blue Hawk Records. The music organization allows students to learn hands-on, gaining relevant experience and encountering situations that would occur in the Music Industry. Blue Hawk Records allows students to work together, alongside experienced industry professionals, to build their skills in talent scouting, artist promotion and development, live music and record releases, artwork, packaging, sales, marketing, further learning the structure of business and how to mold artists into marketable material. =Greek life= Fraternities * Tau Delta Phi (Delta Tau Chapter) *Delta Tau Delta (Kappa Gamma chapter) * Phi Kappa Psi (New Jersey Beta chapter) * Sigma Pi (Delta Beta chapter) * Sigma Tau Gamma (Epsilon Omicron chapter) * Lambda Theta Phi (Pi Chapter) Sororities * Alpha Kappa Alpha (Tau Eta chapter) * Alpha Omicron Pi (Iota Theta chapter) * Alpha Sigma Tau (Beta Omega chapter) * Alpha Xi Delta (Iota Nu chapter) * Chi Upsilon Sigma (Gamma Beta chapter) * Delta Phi Epsilon (Delta Omega chapter) * Lambda Theta Alpha (Tau Chapter) * Phi Sigma Sigma (Delta Phi chapter) * Zeta Tau Alpha (Kappa Nu chapter) =Student residences= * Beechwood Hall * Cedar Hall * University Bluffs * Elmwood Hall * Garden Apartments * Great Lawn Apartments * Laurel Hall * Maplewood Hall * Mullaney Hall * Hesse Hall * Oakwood Hall * Pier Village * Pinewood Hall * Redwood Hall * Spruce Hall * Willow Hall =Food services= * C-Store * Java City at Bey Hall * Library Cafe * Magill Commons * Rebecca Stafford Student Center * Shadow's (formerly \\"The Underground\\") * Jersey Mike's Subs Athletics Monmouth's athletic teams are known as the Hawks. The school competes as a Division I (NCAA) school in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, with football competing as a FCS independent in the 2013 season before joining the Big South Conference in 2014. Monmouth fields the following sports at the Division I level: baseball, basketball (men's and women's), bowling (women's) cross country (men's and women's), field hockey, football, golf (men's and women's), indoor track (men's and women's), lacrosse (women's and men's), soccer (men's and women's), softball, tennis (men's and women's), and track & field (men's and women's). In the fall of 2014, Monmouth announced the reintroduction of swimming programs (women's and men's) at the Division I level in the fall of 2015. Monmouth University (then still Monmouth College), added football to the school's ledger of sports teams in 1993. The team's first game was played on September 25 of that year. The first points in school history were scored on a bizarre defensive play by intercepting and returning a two-point conversion. A new multipurpose activity center opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 16, 2009. The Center currently serves as the primary indoor athletic structure. A partnership agreement with OceanFirst Bank named the facility as the OceanFirst Bank Center in June, 2016. It houses a 4,100 seat competition arena; a 200-meter; six-lane indoor track; locker rooms; educational and conference space; ground-level bookstore; and fitness center. The new facility adjoins the William T. Boylan Gymnasium a 2,500-seat arena built in 1965. Monmouth has been in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2006. Monmouth won their first NCAA men's basketball tournament game in 2006 when they beat Hampton University in that year's play- in game. It was the first time a Northeast Conference school won a game in the NCAA tournament since 1983 when Robert Morris University won in the opening round. Monmouth's men and women's soccer teams as well as baseball, women's lacrosse, men‚Äôs tennis and men's golf team have also reached the NCAA tournament. The men's lacrosse team made the 2016 NCAA playoff tournament as well. The Monmouth Men's Soccer team is the only sport on campus to ever advance to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament. The men's soccer team also hosted three first round NCAA Tournament games on The Great Lawn, in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Monmouth's men's soccer team has even been ranked as one of the top teams in the country. In September 2010, Monmouth attained the #4 spot on the NSCAA/HendrickCars.com National Rankings and has been ranked in the national top 25 every single week for the past two seasons.

Eden is located in Erie County, New York, and has some of the most fertile and well-drained soils in New York State, allowing farmers to grow over of corn annually, and produce more early corn than anyone else in upstate New York.  History  In 1959, the Eden Chamber of Commerce discussed the idea of holding an annual festival to promote the town. The resulting Garden Festival was held that year, but did not become an annual event. In 1962, the town had a very successful 150th Sesquicentennial celebration. Following the celebration, a man named John Munich brought up the idea to the Chamber of Commerce of a yearly corn festival aimed to make the town money and gain publicity. After further talk and planning, the Chamber President proposed the sweet corn festival in May, 1963, and the Eden Corn Festival was born. The dates were set for Saturday, August 15 and Sunday, August 16, due to this being the time of year that Eden's sweet corn would be most tender. Various committees were set up, and decisions had to be made regarding how big the festival should be, how much money would be required to finance it, and how the money could be raised, since the treasury balance at the time amounted to a mere few hundred dollars. The festival would be held on the grounds of the Newell Faulkner Post of the American Legion on Legion Drive and Route 62, and the committees received help from the American Legion and the Eden School District, who allowed the use of the parking lots on the school grounds and use of their athletic fields. The first corn festival was successful, featuring a carnival, corn judging and auction, a corn queen beauty contest, pet show, tug-of-war, and a parade. Corn was sold for 10 cents an ear, and had to be picked in the dark to keep up with the demand for the 6,000 ears sold. Swimming events, lacrosse and baseball games, square dancing, and a concert provided additional entertainment. It was decided that the Eden Corn Festival would become an annual event, and it has been held every year since 1964.Meyer, Dorothea Hickman. Town of Eden Historian. 2759 East Church Street, Eden, New York  Years following  Early on, the festival was a local event. The concessionaires were local, and Zabel Amusements from Derby provided the rides. In 1966, it was decided to enlarge the festival by having a bigger parade with more prizes. The attendance that year reached 2,500, and eventually, the parade drew marching units and groups from all over the United States and Canada. A man named Bill Edwards became the Chairman of the Eden Corn Festival in 1974, an since then, it has become a four-day event. On August 2, 1978, a Guinness Book World Record category for the most ears of corn eaten in five minutes was established, when Luis Pirada of Eden devoured 18 ears. Attendance this year reached 75,000, and by 1980, the project outgrew the Chamber's capabilities and they turned sponsorship over to the newly formed Eden Corn Festival, Inc., which consisted of members from various organizations in the town. Over the years, the physical ground of the festival was expanded, and by 1988 the Eden Volunteer Fire Department, which to this day sponsors the corn and french fry booths, was selling 45,000 ears of corn. By 1993, the parade had become too big and expensive and was almost canceled. The budget was reduced to $2,000‚Äì$3,000, when the cost of the 29th parade a year before had been $96,000. It was decided to scale down from the New York/Pennsylvania Parade and Judging Association's Championship that was filled with bands and floats from all over the Northeast to groups from Eden and Western New York. During this time, a craft show, car show, and talent show were added, along with more rides. The 30th annual corn festival of 1993 had 105,000 in attendance, and has averaged 200,000 people or more ever since. To this day, the Eden Corn Festival is held Thursday through Sunday during the first weekend in August, and inarguably remains the highlight of the year for the town's small population.  2018 Board of Directors  *Jeff Winter, President, Amusements Chairman and Media Contact *Keith Gannon, 1st Vice President and Concessions Chairman *Rich Ventry, 2nd Vice President, Parking Chairman and Go Green Chairman *Linda Prell, Secretary and Trade Show Chairman *Gary Eye, Financial Advisor *Sallie Bigelow, Advertising Chairperson, Marketing Chairperson and Information Technology Chairperson *Mike Dau, Grounds Chairman *Dale Hess, Tractor Pull Chairman and Assistant to Concession Manager *Kris Scheetz, Craft Show Chairman and Entertainment Chairman *Vince LaGreca *Bill Clark  References  External links * Festivals in New York (state) Tourist attractions in Erie County, New York ","title":"Eden Corn Festival"},{"id":"295222","text":"Ernest Aldrich Simpson (6 May 1897 ‚Äì 30 November 1958) was an American-born British shipbroker, best known as the second husband of Wallis Simpson, later wife of the former King Edward VIII.

Casta painting from colonial Peru, 1770. Casta painting showing 16 hierarchically arranged, mixed-race groupings. The top left grouping uses cholo as a synonym for mestizo. Ignacio Maria Barreda, 1777. Real Academia Espa√±ola de la Lengua, Madrid. Cholo () is a loosely defined Spanish term that has had various meanings. Its origin is a somewhat derogatory term for people of mixed-blood heritage in the Spanish Empire in Latin America and its successor states as part of castas, the informal ranking of society by heritage. Cholo no longer necessarily refers only to ethnic heritage, and is not always meant negatively. Cholo can signify anything from its original sense as a person with one Amerindian parent and one Mestizo parent, \\"gangster\\" in Mexico, an insult in some South American countries (similar to chulo in Spain), or a \\"person who dresses in the manner of a certain subculture\\" in the United States as part of the cholo subculture. Historical usage The term's use is first recorded in a Peruvian book published in 1609 and 1616, the Comentarios Reales de los Incas by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega. He writes (in Spanish) \\"The child of a Black male and an Indian female, or of an Indian male and Black female, they call mulato and mulata. The children of these they call cholos. Cholo is a word from the Windward Islands; it means dog, not of the purebred variety, but of very disreputable origin; and the Spaniards use it for insult and vituperation\\". In Ecuador, mestizas wearing indigenous attire in Ecuador were termed cholas. \\"Chola appears to have been a designation largely reserved for women and which, according to Jacques Poloni-Simard, was used to indicate mestiza women who had achieved an incipient degree of hispanization that was beyond the grasp of men, who were more firmly bound to their native communities by tribute obligations.\\"Rappaport, Joanne.

Under the casta designations of colonial Mexico, the term rarely appears; however, an eighteenth-century casta painting by Ignacio Mar√≠a Barreda shows the grouping Espa√±ol, India, with their offspring a Mestizo or CholoGarc√≠a S√°iz, Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n. Las castas mexicanas. Milan: Olivetti 1989, pp. 140-41. Cholo as an English-language term dates at least to 1851 when it was used by Herman Melville in his novel Moby-Dick, referring to a Spanish speaking sailor, possibly derived from the Windward Islands reference mentioned above. Isela Alexsandra Garcia of the University of California at Berkeley writes that the term can be traced to Mexico, where in the early part of the last century it referred to \\"culturally marginal\\" mestizos and Native American origin. During the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1883) Peruvians were contemptuously referred to as \\"cholos\\" by Chilean officers. An article in the Los Angeles Express of April 2, 1907, headlined \\"Cleaning Up the Filthy Cholo Courts Has Begun in Earnest\\", uses the terms cholos and Mexicans interchangeably.Author unknown. \\"Cleaning Up the Filthy Cholo Courts Has Begun in Earnest\\" , Los Angeles Express, April 2, 1907. The term cholo courts was defined in The Journal of San Diego History as \\"sometimes little more than instant slums as shanties were strewn almost randomly around city lots in order to create cheap horizontal tenements.\\"Curtis, James R. and Ford, Larry. \\"Bungalow Courts in San Diego: Monitoring a Sense of Place\\". The Journal of San Diego History. Spring 1988, Volume 34, Modern usage =United States= Cholos, cholas and cholitas are used as informal slang terms in parts of the US, to refer to people of Mexican descent, who usually are low-income, \\"tough\\", and may wear stereotypical clothes. The origin is complex: > Racial and cultural status, along with social class are reflected in the > term cholo itself, which was adopted in California in the 1960s by youth > following the pachuco tradition, as a label for that identity (Cuellar > 1982). In 1571, Fray Alonso de Molina, in his Nahuatl vocabulary > (Vocabulario en Lengua Castellana y Mexicana Y Mexicana y Castellana), > defined the word xolo as slave, servant, or waiter. The Porr√∫a Dictionary > defines cholo, as used in the Americas, as a civilized Native American or a > half-breed or mestizo of a European father and Native American mother. The > word has historically been used along the borderland as a derogatory term to > mean lower class Mexican migrants, and in the rest of Latin America to mean > an acculturating Indian or peasant. Despite, or because of, its long history of denigrating semantics, the term Cholo was turned on its head and used as a symbol of pride in the context of the ethnic power movements of the 1960s.  Criminalization  Chicano/a youth who adopt a cholo or chola culture endure hyper-criminalization, since police and institutions equate cholo style with a criminal style. Educational institutions and the police \\"translate cholo as 'gang member'.\\" While older residents in barrios initially embraced cholas and cholos as \\"a larger subculture not necessarily associated with crime and violence (but rather with a youthful temporary identity), law enforcement agents, ignorant or disdainful of barrio life, labeled youth who wore clean white tennis shoes, shaved their heads, or long socks, as deviant.\\" Convinced by the police and schools of cholo/a criminality, some community members shamed and policed cholos and cholas, \\"reminiscent of the criminalization of Chicana and Chicano youth during the Zoot-Suit era in the 1940s.\\" Sociologist Jos√© S. Plascencia- Castillo refers to the barrio as a panopticon‚Äìa space which leads to intense self-regulation‚Äìas cholo/a youth are scrutinized by police to \\"stay in their side of town\\" and by the community who sometimes \\"call the police to have the youngsters removed from the premises.\\" The intense governance of cholo/a identity has deep implications on youth experience, sometimes affecting their physical and mental health as well as their outlook on the future. Some cholo/a youth feel they \\"can either comply with the demands of authority figures, and become obedient and compliant, and suffer the accompanying loss of identity and self-esteem, or adopt a resistant stance and contest social invisibility to command respect in the public sphere.\\" Fashion stereotypes A teddy bear dressed as a cholo During the 1930s and 1940s, Cholos and Chicanos were known as pachucos and were associated with the zoot suit and hep cat subcultures.LA Almanac The press at the time accused the pachucos in the U.S. of gang membership and petty criminality, leading to the Zoot Suit Riots.Zoot suit riots media Continuing until the early 1970s, the typical Cholo and Chicano hairstyle was a variant of the pompadour, piled high on the head and kept in place with large quantities of wet look gel.Danny Trejo wearing a snapback with long hairIn the 21st century, a cholo is stereotypically male, depicted as wearing loose fitting khaki pants or shorts, with white knee-high socks, creased jeans, white tank top undershirt, and button-front shirts, commonly plaid and flannel, often with just the top button buttoned. Cholos in the 1990s and 2000s frequently have their hair buzzed very short, though some continue to have the more traditional slicked- back hair, sometimes held in place by a hairnet or a bandana. Footwear originally included Stacy Adams dress shoes, and \\"biscuits\\" (pointy toed dress shoes). Modern cholos tend to wear athletic shoes, such as Converse, Nike Cortez, Nike Air Force 1, Vans, Fila, Adidas Stan Smith, Onitsuka Tiger slip- on house shoes, K Swiss or Huarache sandals. Popular \\"Cholo\\" brands include Dickies, Ben Davis, Joker, Lowrider, and Bighouse. Some cholos, particularly older cholos (veteranos) or cholos wishing to adopt a more traditional look, wear formal wear inspired by zoot suit fashion, including dress shirts with suspenders, and fedora hats, but may still retain cholo elements such as a bandana or hair net. In South Texas, cholos are sometimes referred to as chucs or chukes. This term is short for pachucos. Tejano cholos typically make heavy use of starch on their pants but so do traditional Tejanos. This designation may also be associated with black ink tattoos, commonly involving calligraphy and art. A cholo might also stereotypically own a lowrider. Another staple of cholo fashion is long hair tied into braids as depicted by actor Danny Trejo. =Bolivia= cuencana In Bolivia, \\"cholo\\" refers to people with various degrees of Amerindian racial ancestry. In Bolivia, the term \\"cholita\\" has overcome former prejudice and discrimination, and cholitas are now seen as fashion icons. A \\"cholo\\" in Bolivia is a campesino who moved to the city, and though the term was originally derogatory, has become more of a symbol of indigenous power. The word \\"cholo/a\\" is considered a common and/or official enough term in Bolivia such that \\"cholo\\" has been included as its own ethnic group option in demographic surveys conducted in the country. In these same surveys, the term had on occasion been used interchangeably with the term \\"mestizo.\\" Nevertheless, some locals still use cholo as a derogatory term. =Ecuador= Cholos pescadores are a group of traditional fishermen along the coasts of Ecuador. =Peru= In Peru, Mestizos with greater Amerindian contributions (Indo-mestizo), are 27.7%: Those that would be in the range of 75% to 60% of Amerindian contributions, characterized by presenting a tonality of tan, brown, and brunette skin with major features of Amerindian ethnic groups. They are mostly descendants of Quechua peoples at around 23.7%; of other ethnic groups originating from the coast in 2%; of the Aymaras by 1.5%; of native ethnic groups of the jungle at 0.5%. Of the total of this sub-group around half are in the mountains, an important part of this segment due to migration are on the coast, preferably in Lima, major urban centers and finally around a quarter (1/4 ) in the jungle, they could also be called as Indo-mestizos or the so-called \\"Peruvian cholo\\". =Mexico= The cholo gangs started from the U.S. in the mid to late 1970s. Cholo groups in Mexico were well established at least by the mid 1970s along the US-Mexico border, and in Central Mexico. These were called by various names, such as ‚Äúbarrios,‚Äù ‚Äúclickas‚Äù and ‚Äúgangas.\\" They were typically seen as American Hispanics and not as Mexicans because of their dress and appearance, which has never been traditional to Mexico. Many of these groups were formed by youths who had spent time in the United States and who returned with a different identity picked up in U.S. street life. Most cholos are youths between 13 and 25 years old who generally do not finish school beyond the eighth grade. These groups mimic the organization of gangs found in the United States, especially California, Texas and Chicago. Cholos have their own style of dress and speech. They are known for hand signals, tattoos and graffiti. Groups of cholos control various territories in the city. Most of the violence among these groups is over territory. Well established Latino gangs from the United States (Such as Norte√±os, Sure√±os, Latin Kings, 18th Street Gang and MS-13) have made a strong presence in Mexico through making alliances with local drug cartels based on particular regions or cities.

It is part of New Jersey's public system of higher education. It is named for Richard Stockton, one of the New Jersey signers of the Declaration of Independence. Founded in 1969, Stockton accepted its charter class in 1971. At its opening in 1971, classes were held at the Mayflower Hotel in Atlantic City; the campus in Galloway Township began operating late in 1971. Nearly 10,000 students are enrolled at Stockton and it is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.Stockton University Accreditation, Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Accessed April 8, 2008. History In November 1968, New Jersey approved a $202.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) capital construction bond issue with an earmarked $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ) designated for the construction of a new state college in Southern New Jersey. In 1969, a tract was selected for the campus in the heart of the Pine Barrens in Galloway Township. The trustees originally named the school \\"South Jersey State College\\", but they later renamed it to \\"Stockton State College\\", in order to avoid confusion with Rutgers College of South Jersey. In 1970, as construction began to run behind schedule, the trustees realized they needed an alternative location for the first class in 1971. They selected the historic Mayflower Hotel in Atlantic City as the temporary campus. Classes began on schedule with the commencement of the first academic year in September 1971. The college took shape as 1,000 students (50 of whom were Educational Opportunity Fund students), 97 staff, and 60 full-time faculty took over the former resort hotel. By December 1971, occupancy of the first phase of the new campus construction took place, with the transfer of classes and offices to Galloway Township during the winter holiday period. Accreditation of Stockton State College by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools was first granted in December 1975. In July 1991, the college was re-accredited unconditionally for another 10 years by the Middle States Association Commission on Higher Education, and Middle States accreditation was reaffirmed most recently in 2012. In 1978 the US Congress passed legislation creating the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, the first such designation in the nation, to protect the area's ecology and aquifer, which serves the large metropolitan region. In 1988, the United Nations designated it an International Biosphere Reserve, in recognition of its importance. Stockton continued to grow rapidly. Housing II opened in November 1981. With the opening of the N-Wing College Center & Housing III in February 1983, Stockton State College achieved a high student- residency rate among New Jersey state colleges. In 1993, the college's name was changed to the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. Rochelle Hendricks, New Jersey Secretary of Higher Education, approved Stockton's petition to become a university on February 13, 2015. On February 18, 2015, Stockton's Board of Trustees voted to change the former college's seal to reflect the new name, Stockton University. The Executive Committee of the New Jersey Presidents Council, which represents the presidents of the state's public, private and community colleges and universities that receive state aid, had also voted for the change. In February 2015, the college was awarded University status and was officially renamed Stockton University on February 18, 2015. =Presidents= Richard E. Bjork, (1969‚Äì1979) Bjork led the College as it graduated its first classes, expanded programs and achieved accreditation in 1975, the year it completed Phase II of the campus.

Stockton University Atlantic City opened fall 2018 with more than 500 residential students and more than 1,800 students taking courses in the new Academic Center, built on the former site of Atlantic City High School. The project is a public-private partnership with Atlantic City Development Corp., or AC Devco, a non-profit modeled on New Brunswick Development Corp., which expanded Rutgers' New Brunswick campus. The project includes a parking garage topped by new offices for South Jersey Gas, with 879 parking spaces for use by the university, South Jersey Gas and the public; and an academic building that can accommodate up to 1,800 students. In Atlantic City, the university operates the Dante Hall Theater and the Carnegie Library Center. Funding sources for the Atlantic City campus include $50.4 million in bonds from the Atlantic County Improvement Authority from proceeds of almost $70 million in tax credits issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority; $17 million from the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA); state bond funds for higher education construction; and $18 million from Stockton. In December 2014, Stockton had purchased the shuttered Showboat Atlantic City hotel and casino for $18 million, with plans to develop a full-service residential campus awarding undergraduate and graduate degrees and other professional training programs. The former resort, dubbed the \\"Island Campus\\", would have been converted casino and employee spaces into classrooms, cafeteria space and offices for faculty and staff. Several floors of hotel rooms would be renovated into student housing, while the remaining rooms would be operated as a hotel. The House of Blues would be modified to house the school's performing arts programs. Soon after, it was publicly disclosed that Trump Entertainment Resorts held a covenant to the property, preventing the site from being used as anything other than a casino. It was through this covenant that Trump Entertainment Resorts prevented Stockton's plans to open an Atlantic City campus on the Showboat property. President Saatkamp came under fire for making the purchase despite knowing about the covenant. The university reached a deal to lease the property from investor Glenn Straub, who planned to purchase the Showboat. Straub later sued the university to prevent Stockton from backing out of the deal. Stockton sold the Showboat property to Bart Blatstein in January 2016.  Academics  Stockton's academic programs provide opportunities for study in fields including Criminal Justice, Psychology, Environmental Science, Biology, Business, Historical Studies, and Literature. Additionally, courses are offered in emerging fields such as Computational Science, Tourism and Hospitality Management, and Homeland Security. Stockton also offers a Doctor of Physical Therapy program. The Division of Continuing Studies in the School of Graduate and Continuing Studies provides credit- bearing and non-credit certificate programs, CE approved continuing professional education for health sciences, human services and business professionals, and a growing number and variety of community education offerings.

Green initiatives Stockton is an environmentally friendly campus featuring a geothermal heat pump, fuel cells, and photovoltaic panels. In 2002, Stockton installed a 200 kW fuel cell at an initial cost of $1.3 million. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities provided a grant to cover most of the cost of the unit, with Stockton paying only $305,000. South Jersey Industries (SJI) also provided a rebate of $710,000 for the unit. The fuel cell provides just under 10% of the total energy for the campus; Stockton has the lowest energy cost per student among universities in New Jersey. Stockton achieved national LEED certification for its new sustainable design. In 2006, the F-Wing expansion, including classrooms, offices and an atrium received the prestigious LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Stockton's commitment to environmentally responsible design has resulted in \\"green\\" initiatives that have both saved energy and decreased greenhouse gas emissions. These include the development on campus of one of the largest geothermal heating and cooling systems in the world.Chrisopherson E.G. (2009). \\"Green Builders\\". Documentary, PBS & NJN Public Television. The geothermal systems incorporate seasonal thermal energy storage so that waste heat or winter cold can be collected when seasonally available and stored for use in the opposing seasons. A borehole thermal energy storage system (BTES) was installed in 1994 and is used for heating the older half of campus, with waste heat collected from air conditioning equipment there.Stiles L. (1998). \\"Underground Thermal Energy Storage in the US\\" . IEA Heat Pump Centre Newsletter 16:2 pp. 22‚Äì23. In 1995 a fuel cell and photovoltaic panels were installed buildings to generate energy. An aquifer thermal energy storage system (ATES), the first of its kind in the United States, began operation in 2008.Paksoy H., Snijders A., Stiles L. (2009). \\"Aquifer Thermal Energy Cold Storage System at Richard Stockton College\\" . Effstock Conference ‚Äì Thermal Energy Storage for Efficiency and Sustainability (11th International Conf.). The ATES system reduces the amount of energy used to cool Stockton's newer buildings by storing the chill of winter air in the water and rock of an underground aquifer, and withdrawing it in the summer for cooling. (Because building insulation standards have changed over time, the older buildings have a higher heating than cooling need, and the opposite is true for the newer buildings.) In 2008, Stockton approved an agreement with Marina Energy LLC for the installation of solar panels on The Big Blue athletic center roof to generate electricity. Marina Energy is a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries. Stockton paid nothing for the equipment and signed a 10-year agreement to buy the generated power. In 2009 the job was completed. As part of the capital plan, Housing V was built in 2009 to accommodate the rising demand for student housing. It incorporates geothermal heating and cooling using closed-loop technology, for a total of 450 tons cooling capacity. To eliminate the possibility of groundwater contamination in the event of a leak, freeze protection is provided in the circulating fluid. The design accommodates future solar thermal heating systems. Sustainable design includes landscaping: upper-story deciduous trees were planted along the south-facing facades of the residence halls to provide shade during the summer months, but allow the warmth of the sun to reach the buildings during the winter. This design received the \\"Green Project of Distinction\\" award from Education Design Showcase. Stockton's next green project was the largest single building project in its history. Designed and built according to the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED Gold Standard in sustainable design, the new Campus Center, completed in 2011, provides of space for dining, bookstore, pool, theater, lounges and offices. It will use 25% less energy than standard construction, and 40% less water. Other features include low-emitting adhesives, sealants, paints and coatings. Additional \\"green\\" features of the building include a storm water-collection system to irrigate an on-site \\"rain garden\\" landscaped with indigenous and adapted plant species. It also has a sophisticated energy management system for heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting.

These customized vehicles are generally individually painted with intricate, colorful designs, rolling on wire-spoke wheels with whitewall tires. Lowrider rims range from 13\\". They are also fitted with hydraulic or air bag systems that allow height adjustable suspension, where the vehicle is raised or lowered at the owner's command. Given these specific characteristics, while a lowrider is always a lowered car, a lowered car is not always a lowrider. The term is used to describe a class of vehicle, not simply the height from ground to chassis. The term lowrider can also refer to the driver of the car. Origin and Purpose Lowrider car culture began in Los Angeles, California in the mid-to-late 1940s and during the post-war prosperity of the 1950s. Initially, some Mexican- American youths lowered blocks, cut spring coils, z‚Äôed the frames and dropped spindles. The aim of the lowriders is to cruise as slowly as possible, \\"Low and Slow\\" being their motto. By redesigning these cars in ways that go against their intended purposes and in painting their cars so that they reflect and hold meanings from Mexican culture, lowriders create cultural and political statements that go against the more prevalent Anglo culture. However, this resulted in a backlash: the enactment of Section 24008 of the California Vehicle Code on January 1, 1958, which made it illegal to operate any car modified so that any part was lower than the bottoms of its wheel rims. Adding height adjustable suspension In 1959, a customizer named Ron Aguirre developed a way of bypassing the law with the use of hydraulic Pesco pumps and valves that allowed him to change ride height at the flick of a switch. Role of Chevrolet Impala The preceding year, 1958 saw the emergence of the Chevrolet Impala, which featured an X-shaped frame that was perfectly suited for lowering and modification with hydraulics. On this car, the standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated \\"X.\\" Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional perimeter frame construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis, the body structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall. This frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash, as a traditional perimeter frame. Culture Between 1960 and 1975, customizers adapted and refined GM X-frames, hydraulics, and airbrushing techniques to create the modern lowrider style. At first, lowriders were only seen in places like Los Angeles, especially in the 1970s on Whittier Boulevard when lowriding came to its peak. Whittier was a wide commercial street that cut through the barrio of the city in Los Angeles, California. On Saturday nights, young Mexican Americans went cruising along Whittier in their lowriders. Expanded Audience in U.S. In the 1990s, lowriders became strongly associated with West Coast Hip hop and G-Funk culture. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Game, Warren G, South Central Cartel, Eazy-E and Above the Law among others featured lowriders prominently in their music videos. Today, the lowriding scene is diverse with many different participating cultures, vehicle makes, and visual styles. Lowriders today can be seen all over the country, but recently they have been spreading to other places around the world as well. Expanded Audience in Japan Lowriding culture has also spread to Japan.DELGADILLO , NATALIE. ‚ÄúMeet the Chicanos of Japan.‚Äù Google, Google, 2 Feb. 2017, www.google.com/amp/s/www.citylab.com/amp/article/515388/.Lowrider History; convictedartist.com; retrieved on 2010-11-25. With the exposure of Chicano culture in Japan, the lowrider community began to grow in Japan as locals became interested in the car culture. Lowrider Japan is a magazine that was created in the '80s and sold in Japan thanks to the increased interest of lowriders in Japan. Junichi Shimodaira was known to be the grandfather of the lowriders in Japan since he was one of the first importers of these cars. Shimordaira continues to import and sell these cars through his business, Paradise Road. The spread of lowrider culture and the fame of Paradise Road even raised the attention of Ed Roth, who is famous for creating custom cars such as hot rods and a prominent figure in Kustom Kulture. Since the introduction of lowriders in Japan and the rise of lowriders in Japan in 2001, it is estimated that there are still 200 car clubs that are related to the lowrider scene that are still active to this day.

Unlike most electoral systems, it requires that only negative measures or choices be presented to the voter or representative. If used to select candidates for an office, or for continuation to a next round of voting or play, it is either single- or multi-winner, as everyone who is not disapproved of is in effect a winner, for that round. A referendum or a recall election may be said to be minimal forms of disapproval voting. However, usually only one measure or candidate is presented to be disapproved of. True disapproval voting would require more than two choices or representatives, and would ask voters to disavow one or more. Voting against There are a variety of interpretations of the meaning of a negative vote. The term is sometimes used for allowing a voter to reject the entire field of candidates; it can also mean that the only option offered voters is to vote against one or more candidates, but it is sometimes used for systems that allow a voter to choose whether to vote for or against a candidate. The psychology of vetoing, protesting, excluding individuals or options, or removing an incumbent, triggers a very different cognitive bias and mode of risk aversion on the part of voters, legislators, or board members - thus it is an over-simplification to think of disapproval as simply 'negative approval'. Similar asymmetries apply in economics, where they are studied in behavioral finance, and in social sciences and ethics, as the expression of tolerances versus preferences, e.g. as in opinion polls. The well-known lifeboat game is often portrayed in fiction as having a disapproval voting form, with the poor individual who is most disapproved of being tossed overboard. General-purpose methods of disapproval voting, e.g. for use in general elections as an electoral reform, have been proposed and discussed by political scientists, but there is little literature on the subject. Most discussion of the issue is concentrated in the theory of consensus decision making, where small numbers of members disapproving of a measure have disproportionate power to block it. Also, there has been an explosion of application of disapproval voting electoral systems in the reality game show, as noted below. Most people are familiar with the concept only from these shows. Disapproval expression in other electoral systems Russia and several other countries of the region allow voters to vote \\"against all\\" candidates. In Canada, one can appear at a polling station and decline the ballot; although this does not count as a vote, declined ballots are tallied separately from spoiled ballots and no- shows. Any electoral system permits some expression of disapproval, but these are necessarily confused with expressions of choice or approval, leading some to conclude that separating these expressions is best: After the U.S. presidential election, 2000, some commentators suggested that the ability to approve of a candidate, but disapprove of his or her party affiliation or elements of his or her platform, might be quite important, and that satisfaction of citizens with the political system might well depend on such an electoral reform. A group of members of the United States Green Party, calling itself \\"Greens for Gore\\", made explicit the fact that they were voting for Gore but supported not the platform of the Democratic Party which nominated him, but that of their own Green Party, which they called on Gore to implement. This is an example of disapproval voting on an informal level, where voters found a way to approve of the candidate, while disapproving of party and platform ‚Äì and of his key opponent, George W. Bush. The Soviet Union experimented with a form of disapproval voting for multi-winner elections in the 1980s, in which voters could cross off the names of candidates they did not approve of, and those with the greatest approval (above a 50% threshold) were elected. It is also often said that votes for a \\"protest candidate\\" or a \\"compromise candidate\\" can be viewed as disapproval votes, since the undesirable characteristics of the incumbent or alternative, respectively, can be said to be the voters' main concern. This of course is impossible to determine from the electoral results, as a vote intended to choose that candidate is indistinguishable in most systems from one that was intended to block or disapprove of another. Arguments for and against Given the prevalence of disapproval as a tool of government, including the criminal law and diplomatic relations, some see voting less as a positive and voluntary choice of a desirable outcome than as a way to reduce losses. Other advocates of disapproval voting argue that they simply wish to extend to the citizen the powers that are already ceded to the executive, in terms of structure, e.g. many voters formally disapproving should tell the president when to exercise the veto. This is one of many arguments made for deliberative democracy, and advocated by some in the US, e.g. Ralph Nader. Detractors of this view of civic life note that the complexity of widespread public consultation and letting the public vote down necessary but unpopular expenditures is contrary to the spirit of a representative democracy, and is an impractical and untrusting measure. In part this is a reaction to the negative view of politics, parties, and platforms inherent in any scheme of disapproval. Advocating disapproval or approval voting may be seen as taking a position on the tolerances versus preferences problem. Some propose that disapproval is more likely to trigger tolerance ideas of the voter, e.g. as in a poor woman choosing a lifetime mate, while approval is more likely to trigger preferences, e.g. as in shopping. This suggestion, like most advocacy of electoral systems, is controversial as it implies that voters cannot measure both tolerances and preferences for themselves, and come to conclusions that consider both. Another issue is that expressions of disapproval in many societies, especially in Asia, are taken as anti-social. In the government of China, which is structured more as a bureaucracy than as a democracy, an official who rises a level is ratified by others at the level he is entering ‚Äì no other candidates are presented but abstention as a protest is not uncommon. Support in this ratification vote of less than 67‚Äì80% is taken as a strong disapproval ‚Äì and most likely ends the rise of that individual at his current level. In any such structure, formal disapproval voting may lead to less honest outcomes, if the peer pressure not to be seen to formally disapprove of anyone is extreme. Popular use The best-known examples of the use of disapproval voting are on reality game shows, e.g. Survivor, The Weakest Link, where it is used to eliminate one contestant at a time from the contest, or the variation used on Boot Camp where the eliminated contestant can \\"take one (other) out with him\\". (Note: the examples given here are better examples of Coombs' method than disapproval voting as described here). No-confidence voting A particular case of disapproval voting is the motion of no confidence. This is a motion of a legislature ‚Äì rather than a vote of the electorate that elected it ‚Äì expressing that it disapproves of the current executive, or of certain members of the executive. In the Westminster system, the person or persons who lose a motion of no confidence are normally expected to resign as a matter of constitutional convention, and in the case of an executive a general election normally results, unless a replacement government (typically a new prime minister, who can subsequently appoint a new cabinet) can be approved in a motion of confidence. This process is formalized in the United Kingdom by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. No-confidence voting can only disapprove; it cannot be used to approve of any particular candidates. This decision is left to political discussions among those involved. The percentage which triggers a successful no-confidence vote can vary widely, from small values (like 20%) which allow minorities (particularly people with experience in the issue being voted) to decide the outcome, up to unanimity.

For over half a century the Theatre department at Rider University has had a rich tradition in educating students and preparing them for all aspects of a life in theater. Six productions each year give students a wide variety of experiences and opportunities. They are a combination of musicals and straight plays. A professionally active faculty whose backgrounds include directing and design experience nationwide; acting on Broadway, with national tours and regional theater companies, on film and screen, as well as commercial and voice-over work. Professional performing arts facilities include: The Yvonne Theater, The Spitz Studio Theater, Bart Luedeke Arts Center, Various guest artists have come to Rider to teach Master Classes including Lennie Daniels, Christine Ebersole, Heather Hurst, Adam Jacobs, Derek Klena, Norm Lewis, Kelli O'Hara, Laura Osnes, Rachelle Rak, Andy Richardson, Nikki Snelson, Ben Vereen, Frank Wildhorn, and Mary Zimmerman. Athletics Athletic teams are nicknamed the Broncs. The school competes in the NCAA Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. As the MAAC is a non-wrestling conference, Rider's wrestling team competes as a member of the Eastern Wrestling League. The intercollegiate sports program at Rider was started by coach Clair Bee in the 1920s. Two of the school's most famous athletic alumni are former Notre Dame basketball coach and current ESPN sportscaster Digger Phelps, who played basketball at Rider from 1959 to 1963, and Jason Thompson, who played basketball at Rider from 2004 to 2008 and was drafted by the Sacramento Kings with the 12th pick of the 2008 NBA Draft while never winning a MAAC championship or appearing in the NCAA Tournament. Prior to Thompson's years at Rider, Rider did appear in the NCAA Basketball (\\"March Madness\\") Tournament three times: first in 1984 against the University of Richmond, again in 1993 as a 16-seed losing to Kentucky 96‚Äì52, and 1994 as a 15-seed losing to Connecticut 64‚Äì49. The university competed in football until 1951, when the football team was disbanded. A common myth is that the NCAA asked the school to discontinue the football program after an investigation into allegations of paying recruits, as well as improper benefits for players on the team. However, according to the University, Rider chose to stop sponsoring a football team for financial reasons. Rider students often proclaim their football team \\"undefeated since 1951\\". The University has recently redesigned the sports logo.Caputo, Mike. \\"University plans to revamp Bronc logo\\", The Rider News, Rider University, 23 February 2007.

Formed in 1998, the band consisted of Jenny Lewis, Blake Sennett, Pierre de Reeder, and Dave Rock. The group released their debut album Take- Offs and Landings under Seattle-based independent label Barsuk Records in 2001. After that, they released three additional studio albums and several EPs. In 2007 they were signed with Warner Bros., and subsequently made their major-label debut with the album Under the Blacklight. History Rilo Kiley performed their first concert at Spaceland in Los Angeles in January 1998. Their debut EP, Rilo Kiley (later reissued as The Initial Friend EP) was released in 1999. The band signed with independent label Barsuk Records for its first full-length album, Take-Offs and Landings, in 2001. The band later signed with Omaha's Saddle Creek Records and released The Execution of All Things in 2002. In 2004, it released More Adventurous on its own imprint, Brute/Beaute Records, which was distributed by major label Warner Bros. Records. The band later signed directly with Warner Bros. 2004 saw a great increase in recognition for the band, as Sennett and Boesel released an album with their band The Elected and Lewis sang backup on The Postal Service's Give Up. Lewis toured with The Postal Service before heading out on two tours in support of Rilo Kiley's More Adventurous in the summer and fall of 2004. The album spent late 2004 high on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, and was promoted with appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The band opened for Bright Eyes on the international leg of Conor Oberst's tour for 2005's I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning and was the opening act for the North American dates of Coldplay's Twisted Logic Tour in Fall 2005. \\"I Never\\" and \\"Ripchord\\" (from More Adventurous) have been featured in several feature films, including Must Love Dogs, Conversations with Other Women, and John Tucker Must Die. The band's fourth album Under the Blacklight was released August 20, 2007 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States.Pitchfork: Rilo Kiley Reveal Blacklight Tracklist, U.S. Release Date Its first single is \\"The Moneymaker\\". For the video, the band cast \\"real-life porn stars\\", who Lewis says were told they were auditioning for \\"soft core porn\\". The second single is \\"Silver Lining\\". On September 6, 2007, the band began a North American tour in support of Under the Blacklight. On this tour, it was joined by Orenda Fink (of Azure Ray) and Kristin Gundred (of Grand Ole Party and Dum Dum Girls). The group was also known for its charitable contributions, particularly to the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund, in honor of the late singer and friend of the band. Sennett and Lewis participated in a memorial concert for the singer shortly after his death in 2003. In 2007, the band contributed a t-shirt, which was designed by de Reeder for the Yellow Bird Project to benefit the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund. =Hiatus and breakup= In a 2010 interview with Paste, Jason Boesel said the band was taking a break but working on a compilation of unreleased songs. He also said there were no plans to release a new album in the near future. In an April 2011 interview, Blake Sennett said, \\"I would say that if Rilo Kiley were ... hmmm ... a human being ... hmmm ... he's probably laying on his back in a morgue with a tag on his toe. Now, I see movies where the dead get up and walk. And when they do that, rarely do good things happen.\\" In June 2011, when asked about his \\"corpse\\" comment and whether Rilo Kiley was indeed dead, Sennett said \\"I never say never. I loved Rilo Kiley‚ÄîI loved writing with Jenny. I think she's a great artist and great to write with. I think we're not there yet. Maybe one day we'll dust it off and give it a go; I'd be open to it. I think it was fun‚Äîfor all of the pitfalls, it was great. I had a great time in Rilo Kiley. I always did.\\" A month later Sennett told AOL Spinner: \\"I said, 'Fuck that, I can't do this anymore.' That being said, it was probably immature and that came from a place of ego. I think that stuff will rear its head in anything you do, depending on the personnel you surround yourself with; things change overtime and people change and relationships change.\\" In February 2013, the band announced a collection of previously released rarities and unreleased material, titled Rkives, to be released in April 2013 on DeReeder's own label The Little Record Company. In a 2014 interview with the National Post, Jenny Lewis confirmed the band had officially broken up. In April of 2015, Blake Sennett joined Jenny Lewis and her band on stage at Coachella for a performance of Rilo Kiley song ‚ÄúPortions for Foxes.‚Äù Since embarking on a solo career, Jenny Lewis has enlisted the help of drummer Jason Boesel for percussion on studio recordings. He is also part of Lewis' live band for her 2019 tour. Television appearances 2004 live performance The band's songs have frequently been used on television programs, such as The O.C. and Dawson's Creek. The apparent first use of Rilo Kiley music on a television show was also the last time that Blake Sennett and Jenny Lewis acted on television. In 2000, they played fictionalized versions of themselves (and the band performed \\"The Frug\\") on ABC's short-lived drama Once & Again. Both \\"The Frug\\" and \\"85\\" were used during a third season episode of Dawson's Creek (#46, \\"Barefoot At Capefest\\"). \\"Pictures of Success\\" was used in episode No. 114 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, entitled \\"Older and Far Away\\". The song \\"Breakin' Up\\" was featured in a fourth season episode of Grey's Anatomy. In 2005, \\"Portions For Foxes\\" was used in the pilot of Grey's Anatomy and in 2009, the song was used in the seventh episode of season one of Dollhouse, \\"Echoes\\". \\"With Arms Outstretched\\" was used at the end of the pilot episode of Weeds in 2005 and to bring the show full circle, it was the final song played in the series finale in 2012. For a second-season episode of Weeds, Lewis sang the theme song (\\"Little Boxes\\") with Johnathan Rice who was touring with the band. \\"Silver Lining\\" was featured in the pilot of Women's Murder Club. The song was also used in the second season of Girls. \\"The Moneymaker\\" was used on an episode of Nip/Tuck that aired on December 11, 2007 and on an episode of Samantha Who? that aired on April 16, 2009. \\"The Good That Won't Come Out\\" was featured in the background of the Season 4 Episode 4 episode of Heroes \\"Hysterical Blindness\\" on 10/12/2009. Their song \\"A Better Son/Daughter\\" was featured in the trailer for the Netflix original series Orange is the New Black. It is also featured at the end of Hannah Gadsby's 2018 Netflix special Nanette. Rilo Kiley's song \\"The Execution Of All Things\\" also featured in Episode 4, Season 4 of Six Feet Under. Their song \\"Go Ahead\\" was featured throughout the movie, Very Good Girls.  Origin of the band's name  On the syndicated radio show Loveline in August 2005, Sennett explained that he had a dream in which he was being chased by a sports almanac: \\"when it got me, I leafed through it...and I came upon an Australian rules football player from the 19th century named Rilo Kiley. It's kind of embarrassing.\\" When asked by co-host Drew Pinsky if he had ever seen this name in reality, Sennett said, \\"I don't think so, I don't think that character exists...If you Google 'Rilo Kiley' you just come back with a lot of pictures of us.\\" On how this imaginary name became the name for the band: \\"I wrote it down on a blotter, an office desk when I woke up, and, I don't know, I came back to it when we were trying to think of a name and we thought we'd use that for one show then change it, 'cause who'd want that name? Who can remember that anyway?\\"http://www.whysanity.net/wikipedia/loveline_rilo_kiley.mp3 In 2005, Sennett told Planet Sound Teletext Magazine that the name came from a Scottish athlete. On a 2005 episode of the MSNBC entertainment show MSNBC Entertainment Hot List, the female host stated that the name came from \\"old Scottish sports almanacs\\". In the interview segment that followed, Sennett stated, \\"We just looked in there and the name of one of the star players from the turn of the century was Rilo Kiley.\\" In an interview published in Q magazine in September 2007, Sennett stated that Rilo Kiley is named after a character he'd met in a dream who had predicted the date of Jenny Lewis' death.

The model was originally rooted in 1930s behaviourism and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but big data analytics-based mass customisation has led to a modern revival of the basic idea. Concept The \\"Magic Bullet\\" or \\"Hypodermic Needle Theory\\" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by Nazi propaganda and the effects of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s.Communication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic- needle-theory-of-communication/ People were assumed to be \\"uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along\\".Lowery, Shearon (1995). Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects (en ingl√©s). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. . The \\"Magic Bullet\\" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the \\"media gun\\" into the viewer's \\"head\\".Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications. Similarly, the \\"Hypodermic Needle Model\\" uses the same idea of the \\"shooting\\" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1997). Media/society: industries, images, and audiences. Pine Forge Press. . This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a \\"sitting duck\\". Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.Davis, D.K. & Baron, S.J. (1981). A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing. It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets. The \\"magic bullet\\" and \\"hypodermic needle\\" models originate from Harold Lasswell's 1927 book, Propaganda Technique in the World War.Lasswell, H. (1927) \\"Propaganda Technique in the World War\\" Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacyLubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park & J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing. or even a \\"myth\\".Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331 Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon & L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. Two-step flow The phrasing \\"hypodermic needle\\" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people. The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of The War of the Worlds and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its American mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by Paul Lazarsfeld and Herta Herzog, that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as Hadley Cantril managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners. In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the \\"magic bullet\\" theory and \\"hypodermic needle model theory\\" through elections studies in \\"The People's Choice\\".Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign. Columbia University Press. Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded \\"helpless audiences\\", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them. Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the two-step flow of communicationcf. Two- step flow model in 1944. Elihu Katz contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.Katz, E., Lazarsfeld, P.F. (1955) ‚ÄòPersonal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‚Äò, The Free Press, New York. The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this opinion leadership. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others. Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even selective exposure play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses. Hastings House. . Contemporary one-step flow More recently, the use of big data analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a \\"one-step flow of communication\\", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.Bennett, W. L., & Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213‚Äì232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266 The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the mass customization of messages. So it is not one generic mass media message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, empirical studies have found that in Twitter networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80‚Äì90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., & Arriagada, E. (2016). One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests. Social Science Computer Review. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.Stansberry, K. (2012).

Expanding on their previous musical sound that mostly incorporated guitars, vocals, percussion and pianos, the album contains heavy electronica sampling mixed into the songs in a rather unusual and displaced-sounding way. Also, unlike their previous tracks which were written in very traditional manners, the lyrics to the songs on Execution are very wordy and read like prose. Musically, the record has a very sunny disposition, with bouncing bass lines and simple melodies complemented by lead singer Jenny Lewis's vocal style, but the upbeat music is generally counterpointed by the often dark and morose subject matter that the lyrics reference. The album was recorded at Saddle Creek Records in Omaha, Nebraska, and the aforementioned features show the influence of that studio's associated Omaha Sound. The album is also strung together by a song that is broken into pieces and that trails between several tracks. Called \\"And That's How I Choose to Remember It\\", it tells the story of Lewis' childhood and her parents' divorce. This theme is visited throughout the album, which is lyrically filled with childhood recollections of loss, displacement, anger and hopelessness. The songs \\"So Long\\" and \\"Three Hopeful Thoughts\\" feature lead vocals by Blake Sennett. Lewis sings lead on all other tracks. The song \\"With Arms Outstretched\\" played in the final moments of the series finale of Weeds, just as it had in the pilot. The song \\"A Better Son/Daughter\\" was played in the trailer for the first season of the Netflix original series Orange Is the New Black. It is also featured at the end of Hannah Gadsby's 2018 Netflix special Nanette. This album is the 47th release of Saddle Creek Records.

These caught the attention of local media outlets, and soon she received a number of offers for film roles, magazine interviews, and television show appearances. The main trademark of her celebrity persona is a pink Corvette. Her billboards have been featured in a number of movies and television series, including the opening credits of Moonlighting, and spoofed in shows such as The Simpsons, Futurama, and BoJack Horseman. In 1978, she joined her then- boyfriend's punk rock band Baby Blue which performed in clubs around Los Angeles but never became financially successful. In 1982 she released her self-titled debut album and her first posters began appearing as a part of the album's promotion. After the launch of a massive billboard campaign in February 1984, she began working on her second album. Driven to Fantasy was released in 1986. Angelyne then appeared in small parts in films such as Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), Dangerous Love (1988) and Homer and Eddie (1989). In 2003, Angelyne became a candidate in the California governor recall election, finishing 28th in a field of 135 candidates (garnering 2,536 votes). Her slogan during the campaign was \\"We've had Gray, we've had Brown, now it's time for some blond and pink.\\"Pool, Bob (June 20, 2007). \\"Angelyne seeks enhanced deal\\". Los Angeles Times.

She began painting in 1998 and has had several art shows in Los Angeles.Kreuzer, Nikki (April 9, 2013). \\"Angelyne- Pretty in Pink\\", The Los Angeles Beat. Retrieved September 23, 2014. Angelyne was also noted for concealing her true name, age and identity, which did not come to public knowledge until 2017.  Career  In 1978, Angelyne joined her then- boyfriend's band Baby Blue. They performed in local clubs in L.A. and once opened along with Rubber City Rebels for The Screamers' show at the Whisky a Go Go.\\"The Screamers Chronology And History.\\" The punk rock club The Masque served as a rehearsal place for the band. In 1978 they released a single \\"Rock n' Roll Rebel\\" with a b-side \\"Fantasy Man\\". Only 1000 copies of the record were made and distributed in England.Kreuzer, Nikki. \\"Angelyne- Pretty in Pink\\", The Los Angeles Beat, April 9, 2013. The band wasn't getting much attention, so they decided to promote it by posting her picture around town. In 1979, the single \\"Too Much to Touch\\" was released under the name Angelyne, also promoted by posters and flyers. In 1982, she released a self-titled debut album on an independent label Erika Records.\\"Billboard\\", Billboard, March 5, 1983. The 12\\" picture disc contained 11 songs, including 2 versions of \\"Sexy Stranger\\", a cover of Elvis Presley's hit \\"Teddy Bear\\", and a main single \\"Kiss Me L.A.\\". The album was promoted by another series of bus-shelter posters. In July 1983, Erika Records released another Angelyne's single, \\"My List\\", accompanied by a music video.Schneider, Mitchell. \\"Angelyne. Attack of the 50-foot Sex Kitten\\", BAM, February 24, 1984. According to Angelyne, she met wealthy adhesive-free-tape entrepreneur Hugo Maisnik (inventor of Hugo's Amazing Tape) in 1982. Maisnik had a display-printing business in Los Angeles. Described as \\"very eccentric\\" and a \\"bored prankster\\", Maisnik reportedly saw potential in using Angelyne's image and understood the \\"intricacies of the outdoor-advertising game\\". In February 1984, Angelyne's first billboard proclaiming \\"Angelyne Rocks\\" went up on Sunset Boulevard. Maisnik's daughter, Katherine Saltzberg, wrote the one-woman play, Los Angelyne, about her experience growing up in the shadow of the Angelyne billboards. In 1986, she released her second album, Driven to Fantasy, on her own label, Pink Kitten. An enhanced pink vinyl re-issue of the album was later released in Italy.\\"Angelyne\\", Ciao 2001, 1987. In June 1987, an 85 feet high mural depicting Angelyne was painted on the side of a building on Hollywood and Vine. The $22,000 painting was allegedly financed by her manager.\\"Sequels\\", People, December 28, 1987. The same year, her friend Nina Hagen got her recording with Michael \\"Doc\\" Dosco, who had previously worked with Hagen on her album Nina Hagen in Ekstasy. He wrote and produced several songs for Angelyne, including \\"Animal Attraction\\", which was later featured in Julien Temple's movie Earth Girls Are Easy, where Angelyne had a cameo. The single was released in 1988 with remixes by Italian producer Pino Toma. Hagen mentioned Angelyne in her song \\"Super Freak Family\\" and her voice can be heard in the song \\"Pillow Talk\\". In 1995, a black-and-white documentary by Robinson Devor \\"Angelyne\\" was released. Around that time she had over 200 billboards up all over Los Angeles.Sahgal, Ajay. \\"So L.A. : Angelyne & Me : What's the Story Behind the Billboard?

The Angelyne Dream Experience, an experimental film by Dan Kapelovitz, who also worked on her EP Beauty & the Pink, was released in 1998. The short movie with elements of psychedelia features Angelyne driving in the streets of Los Angeles, greeting her fans and talking about out-of-body experience.Haden-Guest, Anthony. \\"The queen of LA's billboards\\", The Telegraph, April 22, 2000. The same year Angelyne pursued another artistic venture and began painting self-portraits. Since then she has had several successful art exhibitions. After being a candidate for Hollywood city council in 2002 if it were to secede from Los Angeles, she ran again in 2003, this time for governor of California.

Designed by Brown and Storey Architects, the square was conceived in 1997 as part of revitalizing the intersection. Since its completion in 2002, the square has hosted many public events, performances and art displays, establishing itself as a prominent landmark in Toronto and one of the city's prime tourist attractions. Central to the Downtown Yonge entertainment and shopping district, the square is owned by the city and is the first public square in Canada to be maintained through a public-private partnership. The intersection is one of the busiest in Canada, with over 100,000 people crossing the city's first pedestrian scramble daily. Surrounding the square are other major landmarks, including the Toronto Eaton Centre, Ed Mirvish Theatre, and the Citytv building. The square is accessible by the Toronto subway at Dundas station and is connected to the PATH. The square is continuously illuminated by large billboard screens and corporate logos, which has led to comparison of the square with Times Square in New York City and Piccadilly Circus in London. History Looking north along Yonge Street at the Dundas Square building, which was situated on the present-day square in 1979. The building was demolished in 1998. In 1998, as part of its Yonge Street Regeneration Project, Toronto City Council approved the expropriation and demolition of the buildings on the site and the construction of Yonge‚ÄìDundas Square. The square is a joint project of the city, residents, the McGill Granby Association, the Downtown Yonge Business and Resident Association, and the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area, an association of local businesses. This effort was spearheaded by Councillor Kyle Rae, Robert Sniderman of the Senator Restaurant, and Arron Barberian of Barberian's Steak House. Ron Soskolne was retained in 1995 to head up the planning of the regeneration project, and went on to become the Chair of the Board of Management for the first decade of the Square's operation. Designed by Brown + Storey Architects, the square was intended as a new public space in Toronto, somewhat akin to Nathan Phillips Square, designed by Viljo Revell for New City Hall. In 1999, the square's design received the Award of Excellence for significant building in the design stage by the Canadian Architect magazine, in recognition of it being an outstanding example of contemporary architecture. The next year, Architecture magazine commended the square as a new form of urban space with great presence ... pushes the limits of invention and originality. Unlike Nathan Phillips Square, however, Yonge‚ÄìDundas Square is operated by a separate Board of Management. The site is owned by the City and administered by a Board of Management. The board of management for Yonge‚ÄìDundas Square was established in 2001, and is the first public‚Äìprivate partnership in Canada to operate a public square. In 2006, the square's Wi-Fi hotspot, set up by Wireless Toronto, was voted the best in the city. Some claim that the intersection is the busiest in Canada, with over 56 million people passing through annually. The square's development is cited as modelling New York's Times Square, Tokyo's Shibuya district, and London's Piccadilly Circus. To manage the volume of pedestrians, a pedestrian scramble was installed in August 2008. Pride festivities at the northern end of the square, 2014. The square hosted the closing ceremonies for WorldPride in 2014. The square frequently serves as a venue for public events connected to the city's cultural festivals, including NXNE, the Toronto International Film Festival, Luminato, Nuit blanche and Pride Week. On June 29, 2014, the square hosted the official closing ceremonies of WorldPride.\\"Tegan and Sara close WorldPride Toronto with a bang\\". Xtra!, June 30, 2014. The square is property of the City of Toronto and regulated by Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 636: Public Squares. These regulations govern activities in the square and the use of the property. As of April 2014, smoking is prohibited on the entire property of the square. Design The site is bordered on the north by Dundas Street, on the east by Victoria Street, and on the west by Yonge Street. A former street named Dundas Square (previously Wilton Street) forms the southern boundary. Dundas Street, an east‚Äìwest street through Downtown Toronto, was constructed by connecting pre-existing streets. From the west, Agnes Street intersected at Yonge Street at the present Dundas Street intersection, but did not continue east. From the east, Wilton Street connected to Yonge Street approximately 100 metres to the south. In the 20th century, Dundas Street was extended east from the Agnes Street intersection to meet with Wilton Street at Victoria Street, by building a curved road east, then southeast, to intersect with Wilton. Wilton was renamed Dundas Street East, and the section of Wilton west of Victoria Street was renamed Dundas Square. Yonge Street retail stores south of the new Dundas intersection and not in the way of the roadway, remained. The square is on a slight incline, which architects Brown and Storey have said was intended to evoke a theatrical stage. It is made with modular raised square textured granite slabs (each slab costing approximately $1,500: $1,000 materials plus $500 labour), features a diagonally running zinc canopy along the northern hypotenuse of the \\"square\\", a movable plinth which serves as a stage for concerts and other performances, a row of lighted fountains set directly into the pavement, a row of small trees along the southern edge, a transparent canopy over the plinth, and a new entrance to Dundas subway station below. A series of low, circular stone planters was added to the western side of the square in summer 2005. Because Dundas Street bends at the square, it is not actually a square, but an irregular pentagon. This angled northeastern side of the square is known as the hypotenuse, which features a structure supported by 11 concrete pillars of the type used to make overpasses on highways. This creates an industrial urban aesthetic, which, being to the north, casts no shadows on the rest of the space. The other three sides are square (i.e., at right angles to one another and to Yonge and Dundas Streets). As well, there is a road which traverses the square known as Dundas Square. This is a small street leading from Yonge Street to Dundas Street. =Features= The surface of Yonge‚ÄìDundas Square is not level; it is sloped upward away from Yonge Street to allow enough height to provide clearance for the Toronto Parking Authority garage entrance. The architects planned the slope of the surface to make it interesting and to accommodate the necessary clearances for what lies underneath. Level P1 houses the washrooms and changerooms, a green room for stage performers, and various utilities rooms, custodial and supply closets, and the water treatment plant and pump rooms for the fountains. The square features two public drinking fountains At the southeast and southwest corners of Yonge‚ÄìDundas Square are drinking water fountains. The water fountain on the southwest corner (nearest to Yonge Street) is known for its large, cool stream of water that flows down the fountain to drains in the ground. The stream produced by the other fountain is warmer and flows less copiously. On the other hand, the fountain nearest Yonge street is also near a protrusion in the ground that has become a popular seat. Fountains The centrepiece of the square is the array of fountains designed by Dan Euser of Waterarchitecture. Two rows of ten fountains are spread out across the square's main walkway, so that visitors have the opportunity to walk through or around the fountains. Unlike many other city fountains, the Dundas Square fountains were meant for waterplay and include a sophisticated filtration system that (according to both of the architects) keep the water at or above \\"pool quality\\" water. According to Euser, the water is treated to maintain health standards for waterplay. According to facility administrator Christine MacLean, the granite that was chosen for the entire space has non-slip properties for the safety of those running through or playing in the fountains. Each of the 10 water fountains consists of a stainless steel grille with 30 ground nozzles (arranged in three rows of 10) under it. The entire rock surface is of a very dark (almost black) colour and effectively absorbs sunlight, thus creating a warm surface on which to rest. The water runs under the dark rock slabs and is thus heated by them, so that the fountain water is solar heated. Three curved lighting masts along the south edge of the square, made of hollow structural steel, have a high- gloss white finish that contrasts with the rough non-slip texture of the black granite, and each support six mercury vapour arc lamps that create evening light that comes from approximately the same directions as natural sunlight does during the day (i.e., from various southerly directions). 600 ground nozzles are spread out in 20 groups across the square's main walkway The fountains comprise a dynamic art installation and water sculpture in which the 600 water jets are programmed to vary, dynamically, over time. The fountains usually operate 24 hours a day. Other than the aquatic play area in front of the Ontario Science Centre (the centrepiece of Teluscape), Dundas Square is Toronto's only 24-hour waterplay area, open all day and night except during special events, maintenance, and other exceptions. The fountains usually run from around mid-April to the end of October, making this one of two aquatic play areas in Toronto that opens very early in the season and closes very late in the season. To reduce costs, only the middle channel (the middle 10 nozzles of each fountain) can be animated, but the outer two channels can still be globally controlled. The outer two channels are often used to set a background (pedestal) level while the middle channel animates, typically for eight-second intervals. The directionality imposed by the middle channel's sequencer encourages bathers to run west rather than east. Moreover, the sequencer makes the bathing experience optimal for joggers who run west at exactly 20 km/h. Architects Brown and Storey, fountain creator Dan Euser, the firm that initiated the bidding, former Councillor Kyle Rae, and the management of Dundas Square have all confirmed that waterplay was one of the intended uses of the space. The fountains are intended to appeal to children and adults, and there is evidence that has been realized. Because many people drink from the ground spray nozzles (some people even fill up water bottles from the ground sprays), and since waterplay is one of the intended uses, the water is tested daily, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., by the Toronto health department. The water is treated with bromine, which many bathers prefer to chlorine. There are three separate water treatment facilities, one for each group of ten westmost nozzles in each grille (200 nozzles total), another for the middle row of ten in each grille, and a third for all of the eastmost nozzles. The water that runs into the grilles travels west, under the raised floor of the Dundas Square slabs, to the treatment facility under the west end of the waterplay area. =Surrounding buildings= View of the Eaton's Centre to the west, and 10 Dundas East to the north of the square. A media tower is located to the northwest of the square. Yonge‚ÄìDundas Square is located within the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area (BIA). Other projects in the area include the redevelopment of the Eaton Centre, the construction of a new retail and cinema complex to the north in 2007, called 10 Dundas East (formerly Toronto Life Square and before that known as Metropolis), and the opening of 33 Dundas Street East to the southeast (on the corner of Victoria and Dundas), which used to be the home of Olympic Spirit Toronto. On October 22, 2007, Rogers Media announced that it would buy this building as a new home for its Citytv and Omni Television stations. This new studio space is now operational. A \\"media tower\\" ‚Äì a scaffold for billboards, operated by Branded Cities ‚Äì has been constructed on the northwest corner of Yonge and Dundas. It is advertised as the tallest media tower in the world. Another large media tower, complete with a video screen, is a major feature of the Rogers Media building on the southeast corner of Dundas Square; the video screen usually shows the CITY-TV broadcast. The building that was home to the Hard Rock Cafe (now a Shoppers Drug Mart) on the southwest corner of the square originally features a series of billboards, but these were replaced by a large video screen in 2017. The introduction of the imposing media tower, screens, and brightly illuminated advertising billboards has been too great a sacrifice for some area residents, who feel a loss of the neighbourhood's identity and character (see \\"Controversy\\", below). A curved video screen was installed atop the building south of the square in 2017 The redevelopment of the Eaton Centre and the building at Victoria and Dundas were completed in 2004. Toronto Life Square, formerly known as the Metropolis development, began in January 1999 after the City of Toronto expropriated a number of properties, and a phased opening began in 2007. It was renamed \\"10 Dundas East\\" after Toronto Life magazine's parent company, St. Joseph Communications, sued to have the magazine's name removed from the building. In 2019, an existing smaller screen and two billboards were replaced by a massive curved video display on the corner of the building facing Yonge and Dundas. Criticism Criticism ranges from suggestions that the city has missed an opportunity for more green space within the downtown core (or that they have missed an opportunity for what some critics consider more interesting architectural elements) to questions of what the true intent behind the ostensibly public square is. The Toronto Public Space Committee and organizers of Toronto iterations of the Reclaim The Streets phenomenon often point to the square as an example of what they consider a negative trend in urban planning. The square is surrounded on all sides by gigantic commercial billboards in a redevelopment scheme modelled on New York City's Times Square or London's Piccadilly Circus. Many have pointed to the square as a prime example of the creeping privatization of public space. Those making this point have been bolstered by the fact that the square's board is populated by local businesses and residents. The board of management for the square is an ABC organization of the City of Toronto. While there are permit fees for commercial events, community groups can use the square for free under the square's community use policy. All events are charged back for staffing and equipment use.

It was founded as Saint Peter's College in 1872 by the Society of Jesus. It offers over 60 undergraduate and graduate programs to more than 2,600 undergraduate and 800 graduate students. Its college mascot is the Peacock and its sports teams play in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, of which it is a founding member. The school is located on a campus just south of Journal Square, and is 2 miles (3 km) west of New York City. Evening and weekend classes are offered in Jersey City, Englewood Cliffs, and South Amboy. History The college was chartered in 1872 and enrolled its first students in 1878 at Warren Street, in Jersey City, on the present site of its former high school section, St. Peter's Preparatory School. In September 1918, the college was closed, along with several other Jesuit colleges and high schools, because of declining enrollment in the face of World War I. Although the war ended only two months after its closing, and despite clamoring from alumni, it took until 1930 to re-open the college. The college was temporarily located on Newark Avenue, before moving in 1936 to its current location on Hudson (now Kennedy) Boulevard, between Montgomery Street and Glenwood Avenue. Unlike other institutions in New Jersey, the school was racially segregated for many years. It was first integrated in 1936, when the college admitted its first black student.

This choice was made for several reasons. Primarily, the land on which Saint Peter's now stands was once owned by a man named Michael Pauw, whose last name means \\"peacock\\" in Dutch. His extensive holdings included most of Hudson County and were part of the Pavonia, New Netherland settlement. In pagan mythology, the peacock is considered to be a symbol of rebirth, much like the phoenix. For Saint Peter's, it is a reference to the closing and reopening of the college in the early 20th century. At one point in the 1960s, live peacocks roamed the campus. Many institutions within the college derive their name from the peacock: * The school newspaper is titled the Pauw Wow. * The literary magazine is titled the Pavan. * The school's yearbook is titled the Peacock Pie. * The drama society calls itself Argus Eyes, in reference to Argus \\"Panoptes\\", who, according to Greek mythology, had his 100 eyes preserved by Hera in the tail of the peacock. * One of the major dining facilities is named the Pavonia Room. * The O'Toole Library caf√© is named Pavo Perk.

Originally, it was widely used for both literary and official purposes, though sparingly in daily language. In the 20th century, it was increasingly adopted for official and formal purposes, until minister of education Georgios Rallis made Demotic Greek the official language of Greece in 1976, and in 1982 Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou abolished the polytonic system of writing for both Demotic and Katharevousa. Katharevousa was conceived by the intellectual and revolutionary leader Adamantios Korais (1748‚Äì1833). A graduate of the University of Montpellier, Korais spent most of his life as an expatriate in Paris. As a classical scholar credited with both laying the foundations of Modern Greek literature and a major figure in the Greek Enlightenment, he was repelled by the Byzantine and subsequent influence on Greek society, and was a fierce critic of the clergy and their alleged subservience to the Ottoman Empire.Adamantios Korais, ŒëŒ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒîŒπŒ¥Œ±œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒØŒ±, pages 3sq. He held that education was a prerequisite to Greek liberation. Part of Katharevousa's purpose was to serve as a compromise solution for the struggle between the \\"archaists\\" demanding full reversion to archaic Greek, and the \\"modernists\\". History Although Katharevousa was introduced relatively recently, the concept of a conservative literary version of Greek had been present since the times of Koine Greek. There had always existed a tendency towards a state of diglossia between the Attic literary language and the constantly developing spoken Koine, which eventually evolved into Demotic Greek. Medieval Greek texts and documents of the Byzantine Empire were almost always written in conservative literary Greek. Examples of texts written in vernacular Greek prior to the 13th century are very rare. It can be argued that the establishment of Katharevousa was an official declaration and standardization of the conservative form of Greek, which had already existed in one way or another. The first known use of the term Katharevousa is in a work by the Greek polymath Nikephoros Theotokis, in 1796.The Phenomenon of Diglossia: Language and National Identity, interview with Peter Mackridge Katharevousa was widely used in public documents and whatever was conceived as work of formal activity by Greek scholars. The name Katharevousa implies a pure form of Greek as it might hypothetically have evolved from ancient Greek without external influences, while in its modern connotation the word has come to mean \\"formal language\\". In later years, Katharevousa was used for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting), while Demotic Greek (Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, dimotiki) or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a diglossic situation whereby most of the Greek population was excluded from the public sphere and advancement in education unless they conformed to Katharevousa. In 1976, Demotic was made the official language, and in 1982 Andreas Papandreou abolished the polytonic system of writing; by the end of the 20th century full Katharevousa in its earlier form had become obsolete. Much of the vocabulary of Katharevousa and its grammatical and syntactical rules have influenced the Demotic language, so that the project's emphasis has made an observable contribution to the language as it is used today. Modern Greek might be argued to be a combination of the original Demotic and the traditional Katharevousa as stressed in the 19th century, also with institutional input from Koine Greek. Among Katharevousa's later contributions are the promotion of classically based compounds to describe items and concepts that did not exist in earlier times, such as \\"newspaper\\", \\"police\\", \\"automobile\\", \\"airplane\\", \\"television\\" and many others, rather than borrowing new words directly from other languages.  Etymology  Katharevousa () means 'cleansed, purified', the feminine present participle of the verb kathar√©vo (, ). (The term is thus cognate with English catharsis.) Present-day use The Church of Greece and other churches of the Greek Orthodox tradition still use Katharevousa in official communications.Argyropoulou, Christina (2015): ' 7: 52‚Äì69. Text sample This is a text sample of Katharevousa from the Great Greek Encyclopedia, published in 1930. The text has to do with Adamantios Korais's relations with the Greek Church. It is rendered in Demotic and translated into English. *Katharevousa: Great Greek Encyclopedia, Vol. XIV, 1930, p. 864. : *Standard Modern Greek: : *English: His expatriation from Greece was a cause for many unjust judgments regarding situations and people and mainly for his behavior towards the clergy, which was discussed above. If he had lived in Greece and been in contact with the clergy and known closely not only its turpitude but also its virtues, not only would he have contributed greatly to correcting some of the problems within the Church, but also would not have listened to all that he listened to due to his exaggerated sentiments against the clergy.

It is a majority-online institution that serves the state's adult population. One of New Jersey's 11 public universities and colleges, Thomas Edison State University offers degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. Thomas Edison State College was approved by the New Jersey Board of Education in December 1971, and established on July 1, 1972. The school was named in honor of Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor who lived in New Jersey for the bulk of his adult life and gained encyclopedic knowledge of many subject areas through self-directed learning. In 2015, Thomas Edison State University was awarded university status. Campus Thomas Edison State University moved into downtown Trenton in September 1979, at a time when other institutions were leaving cities. The 7-year-old university, which had spent three years at the Forrestal Center outside of Princeton, needed room for growth. At the same time, the state was looking for an appropriate tenant for the landmark Kelsey Building located adjacent to New Jersey's State House complex and the State House historic district, while the city sought to preserve the building's historic use as a school. Behind the Kelsey Building and the adjoining five restored mid-19th-century brick Townhouses is Petty's Run, which flows to the Delaware River.

He defected on 5 September 1945, three days after the end of World War II, with 109 documents on the USSR's espionage activities in the West. This forced Canada's Prime Minister Mackenzie King to call a Royal Commission to investigate espionage in Canada. Gouzenko exposed Soviet intelligence's efforts to steal nuclear secrets as well as the technique of planting sleeper agents. The \\"Gouzenko Affair\\" is often credited as a triggering event of the Cold War, with historian Jack Granatstein stating it was \\"the beginning of the Cold War for public opinion\\" and journalist Robert Fulford writing he was \\"absolutely certain the Cold War began in Ottawa\\". Granville Hicks described Gouzenko's actions as having \\"awakened the people of North America to the magnitude and the danger of Soviet espionage\\".  Background  Gouzenko was born on January 13, 1919, in the village of Rogachev near Dmitrov, Moscow Governorate (now Moscow Oblast), 100 kilometers north-west of Moscow. He was the youngest of three children.–°–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞—Ç—å –†–æ–¥–∏–Ω—É, –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–æ–≤, Olma Media Group, 2005. He studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute. While at the institute he met his future wife Svetlana (Anna) Gouseva; the couple married soon after meeting. At the start of World War II, he joined the military where he trained for a year as a cipher clerk. His position gave him knowledge of Soviet espionage activities in the West. Gouzenko worked under the leadership of Colonel Nikolai Zabotin.  Defection  Gouzenko's Somerset Street apartment (upper right, facing street) in 2007 In September 1945, upon learning that he and his family were to be sent home to the Soviet Union and dissatisfied with the quality of life and the politics of his homeland, he decided to defect. Gouzenko walked out of the embassy door carrying with him a briefcase with Soviet code books and deciphering materials. He initially went to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but the RCMP officers on duty refused to believe his story. He then went to the Ottawa Journal newspaper, but the paper's night editor was not interested, and suggested he go to the Department of Justice but nobody was on duty when he arrived there. Terrified that the Soviets had discovered his duplicity, he went back to his apartment and hid his family in the apartment across the hall for the night. Gouzenko, hidden by a neighbour, watched through the keyhole as a group of Soviet agents broke into his apartment. They began searching through his belongings, and left only when confronted by Ottawa police. The next day Gouzenko was able to find contacts in the RCMP who were willing to examine the documents he had removed from the Soviet embassy. Gouzenko was transported by the RCMP to the secret World War II \\"Camp X\\", comfortably distant from Ottawa. While there, Gouzenko was interviewed by investigators from Britain's internal security service, MI5 (rather than MI6, as Canada was within the British Commonwealth) and by investigators from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (as the CIA had not yet been founded). It has been alleged that, though the RCMP expressed interest in Gouzenko, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King initially wanted nothing to do with him. Even with Gouzenko in hiding and under RCMP protection, King reportedly pushed for a diplomatic solution to avoid upsetting the Soviet Union, still a wartime ally and ostensible friend. Documents reveal that King, then 70 and weary from six years of war leadership, was aghast when Norman Robertson, his undersecretary for external affairs, and his assistant, H. H. Wrong, informed him on the morning of September 6, 1945, that a \\"terrible thing\\" had happened. Gouzenko and his wife Svetlana, they told him, had appeared at the office of Justice Minister Louis St. Laurent with documents unmasking Soviet perfidy on Canadian soil. \\"It was like a bomb on top of everything else\\", King wrote.Appendix: Secret and Confidential Diary Relating to Russian Espionage Activities ‚Äì September 6 to October 31, 1945, by William Lyon Mackenzie King, The Evidence Web, Library and Archives Canada, September 6, 1945 King's diaries assembled after his death were missing a single volume for November 10 to December 31, 1945, according to Library and Archives Canada.Quoting a photocopy of a typewritten page at the Library and Archives Canada web site, Igor Gouzenko's pistol, which he was carrying when hiding in his neighbor's apartment (exhibit of the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC). Robertson told the Prime Minister that Gouzenko was threatening suicide, but King was adamant that his government not get involved, even if Gouzenko was apprehended by Soviet authorities. Robertson ignored King's wishes and authorized the granting of asylum to Gouzenko and his family, on the basis that their lives were in danger.  Ramifications of the defection  In February 1946, news spread that a network of Canadian spies under control of the Soviet Union had been passing classified information to the Soviet government.Finkel, Alvin. Conrad, Margaret (2002). History Of the Canadian People: 1867 to Present. Toronto:Addison Wesley Longman Publishing, p. 347. Much of the information taken then is public knowledge now, and the Canadian government was less concerned with the information stolen, but more of the potential of real secrets coming into the hands of future enemies. Canada played an important part in the early research with nuclear bomb technology, Canada along with the UK being part of the wartime Manhattan Project, and that kind of vital information could be dangerous to Canadian interests in the hands of other nations. Gouzenko's defection \\"ushered in the modern era of Canadian security intelligence\\". The evidence provided by Gouzenko led to the arrest of 39 suspects, including Agatha Chapman, whose apartment at 282 Somerset Street West was a favourite evening rendezvous; a total of 18 were eventually convicted of a variety of offences. Among those convicted were Fred Rose, who was the only Communist Member of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons; Sam Carr, the Communist Party's national organizer; and scientist Raymond Boyer.Raymond Boyer, Canada's Human Rights History, (C) Dominique Cl√©ment. Chapman was later acquitted; the judge in her case announced that \\"No case has been made out and, as far as this trial is concerned, the accused is dismissed.\\" A Royal Commission of Inquiry to investigate espionage, headed by Justices Robert Taschereau and Roy Kellock, was conducted into the Gouzenko Affair and his evidence of a Soviet spy ring in Canada. It also alerted other countries around the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, that Soviet agents had almost certainly infiltrated their nations as well. Gouzenko provided many vital leads which assisted greatly with ongoing espionage investigations in Britain and North America. The documents he handed over exposed numerous Canadians who were spying for the Soviet Union. A clerk at the External Affairs, a Canadian Army captain, and a radar engineer working at the National Research Council were arrested for espionage. A spy ring of up to 20 people passing information to the Soviets led by Fred Rose was also exposed. In the United States the FBI tracked down a Soviet spy, Ignacy Witczak, at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles.  Life in Canada  Gouzenko and his family were given another identity by the Canadian government out of fear of Soviet reprisals. Gouzenko, as assigned by the Canadian government, lived the rest of his life under the assumed name of George Brown. Little is known about his life afterwards, but it is understood that he and his wife settled down to a middle-class existence in the Toronto suburb of Clarkson. They raised eight children together. He was, however, involved in a defamation case against Maclean's for a libellous article written about him. The case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.Lefolii et al. v. Gouzenko, [1969] S.C.R. 3. Gouzenko remained in the public eye, writing two books, This Was My Choice, a non-fiction account of his defection, and the novel The Fall of a Titan, which won a Governor General's Award in 1954. Gouzenko also appeared on television to promote his books and air grievances with the RCMP, always with a hood over his head.  Death  Gouzenko died of a heart attack in 1982 at Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Svetlana died in September 2001 and was buried next to him. His grave was unmarked until 2002, when family members erected a headstone. Igor Gouzenko tombstone on Spring Creek Cemetery in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada In 2002 federal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps designated \\"The Gouzenko Affair (1945-46)\\" an event of national historic significance. In June 2003, the city of Ottawa and in April 2004, the Canadian federal government put up memorial plaques in Dundonald Park commemorating the Soviet defector. It was from this park that RCMP agents monitored Gouzenko's apartment across Somerset Street the night men from the Soviet embassy came looking for Gouzenko. The story of the process of lobbying the two levels of government to unveil the historic plaques is told in the book \\"Remembering Gouzenko: The Struggle to Honour a Cold War Hero\\" by Andrew Kavchak (2019).  Film The story of the Gouzenko Affair was made into the film The Iron Curtain in 1948, directed by William Wellman, with screenplay by Milton Krims, and starring Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney as Igor and Anna Gouzenko, produced by Twentieth Century Fox. Another film version of the Gouzenko Affair was made as Operation Manhunt in 1954, directed by Jack Alexander, with screenplay by Paul Monash, and starring Harry Townes and Irja Jensen, released by United Artists.

He is best known for writing the Hymn to Liberty (, √ùmnos eis tƒ´n Eleuther√≠an), of which the first two stanzas, set to music by Nikolaos Mantzaros, became the Greek and Cypriot national anthem in 1865. He was the central figure of the Heptanese School of poetry, and is considered the national poet of Greece‚Äînot only because he wrote the national anthem, but also because he contributed to the preservation of earlier poetic tradition and highlighted its usefulness to modern literature. Other notable poems include ·Ωâ ŒöœÅŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (The Cretan), ·ºòŒªŒµœçŒ∏ŒµœÅŒøŒπ Œ†ŒøŒªŒπŒøœÅŒ∫Œ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ (The Free Besieged) and others. A characteristic of his work is that no poem except the Hymn to Liberty was completed, and almost nothing was published during his lifetime. Life =Early life and education= Solomos when young Born at Zakynthos in 1798,At the time of Solomos' birth Zakynthos was part of the French d√©partment Mer-√âg√©e. Dionysios Solomos was the illegitimate child of a wealthy count, Nikolaos Solomos, and his housekeeper, Angeliki Nikli. Nikolaos Solomos was of Cretan origin; his family were Cretan refugees who settled on Zakynthos in 1670 after Crete's conquest by the Ottoman Empire in 1669. The Italian version of the family name is recorded as: Salamon, Salomon, Solomon, and Salomone.Jenkins 1981, 6 It is possible that his mother Angeliki Nikli came from the region of Mani.Kriaras 1969, 13 Count Nikolaos Solomos was legally married to Marnetta Kakni, who died in 1802. From that marriage, he had two children: Roberto and Elena. Since 1796, Nikolaos Solomos had a parallel relationship with his housekeeper Angeliki Nikli, who gave birth to one more son apart from Dionysios, Dimitrios (born in 1801). His father married Dionysios' mother a day before he died on 27 February 1807, making the young Dionysios legitimate and a co-heir to the count's estate, along with his half- brother. The poet spent his childhood years on Zakynthos until 1808, under the supervision of his Italian tutor, abbot Santo Rossi. After his father's death, count Dionysios Messalas gained Solomos' custody, whereas his mother married Manolis Leontarakis on 15 August 1807. In 1808, Messalas sent Solomos to Italy in order to study law, as was customary with Ionian nobility, but possibly also because of Dionysios' mother's new marriage. =Studies in Italy= Solomos went to Italy with his tutor, who returned to his home town, Cremona. Initially he was enrolled at the Lyceum of St. Catherine in Venice, but he had adjustment difficulties because of the school's strict discipline. For that reason, Rossi took Solomos with him to Cremona, where he finished his high- school studies in 1815. In November 1815, Solomos was enrolled at Pavia University's Faculty of Law, from which he graduated in 1817. Given the interest the young poet showed in the flourishing Italian literature and being a perfect speaker of Italian, he started writing poems in Italian. One of the most important first poems written in Italian during that period of time was the Ode per la prima messa (Ode to the first mass) and La distruzione di Gerusalemme (The destruction of Jerusalem). In the meantime, he acquainted himself with famous Italian poets and novelists (possibly Manzoni, Vincenzo Monti etc.); Ugo Foscolo from Zakynthos was among his friends. As a result, he was easily accepted in the Italian literary circles and evolved into a revered poet of the Italian language. =Return to Zakynthos= After 10 years of studies Solomos returned to Zakynthos in 1818 with a solid background in literature. On Zakynthos, which at that time was well known for its flourishing literary culture, the poet acquainted himself with people interested in literature. Antonios Matesis (the author of Vasilikos), Georgios Tertsetis, Dionysios Tagiapieras (a physician and supporter of the dimotiki, and also a friend of Ioannis Vilaras) and Nikolaos Lountzis were some of Solomos' most well-known friends. They used to gather in each other's homes and amused themselves by making up poems. They frequently satirized a Zakynthian doctor, Roidis (Solomos' satirical poems referring to the doctor are The doctors' council, the New Year's Day and The Gallows). They also liked to improvise poems on a given rhyme and topic. His improvised Italian poems during that period of time were published in 1822, under the title Rime Improvvisate. =First works in Greek and encounter with Spyridon Trikoupis= Along with the Italian poems, Solomos made his first attempts to write in Greek. This was a difficult task for the young poet, since his education was classical and in Italian, but also because there did not exist any poetic works written in the demotic dialect that could have served as models. However, the fact that his education in Greek was minimal kept him free of any scholarly influences, that might have led him to write in katharevousa, a \\"purist\\" language formulated as a simpler form of ancient Greek. Instead he wrote in the language of the common people of his native island. In order to ameliorate his language skills, he started studying methodically demotic songs, the works of pre-solomian poets (œÄœÅŒøœÉŒøŒªœâŒºŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒ≠œÇ) and popular and Cretan literature that at that time constituted the best samples of the use of the demotic dialect in modern Greek literature.The result was the first extensive body of literature written in the demotic dialect, a move whose influence on subsequent writers cannot be overstated. Poems dating to that period of time are I Xanthoula ‚Äî The little blond girl, I Agnoristi ‚Äî The Unrecognizable, Ta dyo aderfia ‚Äî The two brothers and I trelli mana ‚Äî The mad mother. Solomos' encounter with Spyridon Trikoupis in 1822 was a turning-point in his writing. When Trikoupis visited Zakynthos in 1822, invited by Lord Guilford, Solomos' fame on the island was already widespread and Trikoupis wished to meet him. During their second meeting, Solomos read to him the Ode to the first mass. Impressed by Solomos' poetic skills, Trikoupis stated: > Your poetic aptitude reserves for you a select place on the Italian > Parnassus. But the first places there are already taken. The Greek Parnassus > does not yet have its Dante. Solomos explained to Trikoupis that his Greek was not fluent, and Trikoupis helped him in his studies of Christopoulos' poems. =Hymn to Liberty and the poet's establishment= Cover of the \\"Hymn to Liberty\\" (ŒéŒºŒΩŒøœÇ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ±ŒΩ), published on 1825 (second Greek edition) The first important turning point in the Greek works of Solomos was the Hymn to Liberty that was completed in May 1823-a poem inspired by the Greek revolution 1821. The poem was at first published in 1824 in occupied Mesolongi and afterwards in Paris in 1825 translated into French and later on in other languages too. This resulted in the poet's fame proliferation outside the Greek borders. Thanks to this poem, Solomos was revered until his death, since the rest of his work was only known to his small circle of admirers and his \\"students\\". The Hymn to Liberty inaugurated a new phase in the poet's literary work: this is the time when the poet has finally managed to master the language and is experimenting himself with more complex forms, opening up to new kinds of inspirations and easily leaving aside improvisation. This period resulted in the Odi eis to thanato tou Lordou Byron ‚Äî Ode to the death of Lord Byron, a poem having many things in common with the Hymn but also many weaknesses, I Katastrofi ton Psaron ‚Äî Psara's Destruction, O Dialogos ‚Äî The Dialogue (referring to the language) and I Gynaika tis Zakynthos ‚Äî The Woman from Zakynthos. It is alleged that Solomos could hear the cannon firing from Zakynthos during the Greek War of Independence, which inspired him to write his most famous works. =Establishment on Corfu: first years= After frictions and economic disputes with his brother Dimitrios concerning legacy matters, Solomos move to Corfu, the most important intellectual center of the Ionian islands in those years. However, Dionysios did not leave Zakynthos solely because of his family problems; Solomos had been planning to visit the island since 1825. Corfu would offer him not only a more stimulating environment but also the vital isolation for his solitary and bizarre character. Corfu was the perfect place for contemplation and writing poetry, in line with Solomos' noble ideas about Art. That explains the fact that his happiest years were the first years he spent on Corfu. It was during this period of time that he took up studying German romantic philosophy and poetry (Hegel, Schlegel, Schiller, Goethe). Since he did not know German, he read Italian translations by his friend Nikolaos Lountzis. In the meantime, he continued to work on The Woman of Zakynthos and Lambros that he had started in 1826. =1833: trial and great works of maturity= Between 1833 and 1838, having restored the relations with his brother, Solomos' life was perturbed by a series of trials where his half- brother (from his mother's side) Ioannis Leontarakis was claiming part of their father's legacy, arguing that he was also the legal child of count Nikolaos Solomos, since his mother was pregnant before the father's death. Even though the outcome of the trial was favorable to both the poet and his brother, the dispute led to Solomos' alienation from his mother (his feelings were badly hurt because of his adoration towards his mother) and his withdrawal from publicity. Even though the trial influenced the poet to such a point, it was not able to seize his poetical work. 1833 signifies the mature period of his poetical work, that resulted in the unfinished poems of O Kritikos ‚Äî The Cretan (1833), Eleftheroi Poliorkimenoi ‚Äî The Free Besieged (until 1845) and O Porfyras(1847), that are considered to be the best of his works. In the meantime, he was planning other works that either remained at the preparation stage or remained as fragments, such as Nikoforos Vryennios, Eis to thanato Aimilias Rodostamo ‚Äî To the death of Emilia Rodostamo, To Francisca Fraser and Carmen Seculare. =Circle of Corfu= On Corfu, Solomos soon found himself at the admirers' and poets' center of attention, a group of well educated intellectuals with liberal and progressive ideas, a deep knowledge of art and with austere artistic pretensions. The most important people Solomos was acquainted to were Nikolaos Mantzaros, Ioannis and Spyridon Zampelios, Ermannos Lountzis, Niccol√≤ Tommaseo, Andreas Mustoxydis, Petros Vrailas Armenis, Iakovos Polylas, Ioulios Typaldos, Andreas Laskaratos and Gerasimos Markoras. Polylas, Typaldos and Markoras were Solomos' students, constituting the circle referred to as the \\"solomian poets\\" (œÉŒøŒªœâŒºŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒ≠œÇ), which signifies Greek's poetry flourishing, several decades before the appearance of the New Athenian School, a second poetical renaissance inspired by Kostis Palamas. =Last years= The tomb of Dionysios Solomos, located in the Museum of Dionysios Solomos; Zakynthos (city) After 1847, Solomos started writing in Italian once more. Most works from this period are half-finished poems and prose drafts that maybe the poet was planning to translate into Greek. Serious health problems made their appearance in 1851 and Solomos' character became even more temperamental. He alienated himself from friends such as Polylas (they came on terms with each other in 1854) and after his third stroke the poet did not leave his house. Solomos died in February 1857 from apoplexy. His fame had reached such heights so when the news about his death became known, everyone mourned. Corfu's theater closed down, the Ionian Parliament's sessions were suspended and mourning was declared. His remains were transferred to Zakynthos in 1865. Work =Literary influences and major works= Sketch of Solomos after his death (1857) by thumb Solomos' first poems written on Zakynthos were influenced by Italian poetry of that era, in line with the Academy of Arcadia movement (e.g. O thanatos tou voskou-The shepherd's death, Evrikomi) and by early romanticism (I trelli mana-The mad mother). Generally speaking, Solomos was heavily influenced by European romanticism, including Byron and Leopardi. The decade 1823‚Äì1833 determined the poet's progress. It was during that time he tried to give up improvisation and abandoned the new classicism style of poems such as Hymn to Liberty and Ode to the death of Lord Byron. Solomos was exposed to the cultural and political ferment of the Enlightenment and the ideas of the French Revolution, and he identified with Italian national sentiments for unification and liberation from the Habsburgs. In 1823, the poet writes the epic Hymn to Liberty, the first two stanzas of which became the Greek national anthem. This work salutes the War of Greek Independence, started in 1821, by invoking the personified image of Liberty, reborn and renewed out of \\"the sacred bones of the Greeks.\\" Of particular interest to non-Greeks are references to all the great powers of the time, which include the \\"heartfelt joy of Washington's land\\" that \\"remembered the irons that bound her as well\\", and a savage dig at the Austrian Eagle \\"that feeds on the entrails of the Italians to grow wings and talons\\" and does his best to harm Liberty. Solomos' own Ionian islands, under British rule at the time, are described as being \\"artfully chained\\" and having \\"'False Freedom' written on their foreheads.\\" The poem does not shrink from the savagery of the war, and ends with exhortations to the revolutionaries to maintain unity and avoid civil war, which had already erupted at the time of writing. In the Hymn to Liberty Solomos rejoices in the sight of \\"lily-fingered virgins\\" whose \\"breasts are preparing the sweet-suckled milk of bravery and freedom.\\" In 1824, Solomos composed The Dialogue, dealing with the language issue. The work involves three people: the poet, his friend (the first draft mentions Sp. Trikoupis) and the savant. However, it is mainly the poet and the savant who speak. The poet is trying to prove that katharevousa is an artificial language, of no use to either the people nor to literature. The poet supports a literary language based on the language spoken by the people, that should be elaborated on by the poet. In order to support his argument, the following phrase is used: \\"firstly succumb to the language of the people and then, if you are worthy, conquer it\\". His arguments are based on the French Age of Enlightenment on the subject of the use of national languages and on examples of Italian poetry, by which he tries to prove that no word is vulgar in itself but gets its meaning by the poem's context. At the end of the work, the poet abandons the rational reasoning and supports his arguments with passion. Between 1824 and 1826, the poet started working on the poem Lampros, a poem that remained unfinished. Lampros is an extreme romantic hero: he entered into a relationship with a young girl named Maria and they had four children without being married. Lampros sen t their children to an orphanage. While he was fighting against Ali Pasha, he met a girl, unaware of the fact that she was his daughter, and had a love affair with her. When he finally became aware of the incest, after recognizing the daughter's birthmarks, he told his daughter the truth that resulted in the daughter's suicide. On his way home, Lampros was forced to tell Maria about his crime and he fled to a church in order to appeace his soul. Divine Justice however sent the three boys' ghosts that chased him to the end of a cliff from which he fell of. Maria had already lost her reason and fell into a lake, hoping that she would at last find peace. Between 1826 and 1829, Solomos worked on the prose-like poem I Gynaika tis Zakynthos, a work of a satirical character, that mainly analyses the Evil. The poem is a monk's (Dionysios) narration and \\"I Gynaika\\"-\\"The Woman\\" is the Evil's main expression. It is said that this composition was about one of Solomos' relatives and that is the reason why the poet's brother never let Polylas publish the poem. In 1833, Solomos wrote his first important work during his maturity, O Kritikos (The Cretan), in iambic fifteen-syllable verse, as a result of the Cretan's literature influence. The work describes the story of a Cretan who left from Crete after the revolution was lost in 1826, the shipwreck and his efforts to save his beloved from the tempest. A central point in the work is the apparition of an oracle, the Feggarontymeni (meaning the one dressed by the moon). The narrator of the story is the Cretan himself: he starts telling his story many years later, when he is living alone as a beggar, doing flashbacks (from his life on Crete and the shipwreck) and talking about the future (the resurrection of the dead and his encounter with his beloved one in Paradise). O Kritikos is aesthetically the most complete poem. There is juxtaposition of storm imagery and the pursuit by the Turks. The problem troubling language specialists is the interpretation of the Feggarontymeni's figure. Some think the figure is an allusion to the Virgin Mary. She is described as the 'goddess' and reads in his heart the story of his heroic and ultimately futile struggles against the Turks in his native island which all but charms him out of his mortal body. David Ricks writes with respect to her identity, \\"we must hold in balance the soul of the expiring fianc√©e, the kindly presence of the Motherland and a recollection of our Lady\\".Ricks 2003, p. 31 Between 1833 and 1844, Solomos edited the second draft of The Free Besieged, a poem inspired by the Third Siege of Missolonghi and the heroic exodus of its inhabitants, written in a rhyming fifteen- syllable verse. After 1845, the poet started working on the poem once more, this time without using rhyme. The poem describes the last days of the siege, when food supplies were exhausted and it was certain that the city would fall. The notes written by the poet in Italian are very useful for the poem's interpretation. These notes are included in the Polylas edition. The central theme of the poem is willpower and the struggle with the temptations of nature that give birth to the will for life. There are three fragmentary drafts of this unfinished work, each draft longer and more thoroughly worked than the previous one, all of which show glimpses of what the finished poem could have been; yet the three drafts are considered possibly the finest moment of modern Greek poetry. This opinion of reverence and awe is not only one expressed by critics and scholars, but also by all major Greek poets who have invariably referred to Dionysios Solomos as a poet far superior than themselves. The last work of maturity is \\"O P√≥rfyras\\" (The Shark), written in 1847. The poet was inspired by a real incident, when a shark mangled an English soldier swimming in Corfu harbor. Porfyras is a difficult poem to interpret, mostly because of its fragmented nature. This poem also refers to the relation between nature and man and the body's and soul's dimension. The fragmented poems Lampros and Porfyras show the romantic impulse of Solomos (melancholy, gothic and supernatural, influenced by both Byron and Leopardi). The poem Ode to the death of Lord Byron, is labeled lyrical and was written after Byron died during the siege of Mesolongi, but the subject matter and form are epic. In the works of The Hymn to Liberty and Ode to the death of Lord Byron there are several direct and indirect references to Byron's works. A good example is a reference (in Solomos' own footnotes) to Byron's Don Juan, where in Canto the Third (The Greek Isles 15) a Greek poet says: > Fill high the bowl with Samian wine! > Our virgins dance beneath the shade > I see their glorious black eyes shine; > But gazing on each glowing maid, > My own the burning tear-drop laves, > To think such breasts must suckle slaves. =Minor works= Solomos also wrote translations of Italian poetry and Desdemona's song from Shakespeare's Othello, epigrams, other miscellaneous verse, satirical poems in Zakynthian dialect, and two prose works, including the tragic/mystical The Woman of Zakynthos. Of his attempts to translate parts of the Iliad into modern Greek only a couple of dozen lines remain. =Acceptance of his work= Since the beginning, Solomos was in the center of the literary circles of Zakynthos. After the Hymn to Liberty's publication, his fame spread throughout the Greek state. On the Ionian Islands and in Athens, the poet was known only by his published poems: the Hymn to Liberty, the abstract from Maria's prayer, Lampros, the Ode to the Nun and his poems written in his youth, many of them which were spread by word of mouth and many of them were set to music. This means that his contemporaries' opinion was formed by these works and it was thanks to these works that Solomos gained the fame that lasted until his death. The most important representatives of the First Athenian School admired Solomos' works even though they expressed their objections about the language used by the poet. In 1827, Iakovos Rizos Neroulos wrote in the Cours de la literature grecque moderne: \\"Dionysios Solomos' poems... have the value of a strong and fascinating inspiration, a fantasy full of courage and fertility\\".Politis 1958, 197 Alexandros Soutsos in the poem Letter to King Otto described Solomos (and Andreas Kalvos) as a great maker of odes who, however, neglected the beauties of the language and presented rich ideas poorly clad. Alexandros Rizos Ragkavis in Esquisses de la literature grecque moderne wrote: his spirit makes him one of Greece's greatest glories... Solomos shone like the most beautiful gem of Greece's poetical crown. Even before his death, Solomos' poetical work was identified with the fatherland's concept; in 1849, the newspaper Aion wrote: \\"the poetry of Solomos is not the poetry of a single person but the poetry of a whole nation\\".Garantoudis 2001, 221 Similar judgements were expressed even after the poet's death. The magazine Pandora wrote: \\"one of the finest poets of Greece and of Europe, the author of the dithyramb to Liberty, Dionysios Solomos from Zakynthos died at a thriving age\\".Politis 1958, 202 The funeral orations of Solomos' students were of course more essential and referred to the poet's unpublished works, many of which they had heard their teacher reciting. Ioulios Typaldos described Solomos as the \\"first and greatest founder of a new type of literature\\" and Iakovos Polylas in Solomos' poems \\"Prolegomena\\" in 1859 refers to him as \\"the national poet\\". The perception of Solomos' work changed radically after the long-awaited publication in 1859. His uncompleted work was an unpleasant surprise and created puzzlement to the newspapers which praised the greatest Greek poet after his death did not mention anything about the publication of the works. Valaoritis wrote to Constantinos Asopius in 1859 after the poet's death: \\"the nation's hopes were deceived\\" and in 1877 in a letter to Emmanouil Roidis he wrote that Solomos left us \\"only a hymn and some incoherent verses\\".Politis 1958, 209 Spyridon Trikoupis also expressed negative comments about Solomos' poems in his essay \\"Where does the common word \\"tragoudo\\" (i.e. \\"I am singing\\") derive from?\\" written in 1859. The first revaluation of Solomos' work outside the Ionian region started after 1880, especially after the critical work of Kostis Palamas, who acknowledged the historical importance of Solomos' work, which is characterized by the creation of a personal poetic language and the combination of all elements of the poetical tradition and the European poetical currents and ideas. =Formal elements= The poet used different metrical and rhyme forms, starting with some influenced by Italian poetry (sonnet form, rhymed trochaic terameters) and settling into the standard forms of Greek folk songs (iambic 15-syllable blank verse). His epigram on the destruction of Psara, an event of the Greek War of Independence, influenced by classical forms, is a marvel of rhythm and brevity in six lines of anapaest. =The fragmented nature of Solomos' works= One of the most important issues of Solomic poetry and of Greek literature in general is the fragmented nature of the poet's works. The only works published during Solomos' lifetime were the Hymn to Liberty (1825), an extract from Lampros (\\"Maria's prayer\\") (1834), the Ode to the Nun (1829) and the epigram To Francisca Fraser (1849). The rest of his works remained incomplete. Solomos was constantly editing his works and was striving towards total perfection of form, making efforts to get rid of anything excessive that destroyed their essential lyrical substance. His manuscripts do not comprise engrossed works; on the contrary, they reveal all stages of editing, without their latest version being the final one. At first, the poet conceptualized a draft of the poem written in Italian prose and after that he used to start editing the Greek version. Many of the verses are saved in the form of alternative versions, often in the wrong order, some incomplete and with many gaps. The poet often used to write verses of different poems on the same piece of paper. The poem 'The Cretan' (1833), written about the Cretan revolution was one of his most famous poems. It is highly fragmented, however, this adds to the tormented atmosphere of the dramatic monologue because the speaker is a beggar whose life has been torn apart and who is in emotional turmoil, his entire family killed by the Turks. A faithful student of Solomos, Iakovos Polylas, affronted many difficulties when he undertook the publication of his \\"teacher's\\" work (that was long-awaited, not only in the Ionian Islands but also the rest of Greece). First of all, Polylas had to ask permission from the poet's brother Dimitrios in order to be able to study the poet's manuscripts. After that, he had to arrange the scattered material (written in the poet's difficult to decipher handwriting) so as to present an as much as possible complete and coherent work. Polylas piled and arranged this material, choosing the verses that he thought were closest in meaning to what the poet had in mind. Sometimes Polylas added verses that he had heard Solomos recite and wrote down some alternative versions. In 1859, Polylas published the work of Solomos under the title \\"Apanta ta Evriskomena- Omnibus of the works found\\", accompanying this work with an exceptional introduction, in which he stated that the poet's manuscripts with their definitive form were lost. =Attempt to interpret the fragmented works= The form of Solomos' work as presented in its first edition was the source of disappointment, because at that time the work's value could not be appreciated. Polylas in his \\"Prolegomena\\" stressed that the major manuscripts of the poems' final version were either lost or destroyed. People assumed that the works may have been stolen by Solomos' servant or by the poet's brother Dimitrios or even that the poet himself destroyed them. Only in the beginning of the 20th century was it made clear that no more manuscripts existed and that Solomos had not completed his poems. The first attempts to interpret the fragmented nature of the poet's work were mostly based on theories having nothing to do with the texts themselves: the difficulty to complete the works was thought to be due to the lack of an appropriate intellectual atmosphere that would provide Solomos with the motivation to complete his works, or due to the lack of an adequate literary tradition that the poet could have followed. The fragmentation of Solomos' work was also attributed to psychological factors, such as the poet's alcoholism, the lack of compositive capability, the negative effects of the 1833‚Äì1838 trial, Solomos' perfectionism or his feeling of dissatisfaction.For a summary of these analyses, see E. Kriaras 1969, p.110-117 Other scholars underlined however that, to a great extent, Solomos did not care about the completion of his poems. A phrase attributed to the poet is illustrative: \\"Lampros will remain an abstract, because the whole poem does not reach the height of some days\\". Linos Politis notes on the fragmentary nature of the Free Besieged: \\"He did not want or did not care to incorporate these lyrical pieces into a narrative group ... He stuck to the pure, lyrical expression, without regard to the non-lyrical linking substance, thus advancing ... to the conquest of a 'pure' lyrical sphere, long before his time. We detected something similar in Kritikos too and the same thing is applied to the rest of his 'fragmented' works\\".L. Politis, History of modern Greek literature, National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation, Athens 1978 Later on, Solomos was considered by several poets and critics as the forerunner of \\"pure poetry\\"A. Grekou, Pure poetry in Greece. From Solomos to Seferis: 1833‚Äì1930, Editions Alexandreia 2000 and the fragmented nature of his work did not \\"disturb\\" any more; on the contrary, it was considered as an advantage. During the last decade, attempts have been made to associate the incomplete Solomian works with the fragmentary works of romantic literatureVeloudis 1989, p. 374-395 and 2000, p. 58-135 (such as Kubla Khan by Coleridge, Giaour by Lord Byron and Heinrich von Oftendingen by Novalis), even though this interpretation is not accepted by all scholars.Kapsomenos 1998, p. 95-96 and 2004, p.14-16 =Publication issue= From 1920 to 1930, an issue arose concerning the publication of works that were not included in Iakovos Polylas' edition such as The Woman of Zakynthos, the satirical The Gallows and several Italian sonnets that were published by K. Kairofylas in 1927. The Academy of Athens decided to publish Solomos' poems accompanied by a critical edition by N.B. Tomadakis, thus contributing to the discussion about whether a genuine (as Linos Politis was in favor of) or a critical edition of Solomos' works would be best. The critical edition was never published and the two classical scholars prepared \\"easy to use\\" editions of the poems, aiming at a wider range of readers. In 1964, Linos Politis published the poet's manuscripts using photographic reprint and typographical transcription. This edition constitutes a turn-point in the research on the Solomian works because not only was the poet's way of work revealed but also because the scholars had the opportunity to study all of the poet's editing phases and maybe even propose new editions. The contemporary editing attempts of the solomic work can be divided into two categories: the \\"analytical\\" edition which reveals the successive editing stages of every poem and its different versions, such as Politis had proposed and intended to realize; the \\"synthetical\\" edition which presents the work with a logical sequence and a completion of form, excluding verses or abstracts that do no fulfill these criteria. A sample of \\"synthetical\\" edition is the one of Stylianos Alexiou (1994), that was strongly criticized by the supporters of \\"analytical\\" approach.Veloudis 2000, p. 9-57 and 186‚Äì220  Surviving works at his death  Sadly, the poet's work at his death was mostly unfinished and in fragments, and was edited and published by his friend and fellow poet Iakovos Polylas. Whether Solomos was never satisfied with his work and kept little of it, whether large parts of his manuscripts were lost (something Polylas implies), or whether he had difficulties fleshing out the ambitious structure of his planned works is not clear, but the fragments show a huge disconnect between intention and surviving work: The Cretan begins with a fragment of Canto 18 and ends with Canto 22, and none of them are complete; Lambros was conceived with at least 38 cantos (of some of them only a prose summary survives), with the shortest poetic fragment consisting of a single line, and the longest containing 33 stanzas; the second draft of The Free Besieged consists of 61 fragments, of which 27 are single lines, seven are two lines, and two are half-lines.  Legacy  The statue of Solomos in Solomos Square, Zakynthos Solomos is commonly referred to as Greece's \\"national poet\\" for his important legacy to Greek literature and national identity. He was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 20 drachmas coin of 1990‚Äì2001. Drachma Banknotes & Coins: A 50 drachmas commemorative coin was issued in 1998 for the 200th anniversary of his birth. Drachma Banknotes & Coins: The international airport on the island of Zakynthos and a square in Nicosia, Cyprus, are named after Dionysis Solomos. The film Eternity and a Day (1998) depicts a dying Greek poet who attempts to complete some of Solomos' unfinished works. He also sees visions of Solomos (played by Fabrizio Bentivoglio) as he travels around Thessaloniki.

Since its founding in 1999, it has accumulated more than a million English facts from over 15,000 contributors in addition to knowledge bases in other languages. Much of OMCS's software is built on three interconnected representations: the natural language corpus that people interact with directly, a semantic network built from this corpus called ConceptNet, and a matrix-based representation of ConceptNet called AnalogySpace that can infer new knowledge using dimensionality reduction. The knowledge collected by Open Mind Common Sense has enabled research projects at MIT and elsewhere.  History  The project was the brainchild of Marvin Minsky, Push Singh, Catherine Havasi, and others. Development work began in September 1999, and the project was opened to the Internet a year later. Havasi described it in her dissertation as \\"an attempt to ... harness some of the distributed human computing power of the Internet, an idea which was then only in its early stages.\\" The original OMCS was influenced by the website Everything2 and its predecessor, and presented a minimalist interface that was inspired by Google. Push Singh was slated to become a professor at the MIT Media Lab to lead the Common Sense Computing group in 2007 until his suicide on Tuesday, February 28, 2006. The project is currently run by the Digital Intuition Group at the MIT Media Lab under Catherine Havasi.  Database and website  There are many different types of knowledge in OMCS. Some statements convey relationships between objects or events, expressed as simple phrases of natural language: some examples include \\"A coat is used for keeping warm\\", \\"The sun is very hot\\", and \\"The last thing you do when you cook dinner is wash your dishes\\". The database also contains information on the emotional content of situations, in such statements as \\"Spending time with friends causes happiness\\" and \\"Getting into a car wreck makes one angry\\". OMCS contains information on people's desires and goals, both large and small, such as \\"People want to be respected\\" and \\"People want good coffee\\". Originally, these statements could be entered into the Web site as unconstrained sentences of text, which had to be parsed later. The current version of the Web site collects knowledge only using more structured fill-in-the-blank templates. OMCS also makes use of data collected by the Game With a Purpose \\"Verbosity\\". In its native form, the OMCS database is simply a collection of these short sentences that convey some common knowledge. In order to use this knowledge computationally, it has to be transformed into a more structured representation.  ConceptNet  ConceptNet is a semantic network based on the information in the OMCS database. ConceptNet is expressed as a directed graph whose nodes are concepts, and whose edges are assertions of common sense about these concepts. Concepts represent sets of closely related natural language phrases, which could be noun phrases, verb phrases, adjective phrases, or clauses. ConceptNet is created from the natural-language assertions in OMCS by matching them against patterns using a shallow parser. Assertions are expressed as relations between two concepts, selected from a limited set of possible relations. The various relations represent common sentence patterns found in the OMCS corpus, and in particular, every \\"fill-in-the-blanks\\" template used on the knowledge-collection Web site is associated with a particular relation. The data structures that make up ConceptNet were significantly reorganized in 2007, and published as ConceptNet 3. The Software Agents group currently distributes a database and API for the new version 4.0. In 2010, OMCS co-founder and director Catherine Havasi, with Robyn Speer, Dennis Clark and Jason Alonso, created Luminoso, a text analytics software company that builds on ConceptNet. It uses ConceptNet as its primary lexical resource in order to help businesses make sense of and derive insight from vast amounts of qualitative data, including surveys, product reviews and social media.  Machine learning tools  The information in ConceptNet can be used as a basis for machine learning algorithms. One representation, called AnalogySpace, uses singular value decomposition to generalize and represent patterns in the knowledge in ConceptNet, in a way that can be used in AI applications. Its creators distribute a Python machine learning toolkit called Divisi for performing machine learning based on text corpora, structured knowledge bases such as ConceptNet, and combinations of the two.  Comparison to other projects  Other similar projects include Never-Ending Language Learning, Mindpixel (discontinued), Cyc, Learner, SenticNet, Freebase, YAGO, DBpedia, and Open Mind 1001 Questions, which have explored alternative approaches to collecting knowledge and providing incentive for participation. The Open Mind Common Sense project differs from Cyc because it has focused on representing the common sense knowledge it collected as English sentences, rather than using a formal logical structure. ConceptNet is described by one of its creators, Hugo Liu, as being structured more like WordNet than Cyc, due to its \\"emphasis on informal conceptual-connectedness over formal linguistic- rigor\\". There is also the Brazilian initiative, named Open Mind Common Sense in Brazil (OMCS-Br), led by the Advanced Interaction Lab at Federal University of S√£o Carlos (LIA-UFSCar). This project started in 2005, in collaboration with the Software Agents Group at the MIT Media Lab, the main goal is to collect common sense stated in Brazilian Portuguese and use it to develop culturally sensitive software applications based on extracting cultural profiles' knowledge from ConceptNet. This is intended to help developers and users with a culturally contextualized content software, making the final applications more flexible, adaptive, accessible and usable. The main applications' focuses are education and healthcare.

Airing during the fall of 1993, 65 episodes were produced for first-run syndication. The series was co-produced by DiC Animation City, Sega of America, Inc., Bohbot Entertainment and the Italian studio Reteitalia S.p.A. in association with Spanish network Telecinco. On November 24, 1996, USA Network aired a Christmas special which was produced to promote Sonic 3D Blast (originally meant for the ultimately cancelled Sonic X-treme). The series inspired a video game, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which features several original characters from the show. Furthermore, some elements of the series, such as Sonic's fondness for chili dogs, appeared in later video games and media of the franchise. Plot Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is a comical, light-hearted and gag-driven adventure series based on the titular character Sonic the Hedgehog, a sometimes arrogant yet kind-hearted and mischievous teenage hedgehog with the power to move at supersonic speeds. Sonic, along with his idolizing young friend Tails, regularly oppose the main antagonist Dr. Robotnik, his robot henchmen Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts, and thwart their plans to conquer their home planet of Mobius. The series features a short PSA segment titled \\"Sonic Says\\" at the end of each episode; these segments were written by Phil Harnage. Characters =Main= *Sonic the Hedgehog (voiced by Jaleel White) - The main character of the series. Sonic works to defend Mobius from the threat of Dr. Robotnik. *Tails (voiced by Christopher Stephen Welch, except for \\"Sonic Christmas Blast\\"; voiced by Chris Turner) - A two-tailed fox who is Sonic's friend. =Villains= *Dr. Ivo Robotnik (voiced by Long John Baldry) ‚Äì An evil mad scientist who uses robots and inventions in order to take over Mobius. His headquarters is a fortress atop Mobius' tallest mountain, where he uses his Robo-Matic Machine to create robots called Badniks to aid him in his plots. *Scratch (voiced by Phil Hayes) ‚Äì A dim-witted chicken-type Badnik who is one of Dr. Robotnik's henchmen. Originally, Dr. Robotnik wanted the Robo-Matic Machine to create a super robot, only for it to produce Scratch instead due to a malfunction. He is the older brother of Grounder, both of whom work to catch Sonic which with comical results. *Grounder (voiced by Garry Chalk) ‚Äì A Badnik with a drill-nose, drill-hands, and tank treads for legs who was created by Dr. Robotnik when he put one of Scratch's tail feathers into the Robo-Matic Machine. He is the younger brother of Scratch. *Coconuts (voiced by Ian James Corlett) ‚Äì A monkey-type Badnik who was created before Scratch and Grounder. At some point, he was demoted to working as Dr. Robotnik's janitor and is often trying to impress him by outdoing Scratch and Grounder in stopping Sonic to no avail. =Other characters= *Breezie (voiced by Venus Terzo) - A hedgehog-type Badnik created by Dr. Robotnik in a plot to get rid of Sonic. She developed feelings for him and left Dr. Robotnik's services. Breezie later met Robotnik Jr. who later developed a crush on her. *Momma Robotnik (voiced by Kathleen Barr) ‚Äì The mother of Dr. Robotnik who is even worse than her son. While kept in an asylum called the Mobius Home for Really Bizarre Mothers, she tends to escape on occasion and her insanity even scares Dr. Robotnik. *Wes Weasely (voiced by Michael Donovan) ‚Äì A weasel who works as a salesman at H.D.S.V.A.D.L. (Handy Dandy Super Villain Appliance Distributors Limited) company. He would often sell devices to Dr. Robotnik that would either fail because of either Sonic's ingenuity or Scratch and Grounder's incompetence. *Sergeant Doberman (voiced by Phil Hayes) - A Doberman Pinscher who is a retired army sergeant and a known war hero. *Professor Von Schlemmer (voiced by French Tickner) - A brilliant but eccentric and kooky scientist who is an ally of Sonic and Tails. *Professor Caninestine (voiced by Garry Chalk) - A highly-intelligent dog scientist that invents gadgets for Sonic to use. Dr. Robotnik once captured him and had him build a time machine in order to steal four Chaos Emeralds in different time periods. *Captain Rescue (voiced by Garry Chalk) - A retired superhero raccoon who briefly came out of retirement to help Sonic defeat Robotnik. *Robotnik Jr. (voiced by Ian James Corlett) - A short Dr. Robotnik- resembling Badnik created by Dr. Robotnik to be his son and carry on his legacy the day after Dr. Robotnik passes away. Unfortunately, he defects from his creator and sides with Sonic. Robotnik Jr. later fell in love with Breezie.

The show's animation was outsourced to four animation studios: * the Chinese subdivision of Rainbow Animation Group (later renamed Galaxy World, Inc., not to be confused with the Italian studio Rainbow S.p.A.), * the Korean Sae Rom Production (which also at the same time worked on the animation for the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon for ABC), * the Taiwanese Hong Ying Animation (which would later work on the animation for Sonic Underground), * the Japanese Tokyo Movie Shinsha (which would later produce its own Sonic cartoon, Sonic X). Pierre DeCelles, who worked at Hong Ying as a Senior Animation Director, has described the show as \\"fun and humorous\\". According to Robby London, DiC originally made a deal to produce only the Saturday morning Sonic series for the ABC network. The cartoon was originally planned to be more light-hearted compared to the final product, as reflected by its pilot episode and the early issues of Sonic the Hedgehog comics by Archie, which were based on the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon. However, DiC also wanted to go further and produce additional episodes for weekday syndication as well, similar to what DiC has previously done with The Real Ghostbusters, but Mark Pedowitz, ABC's senior vice president of business affairs and contracts, expected Sonic to air exclusively on ABC and rejected the idea, telling London \\"If you guys want to do syndication, be our guest, go with God, but you won‚Äôt be on our network.\\" ABC would not agree to the deal until London came with a proposition that DiC would produce a separate, vastly different Sonic show for syndication instead, the end result of which became Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. As a result, the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon was made darker and more serious in order to differentiate itself from the syndicated Sonic cartoon. Broadcast and distribution =First-run broadcast= The series was shown through syndication in the United States in 1993 on weekday afternoons. In the United Kingdom, the series was screened on Channel 4 in 1993 on Sunday mornings at 9:00, but with the \\"Sonic Says\\" segments edited out. They were also edited out on The Children's Channel and the UK VHS releases of the series. The weekday mornings airings in Australia on Seven Network as part of Agro's Cartoon Connection retained the segments. The cartoon was broadcast in the Republic of Ireland on RT√â Two from 12 September to December 1994 on weekday afternoons with the segments retained also. =Rebroadcast and international airings= USA Network re-aired the original episodes of the show in the United States from 1994 to 1996 (with an additional Christmas special ordered by Sega to be produced for the Christmas season of 1996 to coincide with the release of Sonic 3D Blast), and later returned to Broadcast Syndication on the BKN block from 1997-1998, and later BKN Kids II from 1999 until 2000. Toon Disney would start broadcasting the series in September 1998, and aired on the channel until 2002. This TV subsequently aired the first 13 episodes of the show from 2010 to 2011 on their Cookie Jar Toons block. The series was also available on Netflix, containing the 20 episodes. In December 2018, reruns of the series began airing on Starz. Later starting on September 3, 2019, the show aired its reruns on the streaming channel called Pluto TV for the first time since another Sonic cartoon Sonic SatAM aired back on sometime 2017. In the UK, Channel 4 and Pop re-aired the show with the \\"Sonic Says\\" segments restored. In Italy, the show aired on Italia 1. The show was re-aired on in Australia Saturday mornings on Network Ten as part of Cheez TV from 1993 to 1999, and also aired on Nick Jr. and Disney Channel. In Brazil, the show aired in January 1996, on Rede Globo on the block Colossus TV. Only the first 22 of 65 episodes aired in Brazilian Portuguese, as well as the Christmas special. The show also aired in Sweden on TV3, in The Netherlands on RTL4, in Germany on RTL II and in 2005 in Arab countries on Spacetoon. The series also aired on KidsCo, like with many other DIC-produced cartoons. =Home media= North America In 1994, Buena Vista Home Video through their DIC Toon-Time Video label, released 6 VHS tapes of the series each containing 2 episodes. Shout! Factory have released all 65 episodes of Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog on DVD in Region 1 in three volume sets. The first volume, released on July 17, 2007, features the first 22 episodes along with two featurettes: \\"A Conversation With Artist Milton Knight\\" and \\"How to Draw Sonic the Hedgehog\\". The second volume was released on December 9, 2008, and features episodes 23‚Äì44 with the featurette \\"How to Draw Dr. Robotnik\\". The third volume contains the final 21 episodes of the series, plus the \\"Sonic Christmas Blast\\" special and the featurette \\"How to Draw Tails\\". These episodes were not compiled in the correct airdate order in the final volume. These sets were discontinued in 2012 along with Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Underground after Shout!'s deal with Cookie Jar Entertainment expired. From 2007-2010, NCircle Entertainment released a number of single disc releases of the series. Invincible Pictures re-released the complete series set on August 13, 2019 (originally scheduled for April 9, 2019 and July 16, 2019).https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07KLNHNHF/metacritic_newsletter-20 The series along with its successors Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Underground is available on the streaming services CBS All Access and Tubi International Throughout 1993-1994, Abbey Home Entertainment through their Tempo Video label released 8 VHS volumes of the series each containing an assortment of episodes. PolyGram Video through their 4Front Video label would also release a VHS tape of the series in 1997. In Region 2, Delta Home Entertainment released Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog: The Complete Series on DVD in the UK on June 11, 2007. =Broadcast UK history= *Channel 4 (1993‚Äì1997) *The Children's Channel (1995‚Äì1998) *POP (2004‚Äì2010) *ITV2 (4 October 2004 ‚Äì 31 December 2004) (as part of GMTV2 kids) Reception Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog received mixed retrospective reviews. Randy Miller III of DVDTalk said, \\"While it's obvious that The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog [sic] won't ever be mentioned in the same sentence with Disney, Pixar or Studio Ghibli (except for this one), there's enough goofy fun here to entertain any resident of the 16-bit gaming era.\\" Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict criticized the show for being dated, contrived, and bloated with chili dog jokes. GamesRadar listed the show as one of \\"the worst things to happen to Sonic.\\" It commented that it \\"made Ren & Stimpy look like a rigid, strictly story driven opus of animation\\", and criticized the supporting cast as \\"wholly uninteresting, unfunny and just all around annoying.\\" Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series an overall rating of 3/5 and noted that while the show's pace is \\"frantic\\", \\"the series emphasizes positive themes for kids about personal safety and interpersonal relationships.\\" Bob Mackey of USgamer wrote that the show's attempts to emulate Looney Tunes and The Ren & Stimpy Show \\"were done in by the lack of quality control that typically plagued 65-episode syndicated series\\", and that \\"the zippy, timing-reliant slapstick Adventures relied on never stood a chance against the animation sweatshops DiC regularly used to pump out their nearly endless supply of televised content.\\" Ian Flynn, writer for the Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series by Archie Comics, remarked that Adventures was the closest to \\"[getting] Sonic right\\" despite \\"fail[ing] on the details\\", although he observed that the show's gags were \\"polarizing\\" and that the guest characters \\"ranged from tired tropes (Breezie the sexy hedgehog robot) to Saturday Night Live knockoffs (Da Bears, a pair of bears with Chicago accents)\\".

The basic Thach Weave, executed by two wingmen. The Thach Weave (also known as a Beam Defense Position) is an aerial combat tactic developed by naval aviator John S. Thach and named by James H. Flatley of the United States Navy soon after the United States' entry into World War II. It is a tactical formation maneuver in which two or more allied planes would weave in regularly intersecting flight paths to lure an enemy into focusing on one plane, while the targeted pilot's wingman would come into position to attack the pursuer. Overcoming the Wildcat's disadvantage Thach had heard, from a report published in the 22 September 1941 Fleet Air Tactical Unit Intelligence Bulletin, of the Japanese Mitsubishi Zero's extraordinary maneuverability and climb rate. Before even experiencing it for himself, he began to devise tactics meant to give the slower-turning American Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters a chance in combat. While based in San Diego, he would spend every evening thinking of different tactics that could overcome the Zero's maneuverability, and would then test them in flight the following day. Working at night with matchsticks on the table, he eventually came up with what he called \\"Beam Defense Position\\", but which soon became known as the \\"Thach Weave\\". The theory behind the beam attack was predicated on the 2 plane element of the Finger-Four Formation. It was executed either by two fighter aircraft side-by-side or by two pairs of fighters flying together. When an enemy aircraft chose one fighter as his target (the \\"bait\\" fighter; his wingman being the \\"hook\\"), the two wingmen turned in towards each other. After crossing paths, and once their separation was great enough, they would then repeat the exercise, again turning in towards each other, bringing the enemy plane into the hook's sights. A correctly executed Thach Weave (assuming the bait was taken and followed) left little chance of escape to even the most maneuverable opponent. Thach called on Ensign Edward \\"Butch\\" O'Hare, who led the second section in Thach's division, to test the idea. Thach took off with three other Wildcats in the role of defenders, O'Hare meanwhile led four Wildcats in the role of attackers. The defending aircraft had their throttles wired (to restrict their performance), while the attacking aircraft had their engine power unrestricted - this simulated an attack by superior fighter aircraft. Trying a series of mock attacks, O'Hare found that in every instance Thach's fighters, despite their power handicap, had either ruined his attack or actually maneuvered into position to shoot back. After landing, O'Hare excitedly congratulated Thach: \\"Skipper, it really worked. I couldn't make any attack without seeing the nose of one of your airplanes pointed at me.\\" In combat Thach carried out the first test of the tactic in combat during the Battle of Midway in June 1942, when a squadron of Zeroes attacked his flight of four Wildcats. Thach's wingman, Ensign R. A. M. Dibb, was attacked by a Japanese pilot and turned towards Thach, who dove under his wingman and fired at the incoming enemy aircraft's belly until its engine ignited. The maneuver soon became standard among US Navy pilots and was adopted by USAAF pilots. For instance, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Flatley's division of four Wildcats encountered Zeros from Jun'y≈ç and deployed Thach Weave defensive tactics when they attacked. One of the attackers was Lieutenant Yoshio Shiga, who gave up after he made several runs.Lundstrom (2005b). p. 436-438 Marines flying Wildcats from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal also adopted the Thach Weave. The tactic initially confounded the Japanese Zero pilots flying out of Rabaul. Sabur≈ç Sakai, the famous Japanese ace, relates their reaction to the Thach Weave when they encountered Guadalcanal Wildcats using it: https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval- aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1990/pdf/ja93.pdf \\"Naval Aviation News\\" July- August 1993. The maneuver proved so effective that American pilots also used it during the Vietnam War, and it remains an applicable dogfighting tactic today. Criticism There were also pilots who criticised the Thach Weave. One of the most notable among them was USN ace Swede Vejtasa. He argued that it is ineffective when faced against experienced attacking pilots. During the training sessions, James Flatley and Vejtasa tested the maneuver with their divisions playing attacking and defending teams. In all attempts the attackers prevailed. According to Vejtasa, he then challenged Thach himself to repeat the exercise with him in order to prove his point, however Thach ignored the challenge.Edwards (2018), p=68-71 The Japanese also eventually figured out how to break the Thach Weave. For example, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands when USN and IJN strike forces passed each other, Zeros from carrier Zuih≈ç led by Lieutenant Moriyasu Hidaka attacked USN aircraft. In response, Ensigns Al Mead and Raleigh Rhodes in their Wildcats performed the maneuver, but were outmatched and were eventually forced to ditch their ruined fighters.Edwards (2018), p=93 In another example, initially USN Lieutenant Commander Sam Silber and his wingman executed the maneuver with a relative success during the Raid on Kavieng in 1944. However, a few days later they used it again and the attackers shot down the wingman, while Silber's aircraft was severely damaged.

In his book of the same name, Minsky constructs a model of human intelligence step by step, built up from the interactions of simple parts called agents, which are themselves mindless. He describes the postulated interactions as constituting a \\"society of mind\\", hence the title. The book The work, which first appeared in 1986, was the first comprehensive description of Minsky's \\"society of mind\\" theory, which he began developing in the early 1970s. It is composed of 270 self-contained essays which are divided into 30 general chapters. The book was also made into a CD-ROM version. In the process of explaining the society of mind, Minsky introduces a wide range of ideas and concepts. He develops theories about how processes such as language, memory, and learning work, and also covers concepts such as consciousness, the sense of self, and free will; because of this, many view The Society of Mind as a work of philosophy. The book was not written to prove anything specific about AI or cognitive science, and does not reference physical brain structures. Instead, it is a collection of ideas about how the mind and thinking work on the conceptual level. The theory Minsky first started developing the theory with Seymour Papert in the early 1970s. Minsky said that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks. Nature of mind A core tenet of Minsky's philosophy is that \\"minds are what brains do\\". The society of mind theory views the human mind and any other naturally evolved cognitive systems as a vast society of individually simple processes known as agents. These processes are the fundamental thinking entities from which minds are built, and together produce the many abilities we attribute to minds. The great power in viewing a mind as a society of agents, as opposed to the consequence of some basic principle or some simple formal system, is that different agents can be based on different types of processes with different purposes, ways of representing knowledge, and methods for producing results. This idea is perhaps best summarized by the following quote: See also *Cognitive psychology *Cognitive science *Distributed cognition *DUAL (cognitive architecture) *Self-awareness *Situated cognition *The Emotion Machine *Left-brain interpreter *Dual consciousness *Divided consciousness *Lateralization of brain function *Parallel computing *Theory of mind *Philosophy of mind *Consciousness Explained References External links *Examining the Society of Mind on the MIT Media Lab *The Society of Mind text and video archive Philosophy of mind literature Artificial intelligence publications Society of Mind, The Psychology books Consciousness studies Intelligence Books about cognition ","title":"Society of Mind"},{"id":"295321","text":"Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness (born Thelma Morgan, 23 August 1904 ‚Äì 29 January 1970) was a mistress of King Edward VIII while he was still the Prince of Wales; she preceded Wallis Simpson in his affections (for whose sake Edward abdicated and became the Duke of Windsor). She was the maternal aunt of the author, fashion designer and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt. During most of Furness's relationship with the prince, she was married to a British nobleman, Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness. That marriage ended the year before her relationship with the Prince ended. Furness's first name was pronounced in Spanish fashion as \\"TEL-ma.\\"Spoto, Donald, The Decline and Fall of the House of Windsor (Pocket Books, 1996), page 208 Early life Born in Lucerne, Switzerland, Thelma Morgan was a daughter of Harry Hays Morgan Sr., an American diplomat who was U.S. consul in Buenos Aires and in Brussels, and his half-Chilean, half-Irish-American wife, Laura Delphine Kilpatrick. Married in 1893, they were divorced in 1927. Morgan's maternal grandfather was a Union general, Hugh Judson Kilpatrick (1836‚Äì1881), who was also U.S. minister to Chile, and through her maternal grandmother Luisa Fernandez de Valdivieso, who was a niece of Crescente Err√°zuriz Valdivieso, Archbishop of Santiago, she reportedly was a descendant of Spain's Royal House of Navarre. Thelma Morgan had two sisters: Gloria (her identical twin, the mother of Gloria Vanderbilt, the fashion designer and artist and mother of news anchor Anderson Cooper) and Laura Consuelo Morgan (aka Tamar), who was married to three men in succession: Count Jean de Maupas du Juglart (a French nobleman); Benjamin Thaw, Jr. of Pittsburgh; and Alfons B. Landa, president of Colonial Airlines and vice- chairman of the finance committee of the Democratic National Committee in 1948. Thelma Morgan also had a brother, Harry Hays Morgan Jr., who became a diplomat and then a minor Hollywood actor in such films as Abie's Irish Rose (1946), Joan of Arc (1948). Her half-siblings, from her father's first marriage to Mary E. Edgerton, were Constance Morgan (1887‚Äì1892) and Gladys \\"Margaret\\" Morgan (1889‚Äì1958). Film career For a very brief time, Furness was a motion picture producer and actress, after founding Thelma Morgan Pictures at the age of 17 in 1923. As she told Time magazine, \\"I am incorporating the Thelma Morgan Pictures, Inc., with $100,000 capital and will produce big, sane, and sound 'specials.' I will be my own star. Hitherto, my chief experience has been in Junior League shows.\\" Her first starring role, in 1923, was the lead in a film Aphrodite, produced by her own company and filmed at Vitagraph Studios. Furness described her leading role in Aphrodite to The New York Times as that of \\"an American girl, brought up under the sinister influence of an old Egyptian woman.\\" She also had small parts in the films Enemies of Women (1923), a William Randolph Hearst production whose cast included Lionel Barrymore and Clara Bow, So This Is Marriage? (1924), and Any Woman (1925). Marriages and relationships Morgan's first husband was James Vail Converse, a grandson of Theodore N. Vail, former president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;). They were married in Washington, D.C., on 16 February 1922 when she was 17 years old; Converse was about a decade older and had been married before. They divorced in Los Angeles, California, on 10 April 1925. By this marriage she had one stepson, James Vail Converse, Jr. (born 18 January 1918), her husband's son from his first marriage to Nadine Melbourne. After the divorce, Morgan was rumored to be engaged to the American actor Richard Bennett, the matin√©e-idol father of Hollywood film stars Constance Bennett, Joan Bennett, and Barbara Bennett. Morgan's second husband was Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness (1883‚Äì1940), the chairman of Furness Shipping Company. She was his second wife. They were married on 27 June 1926, and divorced in 1933 They had one son, William Anthony Furness, 2nd Viscount Furness, and as the former wife of a British nobleman she was known as Thelma, Viscountess Furness. By this marriage she also had a stepson, Christopher Furness, and a stepdaughter, Averill Furness. Thelma and the Prince in 1932 Furness first met the Prince of Wales at a ball at Londonderry House in 1926Vanderbilt (1959) 177. but they did not meet again until the Leicestershire Agricultural Show at Leicester on 14 June 1929.Vanderbilt (1959) 223-3; The Times, 15 June 1929, 17b. Edward asked her to dine and they met regularly until she joined him on safari in East Africa early in 1930, when a closer relationship developed.Vanderbilt (1959) 265-66. On Edward's return to Britain in April 1930 she was his regular weekend companion at the newly acquired Fort Belvedere until January 1934. She also entertained him at her London home, in Elsworthy Road, Primrose Hill, and the Furness country house, Burrough Court, in Leicestershire. On 10 January 1931 at her country house Burrough Court, near Melton Mowbray, Furness introduced the prince to her close friend Wallis Simpson and, while visiting her sister Gloria in America between January and March 1934, she was supplanted in the Prince's affection by Simpson. Reacting to Edward's coldness later that year she threw herself into a short-lived affair with Prince Aly Khan.Anthony Camp, Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction 1714‚Äì1936 (London, 2007) 397. She had openly flirted with Khan during her voyage back to the UK in March 1934 which was reported to the Prince of Wales and widely reported in the British and American press including the social gossip magazine Tatler. Furness' identical twin sister was Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, who was married to Reginald Vanderbilt and had a daughter, Gloria Vanderbilt. This makes her the maternal great-aunt of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. Final years Furness and her sister Gloria wrote a memoir called Double Exposure (1959) cited below as 'Vanderbilt'. Furness died in New York City on 29 January 1970. As her niece, Gloria Vanderbilt, recalled, \\"She dropped dead on Seventy-third and Lexington on her way to see the doctor. In her bag was this miniature teddy bear that the Prince of Wales had given her, years before, when she came to be with my mother at the custody trial, and it was worn down to the nub\\".Dominick Dunne, Fatal Charms and the Mansions of Limbo, Ballatine, 1999, page 152.

During the 1930s and 1940s he was celebrated as a portraitist, painting society figures such as Marlene Dietrich and the Duchess of Windsor. Today he is best known for his small etched prints of beautiful, idealized women ‚Äì many of them modelled by his first and second wives. Biography Born in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham on 31 October 1890, son of a coal merchant called Arthur Brockhurst, he soon showed precocious drawing skills and entered the Birmingham School of Art at the age of twelve.Anne L. Goodchild, 'Brockhurst, Gerald Leslie (1890‚Äì1978)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 13 February 2012 A pupil at the Royal Academy Schools in 1907, he won the gold medal and a travelling scholarship in 1913, enabling him to visit both France and Italy. This led to a closer study of such 15th-century artists as Piero della Francesca, Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, whose work had an abiding influence on him. In 1914 he married for the first time to a Frenchwoman, Ana√Øs Folin, whom he used as the model for most of his early etchings of young womanhood (especially from 1920 till 1934). From 1915 to 1919 Brockhurst and his wife Ana√Øs lived in Ireland, where they were friendly with the artist Augustus John and his circle. Though he tried his hand at etching in 1914, it was not until 1920 that he began his career as an etcher in earnest, eventually achieving success as both a printmaker and society portraitist. Brockhurst held his first important exhibition in 1919, in London, and after it was well received returned to live there. In 1921 he was one of the early members of the newly-formed Society of Graphic Art and exhibited with them. Throughout the 1930s he continued an increasingly successful career as a portrait artist, with notable sitters including the film stars Merle Oberon and Marlene Dietrich, as well as the Duchess of Windsor, whose husband commissioned her portrait. In 1937 Brockhurst was elected to the Royal Academy and was able to command a price of 1,000 guineas for a portrait. In the same year however details of his relationship with his young model Kathleen Woodward, whom he had renamed Dorette, were made public after she gave an interview to the Sunday Express. Brockhurst's marriage had previously come under strain in 1922 when his wife discovered his adultery with her sister, Marguerite, and now broke down acrimoniously, with Brockhurst counter-suing on the grounds of his wife's adultery. In August 1939 Brockhurst and Dorette moved to the United States, and he was eventually divorced from his first wife in 1940. In New York City, Brockhurst became both famous and rich with a series of society portraits but his printmaking output diminished, especially his etchings. He produced a few lithographs at the end of his career (around 1945). In 1951, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. In 1958, he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show To Tell The Truth, which is viewable on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-2KXzs02o4&t;=1222s Brockhurst and Dorette settled in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and Brockhurst died there on 4 May 1978.

Hart is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame.https://web.archive.org/web/20090415212412/http://www.avnawards.com/halloffame.php Director Paul Thomas Anderson has called her \\"the Meryl Streep of porn.\\" Early life Hart was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. She graduated from high school at age 16 and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas at age 19 in 1976 with a degree in theatrical arts. After school she worked in England before returning to the United States and moving to New York City. Career Hart appeared in pornographic films from 1980 until 1982 and is best known for her performances in Amanda by Night, Wanda Whips Wall Street, Roommates and A Scent of Heather. She would often portray \\"stylish native New Yorker\\" characters in her films. Around 1984, she began directing segments on the Playboy TV series Electric Blue, appearing in B-Movies and working as a stripper. During the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s she directed, edited, and produced pornographic films, while making occasional (non-sexual) cameos in both mainstream and adult productions. With the sale of VCA, her primary production company, to Hustler in 2003, and the direction of the company moving from feature, storyline-driven films to Gonzo, she left the company when her existing contract expired. Afterwards, Hart moved on to other work, including working as a tour guide at the Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas. Hart has acted in off-Broadway theater productions such as The House of Bernarda Alba, A Thurber Carnival, The Dyke And The Porn Star, and The Deep Throat Sex Scandal. Hart portrays a judge in the film Boogie Nights and also appears in another Paul Thomas Anderson movie, Magnolia. As of 2014 Hart had become a sex educator in China.

Personal life Hart married adult industry sound technician Michael Hunt in 1982, although they have since divorced. She has two sons, Chris and Max, who attended magnet schools for highly gifted students. Hart's career had a negative impact on her sons, with her saying \\"It's horrible for them... I'm their loving mommy and nobody likes to think of their parents having sex and being famous for it. I'm not ashamed of what I do. I take responsibility for who I am. I chose. From the time they were kids, my stripping gear was washed and hanging in my bathtub. At the same time I apologize to my kids for how the choices in my life have affected them. They're well adjusted and can joke with me about it: I know I'm going to spend the rest of my life on the couch\\".  Selected TV appearances  *Six Feet Under, Jean Louise Macarthur a.k.a.

He had previously served on the High Court of Australia from 1906 to 1931, including as Chief Justice from 1930. Isaacs was born in Melbourne and grew up in Yackandandah and Beechworth (in country Victoria). He began working as a schoolteacher at the age of 15, and later moved to Melbourne to work as a clerk and studied law part-time at the University of Melbourne. Isaacs was admitted to the bar in 1880, and soon became one of Melbourne's best-known barristers. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1892, and subsequently served as Solicitor- General under James Patterson, and Attorney-General under George Turner and Alexander Peacock. Isaacs entered the new federal parliament at the 1901 election, representing the Protectionist Party. He became Attorney-General of Australia in 1905, under Alfred Deakin, but the following year left politics in order to become an associate justice of the High Court. Isaacs was often in the minority in his early years on the court, particularly with regard to federalism, where he advocated the supremacy of the Commonwealth Government. The balance of the court eventually shifted, and he famously authored the majority opinion in the Engineers case of 1920, which abolished the reserved powers doctrine and fully established the paramountcy of Commonwealth law. In 1930, Prime Minister James Scullin appointed Isaacs as Chief Justice, in succession to Sir Adrian Knox. Later that year, Scullin nominated Isaacs as his preferred choice for governor-general. The selection of an Australian (rather than the usual British aristocrat) was unprecedented and highly controversial. King George V was opposed to the idea but eventually consented, and Isaacs took office in January 1931 as the first Australian-born holder of the office. He was the first governor-general to live full-time at Yarralumla, and throughout his five-year term was popular among the public for his frugality during the Depression. Isaacs was Australia's first Jewish High Court Justice, the first Jewish Chief Justice of Australia and also the first Jewish Governor-General of Australia, and in retirement became known for his strident anti-Zionism. Early life Isaacs in the 1898 Australasian Federal Convention album. Isaacs was the son of Alfred Isaacs, a tailor of Jewish ancestry from the town of M≈Çawa, Poland. Seeking better prospects, Alfred left Poland and worked his way across what is now Germany, spending some months in Berlin and Frankfurt. By 1845 he had passed through Paris and arrived to work in London, where he met Rebecca Abrahams; the two married in 1849. After news of the 1851 Victorian gold rush reached England, Australia became a very popular destination and the Isaacs decided to emigrate. By 1854 they had saved enough for the fare, departing from Liverpool in June 1854 and arriving in Melbourne in September.Gordon (1963), pp.1‚Äì5 Some time after arriving the Isaacs moved into a cottage and shopfront in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, where Alfred continued his tailoring. Isaac Alfred Isaacs was born in this cottage on 6 August 1855.Gordon (1963), pp.9‚Äì10 His family moved to various locations around Melbourne while he was young, then in 1859 moved to Yackandandah in northern Victoria, close to family friends.Gordon (1963), pp.12‚Äì14 At this time Yackandandah was a gold mining settlement of 3,000 people. Isaacs had siblings born in Melbourne and Yackandandah: John, who later became a solicitor and Victorian Member of Parliament, and sisters Carolyn and Hannah were all born in Yackandandah. A brother was born in Melbourne, and another sister was born in Yackandandah, but both died very young.Gordon (1963), pp.13,18 His first formal schooling was from sometime after 1860 at a small private establishment. At eight he won the school arithmetic prize, winning his photograph by the schoolmaster, who was also a photographer and bootmaker. Yackandandah state school was opened in 1863 and Isaacs enrolled as a pupil. Here he excelled academically, particularly in arithmetic and languages, though he was a frequent truant, walking off to spend time in the nearby mining camps. To help Isaacs gain a better quality education, in 1867, his family moved to nearby Beechworth first enrolling him in the Common school then in the Beechworth Grammar School.Gordon (1963), pp.19‚Äì20 He excelled at the Grammar School, becoming dux in his first year and winning many academic prizes. In his second year he was employed part-time as an assistant teacher at the school, and took up after school tutoring of fellow students. In September 1870, when Isaacs was just 15 years old, he passed his examination as a pupil teacher and taught at the school from then until 1873. Isaacs was next employed as an assistant teacher at the Beechworth State School, the successor to the Common school.Gordon (1963), p.23 While employed at the State School, Isaacs had his first experience of the law, as an unsuccessful litigant in an 1875 County Court case. He disputed a payment arrangement with the headmaster of his school, resigning as part of the dispute. After returning to teaching, now back at the Grammar School, he expanded his interest in the law; reading law books and attending court sittings.Gordon (1963), pp.23‚Äì25 As a child Isaacs became fluent in Russian, which his parents spoke frequently, as well as English and some German. Isaacs later gained varying degrees of proficiency in Italian, French, Greek, Hindustani and Chinese.Gordon (1963), pp.12‚Äì13,17 Legal career In 1875, he moved to Melbourne and found work at the Prothonotary's Office of the Law Department. In 1876, while still working full-time, he studied law at the University of Melbourne. He graduated in 1880 with a Master of Laws degree in 1883. He took silk as a Queen's Counsel in 1899. Political career =Victorian MP, 1892‚Äì1901= In 1892 Isaacs was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as a liberal. He was the member for Bogong from May 1892 until May 1893 and between June 1893 and May 1901. In 1893 he became Solicitor-General in the Patterson ministry. From 1894 to 1899 he was Attorney-General in the Turner ministry, and served as acting Premier on some occasions. In 1897 he was elected to the convention to approve the terms of the Australian Constitution, however he was not elected to the committee drafting the constitution, a failure Alfred Deakin attributed to \\"a plot discreditable to all engaged in it\\" and that this antagonizing and humiliating snub sharpened his \\"tendency to minute technical criticism ... so as to bring him not infrequently into collision\\" with the drafting committee. Isaacs had many reservations about the draft constitution, however he campaigned in support of it after the Australian Natives' Association gave the draft its full support, rejecting his plea to delay for further consideration.Sir Isaac Isaacs, Contribution and significance of an individual in the 1930s, Australia between the wars: 1930s, History Year 9, NSW  Online Education Home Schooling Skwirk Australia . Skwirk.com.au. Retrieved 2011-06-06. =Federal MP, 1901‚Äì1906= Isaacs during his time as a federal MP Isaacs was elected to the first federal Parliament in 1901 to the seat of Indi as a critical supporter of Edmund Barton and his Protectionist government. He was one of a group of backbenchers pushing for more radical policies and he earned the dislike of many of his colleagues through what they saw as his aloofness and rather self- righteous attitude to politics. Alfred Deakin appointed Isaacs Attorney- General in 1905 but he was a difficult colleague and in 1906 Deakin was keen to get him out of politics by appointing him to the High Court bench. He was the first serving minister to resign from the parliament. High Court, 1906‚Äì1931 Isaacs as a High Court judge On the High Court, Isaacs joined H. B. Higgins as a radical minority on the court in opposition to the chief justice, Sir Samuel Griffith. He served on the court for 24 years, acquiring a reputation as a learned and radical but uncollegial justice. Isaacs was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King's Birthday Honours of 1928 for his service on the High Court. Isaacs is one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the court; the others were Edmund Barton, Richard O'Connor, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. He was also one of two to have served in the Parliament of Victoria, along with Higgins. In April 1930, the Labor Prime Minister, James Scullin, appointed the 75-year-old Isaacs as chief justice, succeeding Sir Adrian Knox. Governor-General, 1931‚Äì1936 Isaacs in his viceregal uniform, standing with his wife Shortly after Isaacs became Chief Justice, the office of governor-general fell vacant and, after Cabinet discussion, Scullin offered the post to Isaacs. Although the proposal was supposed to be confidential until communicated to King George V, word got out. While Isaacs was personally esteemed, public opinion divided strongly over whether a governor-general should be an Australian, with perceived risks of local political bias. Scullin personally advised the King to make the appointment during his 1930 trip to Europe and, although the King shared the concern about local political bias, he reluctantly accepted Scullin's advice. Isaacs' appointment was announced in December 1930, and he was sworn in on 22 January 1931. He was the first Australian-born governor-general. Thus Isaacs agreed to a reduction in salary and conducted the office with great frugality. He gave up his official residences in Sydney and Melbourne and most official entertaining. Although he was sworn into office in the chamber of the Victorian Legislative Council in Melbourne, rather than in Parliament House in Canberra, he was the first governor-general to live permanently at Government House, Canberra. This was well-received with the public, as was Isaacs' image of rather austere dignity. Isaacs was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in April 1932. His term as governor-general concluded on 23 January 1936, and he retired to Victoria. In 1937, he was further honoured with the award of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. Personal life Isaacs married Deborah \\"Daisy\\" Jacobs, daughter of a tobacco merchant, at her parents' home in St Kilda on 18 July 1888. They had two daughters, one born in 1890 and the other in 1892. The daughters were Marjorie Isaacs Cohen who died in 1968 and was survived by a son (Thomas B. Cohen), and Nancy Isaacs Cullen. Lady Isaacs died at Bowral, New South Wales in 1960. Later life and death Isaacs was 81 when his term ended in 1936, but his public life was far from over. He remained active in various causes for another decade and wrote frequently on matters of constitutional law. In the 1940s he became embroiled in controversy with the Jewish community both in Australia and internationally through his outspoken opposition to Zionism. His principal critic was Julius Stone.Julius Stone, \\"Stand up and be counted!\\" An open letter to the Rt Hon Sir Isaac Isaacs on the occasion of the 26th anniversary of the Jewish National Home, 1944. Isaacs was supported by Rabbi Jacob Danglow (1880‚Äì1962) and Harold Boas. Isaacs insisted that Judaism was a religious identity and not a national or ethnic one. He opposed the notion of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Isaacs said \\"[p]olitical Zionism to which I am irrevocably opposed for the reasons which will be found clearly stated, must be sharply distinguished from religious and cultural Zionism to which I am strongly attached.\\"Isaacs, pp. 7‚Äì8. Isaacs opposed Zionism partly because he disliked nationalism of all kinds and saw Zionism as a form of Jewish national chauvinism‚Äîand partly because he saw the Zionist agitation in Palestine as disloyalty to the British Empire, to which he was devoted. Following the King David Hotel bombing in 1946, he wrote that \\"the honour of Jews throughout the world demands the renunciation of political Zionism\\". Isaacs' main objections to Political Zionism were: # \\"A negation of Democracy, and an attempt to revert to the Church-State of bygone ages. # Provocative anti-Semitism. # Unwarranted by the Balfour Declaration, the Mandate, or any other right; contrary to Zionist assurances to Britain and to the Arabs and in present conditions unjust to other Palestinians politically and to other religions. # As regards unrestricted immigration, a discriminatory and an undemocratic camouflage for a Jewish State. # An obstruction to the consent of the Arabs to the peaceful and prosperous settlement in Palestine of hundreds of thousands of suffering European Jews, the victims of Nazi atrocities; and provocative of Muslim antagonism within and beyond the Empire, and consequently a danger to its integrity and safety. # Inconsistent in demanding on one hand, on a basis of a separate Jewish nationality everywhere Jews are found, Jewish domination in Palestine, and at the same time claiming complete Jewish equality elsewhere than in Palestine, on the basis of a nationality common to the citizens of every faith.\\"Isaacs Isaacs said \\"the Zionist movement as a whole...now places its own unwarranted interpretation on the Balfour Declaration, and makes demands that are arousing the antagonism of the Muslim world of nearly 400 millions, thereby menacing the safety of our Empire, endangering world peace and imperiling some of the most sacred associations of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths. Besides their inherent injustice to others these demands would, I believe, seriously and detrimentally affect the general position of Jews throughout the world\\".Isaacs, pp. 8‚Äì9. In his later years, Isaacs became embroiled in legal battles with Edna Davis, the wife of his brother John. He forced her out of the family home, reclaimed her wedding ring, and finally had her declared a vexatious litigant. Isaacs died at his home in South Yarra, Victoria, in the early hours of 11 February 1948, at the age of 92. He was the last surviving member of Alfred Deakin's 1905‚Äì1906 Cabinet. The Commonwealth government accorded him a state funeral, held on 13 February, and he was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery after a synagogue service. Honours In May 1949 he was honoured with the naming of the Australian Electoral Division of Isaacs in the outer southern suburbs of Melbourne. At a redistribution in November 1968, the electorate was abolished and a separate Division of Isaacs was created in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It exists to this day. The Canberra suburb of Isaacs was named after him in 1966. In 1973 Isaacs was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.Australian stamp. None. Retrieved 2011-06-06.

Newman, editor Matt Murphy, and artist Bob Fujitani. The character first appeared in Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom #1 in 1962 by Gold Key Comics and has since appeared in other incarnations in books published by Valiant Comics in the 1990s, Dark Horse Comics in the 2000s, and Dynamite Entertainment in the 2010s. Publication history =Gold Key Comics= Cover to Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom #14 (Sept. 1965) Solar was created in 1962 by writer Paul S. Newman and editor Matt Murphy, with illustrations from artist Bob Fujitani, for the Silver Age comic book publisher Gold Key, a new company formed by Western Publishing who, earlier that year, had ended its business arrangement with Dell Comics. The character premiered in issue #1 of Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom in Summer 1962 (cover date October 1962) in the first batch of comics released by Gold Key, with Solar being Gold Key's first original character. Though Gold Key did not have as large a distribution network as Dell Comics, their comics stood out on the newsstand shelves because of their cover art and their 12 cent price, a bargain when contrasted with the 15 cent price on Dell's books. The first two issues of Solar appeared with cover paintings by Richard M. Powers; after the second issue the cover paintings were done by George Wilson. The interior artwork in the first few issues also had unique features: the superhero, Dr. Solar, did not have a costume until the fifth issue, rectangular word balloons and no black holding line around each panel. Following the practice of Dell Comics, and thanks to Western Publishing's reputation of publishing other child-friendly books, Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom was able to be distributed without the Comics Code Authority symbol. The original creative team of writer Paul S. Newman and artist Bob Fujitani lasted until issue #5 when Frank Bolle took over the art work. With the exception of issue #7 written by Otto Binder, Newman wrote the comic book until issue #10, when Dick Wood took over for the remainder of the series. Other artists who contributed included: Mel Crawford, Win Mortimer, Alden McWilliams (issues #20-23), Ernie Col√≥n (issues #24-26), Jos√© Delbo (issue #27). The popularity of this original series peaked in 1965. With a price increase to 15 cents with issue #25 in 1968, and a general decline in sales in the comic book industry in the late-1960s, Gold Key cancelled the series in 1969 with issue #27. In one of Gold Key's few cross-overs, Doctor Solar re-appeared in the 1975 comic book The Occult Files of Doctor Spektor #14. In the early-1980s, with another industry contraction, Gold Key withdrew from distribution to newsstands and began publishing comics under the Whitman Comics imprint. These were distributed to retail stores (e.g. department stores, toy stores, specialty comic book stores) in poly-bagged packages of three comic books. For this purpose, Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom was restarted at #28 (cover date April 1981) with Roger McKenzie writing and Dan Spiegle drawing. This initiative was short-lived and the series was cancelled again after only four issues. =Valiant Comics= Solar next appeared in 1991 when Valiant Comics restarted the series with a new premise. Western Publishing had been distributing Valiant's Nintendo and World Wrestling Entertainment comics and agreed to allow Valiant to license characters from the Gold Key library. Valiant intended to use successful Gold Key characters to launch a superhero line of comics and spin-off original characters under the direction of editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, who had previously, unsuccessfully launched the Marvel Comics superhero line New Universe. With Valiant's video game and wrestling comics experiencing limited success, they launched the new line in 1991 with Magnus, Robot Fighter, followed by Solar, Man of the Atom a couple of months later. The new Solar series began with three multi-part stories all written by Jim Shooter: \\"Alpha and Omega\\" with artwork by Barry Windsor-Smith and Bob Layton, spanned the first ten issues and told of the origin story of how the protagonist, Phil Seleski, became Solar, until the time he accidentally destroys the world; \\"Second Death\\", with artwork by Don Perlin, Bob Layton and Thomas Ryder, spanned the first four issues and tells of Seleski's attempt to prevent another version of himself from destroying the world; \\"First Strike\\", with artwork by Don Perlin and Stan Drake, spanned issues #5 to #8 and follows Solar as he fights spider aliens. These first year stories included first appearances by Eternal Warrior, the Harbinger Foundation, Geomancers, and the X-O Manowar armor - all of which would be spun off into their own series. Valiant Comics' version of Solar by Barry Windsor-Smith With its US$1.75 cover price, and benefiting from Valiant's heavy promotion of its superhero line and its combined direct and newsstand distribution network, Solar was returning a small profit with print runs of approximately 60,000 copies of each issue in the first year. The second year began with two tie-in issues with the \\"Unity\\" storyline with Solar appearing in the other Valiant titles that also tied into that storyline. The popularity of \\"Unity\\" significantly raised demand for Valiant products, including new issues and back issues. Solar's print run rapidly grew to peak at 360,000 copies of issue #23, which by that time, mid-1993, had a cover price of US$2.25. Following Shooter's ouster from Valiant Comics in 1992, Kevin VanHook took over the writing job and Solar editor Bob Layton also became Valiant's editor-in-chief. Steve Ditko pencilled issues #14 and #15 before Pater Grau took over until #35. During that time Solar appeared in other Valiant titles, such as Archer & Armstrong, Rai, Secret Weapons, X-O Manowar, and Harbinger Files, as well as Deathmate, and The Chaos Effect. After Acclaim Entertainment took over ownership of Valiant in Summer 1994, VanHook continued as writer but the penciller job was divided between Andrew Wendell and Louis Small until issue #41 at the end of the year. Stephen D. Sullivan wrote the next two issues with Scott Rosema as penciller, followed by two issues by writer Christopher Priest and penciller Rik Levins. Acclaim launched a publicity strategy dubbed \\"Birthquake\\" which attracted high profile comic book writers and artists to work on their titles. Dan Jurgens took over as writer and penciller, with Dick Giordano as inker, beginning with issue #46 until issue #51 when Tom Grindberg took over as penciller for four issues. As sales continued to fall, Tony Bedard took over as writer from #52, with Aaron Lopresti, Mike Manley and Jeff Johnson dividing the penciller job, until the series was cancelled with issue #60 in 1996. =Acclaim Comics= Acclaim cancelled the remainder of the Valiant titles in 1996 and restarted a select few under a new creative direction with Fabian Nicieza as editor-in-chief. They published the one-shot Solar, Man of the Atom with a May 1997 cover date, written by Warren Ellis, and penciled by Darick Robertson. It was followed by a second one-shot Solar, Man of the Atom: Revelations (cover date November 1997) by Jim Krueger, Patrick Zircher and Jimmy Palmiotti. Acclaim's final attempt at Solar was the four-issue mini- series Solar, Man of the Atom: Hell on Earth by Christopher Priest, Patrick Zircher, ChrisCross, and Romeo Tanghal. While Acclaim continued to publish comics for several more years, the rights to Solar lapsed and reverted to Classic Media, which had acquired Western Publishing's properties in 2001. =Dark Horse Comics= Writer Jim Shooter and artist Dennis Calero at a signing for Dark Horse Comics' Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom #1, at Midtown Comics Times Square, July 17, 2010 Amid an industry-wide resurgence in the popularity of publishing high quality reprint collections, such as Marvel Golden Age Masterworks and the DC Archive series, Dark Horse Comics acquired the rights to reprint Dell and Gold Key comics. Dark Horse published a four volume hard-cover series that reprinted the entire Gold Key Doctor Solar series, including his appearance in The Occult Files of Dr. Spektor #14, with the first volume being released in 2004 covering issue 1 to 7. The second and third volumes were released in 2005 and covered issues 8 to 22. The final volume was released two years later, in 2007, covering issues 23 to 31 as well as the Dr. Spektor issue. In 2008 Dark Horse Comics announced that the company intended to publish an original Solar series, as well as other Gold Key characters. A year later, at the San Diego Comic Con, Dark Horse announced Jim Shooter would be the new series' writer. The new Solar series ran for eight issues, plus a preview issue. A trade paperback collection was released that collected the preview issue and #1-4 of the comic in its first volume, and the remaining issues (#5-8) in its second volume. =Dynamite Entertainment= In 2013 Dynamite Entertainment acquired the publishing rights to Solar, Turok, Magnus: Robot Fighter and Doctor Spektor. Dynamite released a Solar: Man of The Atom ongoing series which lasted for twelve issues from March 2014 to February 2015. Fictional character biography =Gold Key Comics= The original Doctor Solar was a physicist named Dr. Phillip Solar who attempted to assist fellow worker Dr. Bently avert an imminent meltdown of the nuclear power plant where they worked. It had been sabotaged by Dr. Rasp, agent of an evil mastermind named Nuro. Bently lost his life trying to prevent the meltdown, while Solar absorbed a massive amount of radiation in the process. He survived and discovered that he had gained the ability to convert his body into any kind of nuclear energy. Using his new powers, Solar began searching for Nuro, who would become his nemesis. Nuro used a robot double of himself called Orun and later transferred his mind into it, calling himself King Cybernoid. The character was initially envisioned as a \\"post-modern superhero\\" who didn't wear a traditional superhero outfit, but readers wrote in and demanded a costume. In the fifth issue, Doctor Solar donned a superhero costume, and became known as \\"The Man of the Atom\\". In addition, his skin turned green whenever he used his powers. At about that same time, in an \\"Ask Doctor Solar\\" column, Gold Key Comics changed Solar's first name from Phillip to Raymond. =Valiant Comics= This version, known simply as Solar, was a physicist named Phil Seleski. Seleski was a fan of the Gold Key line, especially the adventures of Doctor Solar. One day, Seleski and his colleagues were testing a new type of fusion reactor located in the town of Muskogee. When an accidental breach threatened to obliterate the entire city, Seleski rushed to shut down the reactor. He succeeded, but he was exposed to lethal doses of radiation in the process. However, this did not prove to be fatal, but rather, gave him the ability to manipulate all forms of matter and energy. Seleski tried to use his powers for the good of mankind by attempting to destroy the world's supply of nuclear weapons. However, the U.S. government attempted to stop him and their efforts caused Seleski to lose control of his powers, which in turn caused Earth to fall into a giant black hole. Seleski was thrown several weeks back in time. The guilt over his role in the destruction of his world caused him to split into two beings: Doctor Solar, who believed himself to be Seleski's childhood hero; and Phil Seleski, who retained all the memories of the original. Seleski sought to prevent the accident that gave him his powers from taking place. His efforts were complicated by the presence of Doctor Solar, who was convinced that Seleski was a dangerous criminal. Eventually, Seleski convinced his alter-ego that they needed to work together, and the two of them fused with the past version of Seleski and prevented the accident. In the process, they discovered that Seleski's fusion reactor was actually a \\"wish machine\\" that allowed anyone in close proximity to change the universe in any way they saw fit. Before the original accident, Seleski wished that he could become his childhood superhero. As a result, the reactor simulated the events that gave the original Doctor Solar his powers. Seleski also found out that he did not travel to the past but instead recreated his universe after falling into the black hole. However, this universe was now populated by a large number of super-powered beings. The revelations inspired Seleski to take up the mantle of his childhood hero, becoming known as Solar, Man of the Atom. Solar went on to have several adventures, fighting a wide variety of threats such as the Spider Aliens, malevolent Harbingers and Mothergod. He survived for several centuries and blew himself up in 4000 A.D. in an effort to stop the Spider Alien invasion of Earth. =Acclaim Comics= The Seleski twins, Frank and Helena, were transformed into the Acclaim Universe's Solar after Phil Seleski left them a portion of his powers. Powers and abilities Dr. Solar is a trained scientist, specializing in nuclear physics. Because he has been irradiated, he is now, in effect, a living nuclear battery. No longer dependent on food and water ‚Äì in fact, no longer having either a heartbeat or a human metabolism ‚Äì he obtains the energy he needs by exposing himself to nuclear radiation. After absorbing this radiation, especially in large amounts, his skin turns green. It is often several hours before his skin color returns to normal, especially if he has absorbed a larger amount of energy than normal. As a result, he has to wear clothing impregnated with cadmium and lead, and wear specially made dark glasses to protect his co-workers from radiation poisoning. The uniform he later adopts is also lined with cadmium and lead. A visor shields his eyes. On his belt there is almost always a small pouch containing radioisotopes, in pill or capsule form, which he can swallow to boost his energy level in an emergency. As with any battery, Solar becomes weaker as he draws upon his stored-up energy for various purposes. If too much energy is expended, however, Solar weakens rapidly. More than once, he has nearly died when his energy reserves were depleted too rapidly or too greatly. In some cases, Solar has absorbed so much energy that he has grown to an enormous size, only to shrink back to normal dimensions once the excess energy has been expended. In one case, he absorbed energy from a pile of nuclear waste that his arch-enemy, Nuro, was using to power a gold accumulator in the Pacific Ocean. Fearing that he would lose so much energy that he would not be able to maintain control over his own atomic structure, Solar was forced to retreat. He later resolved this problem, and then returned to destroy the accumulator, thereby foiling Nuro's plot. Solar can draw upon his stored-up energy at will, releasing and directing it into virtually any form he chooses. He can also use it to defy gravity, thus giving him the power of flight. He can also produce a \\"heat exchange\\" effect to reduce an object's temperature to absolute zero in a matter of seconds. He can also manipulate matter at the atomic and sub-atomic level, although the energy cost is usually quite high. In one instance, Solar was able to change a huge iron meteorite into titanium through a form of neutron bombardment called \\"transmutation,\\" although his nuclear reserves were almost fatally depleted in the process. (He was able to restore his energy by flying a small satellite rocket into the Van Allen radiation belt.) Finally, if his energy level is high enough, he can travel through time, and has done so on several occasions. As a scientist at a government nuclear research facility known as \\"Atom Valley,\\" Solar is constantly engaged in nuclear and nuclear-related research. His unique powers enable him to work without the need for lead shielding, since he can absorb radiation and store it up for his own use. In addition, in his secret identity of \\"The Man of the Atom,\\" Solar is always ready to use his powers to aid the public when the need arises.

He was a member of the House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Zweibr√ºcken, a branch of the House of Wittelsbach. Biography =Early life= Maximilian, the son of the Count Palatine Frederick Michael of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld and Maria Francisca of Sulzbach, was born on 27 May 1756 at Schwetzingen, between Heidelberg and Mannheim. After the death of his father in 1767, he was left at first without parental supervision, since his mother had been banished from her husband's court after giving birth to a son fathered by an actor. Maximilian was carefully educated under the supervision of his uncle, Duke Christian IV of Zweibr√ºcken, who settled him in the H√¥tel des Deux-Ponts. He became Count of Rappoltstein in 1776 and took service in 1777 as a colonel in the French army. He rose rapidly to the rank of major-general. From 1782 to 1789, he was stationed at Strasbourg. During his time at the University of Strasbourg, Klemens von Metternich, the future Austrian chancellor, was for some time accommodated by Prince Maximilian. By the outbreak of the French Revolution, Maximilian exchanged the French for the Austrian service and took part in the opening campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. =Duke of Zweibr√ºcken and Elector of Bavaria and the Palatinate= Maximilian Joseph On 1 April 1795, Maximilian succeeded his brother Charles II as Duke of Zweibr√ºcken, however his duchy was entirely occupied by revolutionary France at the time. On 16 February 1799, he became Elector of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg upon the extinction of the Palatinate-Sulzbach line at the death of Elector Charles Theodore of Bavaria. The new elector Maximilian IV Joseph found the Bavarian army in abject condition on his accession to the throne: Hardly any of the units were at full strength, the Rumford uniforms were unpopular and impractical, and the troops were badly-trained. The young Prince-Elector, who had served under the Ancien R√©gime in France as a colonel in the Royal Deux- Ponts regiment, made the reconstruction of the army a priority. Maximilian's sympathy with France and the ideas of enlightenment at once manifested itself when he acceded to the throne of Bavaria. In the newly organized ministry, Count Max Josef von Montgelas, who, after falling into disfavour with Charles Theodore, had acted for a time as Maximilian Joseph's private secretary, was the most potent influence, wholly \\"enlightened\\" and French. Agriculture and commerce were fostered, the laws were ameliorated, a new criminal code drawn up, taxes and imposts equalized without regard to traditional privileges, while a number of religious houses were suppressed and their revenues used for educational and other useful purposes. He closed the University of Ingolstadt in May 1800 and moved it to Landshut. In foreign affairs, Maximilian Joseph's attitude was, from the German point of view, less commendable. He never had any sympathy with the growing sentiment of German nationality, and his attitude was dictated by wholly dynastic, or at least Bavarian, considerations. Until 1813, he was the most faithful of Napoleon's German allies, the relationship cemented by the marriage of his eldest daughter to Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. His reward came with the Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805), by the terms of which he was to receive the royal title and important territorial acquisitions in Swabia and Franconia to round off his kingdom. He assumed the title of king on 1 January 1806. On 15 March, he ceded the Duchy of Berg to Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat. =King of Bavaria= Max I Joseph, Bust by Ernst von Bandel (1826) The new King of Bavaria was the most important of the princes belonging to the Confederation of the Rhine, and remained Napoleon's ally until the eve of the Battle of Leipzig, when by the Treaty of Ried (8 October 1813) he made the guarantee of the integrity of his kingdom the price of his joining the Allies. On 14 October, Bavaria made a formal declaration of war against Napoleonic France. The treaty was passionately backed by Crown Prince Ludwig and by Marshal von Wrede. By the first Treaty of Paris (3 June 1814), however, he ceded Tyrol to Austria in exchange for the former Grand Duchy of W√ºrzburg. At the Congress of Vienna, which he attended in person, Maximilian had to make further concessions to Austria, ceding Salzburg and the regions of Innviertel and Hausruckviertel in return for the western part of the old Palatinate. The king fought hard to maintain the contiguity of the Bavarian territories as guaranteed at Ried but the most he could obtain was an assurance from Metternich in the matter of the Baden succession, in which he was also doomed to be disappointed. cites Baden History, iii, 506.

Presentation medal of the Bavarian Parliament (Bayerische St√§ndeversammlung) 1819 to their King Maximilian I Joseph, on the first anniversary of the constitution of 1818, reverse. At Vienna and afterwards Maximilian sturdily opposed any reconstitution of Germany which should endanger the independence of Bavaria, and it was his insistence on the principle of full sovereignty being left to the German reigning princes that largely contributed to the loose and weak organization of the new German Confederation. The Federative Constitution of Germany (8 June 1815) of the Congress of Vienna was proclaimed in Bavaria, not as a law but as an international treaty. It was partly to secure popular support in his resistance to any interference of the federal diet in the internal affairs of Bavaria, partly to give unity to his somewhat heterogeneous territories, that Maximilian on 26 May 1818 granted a liberal constitution to his people. Montgelas, who had opposed this concession, had fallen in the previous year, and Maximilian had also reversed his ecclesiastical policy, signing on 24 October 1817 a concordat with Rome by which the powers of the clergy, largely curtailed under Montgelas's administration, were restored. The new parliament proved to be more independent than he had anticipated and in 1819 Maximilian resorted to appealing to the powers against his own creation; but his Bavarian \\"particularism\\" and his genuine popular sympathies prevented him from allowing the Carlsbad Decrees to be strictly enforced within his dominions. The suspects arrested by order of the Mainz Commission he was accustomed to examine himself, with the result that in many cases the whole proceedings were quashed, and in not a few the accused dismissed with a present of money. Maximilian died at Nymphenburg Palace, in Munich, on 13 October 1825 and was succeeded by his son Ludwig I. Maximilian is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich. Cultural legacy Monument of Max I Joseph in front of the National Theatre, Munich Under the reign of Maximilian Joseph the Bavarian Secularization (1802‚Äì1803) led to the nationalisation of cultural assets of the Church. The Protestants were emancipated. In 1808 he founded the Academy of Fine Arts Munich. The city of Munich was extended by the first systematic expansion with the new Brienner Strasse as core. In 1810 Max Joseph ordered construction of the National Theatre Munich in French neo-classic style. The monument Max-Joseph Denkmal before the National Theatre was created in the middle of the square Max-Joseph-Platz as a memorial for King Maximilian Joseph by Christian Daniel Rauch and carried out by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier. It was only revealed in 1835 since the king had rejected to be eternalized in sitting position. In 1801 he led the rescue operation when a glassmaker's workshop collapsed, saving the life of Joseph von Fraunhofer, a 14-year-old orphan apprentice. Max Joseph donated books and directed the glassmaker to give Fraunhofer time to study. Fraunhofer went on to become one of the most famous optical scientists and artisans in history, inventing the spectroscope and spectroscopy, making Bavaria noted for fine optics, and joining the nobility before his death at age 39. He was elected a Royal Fellow of the Royal Society in 1802. Private life and family As a monarch, Max Joseph was very close to the citizens, walked freely along the streets of Munich without great accompaniment, and conversed with his people in a casual manner. Regardless, he was somewhat eccentric, like some of his descendants and successors. Maximilian married twice and had children by both marriages: Marie Anne, Sophie and Ludovika) by Stieler His first wife was Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, daughter of Prince George William of Hesse- Darmstadt (14 April 1765 ‚Äì 30 March 1796). They were married on 30 September 1785 in Darmstadt. They had five children: * Ludwig I of Bavaria (25 August 1786 ‚Äì 29 February 1868), married Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. * Princess Augusta Amalia Ludovika, (21 June 1788 ‚Äì 13 May 1851), married Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg. * Princess Amalie Marie Auguste (9 October 1790 ‚Äì 24 January 1794), died in childhood. * Princess Caroline Augusta (8 February 1792 ‚Äì 9 February 1873), married William I of W√ºrttemberg, and then Francis II of Austria. * Prince Karl Theodor Maximilian (7 July 1795 ‚Äì 16 August 1875), married morganatically to Marie-Anne-Sophie Petin. Maximilian's second wife was Karoline of Baden, daughter of Margrave Karl Ludwig of Baden (13 July 1776 ‚Äì 13 November 1841). They were married on 9 March 1797 in Karlsruhe. They had eight children. King Maximilian was also the father of two sets of twin girls, Elisabeth and Amalie born in 1801, as well as Sophie and Marie Anne born in 1805. * Stillborn son (5 September 1799) * Prince Maximilian Joseph Karl Friedrich (28 October 1800 ‚Äì 12 February 1803), died in infancy. * Princess Elisabeth Ludovika (\\"Elise\\") (13 November 1801 ‚Äì 14 December 1873) twin sister of Amalie Auguste.

She may be identical with Cleopatra V. There were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called Cleopatra Tryphaena (‚Äúdainty‚Äù): Tryphaena, daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon and Cleopatra III Tryphaena was a sister of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, Ptolemy X Alexander I, Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene. If this Tryphaena also bore the name Cleopatra, has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married Antiochus VIII Grypus, king of Syria, in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: Seleucus VI Epiphanes, the twin Antiochus XI Epiphanes and Philip I Philadelphus, Demetrius III Eucaerus, and Antiochus XII Dionysus. The couple also had a daughter called Laodice. Tryphaena was killed in Antioch (Greek: ŒëŒΩœÑŒπœåœáŒµŒπŒ±), capital of Syria, by Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena in 111 BC., our only source for these events. Cleopatra V Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes Cleopatra V Tryphaena was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called Cleopatra Tryphaena. Cleopatra Tryphaena, daughter of Cleopatra V and Ptolemy XII Auletes She is called Cleopatra VI Tryphaena by some modern historians and she would have been an older sister of the famous Cleopatra VII.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2004. If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by Porphyry. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), Berenice IV took control of Ptolemaic Egypt and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena.Porphyry, cited by Felix Jacoby, Fragmente der griechischen Historiker, no. 260 F 2, 14. Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate.. This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter.

Earrings are worn by both sexes and have been used by different civilizations in different times. Locations for piercings other than the earlobe include the rook, tragus, and across the helix (see image at right). The simple term \\"ear piercing\\" usually refers to an earlobe piercing, whereas piercings in the upper part of the external ear are often referred to as \\"cartilage piercings\\". Cartilage piercings are more complex to perform than earlobe piercings and take longer to heal. Earring components may be made of any number of materials, including metal, plastic, glass, precious stone, beads, wood, bone, and other materials. Designs range from small loops and studs to large plates and dangling items. The size is ultimately limited by the physical capacity of the earlobe to hold the earring without tearing. However, heavy earrings worn over extended periods of time may lead to stretching of the earlobe and the piercing. History Akrotiri, Thera (Cyclades) Greece, 1650-1625 BCE. Ear piercing is one of the oldest known forms of body modification, with artistic and written references from cultures around the world dating back to early history. Gold earrings, along with other jewelry made of gold, lapis lazuli, and carnelian were found in the ancient sites in Lothal, India, and Sumerian Royal Cemetery at Ur from the Early Dynastic period. Gold, silver and bronze hoop earrings were prevalent in the Minoan Civilization (2000‚Äì1600 BCE) and examples can be seen on frescoes on the Aegean island of Santorini, Greece. During the late Minoan and early Mycenaean periods of Bronze Age Greece hoop earrings with conical pendants were fashionable. Early evidence of earrings worn by men can be seen in archeological evidence from Persepolis in ancient Persia. The carved images of soldiers of the Persian Empire, displayed on some of the surviving walls of the palace, show them wearing an earring. Howard Carter writes in his description of Tutankhamun's tomb that the Pharaoh's earlobes were perforated, but no earrings were inside the wrappings, although the tomb contained some. The burial mask's ears were perforated as well, but the holes were covered with golden discs. That implies that at the time, earrings were only worn in Egypt by children, much like in Egypt of Carter's times.The Tomb of Tut-Ankh-Amen: Discovered by the Late Earl of Carnarvon and Howard Carter, Volume 3, pp. 74‚Äì75 Other early evidence of earring-wearing is evident in the Biblical record. In Exodus 32:1‚Äì4, it is written that while Moses was up on Mount Sinai, the Israelites demanded that Aaron make a god for them. It is written that he commanded them to bring their sons' and daughters' earrings (and other pieces of jewelry) to him in order that he might comply with their demand (). By the classical period, including in the Middle East, as a general rule, they were considered exclusively female ornaments. In Greece and Rome also, earrings were worn mainly by women, and the wearing of them by a man was often spoken of as distinctively oriental. The practice of wearing earrings was a tradition for Ainu men and women,Sherrow, Victoria (2001). For appearance' sake: the historical encyclopedia of good looks, beauty, and grooming. Greenwood Publishing Group via Google Books. p. 101. but the Government of Meiji Japan forbade Ainu men to wear earrings in the late-19th century. Earrings were also commonplace among nomadic Turkic tribes. Lavish ear ornaments have remained popular in India from ancient times to the present day. In Western Europe, earrings became fashionable among English courtiers and gentlemen in the 1590s during the English Renaissance. A document published in 1577 by clergyman William Harrison, Description of England, states \\"Some lusty courtiers and gentlemen of courage do wear either rings of gold, stones or pearls in their ears.\\" Among sailors, a pierced earlobe was a symbol that the wearer had sailed around the world or had crossed the equator. Detail from Chandos portrait (1660s) of William Shakespeare; earrings were emblematic of poets at the time.Tarnya Cooper (ed), Searching for Shakespeare, National Portrait Gallery and Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 54‚Äì61 By the late 1950s or early 1960s, the practice re-emerged in the Western world. Teenage girls were known to hold ear piercing parties, where they performed the procedure on one another. By the mid-1960s, some physicians offered ear piercing as a service. Simultaneously, Manhattan jewelry stores were some of the earliest commercial, non-medical locations for getting an ear piercing. In the late 1960s, ear piercing began to make inroads among men through the hippie and gay communities, although they had been popular among sailors for decades (or longer). Traditionally, a right-side piercing identified a man as gay as part of LGBT ‚Äúculture and code‚Äù to secretly identify oneself to the community. The left-side is widely accepted as heterosexual or straight while dual piercings indicate homosexuality or other varied expressions of sexuality. There has begun to be some challenging of these norms in recent years, though the standard view remains. By the early 1970s, ear piercing was common among women, thus creating a broader market for the procedure. Department stores throughout the country would hold ear piercing events, sponsored by earring manufacturers. At these events, a nurse or other trained person would perform the procedure, either pushing a sharpened and sterilized starter earring through the earlobe by hand, or using an ear-piercing instrument modified from the design used by physicians. In the late 1970s, amateur piercings, sometimes with safety pins or multiple piercings, became popular in the punk rock community. By the 1980s, the trend for male popular music performers to have pierced ears helped establish a fashion trend for men. This was later adopted by many professional athletes. British men started piercing both ears in the 1980s; George Michael of Wham! was a prominent example. During wham! He frequently wore small gold hoop earrings. When he then went on the become a solo artist with his iconic debut album ‚ÄúFaith‚Äù he wore a cross earring on his left ear. As of now, it is widely acceptable for teenage and pre-teen boys to have both ears pierced as well simply as a fashion statement. Newborn baby girl with triple ear piercings ‚Äì Costa Rica 2012. Multiple piercings in one or both ears first emerged in mainstream America in the 1970s. Initially, the trend was for women to wear a second set of earrings in the earlobes, or for men to double-pierce a single earlobe. Asymmetric styles with more and more piercings became popular, eventually leading to the cartilage piercing trend. Double ear piercing in newborn babies is a phenomenon in Central America, in particular in Costa Rica. A variety of specialized cartilage piercings have since become popular. These include the tragus piercing, antitragus piercing, rook piercing, industrial piercing, helix piercing, orbital piercing, daith piercing, and conch piercing. In addition, earlobe stretching, while common in indigenous cultures for thousands of years, began to appear in Western society in the 1990s, and is now a fairly common sight. However, these forms of ear piercing are still infrequent compared to standard ear piercing. =Religious= According to Hindu dharmic tradition, most girls and some boys (especially the \\"twice born\\") get their ears pierced as part of a Dharmic rite known as Karnavedha before they are about five years old. Infants may get their ears pierced as early as several days after their birth. Similar customs are practiced in other Asian countries, including Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Laos, although traditionally most males wait to get their ears pierced until they have reached young adulthood. Ear piercing is mentioned in the Bible in several contexts. The most familiar refers to a Hebrew slave who was to be freed in the seventh year of servitude but wishes to continue serving his master and refuses to go free: \\"‚Ä¶his master shall take him before God. He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall then remain his slave for life\\" (Exodus 21:6). Types of earrings =Modern standard pierced earrings= Statement earrings Statement earrings can be defined as \\"earrings which invite attention from others by demonstrating bold, original, and unique designs with innovative construction and material combinations\\". They include one or more of the following design features:Pair of starter stud earrings. *Dangles *Tassels *Sparkles *Bold or striking colours * Hoops Stud/minimal earrings The main characteristic of stud earrings is the appearance of floating on the ear or earlobe without a visible (from the front) point of connection. Studs are invariably constructed on the end of a post, which penetrates straight through the ear or earlobe. The post is held in place by a removable friction back or clutch (also known as a butterfly scroll). A stud earring features a gemstone or other ornament mounted on a narrow post that passes through a piercing in the ear or earlobe, and is held in place by a fixture on the other side. Studs commonly come in the form of solitaire diamonds. Some stud earrings are constructed so that the post is threaded, allowing a screw back to hold the earring in place securely, which is useful in preventing the loss of expensive earrings containing precious stones, or made of precious metals. Hoop earrings Hoop earrings are circular or semi-circular in design and look very similar to a ring. Hoop earrings generally come in the form of a hoop of metal that can be opened to pass through the ear piercing. They are often constructed of metal tubing, with a thin wire attachment penetrating the ear. The hollow tubing is permanently attached to the wire at the front of the ear, and slips into the tube at the back. The entire device is held together by tension between the wire and the tube. Other hoop designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to stud earrings. A variation is the continuous hoop earring. In this design, the earring is constructed of a continuous piece of solid metal, which penetrates through the ear and can be rotated almost 360¬∞. One of the ends is permanently attached to a small piece of metallic tubing or a hollow metallic bead. The other end is inserted into the tubing or bead, and is held in place by tension. One special type of hoop earring is the sleeper earring, a circular wire normally made of gold, with a diameter of approximately one centimeter. Hinged sleepers, which were common in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, comprise two semi-circular gold wires connected via a tiny hinge at one end, and fastened via a small clasp at the other, to form a continuous hoop whose fastening mechanism is effectively invisible to the naked eye. Because their small size makes them unobtrusive and comfortable, and because they are normally otherwise unadorned, sleepers are so-called because they were intended to be worn at night to keep a pierced ear from closing, and were often the choice for the first set of earrings immediately following the ear piercing in the decades before ear-piercing guns using studs became commonplace, but are often a fashion choice in themselves because of their attractive simplicity and because they subtly call attention to the fact that the ear is pierced. A drop earring attaches to the earlobe and features a gemstone or ornament that dangles down from a chain, hoop, or similar object. The length of these ornaments vary from the very short to the extravagantly long. Such earrings are occasionally known as droplet earrings, dangle earrings, or pendant earrings. They also include chandelier earrings, which branch out into elaborate, multi-level pendants. Dangle earrings Traditional earrings Dangle earrings (also known as drop earrings) are designed to flow from the bottoms of the earlobes, and are available in various lengths from a centimeter or two, all the way to brushing the shoulders. They are generally attached to the ear by the use of thin wires, which go through the earlobe and connect to themselves in a small hook at the back. A variation is the French hook design, which merely hangs from the earlobe without closure, although small plastic retainers are sometimes used on ends of French hooks. Rarely, dangle earrings use the post attachment design. Barbell earrings Barbell earrings get their name from their resemblance to a barbell, generally coming in the form of a metal bar with an orb on either end. One of these orbs is affixed in place, while the other can be detached to allow the barbell to be inserted into a piercing. Several variations on this basic design exist, including barbells with curves or angles in the bar of the earring. Huggy earrings Commonly, stones are channel set in huggy earrings. Ear thread Or earthreader, ear string, threader, a chain that is thin enough to slip into the ear hole, and come back out, dangles. Sometimes, people add beads or other materials onto the chain, so the chain dangles with beads below the ear. =Body piercing jewelry used as earrings= A navel curve used as an earring with a green gemmed ear stud above it Body piercing jewelry is often used for ear piercings, and is selected for a variety of reasons including the availability of larger gauges, better piercing techniques, and a disdain for mainstream jewelry. * Captive bead rings ‚Äì Captive bead rings, often abbreviated as CBRs and sometimes called ball closure rings, are a style of body piercing jewelry that is an almost 360¬∞ ring with a small gap for insertion through the ear. The gap is closed with a small bead that is held in place by the ring's tension. Larger gauge ball closure rings exhibit considerable tension, and may require ring expanding pliers for insertion and removal of the bead. * Barbells ‚Äì Barbells are composed of a thin, straight metal rod with a bead permanently fixed to one end. The other end is threaded, either externally or tapped with an internal thread, and the other bead is screwed into place after the barbell is inserted through the ear. Since the threads on externally threaded barbells tend to irritate the piercing, internal threads have become the most common variety. Another variation are threadless barbells or press-fit jewelry, with a hollow post, a fixed back disk and a front end that is attached with a slightly bend pin that is inserted into the post.The Piercing Bible: The Definitive Guide to Safe Body Piercing, Elayne Angel Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale, 16 Feb 2011, p72 * Circular barbells ‚Äì Circular Barbells are similar to ball-closure rings, except that they have a larger gap, and have a permanently attached bead at one end, and a threaded bead at the other, like barbells. This allows for much easier insertion and removal than with ball closure rings, but at the loss of a continuous look. * Plugs ‚Äì Earplugs are short cylindrical pieces of jewelry. Some plugs have flared ends to hold them in place, others require small elastic rubber rings (O-rings) to keep them from falling out. They are usually used in large-gauge piercings. * Flesh tunnels ‚Äì Flesh tunnels, also known as eyelets or Bullet Holes, are similar to plugs; however, they are hollow in the middle. Flesh tunnels are most commonly used in larger gauge piercings either because weight is a concern to the wearer or for aesthetic reasons.

Several varieties of non-pierced earrings exist. * Clip-on earrings ‚Äì Clip-on earrings have existed longer than any other variety of non-pierced earrings. The clip itself is a two-part piece attached to the back of an earring. The two pieces closed around the earlobe, using mechanical pressure to hold the earring in place. * Magnetic earrings ‚Äì Magnetic earrings simulate the look of a (pierced) stud earring by attaching to the earlobe with a magnetic back that hold the earring in place on by magnetic force. * Stick- on earrings ‚Äì Stick-on earrings are adhesive-backed items which stick to the skin of the earlobe and simulate the look of a (pierced) stud earring. They are considered a novelty item. * Spring hoop earrings ‚Äì Spring hoops are almost indistinguishable from standard hoop earrings and stay in place by means of spring force. ** An alternative which is often used is bending a wire or even just using the ring portion of a CBR to put on the earlobe, which stays on by pinching the ear * Ear hook earrings ‚Äì A large hook like the fish hook that is big enough to hook and hang over the whole ear and dangles. * The hoop ‚Äì A hoop threads over the ear and hangs from just inside the ear, above where ears are pierced. Mobiles or other dangles can be hung from the hoop to create a variety of styles. * Ear screws ‚Äì Screwed onto the lobe, allow for exact adjustment‚Äîan alternative for those who find clips too painful. * Ear cuffs ‚Äì Wrap around the outer cartilage (similar to a conch piercing) and may be chained to a lobe piercing. =Permanent earrings= Where most earrings worn in the western world are designed to be removed easily to be changed at will, earrings can also be permanent (non-removable). They were once used as a mark of slavery or ownership (e.g., see Ex.21:2‚Äì6, Deut.15:16‚Äì17). They appear today in the form of larger gauge rings which are difficult or impossible for a person to remove without assistance. Occasionally, hoop earrings are permanently installed by the use of solder, though this poses some risks due to toxicity of metals used in soldering and the risk of burns from the heat involved. Besides permanent installations, locking earrings are occasionally worn due to their personal symbolism or erotic value. Ear piercing Pierced ears are earlobes or the cartilage portion of the external ears which have had one or more holes created in them for the wearing of earrings. The holes may be permanent or temporary. The holes become permanent when a fistula is created by scar tissue forming around the initial earring. =Piercing techniques= A variety of techniques are used to pierce ears, ranging from \\"do it yourself\\" methods using household items to medically sterile methods using specialized equipment. A long-standing home method involves using ice as a local anesthetic, a sewing needle as a puncture instrument, a burning match and rubbing alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap or rubber eraser, as a push point. Sewing thread may be drawn through the piercing and tied, as a device for keeping the piercing open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold stud or wire earring may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device. Home methods are often unsafe and risky due to issues of improper sterilization or placement. Another method for piercing ears, first made popular in the 1960s, was the use of sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as self-piercers, trainers, or sleepers, which gradually pushed through the earlobe. However, these could slip from their initial placement position, often resulting in more discomfort, and many times would not go all the way through the earlobe without additional pressure being applied. This method has fallen into disuse due to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques. An ear being pierced with an ear piercing instrument Pierced ear with traditional starter stud Ear piercing types Ear piercing instruments, sometimes called ear-piercing guns, were originally developed for physician use but with modifications became available in retail settings. Today more and more people in the Western world have their ears pierced with an ear piercing instrument in specialty jewellery or accessory stores, or at home using disposable ear piercing instruments. An earlobe piercing performed with an ear piercing instrument is often described as feeling similar to being pinched, or being snapped by a rubber band. Piercing with this method, especially for cartilage piercings, is not recommended by many piercing professionals and physicians, as it can cause blunt force trauma to the skin, and takes far longer to heal than needle piercing. In addition, the vast majority of ear piercing instruments are made of plastic, which means they can never be truly sterilized by use of an Autoclave, increasing chance of infection exponentially. In the case of cartilage piercing, doing it with an ear piercing instrument can shatter the ear cartilage and lead to serious complications. An alternative which is growing in practice is the use of a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot in the middle of the holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again. In tribal cultures and among some neo-primitive body piercing enthusiasts, the piercing is made using other tools, such as animal or plant organics. Initial healing time for an earlobe piercing performed with an ear piercing instrument is typically six to eight weeks. After that time, earrings can be changed, but if the hole is left unfilled for an extended period of time, there is some risk of the piercing closing. Piercing professionals recommend wearing earrings in the newly pierced ears for at least six months, and sometimes even a full year. Cartilage piercing will usually require more healing time than earlobe piercing, sometimes two to three times as long. After healing, earlobe piercings will shrink to smaller gauges in the prolonged absence of earrings, and in most cases will completely disappear. =Health risks= The health risks with conventional earlobe piercing are common but tend to be minor, particularly if proper technique and hygienic procedures are followed. One study found that up to 35 percent of persons with pierced ears had one or more complications, including minor infection (77 percent of pierced ear sites with complications), allergic reaction (43 percent), keloids (2.5 percent), and traumatic tearing (2.5 percent). Pierced ears are a significant risk factor for contact allergies to the nickel in jewelry. Earlobe tearing, during the healing period or after healing is complete, can be minimized by not wearing earrings, especially wire-based dangle earrings, during activities in which they are likely to become snagged, such as while playing sports. Also, larger gauge jewellery will lessen the chance of the earring being torn out. With cartilage piercing, the blunt force of an ear piercing instrument will traumatize the cartilage, and therefore make healing more difficult. Also, because there is substantially less blood flow in ear cartilage than in the earlobe, infection is a much more serious issue. There have been several documented cases of severe infections of the upper ear following piercing with an ear piercing instrument, which required courses of antibiotics to clear up. There are many ways that an infection can occur: the most common way is when the person that got pierced decides to take out the piercing too early. According to the A.M.A, the proper waiting period to change or take out a piercing with substantially less risk of infection would be three weeks. For all ear piercings, the use of a sterilized hollow piercing needle tends to minimize the trauma to the tissue and minimize the chances of contracting a bacterial infection during the procedure. As with any invasive procedure, there is always a risk of infection from blood borne pathogens such as hepatitis and HIV. However, modern piercing techniques make this risk extremely small (the risk being greater to the piercer than to the pierced due to the potential splash-back of blood). There has never been a documented case of HIV transmission due to ear/body piercing or tattooing, although there have been instances of the Hepatitis B virus being transmitted through these practices. ; Negative effects of wearing earrings in light of research The most frequent complications connected with wearing earrings are: * inflammation * keloids * loss of tissue by tearing * mechanical division of earlobes * potential skin disorder Researchers observed a correlation between the piercing of young girls' earlobes and subsequent development of allergies.Harmful earrings(pl. Szkodliwe kolczyki) Fizjointormator. Retrieved 2015-04-01 In Professor Ewa Czarnobilska's view (the manager of research team) the main reason of allergy (listed by allergists) is presence of nickel as a component of alloys used in the production of earrings ‚Äì however the ingredients declared by producer is not significant, because nickel is a standard component of jewellery. Symptoms of allergy are visible as eczema. This symptom is often justified to be food allergy (e.g. to milk), meanwhile the reason is contact with the earring (precisely Ni ions) with the lymphatic system. Ceasing of wearing earrings by children doesn't result in vanishing allergy symptoms. Immune system remembers the presence of Ni ions that existed in someone's blood and lymph. Even though the children ceased wearing earrings, it can appear as an allergic reaction to: * metal parts of wardrobe * dental braces * dental prosthesis * orthotics * meals cooked in pots with addition of nickel * margarine (nickel is a catalyst in hydrogenation of unsaturated fats) * coins * chocolate * nuts * leguminous vegetables * wine * beer Research studying a sample of 428 pupils, age seven and eight, and sixteen and seventeen noticed that: * thirty percent of population were allergic to nickel * allergy occurred for many girls who had started wearing earrings in early childhood. Other symptoms of allergy to nickel are: * recurring infections * asthma attacks * chronic larynxis.

During the authoritarian rule during the 20th Century, known as the Estado Novo, or Second Republic, it was used as a prison for communist and other opponents of the regime. The Berlengas islands, about offshore from the peninsula, are part of the municipality. They form one of the world's first nature reserves. In summer, the islands can be visited by taking a ferryboat from Peniche. Peniche, with its scenic harbour, white windmills, chapels and long sandy beaches has inspired famous artists like Maurice Boitel. Climate Peniche has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csb) greatly moderated by the Atlantic ocean, with mild wet winters and cool dry summers. Its low diurnal temperature variation and little seasonal temperature variation make it remarkably mild year-round. It has a climate very similar to that of San Francisco, California only with warmer nights mainly due to the effects of the gulf stream. Despite its latitude, the city has one of the mildest winter night-time temperatures in mainland Europe. Economy Since ancient times Peniche has been an important fishing harbour. Besides fisheries, the economy of the Peniche municipality relies on agriculture, services and tourism. Education Besides schools for primary, secondary and vocational education, Peniche is home to a state-run polytechnic school of the Instituto Polit√©cnico de Leiria, which through its Escola Superior de Turismo e Tecnologia do Mar de Peniche, awards academic degrees in marine technologies and tourism. Parishes Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (freguesias): * Atouguia da Baleia * Ferrel * Peniche * Serra d'El- Rei Surfing Peniche is one of the best surfing locations in Europe. It has beaches and breaks facing three distinctly different directions, making it a consistent destination for surfers. Home to many surf camps/schools, it annually hosts the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal from the World championship tour of the World Surf League (WSL) at the Supertubos beach. Sports The football club of the city is called Grupo Desportivo de Peniche.https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_xWAAAAYAAJ&q;=Grupo+Desportivo+de+Peniche.&dq;=Grupo+Desportivo+de+Peniche.&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjVuJeQ8MLoAhWolnIEHef4B9oQ6AEIJzAA Peniche Amigos Clube is known nationally for their Triathlon and Futsal teams.https://gazetacaldas.com/actualidade/peniche-ac-e-casal-velho- conquistam-tacas-distritais-de-juniores-e-juvenis/ Clube Stella Maris is known nationally for their basketball and badminton teams. The club gives the population a pavilion which hosts many sport-related events. The city annually hosts the Triatlo de Peniche, which unites the Portuguese Cup and the National Universities Championships with the historical event, the first ever in Portugal. The best-known athletes from Peniche are Telma Santos, who has participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Silvano Louren√ßo, the European bodyboarding champion in 2007, and Victoria Kaminskaya who participated in the swimming competitions of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In the domain, the inverse image of this interval is a longer interval that the mapping into 3-space \\"folds in half\\". At the point where the longer interval is folded in half in the image, the nearby configuration is that of the Whitney umbrella. The interval of self intersection precludes the cross-cap from being homeomorphic to the M√∂bius strip, but there are only two points in the image (the endpoints of the interval of self-intersection) where the image cannot be that of an immersion. The bounding edge of a cross-cap is a simple closed loop. Like certain versions of the M√∂bius strip, it may take the form of a symmetrical circle. A cross-cap that has been closed up by gluing a disc to its boundary is a model of the real projective plane P2 (again with an interval of self- intersection, and two points where this model is not an immersion of P2). Two cross-caps glued together at their boundaries form a model of the Klein bottle, this time with two intervals of self-intersection and four points where this model is not an immersion. An important theorem of topology, the classification theorem for surfaces, states that each two-dimensional compact manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to a sphere with some number (possibly 0) of \\"handles\\" and 0, 1, or 2 cross-caps.

One of many unusual sal ammoniac crystal specimens found in the area of Ravat Village, near Yaghnob River, where the crystals have grown in a feather-like or three-dimensional arborescent. Size: miniature, 3.3 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm Salammoniac, also sal ammoniac or salmiac, is a rare naturally occurring mineral composed of ammonium chloride, NH4Cl. It forms colorless, white, or yellow-brown crystals in the isometric-hexoctahedral class. It has very poor cleavage and is brittle to conchoidal fracture. It is quite soft, with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2, and it has a low specific gravity of 1.5. It is water-soluble. Sal ammoniac is also the archaic name for the chemical compound ammonium chloride. Pliny, in Book XXXI of his Natural History, refers to a salt produced in the Roman province of Cyrenaica named hammoniacum, so called because of its proximity to the nearby Temple of Jupiter Amun (Greek ·ºåŒºŒºœâŒΩ Ammon). However, the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of ammonium chloride. According to Herbert Hoover's commentary in his English translation of Georgius Agricola's De re metallica, it is likely to have been common sea salt. In any case, that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name. The first attested reference to sal ammoniac as ammonium chloride is in the Pseudo-Geber work De inventione veritatis, where a preparation of sal ammoniac is given in the chapter De Salis armoniaci pr√¶paratione, salis armoniaci being a common name in the Middle Ages for sal ammoniac. It typically forms as encrustations formed by sublimation around volcanic vents and is found around volcanic fumaroles, guano deposits and burning coal seams. Associated minerals include sodium alum, native sulfur and other fumarole minerals. Notable occurrences include Tajikistan; Mount Vesuvius, Italy; and Par√≠cutin, Michoacan, Mexico. Uses It is commonly used to clean the soldering iron in the soldering of stained-glass windows. In jewellery-making and the refining of precious metals, potassium carbonate is added to gold and silver in a borax-coated crucible to purify iron or steel filings that may have contaminated the scrap. It is then air-cooled and remelted with a one-to-one mixture of powdered charcoal and sal ammoniac to yield a sturdy ingot of the respective metal or alloy in the case of sterling silver (7.5% copper) or karated gold. Sal ammoniac has also been used in the past in bakery products to give cookies or biscuits their crisp texture, but the application of food grade baking ammonia (ammonium carbonate) is generally being substituted with the creation of modern baking powder or baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Sal ammoniac is known, inter alia, by its use in salmiac liquorice, for instance salty liquorice or salmiak pastilles. In addition, the mineral or better its synthetic counterpart also serves for the production of cooling baths as well as in the dyeing and leather tanning (see also use of ammonium chloride). Sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) was the electrolyte in Leclanche cells, a forerunner of the dry battery; a carbon rod and a zinc rod or cylinder formed the electrodes. It was also brought into pharmacopeias by Islamic physicians for medicinal purposes.

Within the Chinatown International District are the three neighborhoods known as Seattle's Chinatown, Japantown and Little Saigon, named for the concentration of businesses owned by people of Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese descent, respectively. The geographic area also once included Seattle's Manilatown. The name Chinatown/International District was established by City Ordinance 119297 in 1999 as a result of the three neighborhoods' work and consensus on the Seattle Chinatown International District Urban Village Strategic Plan submitted to the City Council in December 1998. Like many other areas of Seattle, the neighborhood is multiethnic, but the majority of its residents are of Chinese ethnicity. It is one of eight historic neighborhoods recognized by the City of Seattle. CID has a mix of residences and businesses and is a tourist attraction for its ethnic Asian businesses and landmarks. Location Location of Chinatown International District within Seattle. The CID boundaries are defined as 4th Avenue South (on the west) to Rainier Avenue (on the east) and from Yesler Way (north) to Charles Street/Dearborn (south). The CID is bordered by the neighborhoods of Pioneer Square and SoDo to the west of 4th Ave S; Rainier Valley on the east side of Rainier; Beacon Hill and the Industrial District to the south of Charles/Dearborn; and Downtown and First Hill to the north of Yesler. Within the CID are three distinct neighborhoods: Chinatown, Japantown, and Little Saigon. The Seattle Chinatown Historic District, so designated by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1986, is roughly south of Jackson and west of I-5, with Hing Hay Park at its heart. In the present day, Japantown is centered on 6th Avenue and Main Street and Little Saigon's main nexus is 12th Avenue South and South Jackson Street. =Public transit= The CID is served by the International District/Chinatown station on the Central Link light rail system (via the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel near 4th Ave S), and three stops along Jackson on the First Hill Streetcar: at 5th Ave S (connecting to Central Link), 7th Ave S, and 12th Ave S. History =19th century= Chinese immigrants first came to the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s, and by the 1860s, some had settled in Seattle. Many of the first Chinese immigrants to Washington came from Guangdong province, especially Taishan. The first Chinese quarters were near Yesler's Mill on the waterfront. According to Chinese oral history, the waterfront was the first Chinatown, where the Chinese dock workers lived. The influx of Chinese immigrants was slowed by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In 1886 whites drove out most of Seattle's Chinese population. However, some took shelter with Native Americans on the reservations while others came under the protection of white employers and a judge. The Great Seattle Fire of 1889 further hindered the community. Eventually, the Chinese re-established new quarters farther inland, along Washington St. and Second Avenue South. This was the second Chinatown. Land values rose, especially with impending construction of the Smith Tower, and the people of Chinatown moved again, to the present and third location along King Street. Only the Hop Sing Tong managed to retain its building on 2nd and Washington. It sold this building about 2006 in order to purchase the former China Gate building at 516 7th Ave S in the current Chinatown. 516 7th Ave S was originally built in 1924 as the Chinese Grand Opera Theater to house a Peking Opera company. Near the end of the 19th century, Japanese immigrants also began arriving, settling on the south side of the district on the other side of the railroad tracks. Part of present-day Dearborn Street, between 8th and 12th avenues, was known as Mikado Street, after the Japanese word for \\"emperor.\\" Japanese Americans developed Nihonmachi, or Japantown, on Main Street, two blocks north of King Street. By the mid-1920s, Nihonmachi extended from 4th Avenue along Main to 7th Avenue, with clusters of businesses along Jackson, King, Weller, Lane, and Dearborn streets. =20th century= The Jackson Regrade began in 1907; workers leveled hills and used the resulting fill to reclaim tidal flats, making travel to downtown easier. As downtown property values rose, the Chinese were forced to other areas. By the early 1900s, a new Chinatown began to develop along King Street. In 1910, Goon Dip, a prominent businessman in Seattle's Chinese American community, led a group of Chinese Americans to form the Kong Yick Investment Company, a benefit society. Their funding and efforts led to the construction of two buildings--the East Kong Yick Building and the West Kong Yick Building. Meanwhile, Filipino Americans began arriving to replace the Chinese dock workers, who had moved inland. According to Pamana I, a history of Filipino Americans in Seattle, they settled along First Hill and the hotels and boarding houses of Chinatown and Japantown beginning in the early 1920s. They were attracted to work as contract laborers in agriculture and salmon canneries. Among them was Filipino author Carlos Bulosan, who wrote of his experiences and those of his countrymen in his novel America Is In The Heart (1946). By the 1930s, a 'Manilatown' had been established near the corner of Maynard and King. In 1942, under the auspices of Executive Order 9066, the federal government forcibly removed and detained people of Japanese ancestry from Seattle and the West Coast in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Authorities moved them to inland internment camps, where they lived from 1942 to 1946. Most of Seattle's Japanese residents were sent to Minidoka in Idaho. After the war, many returned to the Pacific Northwest but relocated to the suburbs or other districts in Seattle. A remaining vestige of the old community is the office of the North American Post, a Japanese-language newspaper founded in 1902. Another is the Panama Hotel, which was proclaimed a National Treasure in 2015 with a prior listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Uwajimaya, originally a Japantown store, moved down the hill into Chinatown. Uwajimaya Village. African Americans moved to Seattle in the Great Migration, mostly out of the South, to work in the war industry during World War II, occupying many of the houses left vacant by the internment of the Japanese Americans. They filled the empty businesses along Jackson Street with notable jazz clubs. In 1951, Seattle Mayor William D. Devin proclaimed the area \\"International Center\\" because of the diversity of people who resided and worked in the vicinity. Businesswoman and later city councilwoman Ruby Chow and others criticized the use of \\"international\\" for masking Chinese American history. The use of \\"International District\\" by the city remains controversial. Seattle's first neighborhood advocacy group, the Jackson Street Community Council, opposed the construction of an interstate highway through the area. Despite protest, many Chinese and Japanese buildings and businesses were destroyed for the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s. Ethnic Asians formed new civic organizations (as compared to the traditional Chinese family associations, tongs and social clubs) serve needs ranging from community health, care of the elderly, information and referrals, counseling, historic preservation, marketing of the area, and building low- income housing. The construction of the Kingdome in 1972 further boxed in the neighborhood, leading to renewed protests over the community's lack of representation, including an impromptu demonstration at the stadium's groundbreaking ceremony on November 2, 1972. Aerial photograph of the CID in 1969, facing northeast. Prominent east-west streets (running from lower left to upper right) are Jackson (background) and King (foreground). I-5 at top of photograph. In 1975 with the fall of Saigon, a new wave of immigrants from Vietnam and Southeast Asia established Seattle's Little Saigon east of I-5. Many of these immigrants were of Chinese descent. Viet Wah became Little Saigon's anchor store in 1981, and the famous boat-shaped restaurant Pho Bac introduced Vietnamese pho to the city in 1982. The worst mass murder in the history of Seattle took place at the Wah Mee Club on Maynard Alley on February 18, 1983. Thirteen people were killed. In 1986, a portion of Chinatown and Japantown was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"Seattle Chinatown Historic District.\\" That year the Wing Luke Memorial Museum moved to 7th Avenue, a location it would occupy for two decades. In 1999, the City Council approved the \\"Chinatown/International District Urban Village Strategic Plan\\" for the future of the neighborhood. This plan, agreed to by all major organizations in the CID, led to City Ordinance 119297. This ordinance enshrined the three neighborhoods of Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon and the Chinatown Historic District into one larger neighborhood with a compromised name. Since then, the often conflicting interests of development, preservation and the conversion of old buildings to low-income housing have clashed as office developments (e.g., Union Station) and market-rate housing developments are overwhelmed by drastic increases in low-income housing stock. In addition, controversy erupted over vacating S. Lane Street as part of a large redevelopment by the private business Uwajimaya. Protesters formed the Save Lane Street organization and insisted as business owners they supported re-development, but opposed vacating a public street for a private business use. After losing a lawsuit filed over the matter, the Save Lane Street group dissolved. The Japantown and Chinatown portions of the neighborhood, as seen from the Columbia Center in 2019 = 21st century = Construction on a paifang for the neighborhood began in 2006 and the Historic Chinatown Gate was unveiled on February 9, 2008. It stands at the west end of South King Street. It is 45 feet tall and made from steel and plaster. The Wing Luke Museum moved to its present location in the East Kong Yick Building in 2008.  Culture  Chinese New Year 2007: Lion dancers in the firecracker smoke The neighborhood hosts a Lunar New Year festival near the East Asian Lunar New Year; Dragon Fest, a pan-Asian American festival, during the summer; and a night market in early fall. The nonprofit Friends of Little Saigon hosts an annual Celebrate Little Saigon event that celebrates Vietnamese culture. = Landmarks and institutions = Certain neighborhood buildings in Seattle's Chinatown incorporate Chinese architectural designs such as balconies for on the second or third floors or tile roofs. The neighborhood also has public art installations by artists such as George Tsutakawa and Norie Sato. Artists Meng Huang and Heather Presler installed Chinese dragon sculptures on lampposts along Jackson Street in 2002.

This dataset was not available at the time. thumb Global cooling was a conjecture, especially during the 1970s, of imminent cooling of the Earth culminating in a period of extensive glaciation, due to the cooling effects of aerosols and orbital forcing. Some press reports in the 1970s speculated about continued cooling; these did not accurately reflect the scientific literature of the time, which was generally more concerned with warming from an enhanced greenhouse effect. The current scientific consensus on climate change is that the Earth underwent global warming throughout the 20th century and continues to warm.  Introduction: general awareness and concern  By the 1970s, scientists were becoming increasingly aware that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases. In the scientific papers which considered climate trends of the 21st century, less than 10% inclined towards future cooling, while most papers predicted future warming. The general public had little awareness of carbon dioxide's effects on climate, but Science News in May 1959 forecast a 25% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 150 years from 1850 to 2000, with a consequent warming trend. The actual increase in this period was 29%. Paul R. Ehrlich mentioned global warming from greenhouse gases as a counterforce to the cooling effect of aerosols in 1968.pages 51‚Äì52 of The Population Bomb, 1968, available from By the time the idea of global cooling reached the public press in the mid-1970s temperatures had stopped falling, and there was concern in the climatological community about carbon dioxide's warming effects. In response to such reports, the World Meteorological Organization issued a warning in June 1976 that \\"a very significant warming of global climate\\" was probable.World's temperature likely to rise; The Times; 22 June 1976; pg 9; col A Currently, there are some concerns about the possible regional cooling effects of a slowdown or shutdown of thermohaline circulation, which might be provoked by an increase of fresh water mixing into the North Atlantic due to glacial melting. The probability of this occurring is generally considered to be very low, and the IPCC notes, \\"even in models where the THC weakens, there is still a warming over Europe. For example, in all AOGCM integrations where the radiative forcing is increasing, the sign of the temperature change over north-west Europe is positive.\\" Physical mechanisms The cooling period is reproduced by current (1999 on) global climate models that include the physical effects of sulfate aerosols, and there is now general agreement that aerosol effects were the dominant cause of the mid-20th century cooling. At the time there were two physical mechanisms that were most frequently advanced to cause cooling: aerosols and orbital forcing. =Aerosols= Human activity -- mostly as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, partly by land use changes -- increases the number of tiny particles (aerosols) in the atmosphere. These have a direct effect: they effectively increase the planetary albedo, thus cooling the planet by reducing the solar radiation reaching the surface; and an indirect effect: they affect the properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. In the early 1970s some speculated that this cooling effect might dominate over the warming effect of the CO2 release: see discussion of Rasool and Schneider (1971), below. As a result of observations and a switch to cleaner fuel burning, this no longer seems likely; current scientific work indicates that global warming is far more likely. Although the temperature drops foreseen by this mechanism have now been discarded in light of better theory and the observed warming, aerosols are thought to have contributed a cooling tendency (outweighed by increases in greenhouse gases) and also have contributed to \\"Global Dimming.\\" =Orbital forcing= CO2, temperature, and dust concentration measured by Petit et al. from Vostok ice core at Antarctica. Orbital forcing refers to the slow, cyclical changes in the tilt of Earth's axis and shape of its orbit. These cycles alter the total amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by a small amount and affect the timing and intensity of the seasons. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles, and understanding of the mechanism was increasing rapidly in the mid-1970s. The paper of Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton \\"Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages\\" qualified its predictions with the remark that \\"forecasts must be qualified in two ways. First, they apply only to the natural component of future climatic trends - and not to anthropogenic effects such as those due to the burning of fossil fuels. Second, they describe only the long-term trends, because they are linked to orbital variations with periods of 20,000 years and longer. Climatic oscillations at higher frequencies are not predicted... the results indicate that the long-term trend over the next 20,000 years is towards extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooler climate\\". The idea that ice ages cycles were predictable appears to have become conflated with the idea that another one was due \\"soon\\" - perhaps because much of this study was done by geologists, who are accustomed to dealing with very long time scales and use \\"soon\\" to refer to periods of thousands of years. A strict application of the Milankovitch theory does not allow the prediction of a \\"rapid\\" ice age onset (i.e., less than a century or two) since the fastest orbital period is about 20,000 years. Some creative ways around this were found, notably one championed by Nigel Calder under the name of \\"snowblitz\\", but these ideas did not gain wide acceptance. It is common to see it asserted that the length of the current interglacial temperature peak is similar to the length of the preceding interglacial peak (Sangamon/Eem), and from this conclude that we might be nearing the end of this warm period. This conclusion is mistaken. Firstly, because the lengths of previous interglacials were not particularly regular;http://www.clim- past.net/8/1473/2012/cp-8-1473-2012.pdf see figure. Petit et al. note that \\"interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 are different from the Holocene, but similar to each other in duration, shape and amplitude. During each of these two events, there is a warm period of 4 kyr followed by a relatively rapid cooling\\". Secondly, future orbital variations will not closely resemble those of the past. Concern pre-1970s In 1923, there was concern about a new ice age and Captain Donald Baxter MacMillan sailed toward the Arctic sponsored by the National Geographical Society to look for evidence of advancing glaciers. In 1926, a Berlin astronomer was predicting global cooling but that it was \\"ages away\\". Concerns that a new ice age was approaching was revived in the 1950s. During the Cold War, there were concerns by Harry Wexler that setting off atom bombs could be hastening a new ice age from a nuclear winter scenario. J. Murray Mitchell showed as early as 1963 a multidecadal cooling since about 1940. At a conference on climate change held in Boulder, Colorado in 1965, evidence supporting Milankovitch cycles triggered speculation on how the calculated small changes in sunlight might somehow trigger ice ages. In 1966, Cesare Emiliani predicted that \\"a new glaciation will begin within a few thousand years.\\" In his 1968 book The Population Bomb, Paul R. Ehrlich wrote \\"The greenhouse effect is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of carbon dioxide... [this] is being countered by low-level clouds generated by contrails, dust, and other contaminants... At the moment we cannot predict what the overall climatic results will be of our using the atmosphere as a garbage dump.\\" Concern in the 1970s =1970s awareness= Concern peaked in the early 1970s, though \\"the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then\\" (a cooling period began in 1945, and two decades of a cooling trend suggested a trough had been reached after several decades of warming). This peaking concern is partially attributable to the fact much less was then known about world climate and causes of ice ages. Climate scientists were aware that predictions based on this trend were not possible - because the trend was poorly studied and not understood (for example see reference). Despite that, in the popular press the possibility of cooling was reported generally without the caveats present in the scientific reports, and \\"unusually severe winters in Asia and parts of North America in 1972 and 1973...pushed the issue into the public consciousness\\". In the 1970s, the compilation of records to produce hemispheric, or global, temperature records had just begun. Spencer R. Weart's history of The Discovery of Global Warming says that: \\"While neither scientists nor the public could be sure in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling, people were increasingly inclined to believe that global climate was on the move, and in no small way\\" [emphasis added]. On January 11, 1970, the Washington Post reported that \\"Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age\\". In 1972, Emiliani warned \\"Man's activity may either precipitate this new ice age or lead to substantial or even total melting of the ice caps...\\". Also in 1972 a group of glacial-epoch experts at a conference agreed that \\"the natural end of our warm epoch is undoubtedly near\\";Past Climate Cycles: Ice Age Speculations but the volume of Quaternary Research reporting on the meeting said that \\"the basic conclusion to be drawn from the discussions in this section is that the knowledge necessary for understanding the mechanism of climate change is still lamentably inadequate\\". George Kukla and Robert Matthews, in a Science write- up of a conference, asked when and how the current interglacial would end; concluding that, unless there were impacts from future human activity, \\"Global cooling and related rapid changes of environment, substantially exceeding the fluctuations experienced by man in historical times, must be expected within the next few millennia or even centuries\\", but many other scientists doubted these conclusions. = 1970 SCEP report = The 1970 Study of Critical Environmental Problems reported the possibility of warming from increased carbon dioxide, but no concerns about cooling, setting a lower bound on the beginning of interest in \\"global cooling\\". =1971 to 1975: papers on warming and cooling factors= By 1971, studies indicated that human caused air pollution was spreading, but there was uncertainty as to whether aerosols would cause warming or cooling, and whether or not they were more significant than rising levels. J. Murray Mitchell still viewed humans as \\"innocent bystanders\\" in the cooling from the 1940s to 1970, but in 1971 his calculations suggested that rising emissions could cause significant cooling after 2000, though he also argued that emissions could cause warming depending on circumstances. Calculations were too basic at this time to be trusted to give reliable results.Mitchell, J. Murray, Jr. (1971). \\"The Effect of Atmospheric Aerosols on Climate with Special Reference to Temperature near the Earth's Surface. \\" J. Applied Meteorology 10: 703-14. An early numerical computation of climate effects was published in the journal Science in July 1971 as a paper by S. Ichtiaque Rasool and Stephen H. Schneider, titled \\"Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate\\". The paper used rudimentary data and equations to compute the possible future effects of large increases in the densities in the atmosphere of two types of human environmental emissions: # greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide; # particulate pollution such as smog, some of which remains suspended in the atmosphere in aerosol form for years. The paper suggested that the global warming due to greenhouse gases would tend to have less effect with greater densities, and while aerosol pollution could cause warming, it was likely that it would tend to have a cooling effect which increased with density. They concluded that \\"An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5 ¬∞ K. If sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.\\" Both their equations and their data were badly flawed, as was soon pointed out by other scientists and confirmed by Schneider himself. In January 1972, Robert Jay Charlson et al. pointed out that with other reasonable assumptions, the model produced the opposite conclusion. The model made no allowance for changes in clouds or convection, and erroneously indicated that 8 times as much would only cause 2 ¬∞C of warming. In a paper published in 1975, Schneider corrected the overestimate of aerosol cooling by checking data on the effects of dust produced by volcanoes. When the model included estimated changes in solar intensity, it gave a reasonable match to temperatures over the previous thousand years and its prediction was that \\" warming dominates the surface temperature patterns soon after 1980.\\" =1972 and 1974 National Science Board= The National Science Board's Patterns and Perspectives in Environmental Science report of 1972 discussed the cyclical behavior of climate, and the understanding at the time that the planet was entering a phase of cooling after a warm period. \\"Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end, to be followed by a long period of considerably colder temperatures leading into the next glacial age some 20,000 years from now.\\" But it also continued; \\"However, it is possible, or even likely, that human interference has already altered the environment so much that the climatic pattern of the near future will follow a different path.\\" The Board's report of 1974, Science And The Challenges Ahead, continued on this theme. \\"During the last 20-30 years, world temperature has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the last decade.\\" Discussion of cyclic glacial periods does not feature in this report. Instead it is the role of humans that is central to the report's analysis. \\"The cause of the cooling trend is not known with certainty. But there is increasing concern that man himself may be implicated, not only in the recent cooling trend but also in the warming temperatures over the last century\\". The report did not conclude whether carbon dioxide in warming, or agricultural and industrial pollution in cooling, are factors in the recent climatic changes, noting; \\"Before such questions as these can be resolved, major advances must be made in understanding the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere and oceans, and in measuring and tracing particulates through the system.\\" =1975 National Academy of Sciences report= There also was a Report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) entitled, \\"Understanding Climate Change: A Program for Action\\". The report stated (p. 36) that, \\"The average surface air temperature in the northern hemisphere increased from the 1880s until about 1940 and has been decreasing thereafter.\\" It also stated (p. 44) that, \\"If both the and particulate inputs to the atmosphere grow at equal rates in the future, the widely differing atmospheric residence times of the two pollutants means that the particulate effect will grow in importance relative to that of .\\" The report did not predict whether the 25-year cooling trend would continue. It stated (Forward, p. v) that, \\"we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines its course [so] it does not seem possible to predict climate,\\" and (p. 2) \\"The climates of the earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless continue to do so in the future. How large these future changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur, we do not know.\\" The Report's \\"program for action\\" was a call for creation of a new \\"National Climatic Research Program.\\" It stated (p. 62), \\"If we are to react rationally to the inevitable climatic changes of the future, and if we are ever to predict their future course, whether they are natural or man-induced, a far greater understanding of these changes is required than we now possess. It is, moreover, important that this knowledge be acquired as soon as possible.\\" For that reason, it stated, \\"the time has now come to initiate a broad and coordinated attack on the problem of climate and climatic change.\\" =1974 Time magazine article= While these discussions were ongoing in scientific circles, other accounts appeared in the popular media. In their June 24, 1974 issue, Time presented an article titled \\"Another Ice Age?\\" that noted \\"the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades\\" but noted that \\"Some scientists... think that the cooling trend may be only temporary.\\" =1975 Newsweek article= An April 28, 1975 article in Newsweek magazine was titled \\"The Cooling World\\", it pointed to \\"ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change\\" and pointed to \\"a drop of half a degree [Fahrenheit] in average ground temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere between 1945 and 1968.\\" The article stated \\"The evidence in support of these predictions [of global cooling] has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it.\\" The Newsweek article did not state the cause of cooling; it stated that \\"what causes the onset of major and minor ice ages remains a mystery\\" and cited the NAS conclusion that \\"not only are the basic scientific questions largely unanswered, but in many cases we do not yet know enough to pose the key questions.\\" The article mentioned the alternative solutions of \\"melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting Arctic rivers\\" but conceded these were not feasible. The Newsweek article concluded by criticizing government leaders: \\"But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies...The longer the planners (politicians) delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality.\\" The article emphasized sensational and largely unsourced consequences - \\"resulting famines could be catastrophic\\", \\"drought and desolation,\\" \\"the most devastating outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded\\", \\"droughts, floods, extended dry spells, long freezes, delayed monsoons,\\" \\"impossible for starving peoples to migrate,\\" \\"the present decline has taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age.\\" On October 23, 2006, Newsweek issued a correction, over 31 years after the original article, stating that it had been \\"so spectacularly wrong about the near-term future\\" (though editor Jerry Adler stated that \\"the story wasn't 'wrong' in the journalistic sense of 'inaccurate.'\\") =Other 1970s sources= Academic analysis of the peer-reviewed studies published at that time shows that most papers examining aspects of climate during the 1970s were either neutral or showed a warming trend. In 1977, a popular book on the topic was published, called The Weather Conspiracy: The Coming of the New Ice Age. =1979 WMO conference= Later in the decade, at a WMO conference in 1979, F K Hare reported: Late-20th-century cooling predictions =1980s= Concerns about nuclear winter arose in the early 1980s from several reports. Similar speculations have appeared over effects due to catastrophes such as asteroid impacts and massive volcanic eruptions. =1990s= In 1991, a prediction by Carl Sagan and other scientists who had worked on the famous TTAPS study on nuclear winter that massive oil well fires in Kuwait would cause significant effects on climate was incorrect.Sagan, Carl (1996). The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. New York: Random House. p. 257. . In January 1999, contrarian Patrick Michaels wrote a commentary offering to \\"take even money that the 10 years ending on December 31, 2007, will show a statistically significant global cooling trend in temperatures measured by satellite\\", on the basis of his view that record temperatures in 1998 had been a blip. Indeed, over that period, satellite-measured temperatures never again approached their 1998 peak. Due to a sharp but temporary dip in temperatures in 1999-2000, a least-squares linear regression fit to the satellite temperature record showed little overall trend. The RSS satellite temperature record showed a slight cooling trend, but the UAH satellite temperature record showed a slight warming trend. Twenty-first century In 2003, the Office of Net Assessment at the United States Department of Defense was commissioned to produce a study on the likely and potential effects of abrupt modern climate change should a shutdown of thermohaline circulation occur. The study, conducted under ONA head Andrew Marshall, modelled its prospective climate change on the 8.2 kiloyear event, precisely because it was the middle alternative between the Younger Dryas and the Little Ice Age. Scientists said that \\"abrupt climate change initiated by Greenland ice sheet melting is not a realistic scenario for the 21st century\\". Present level of knowledge The concern that cooler temperatures would continue, and perhaps at a faster rate, has been observed to be incorrect, as was assessed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report of 2001. More has to be learned about climate, but the growing records have shown that short term cooling concerns have not been borne out. As for the prospects of the end of the current interglacial, while the four most recent interglacials lasted about 10,000 years, the interglacial before that lasted around 28,000 years. Milankovitch-type calculations indicate that the present interglacial would probably continue for tens of thousands of years naturally in the absence of human perturbations. Other estimates (Loutre and Berger, based on orbital calculations) put the unperturbed length of the present interglacial at 50,000 years. Berger (EGU 2005 presentation) thinks that the present CO2 perturbation will last long enough to suppress the next glacial cycle entirely. This is entirely consistent with David Archer's and colleague's prediction who argue that the present level of will suspend the next glacial period for the next 500,000 years and will be the longest duration and intensity of the projected interglacial period and are longer than have been seen in the last 2.6 million years. As the NAS report indicates, scientific knowledge regarding climate change was more uncertain than it is today. At the time that Rasool and Schneider wrote their 1971 paper, climatologists had not yet recognized the significance of greenhouse gases other than water vapor and carbon dioxide, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. Early in that decade, carbon dioxide was the only widely studied human-influenced greenhouse gas. The attention drawn to atmospheric gases in the 1970s stimulated many discoveries in subsequent decades. As the temperature pattern changed, global cooling was of waning interest by 1979. The ice age fallacy A common argument used to dismiss the significance of human-caused climate change is to allege that scientists showed concerns about global cooling which did not materialise, and there is therefore no need to heed current scientific concerns about global warming. \\"Call it the Ice Age Fallacy. [...] global cooling was much more an invention of the media than it was a real scientific concern. A survey of peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 1965 and 1979 shows that the large majority of research at the time predicted that the earth would warm as carbon-dioxide levels rose ‚Äî as indeed it has.\\" In a 1998 article promoting the Oregon Petition, Fred Singer argued that expert concerns about global warming should be dismissed on the basis that what he called \\"the same hysterical fears\\" had supposedly been expressed earlier about global cooling. Bryan Walsh of Time magazine (2013) calls this argument \\"the Ice Age Fallacy\\". Illustrating the argument, for several years an image had been circulated of a Time cover, supposedly dated 1977, showing a penguin above a cover story title \\"How to Survive the Coming Ice Age\\". In March 2013, The Mail on Sunday published an article by David Rose, showing this same cover image, to support his claim that there was as much concern in the 1970s about a \\"looming 'ice age'\\" as there was now about global warming. After researching the authenticity of the magazine cover image, in July 2013, Walsh confirmed that the image was a hoax, modified from a 2007 cover story image for \\"The Global Warming Survival Guide\\".

The drink remains important to the peoples of the Central Asian steppes, of Huno-Bulgar, Turkic and Mongol origin: Kazakhs, Bashkirs, Kalmyks, Kyrgyz, Mongols, and Yakuts. Kumis was historically consumed by the Khitan, Jurchen, Hungarians and Han Chinese of North China as well. Kumis is a dairy product similar to kefir, but is produced from a liquid starter culture, in contrast to the solid kefir \\"grains\\". Because mare's milk contains more sugars than cow's or goat's milk, when fermented, kumis has a higher, though still mild, alcohol content compared to kefir. Even in the areas of the world where kumis is popular today, mare's milk remains a very limited commodity. Industrial-scale production, therefore, generally uses cow's milk, which is richer in fat and protein, but lower in lactose than the milk from a horse. Before fermentation, the cow's milk is fortified in one of several ways. Sucrose may be added to allow a comparable fermentation. Another technique adds modified whey to better approximate the composition of mare's milk.Law p. 121.  Terminology and etymology  Kumis comes from the Turkic word kƒ±mƒ±z. Kurmann derives the word from the name of the Kumyks, one of many Turkic peoples, although this appears to be a purely speculative claim. Clauson notes that kƒ±mƒ±z is found throughout the Turkic language family, and cites the 11th-century appearance of the word in Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk written by Ka≈ügarlƒ± Mahmud in the Karakhanid language. In Mongolia, the drink is called airag ( ) or, in some areas, tsegee. William of Rubruck in his travels calls the drink cosmos and describes its preparation among the Mongols.The spelling in William's manuscripts varies, and the most recent editor, P. Chiesa, prefers \\"comos\\". See Guglielmo di Rubruk, Viaggio in Mongolia (Itinerarium), a cura di Paolo Chiesa, Milano, Fondazione Lorenzo Valla, Mondadori, 2011.  Production of mare's milk  A mare being milked in the Suusamyr Valley, Kyrgyzstan A 1982 source reported 230,000 mares were kept in the Soviet Union specifically for producing milk to make into kumis. Rinchingiin Indra, writing about Mongolian dairying, says \\"it takes considerable skill to milk a mare\\" and describes the technique: the milker kneels on one knee, with a pail propped on the other, steadied by a string tied to an arm. One arm is wrapped behind the mare's rear leg and the other in front. A foal starts the milk flow and is pulled away by another person, but left touching the mare's side during the entire process. In Mongolia, the milking season for horses traditionally runs between mid-June and early October. During one season, a mare produces approximately 1,000 to 1,200 litres of milk, of which about half is left to the foals.Indra p. 73.  Production of kumis  A glass of homemade Mongolian airag, prepared in the blue plastic barrel in the background. Kumis is made by fermenting raw unpasteurized mare's milk over the course of hours or days, often while stirring or churning. (The physical agitation has similarities to making butter). During the fermentation, lactobacilli bacteria acidify the milk, and yeasts turn it into a carbonated and mildly alcoholic drink. Traditionally, this fermentation took place in horse-hide containers, which might be left on the top of a yurt and turned over on occasion, or strapped to a saddle and joggled around over the course of a day's riding. Today, a wooden vat or plastic barrel may be used in place of the leather container.Mischler and Sosorbaram (2005‚Äì2006). Ayrag. Mongolian Food Info. Retrieved 11 September 2006. In modern controlled production, the initial fermentation takes two to five hours at a temperature of around ; this may be followed by a cooler aging period. The finished product contains between 0.7 and 2.5% alcohol. Kumis itself has a very low level of alcohol, comparable to small beer, the common drink of medieval Europe that also helps to avoid the consumption of potentially contaminated water. Kumis can, however, be strengthened through freeze distillation, a technique Central Asian nomads are reported to have employed.McGee p. 761 It can also be made into the distilled beverage known as araka or arkhi.  History  Kumyss, in the intestinal disorders of infants and young children. Archaeological investigations of the Botai culture of ancient Kazakhstan have revealed traces of milk in bowls from the site of Botai, suggesting the domestication of the animal. No specific evidence for its fermentation has yet been found, but considering the location of the Botai culture and the nutritional properties of mare's milk, the possibility is high. Kumis is an ancient beverage. Herodotus, in his 5th-century BC Histories, describes the Scythians processing of mare's milk: > Now the Scythians blind all their slaves, to use them in preparing their > milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone, not unlike our > musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to blow into the tubes > with their mouths, some milking while the others blow. They say that they do > this because when the veins of the animal are full of air, the udder is > forced down. The milk thus obtained is poured into deep wooden casks, about > which the blind slaves are placed, and then the milk is stirred round. That > which rises to the top is drawn off, and considered the best part; the under > portion is of less account.Histories, book four. Translation by George > Rawlinson; available online at The Internet Classics Archive. This is widely believed to be the first description of ancient kumis-making. Apart from the idiosyncratic method of mare-milking, it matches up well enough with later accounts, such as this one given by 13th-century traveller William of Rubruck: > This cosmos, which is mare's milk, is made in this wise. [‚Ä¶] When they have > got together a great quantity of milk, which is as sweet as cow's as long as > it is fresh, they pour it into a big skin or bottle, and they set to > churning it with a stick [‚Ä¶] and when they have beaten it sharply it begins > to boil up like new wine and to sour or ferment, and they continue to churn > it until they have extracted the butter. Then they taste it, and when it is > mildly pungent, they drink it. It is pungent on the tongue like rap√© wine > when drunk, and when a man has finished drinking, it leaves a taste of milk > of almonds on the tongue, and it makes the inner man most joyful and also > intoxicates weak heads, and greatly provokes urine.Rockhill, William, > translator (1900). The Journey of William of Rubruck to the Eastern Parts of > the World, 1253‚Äì55. p. 67. London: Hakluyt Society. Rubruk also mentions that the Mongols prized a particular variety of black kumiss called caracosmos, which was made specifically from the milk of black mares. In the 19th century, \\"kumyss\\" was used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.  Consumption  Kumis-flavored ice cream at a restaurant in Nur- Sultan, Kazakhstan Strictly speaking, kumis is in its own category of alcoholic drinks because it is made neither from fruit nor from grain. Technically, it is closer to wine than to beer because the fermentation occurs directly from sugars, as in wine (usually from fruit), as opposed to from starches (usually from grain) converted to sugars by mashing, as in beer. But in terms of experience and traditional manner of consumption, it is much more comparable to beer. It is even milder in alcoholic content than beer. It is arguably the region‚Äôs beer equivalent. Kumis is very light in body compared to most dairy drinks. It has a unique, slightly sour flavor with a bite from the mild alcoholic content. The exact flavor is greatly variable between different producers. Kumis is usually served cold or chilled. Traditionally it is sipped out of small, handle-less, bowl-shaped cups or saucers, called piyala. The serving of it is an essential part of Kyrgyz hospitality on the jayloo or high pasture, where they keep their herds of animals (horse, cattle, and sheep) during the summer phase of transhumance.  Cultural role  During the Yuan Dynasty of China, kumis was essentially made to be the replacement of tea. Furthermore, M√∂ngke Khan had a drinking fountain made in the Mongol Empire's capital of Karakorum, including kumis alongside Chinese rice wine, Scandinavian mead and Persian grape wine as a symbol of the empire's diversity and size. The capital of Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, is named after the paddle used to churn the fermenting milk, showing the importance of the drink in the national culture. The famous Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in A Confession spoke of running away from his troubled life by drinking kumis.; Transliterated as \\"kumys\\". The Russian composer Alexander Scriabin was recommended a kumis diet and \\"water cure\\" by his doctor in his twenties, for his nervous condition and right-hand injury. The Japanese soft drink Calpis models its flavor after the taste of kumis.

Later issues in the initial story arc were subtitled Knights of the Old Republic. Tales of the Jedi is a series of comic books published by Dark Horse Comics between 1993 and 1998. They are part of the fictional Star Wars expanded universe, and cover the Great Sith War and the Great Hyperspace War. The series represented the earliest chronological Star Wars stories until the publication of the Dawn of the Jedi series of comics and novels. The first books released covered the Great Sith War (4,000 BBY, or Before the Battle of Yavin). The latter were prequels that covered the Great Hyperspace War, which happened a thousand years earlier. Summary The Great Hyperspace War was instigated when two Republic hyperspace explorers accidentally crash-landed on the Sith graveyard planet Korriban during the funeral procession of Marka Ragnos. His successor, Naga Sadow, provoked war with the Republic, and installed himself as the leader of the Sith Empire. He fought not only the Republic, but the forces of his chief rival, Ludo Kressh, and was forced to destroy his own fleet to cover his escape. Sadow landed on Yavin IV and constructed vast temples with the labor of his Massassi warriors. Six hundred years later, fallen Jedi Freedon Nadd arrived on Yavin IV, and learned Sith sorcery from the spirit of Naga Sadow. He took his knowledge and the treasures of Sadow to the planet Onderon, where he used his acquired gifts to install himself as king. His spirit continued to advise his descendants. Another Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, was sent to Onderon to mediate a conflict, where he met the spirit of Freedon Nadd, who told him he would become a Sith Lord. The prophecy came true when the Krath, a secret dark side society, attacked the Republic and injured Ulic with alchemically-treated shrapnel, and then injected him with dark side poisons that would ensure his fall. Exar Kun left his master, Vodo-Siosk Baas, because his master would not let him learn about the dark side. He went to Onderon, where he learned of Freedon Nadd's tomb. Nadd's spirit told him to go to Korriban, where Nadd tricked him into accepting the dark side. They went to Yavin IV, where Nadd gave him a choice: surrender to the dark side, or die. Kun chose life. After learning about the dark side from Nadd, Kun destroyed him with a dark side amulet. Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma met on Cinnagar, and their battle was interrupted by the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who declared Kun the Dark Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice. Together, they waged war on the Republic, stealing Jedi students from Ossus and subverting them to the dark side. Qel-Droma defeated Lord Mandalore, earning the services of the Mandalorian warriors. Qel-Droma attacked Coruscant, but was captured. Kun led a rescue attempt, and killed his former master in the process. Soon thereafter, the Sith Lords caused the Cron Cluster to go supernova, destroying countless Jedi artifacts on nearby Ossus. Before Ossus was destroyed, Ulic's brother Cay tried to convince him to return to the light. Ulic cut him down in a lightsaber duel and, horrified by what he had done, surrendered himself to his former lover, Nomi Sunrider, when she forever cut off his connection to the Force. Broken, Ulic surrendered to the Republic, and led them to Yavin IV, where Exar Kun committed a ritual that sapped the life from every Massassi on the planet to separate his spirit from his body and bind it to his temple. The Cleansing of the Nine Houses are the events during the aftermath of the Great Sith War, when, after the repentance of Ulic Qel-Droma, and the death/ascension of Exar Kun, the Old Republic hunted down and bloodily purged the remnants of the Sith Brotherhood. The computer game Knights of the Old Republic, takes place forty years after the end of the Sith War. Comic series =Knights of the Old Republic= Knights of the Old Republic (1993‚Äì94) is a five-part series by Tom Veitch, Chris Gossett, Janine Johnston, and David Roach. It is set between 4,000 and 3,999 years before the Battle of Yavin. =The Freedon Nadd Uprising= The Freedon Nadd Uprising (1994) is a two-part story arc by Tom Veitch, Tony Akins, and Dennis Rodier, set during the same era as the previous arc. While attempting to move the sarcophagi of Freedon Nadd and Queen Amanoa to the moon of Dxun, Jedi Knights Arca Jeth, Ulic Qel-Droma, Cay Qel-Droma, Tott Doneeta and Oss Wilum are attacked by several hundred Naddists, led by Warb Null, invading Iziz from underground. While distracting the Iziz forces, a group of Naddists are able to snatch the sarcophagi and take it back with them underground. Master Arca, Ulic and Queen Galia consult Galia's ailing father, King Ommin, for assistance. However, they are confronted by the spirit of Freedon Nadd, and Ommin betrays his seemingly immobile state by attacking Master Arca, knocking him unconscious. Warb Null comes in and attacks Ulic, but is soon bested and killed by the young Jedi. Unfortunately, this gives Ommin the time he needs to kidnap Master Arca. Meanwhile, on Ossus, Nomi Sunrider, Dace Diath, Shoaneb Culu, Kith Kark and Qrrrl Toq are chosen to defend Iziz in the forthcoming Second Battle of Onderon. On Coruscant, heirs to the Empress Teta system royalty and members of the Dark Side cult the Krath, Satal and Aleema Keto, enter the Galactic Museum and find a fascinating Sith book. Satal steals it while the curator is not looking, and, after seeing a news report on the Sith practitioners still active in Iziz, the Ketos fly to Onderon to find said practitioners and discover the secrets of their new book. Satal and Aleema Keto arrive on Onderon to find a massive battle taking place. Their ship, The Krath Enchanter, crashes, but the young Ketos are able to escape with their lives. Meanwhile, the Jedi task force from Ossus, led by Nomi Sunrider, battles their way through Sith war droids and Naddists. Kith Kark is killed in the assault, as the rest of the Jedi infiltrate the royal palace, meeting up with Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, Tott Doneeta and Oss Wilum. Meanwhile, the Ketos are greeted by King Ommin, hoping to unlock the mysteries of their stolen Sith tome. Ommin gives Satal an amulet, with which he can read the book perfectly, as Arca Jeth is hung on the wall, suffering under deadly Sith magic. Out in the battlefield, Cay Qel-Droma has his prosthetic arm cut off by a war droid, which he quickly dispatches of with his organic arm. The group of seven Jedi arrive at King Ommin's stronghold, and Ulic slices off the former King's armature, sending him tumbling to the ground limply. Victorious, the forces of Iziz soon transport the sarcophagi of Freedon Nadd, Queen Amanoa and now King Ommin to Dxun, to forever be laid to rest. =Dark Lords of the Sith= Dark Lords of the Sith (1994‚Äì95) is a six-part story arc by Kevin J. Anderson, Tom Veitch, Chris Gossett, and Art Wetherell. It is set two years after the previous arcs, continues the tale of Ulic Qel-Droma, and introduces the character of Exar Kun, a dark lord of the Sith. The story details how the Jedi, led by Ulic Qel-Droma and Nomi Sunrider attempt to free the Empress Teta System from the tyrannical control of evil Dark Side adepts Satal and Aleema. It also details Exar Kun's fall to the Dark Side at the seduction of the spirit of Freedon Nadd, becoming Dark Lord of the Sith with Ulic as his apprentice. =The Sith War= The Sith War (1995‚Äì96) is a six-part comic by Kevin J. Anderson, set a year after the previous arc. It continues the story of Ulic Qel-Droma and Exar Kun. The story also shows how the current Mandalore shows great loyalty to Ulic. Mandalore the Indomitable, wage war on the Teta system. Mandalore challenges Ulic Qel-Droma to a duel, which Ulic accepts on the terms that if he wins, he shall receive control of the Mandalorian warriors. Ulic wins, and recruits Mandalore and his army to fight for the Sith. They begin to plan a devastating attack on Coruscant. =Prequels= The Golden Age of the Sith The Golden Age of the Sith (1996‚Äì97) a six- part arc by Kevin J. Anderson, Chris Gossett, and Dario Carrasco Jr., set a millennium before the original comic. Odan-Urr is studying Jedi history when his master, Ooroo, sends him to the Koros system to help Empress Teta fight the Unification Wars and unite the seven worlds located in the system. Once he has arrived on Cinnagar he helps to conquer the last planet, Kirrek, with Battle Meditation, a technique he has learned about in his studies. But even with this technique he cannot prevent casualties from occurring; among them are two blockade runners, Hok and Timar Daragon. With their parents dead, Gav and Jori Daragon get their ship, Starbreaker 12, back from Aarrba the Hutt who was holding it back as collateral. With the ship Gav and Jori have become hyperspace explorers, but their latest route proves less than successful; they just barely make it through. They make it back to Cinnegar, but their ship is heavily damaged. Aarrba the Hutt agrees to make the repairs, but he won't give their ship back until they have paid all the bills. Ssk Kahorr sends one of his drone ships along the route discovered by Gav and Jori, but it is destroyed when it passes too close to Primus Goluud, a red supergiant. Ssk Kahorr isn't pleased with this and sends two bounty hunters after the two hyperspace explorers. But they are saved by two Jedi, Odan-Urr and Memit Nadill. They advise them to leave the Koros system, because it is not safe for them. Gav and Jori steal back the Starbreaker 12 and desperately flee the system with random hyperspace coordinates. On Korriban, on the far side of the galaxy, a funeral procession is held for Marka Ragnos, a Dark Lord of the Sith. The procession is led by Sith Lord Ludo Kressh. Just when the tomb is about to be closed, however, Kressh's nemesis, Naga Sadow, arrives. A fight about who should be the next Dark Lord ensues between the two rivals, but they are stopped by the ghost of Ragnos himself, who warns them of what is to come. Meanwhile, back in the Koros system, Odan-Urr has a premonition about the evil Jedi banished centuries ago. He tells Empress Teta about his dreams, and she promises that she will raise the matter on Coruscant. Back on Korriban, the Starbreaker 12 arrives and Gav and Jori are captured by the Sith forces. On Ziost, the Sith Lords discuss what to do with the prisoners. After a long debate it is decided to have Gav and Jori killed. But Naga Sadow, seeing in these prisoners a chance to expand the Sith Empire, does not give up this easily. He sends one of his Massassi warriors to retrieve the weapons on their ship. He hatches a plan to capture the prisoners for himself and use them to regain contact with the Republic. Together with his most loyal Massassi warriors, he frees the Daragons. But to keep his identity hidden from the other Sith Lords, he has to kill everyone in his path, including his old mentor Simus. He leaves a Republic blaster behind, to let others think it was an attack by the Republic. Gav and Jori are sent to his stronghold on Khar Shian and Sadow returns to Ziost where an urgent meeting is held between the Sith Lords. The other Sith Lords are indecisive about what to do and in the confusion he claims to be named the new Dark Lord of the Sith. The other Sith Lords, except Ludo Kressh and his supporters, agree. Sadow immediately calls upon the others to prepare their ships and warriors so they can attack the Republic first. Empress Teta and her two Jedi advisors have arrived at Coruscant, where she addresses the Senate about Odan-Urr's premonition, but the people listening do not believe her. Even without the help of the Republic, Teta decides to prepare her own forces. In Naga Sadow's hidden fortress on the dark side of Kar Shian, he trains Gav Daragon in the ways of the Sith. Sadow sends his Massassi warriors to retrieve the Starbreaker 12 from Ziost and then travels to his decoy fortress on Khar Delba, where Jori Daragon is held. On Ziost, Sadow's loyal Massassi steal the Starbreaker 12, but not without leaving evidence of their Master's involvement. Ludo Kressh discovers this evidence, and together with his supporters, Horak-mul and Dor Gal-ram, he prepares to attack Sadow's fortress on Khar Delba. Meanwhile, the Starbreaker 12 arrives there. Kressh's forces have arrived at Khar Delba and have opened fire at Sadow's apparently defenseless fortress. Sadow convinces Daragon that she must return to the Republic before the fortress is destroyed. Reluctant to leave her brother behind, she agrees. After the Starbreaker 12 has escaped to hyperspace, Sadow calls in his fleet that he had hidden on the dark side of Khar Shian. But that is not all; Massassi warriors on the ships of Horak-mul and Dol Gal-ram kill the Sith Lords and direct their fire on Kressh, who has no choice but to retreat. After this victory, Sadow prepares his forces to invade the Republic, using the tracking beacon hidden on the Starbreaker 12. The Fall of the Sith Empire The Fall of the Sith Empire (1997) is a five-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson, Dario Carrasco, Dario Carrasco Jr, Bill Black, David Jacob Beckett, and Ray Murtaugh. Set in the same era as the previous comic, many battles are recounted. The Battle of Coruscant was the first battle between the Galactic Republic and Naga Sadow's Sith Empire. Memit Nadill, trusting in Odan-Urr's judgement, came to Coruscant to rally the Jedi before the Sith were to attack, but the invasion fleet came early. The Coruscant defense forces led by Jedi Guardian Anavus Svag defended the planet as other Republic forces and Jedi joined the defense. The size of the Sith Lord's army is visually exaggerated and influenced by Sadow himself, meditating in his meditation sphere high above Primus Goluud. When Gav Daragon fires on the sphere, Naga Sadow's concentration is disrupted, causing much of the army on Coruscant to fade. This increases the confidence and resolve of the Jedi and Republic soldiers, allowing them to take advantage and repel the Sith invasion. The Battle of Koros Major is fought between the army of Koros and the Sith Empire. Naga Sadow's focus is on the Battle of Coruscant, so he appoints his prisoner Gav Daragon as commander of the Koros Major invasion fleet. As the battle begins, Gav lands on the planet to look for his sister Jori, with a group of Massassi bodyguards. As Gav enters Aarrba the Hutt's repair dock, his bodyguards see the Hutt as a threat, and attack and kill him. Jori enters at that exact moment and attacks Gav with a lightsaber given to her by Odan-Urr, assuming he had killed Aarrba. Gav escapes and flees the planet, leaving Teta's men to battle the Sith to eventual victory. The Battle of Kirrek is fought between the army of Koros and the Sith Empire. Prior to the battle, Empress Teta had made an agreement with Commander Llaban, commander of the rebellion in the earlier Battle of Kirrek, to fight alongside each other to defend Kirrek against the Sith, earning amnesty for the ex- rebels. She also decides to let the prisoners mining the colony world of Ronika to fight in the defense of Kirrek, but they are absent for the beginning of the battle. Early in the battle, Odan-Urr attempts to use his Battle Meditation as he did during the Unification Wars, but the fury and determination of the Massassi warriors is infallible. Led by the Sith Lord Shar Dakhan, the Massassi break through the line of defenders and begin climbing the wall. Separating much of the defenders from the Sith onslaught, Odan-Urr's Master Ooroo orders the Kirrek rebels to find cover. He then tips himself over, shattering his cyanogen tank and sending the fumes into the breaths of several Massassi, killing them instantly. This kills Ooroo as well, as oxygen is just as toxic to him as cyanogen is to the Massassi. As the prisoners from Ronika arrive, and with the death of the Sith commander, victory for the Tetans quickly becomes a foregone conclusion. The Battle of Primus Goluud takes place above the red supergiant Primus Goluud between Empress Teta's forces and the Sith Empire. Jori Daragon leads Empress Teta to her brother Gav, presuming he has turned to the dark side of the Force. Gav, trapped in Sadow's meditation sphere, proves he is still on their side by transmitting the coordinates to Korriban to Teta's ship. Soon, the dark lord's ships arrives and engages the Koros battalion. Sadow wastes no time in using a superweapon attached to his flagship to trigger solar flares across Primus Goluud. The Sith forces retreat to the Sith Empire, closely followed by Teta's ships, as Gav is left to die in the meditation sphere. The First Battle of Korriban is fought between Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh's respective war fleets high above the Sith funeral world of Korriban. Fleeing the Battle of Primus Goluud, Sadow's fleet is confronted by Kressh, who declares himself the new Dark Lord of the Sith and banishes Sadow from the Sith Empire. A fierce battle between the Sith Lords ensues, until Sadow crashes one of his ships into Kressh's flagship, killing the new Dark Lord. The Second Battle of Korriban immediately follows the first battle. The Tetan forces, using coordinates given to them by Gav Daragon, come out of hyperspace very soon after Kressh's death in the First Battle of Korriban, catching Sadow by surprise. This allows the Koros ships to quickly put the Sith Empire's forces at a disadvantage. Sadow has another trick up his sleeve, however; the Dark Lord orders his Massassi to kill their commanders on each ship, leaving a massive, impassable barricade between himself and the Koros fleet. Sadow then flees to Yavin 4 with his one remaining ship, to hopefully rebuild the once glorious Sith legacy. =Sequel= Redemption (1998) is a five-part arc by Kevin J. Anderson and Chris Gossett. It is set ten years after the end of the original comic run. Hoggon's ship arrives in the Yavin System and makes its way to the surface. Hoggon tells Ulic of the events that happened there, but all Ulic can see is ghosts, including that of his dead brother, Cay. Ulic tells Hoggon that this place will not do as well. On Ryloth, many Twi'leks flee as a heat storm rages upon them, with Jedi Tott Doneeta doing what he can to help. He tries using the force to hold back the storm, but is overwhelmed, receiving burns across the side of his face. Rather than stay and rest his wounds, he announces that he must leave for the Great Jedi Convocation. On Exis Station, Master Thon arrives, meeting Vima Sunrider, now a teenager. The two are shortly interrupted by the Cathar Jedi Sylvar, and the two Jedi leave Vima to join the convocation that has begun. While Nomi speaks, Vima gets bored and decides to take off and try out flying a mining ship. But, while flying, Vima gets caught in a magnetic loop and has her ship disabled and is forced to eject. She is then rescued by a late arrival for the convocation, Tott Doneeta. Upon arriving back at the station, Nomi questions her daughter's actions, asking how she can expect to become a Jedi with such brash choices. Vima responds by saying if Nomi would spend more time training her, she could have gotten out of it herself. Elsewhere, Hoggon's ship arrives on the icy surface of Rhen Var. Upon landing, Ulic announces that he is satisfied with this place. Hoggon arrives at Exis Station and takes a place in an airshaft to watch the convocation, as Sylvar has taken the chance to speak. She talks of Ulic Qel-Droma and mentions that he betrayed the Jedi and now wanders free. She makes reference to Ulic's conspiring with Exar Kun, and the death of Jedi, including her mate Crado. She then states that Ulic is the greatest shame of the Jedi Knights. On Rhen Var, Ulic takes up his lightsaber, but cannot feel anything in the force. The weapon is nothing but a tool in his hands. The ground beneath him then gives way, dropping him into a hole. Back on Exis, Vima stares at two hologram's belonging to her mother; one is Vima's father, Andur, and the other is Ulic. Vima asks her mother about training, to which Nomi responds with \\"not today.\\" Vima then goes off to the docking bay, stowing away on a ship, intent on finding her own trainer. Also in the docking bay is Tott, who asks Sylvar to come with him to Ryloth, in order to deal with the anger within her. Upon arriving at the new city of Tott's clan, the two Jedi are told of an attack on the clan by another clan. Tott leaves to deal with the situation and asks Sylvar to help while he is gone. Sylvar decides to try and rally the clan, telling them that they must attack and have revenge. Tott returns to announce that blood shed does not create peaces, and that a solution has been reached; the two clan leaders will go into the desert together and a new head-clan will join the tribes. Not used to the difference in custom, Sylvar asks to be taken home to Cathar. On Rhen Var, Ulic looks back on what he has done in the past; betraying Nomi and killing Cay. He considers this to be a place as good as any to die, but is urged to live on by an image of his deceased teacher, Master Arca Jeth. Ulic pulls his strength together and climbs back up through the snow. On Exis Station, Nomi finds her hologram of Ulic missing, and is told by Master Thon that Vima is missing. On his ship, Hoggon discovers that Vima has stowed away on his ship. Vima says she is looking for Ulic Qel-Droma, and show Hoggon the hologram. Hoggon takes her to Rhen Var and drops her on the planet, giving her a transmitter with which to contact him. After Hoggon leaves, Vima states that she will not leave until she is a Jedi.

The western 25% of the island is formed by another volcano, Mauna Kahalawai, also referred to as the West Maui Mountains. The tallest peak of HaleakalƒÅ (\\"house of the sun\\"), at , is Puu Ulaula (Red Hill). From the summit one looks down into a massive depression some 11.25 km (7 mi) across, 3.2 km (2 mi) wide, and nearly 800 m (2,600 ft) deep. The surrounding walls are steep and the interior mostly barren-looking with a scattering of volcanic cones.  History  Early Hawaiians applied the name HaleakalƒÅ (\\"house of the sun\\") to the general mountain. HaleakalƒÅ is also the name of a peak on the southwestern edge of Kaup≈ç Gap. In Hawaiian folklore, the depression (crater) at the summit of HaleakalƒÅ was home to the grandmother of the demigod MƒÅui. According to the legend, MƒÅui's grandmother helped him capture the sun and force it to slow its journey across the sky in order to lengthen the day. Geology According to the United States Geological Survey USGS Volcano Warning Scheme for the United States, the Volcano Alert Level for Haleakala as of August 2015 was \\"normal\\". A Normal status is used to designate typical volcanic activity in a non- eruptive phase. Haleakala has produced numerous eruptions in the last 30,000 years, including in the last 500 years. This volcanic activity has been along two rift zones: the southwest and east. These two rift zones together form an arc that extends from La Perouse Bay on the southwest, through the HaleakalƒÅ Crater, and to HƒÅna to the east. The east rift zone continues under the ocean beyond the east coast of Maui as HaleakalƒÅ Ridge, making the combined rift zones one of the longest in the Hawaiian Islands chain.In its prime, Haleakala may have reached a height of 12,000 feet before water and wind erosion, and possibly glaciers, began to carve two large river valleys out of the rim. Eventually, these valleys formed gaps that merged at the volcano summit to create a crater-like basin. Until recently, East Maui Volcano was thought to have last erupted around 1790, based largely on comparisons of maps made during the voyages of La Perouse and George Vancouver. Recent advanced dating tests, however, have shown that the last eruption was more likely to have been in the 17th century. These last flows from the southwest rift zone of HaleakalƒÅ make up the large lava deposits of the Ahihi Kina\`u/La Perouse Bay area of South Maui. Contrary to popular belief, HaleakalƒÅ crater is not volcanic in origin, nor can it accurately be called a caldera (which is formed when the summit of a volcano collapses to form a depression). Scientists believe that HaleakalƒÅ's crater was formed when the headwalls of two large erosional valleys merged at the summit of the volcano. These valleys formed the two large gaps ‚Äî Koolau on the north side and Kaup≈ç on the south ‚Äî on either side of the depression. Macdonald, Abbott, & Peterson state it this way: > HaleakalƒÅ is far smaller than many volcanic craters (calderas); there is an > excellent chance that it is not extinct, but only dormant; and strictly > speaking it is not of volcanic origin, beyond the fact that it exists in a > volcanic mountain.Macdonald, Abbott, & Peterson p. 391 Haleakala as seen looking northwest from Big Island, Hawaii, near Kawaihae, away =Volcanic hazard= Lava Flow Hazard map of Haleakala. The Maui Hazard Zone numbers are two less than the equivalent Hawaii Hazard Zone numbers. On the island of Hawaii, lava-flow hazards are rated on a scale of one through nine with one being the zone of highest hazard and nine being the zone of lowest hazard. For example, the summits and rift zones of Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes are rated Hazard Zone 1. Using this same scale, preliminary estimates of lava-flow hazard zones on Maui made in 1983 by the U.S. Geological Survey rated the summit and southwest rift zone of Haleakala as Hazard Zone 3. The steep, downslope areas of the Kanaio and Kahikinui ahupuaa and the area north of Hana are rated as Hazard Zone 4. Other areas of Haleakala are rated comparable to the lava-flow hazards of Mauna Kea and Kohala (Hazard Zones 7 through 9). These high hazard estimates for Haleakala are based on the frequency of its eruptions. Haleakala has erupted three times in approximately the last 900 years. By way of comparison, both Mauna Loa and Kilauea have erupted more than a dozen times each in the last 90 years. Hualalai has an eruption rate comparable to Haleakala. All of Hualalai is rated as Hazard Zone 4. However, the frequency of eruption of a volcano is only one of the criteria on which hazards are based. The other important criterion is the lava flow coverage rate. Using the preliminary dates for Haleakala flows, only of lava flows have been emplaced in the last 900 years. In comparison, approximately of Hualalai are covered with flows 900 years old or younger and approximately on Kilauea and on Mauna Loa are covered by lavas less than 200 years old. Thus, Haleakala is a distant fourth in coverage rates. Modern uses =National Park= Silversword is fragile and lives only upon the slopes of HaleakalƒÅ. Surrounding and including the crater is HaleakalƒÅ National Park, a park, of which are wilderness. The park includes the summit depression, Kipahulu Valley on the southeast, and Oheo Gulch (and pools), extending to the shoreline in the Kipahulu area. From the summit, there are two main trails leading into HaleakalƒÅ: Sliding Sands Trail and Halemauu Trail. The temperature near the summit tends to vary between about 40 ¬∞F (5 ¬∞C) and 60 ¬∞F (16 ¬∞C) and, especially given the thin air and the possibility of dehydration at that elevation, the walking trails can be more challenging than one might expect. This is aggravated by the fact that trails lead downhill from parking areas into the crater. Because of this, hikers are faced with a difficult return ascent after potentially descending 2000 ft or more to the crater floor. Despite this, HaleakalƒÅ is popular with tourists and locals alike, who often venture to its summit, or to the visitor center just below the summit, to view the sunrise. There is lodging in the form of a few simple cabins, though no food or gas is available in the park. =Astrophysical research= The Space Surveillance Systems Because of the remarkable clarity, dryness, and stillness of the air, and its elevation (with atmospheric pressure of ), as well as the absence of the lights of major cities, the summit of HaleakalƒÅ is one of the most sought-after locations in the world for ground-based telescopes (though to a lesser extent than Mauna Kea on neighboring Hawaii). As a result of the geographic importance of this observational platform, experts come from all over the world to take part in research at \\"Science City\\", an astrophysical complex operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, University of Hawaii, Smithsonian Institution, Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration, and others. Some of the telescopes operated by the US Department of Defense are involved in researching man-made (e.g. spacecraft, monitoring satellites, rockets, and laser technology) rather than celestial objects. The program is in collaboration with defense contractors in the Maui Research and Technology Park in Kihei. The astronomers on HaleakalƒÅ are concerned about increasing light pollution as Maui's population grows. Nevertheless, new telescopes are added, such as the Pan- STARRS in 2006. From the print edition =Transportation= Map Public road to Mount Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii A well traveled HaleakalƒÅ Highway, completed in 1935, is a road mainly composed of switchbacks that leads to the peak of Haleakala. The road is open to the public (although parts of it are restricted) and is a well-maintained two-lane highway containing many blind turns and very steep dropoffs. Local animals, including cattle, are often encountered in the roadway. The Park Service charges a vehicle entrance fee of $30 (US). Public transportation does not go through the park, but there are four vehicle based tour companies (Polynesian Adventure Tours, Skyline Eco Adventures, Haleakala EcoTours, and Valley Isle Excursions) that operate tours of the park and trips to the summit. There are three Sunset and Stargazing tours permitted within Haleakala National Park. Arrive for sunset and stay to look through a telescope after dark. Cycling and horseback riding are other popular ways to explore the park. There are a few tour guides on Maui that pick people up at their hotels, and outfit them with a bicycle to glide down the road from just outside the National Park boundary (starting at 6500 ft altitude). Tour operators used to run bike rides down the entire 27 miles from the summit, but in 2007 the National Park Service suspended all commercial bicycle activity within the park boundaries, following multiple fatal accidents. Some tour operators now offer a modified version of the service which descends 6,500 feet from outside of the National Park. Climate HaleakalƒÅ's summit experiences a cold-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen classification Csc), one of the few locations in the world with this climate type. The HaleakalƒÅ Ranger station, at a lower elevation, lies in the subtropical highland climate zone.

She was named for Commander William B. Ault, air group commander aboard . Commander Ault was declared missing in action on 8 May 1942 after leading an air attack in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his action in the battle. Built by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey Ault was laid down 15 November 1943, launched 26 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Ault, Commander Ault's widow. Ault was commissioned 31 May 1944, Commander Joseph C. Wylie in command. Service history =World War II= After fitting out, the destroyer departed New York on 10 July 1944 for shakedown training in the Caribbean. She returned to New York for post-shakedown availability and to complete preparations for the long cruise to join the action in the Pacific. Acting as an escort for the cruiser , Ault sailed on 6 September for Trinidad. Detached from escort duty upon her arrival, she transited the Panama Canal and proceeded independently via San Diego to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 29 September. After three months of intensive training in Hawaiian waters, the warship got underway on 18 December and headed west to join Vice Admiral John S. McCain's Fast Carrier Task Force. After a refueling stop at Eniwetok on Christmas Day, Ault entered Ulithi Lagoon on 28 December 1944 and, along with her sister ships of Destroyer Squadron 62 (DesRon 62), reported to Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan for duty in the escort screen of Task Group 38.2 (TG 38.2). When Ault reached the forward area, Leyte was in American hands; but the Philippines were still the focus of the aircraft carrier's operations, and they were directed to strike targets on Luzon and Formosa early in January 1945. Ault sortied on 30 December 1944 with TG 38.2 screening that task group. After the strike on Formosa on 9 January, the destroyer in company with , , and , swept Bashi Channel ahead of Task Force 38 (TF 38), while proceeding into the South China Sea. Heavy weather as well as the proximity of the enemy created a tense atmosphere in which the carriers continued to mount strikes against the Cam Ranh Bay area, Hong Kong, Hainan, Swatow, and the Formosa Strait. Returning to the Pacific through the Balintang Channel on the night of 20 January, the task force launched final strikes against Formosa and Okinawa before returning to Ulithi on 25 January. Shortly before the assault on Iwo Jima, TF 38 was reorganized as TF 58 under Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher. Ault was assigned to Rear Admiral Forrest Sherman's Task Group 58.3, which launched diversionary strikes against Formosa, Luzon, and the Japanese mainland on 16 and 17 February. The carriers provided air cover for the operations on Iwo Jima on 19 February and raided the Tokyo area on the 25th and Okinawa on 1 March before retiring to Ulithi on 4 March. The destroyer returned to the action with TG 58.3 on 14 March for operations to neutralize Japanese air power during the forthcoming Okinawa campaign. In response to strikes against Ky≈´sh≈´ and Honsh≈´, the Japanese retaliated with air strikes against the task group; and, on 20 March, Ault splashed her first two enemy planes. On 23 and 24 March, the task group launched preinvasion strikes against Okinawa; and, on 27 March, Ault assisted the ships of DesRon 62 and four cruisers in shore bombardment of Minami Daito Shima. The warship's next two months were enlivened by days and nights of continuous general quarters. Kamikaze attacks on 6 and 7 April damaged and . On 11 April, a suicide plane that missed Essex came perilously close to Ault; but her gunners splashed the plane close aboard her starboard quarter. was badly hit that day. Ault again participated in the bombardment of Minami Daito Shima on 10 May, then rejoined the task force to assist in repelling heavy enemy air attack. While screening on the morning of 11 May, Ault splashed one kamikaze, but two others hit the carrier. After rescuing 29 men from the stricken ship, the destroyer escorted her to the replenishment group and rejoined the action on the 13th. During attacks on 13 and 14 May, she succeeded in splashing three more planes. On 1 June, Ault put into San Pedro Bay, Leyte, after 80 days at sea. Task Force 58 was redesignated TF 38; and, on 1 July, Ault sortied for strikes against the Japanese home islands. On 18 and 19 July, the ship joined with Cruiser Division 18 and other destroyers in an antishipping sweep of Sagami Wan and a bombardment of Nojima Saki. The following day, she rejoined the task group and continued to support the carriers until Japan capitulated on 15 August. Ault operated off the coast of Honsh≈´ on patrol until 2 September when she entered Tokyo Bay and anchored near during the formal surrender ceremony on board that battleship. The destroyer soon resumed patrol with the task group out of Tokyo and continued that duty until 30 October, when she steamed for Sasebo, Japan, to perform more carrier and escort duties. On 31 December 1945, the destroyer departed Japan, bound for the United States, and arrived at San Francisco on 20 January 1946. After a short respite, she was underway again and headed via the Panama Canal for Boston. Following brief stops along the east coast, the vessel entered the Boston Navy Yard on 26 April 1946 for a well-deserved overhaul. =1947‚Äì50= The yard work was completed on 15 March 1947, and Ault steamed to Charleston, South Carolina, her base for local operations and training exercises until 12 July, when she sailed for New Orleans and two years there as a Naval Reserve training ship. During her operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, she visited such ports as Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba; Kingston, Jamaica; Coco Solo, Canal Zone; Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Veracruz, Mexico; and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. During this period, she also performed planeguard duties for carriers operating out of Pensacola, Florida, and underwent an overhaul in Charleston from 24 February to 11 May 1948. On 21 August 1949, after a month of intensive training in Guantanamo Bay, Ault put into Norfolk to fit out for her first Mediterranean cruise. From 6 to 16 September, the warship steamed across the Atlantic to join 6th Fleet tactical exercises and maneuvers, including a simulated assault on Cyprus. Her ports of call included Aranci Bay, Sardinia; Cannes, France; Argostoli and Piraeus, Greece; and Famagusta, Cyprus. Ault departed Gibraltar on 16 November; headed for the British Isles; and put into Plymouth, England, on 19 November. Prior to leaving Europe, she called at Antwerp, Belgium; Rouen, France; the Isle of Portland, England; and Leith, Scotland. She moored in Norfolk on 26 January 1950 and prepared for inactivation. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 31 May and was towed to the Charleston Naval Shipyard for berthing in the Inactive Reserve Fleet. =1950‚Äì53= However, her respite was brief. With the outbreak of the Korean War, the Navy needed more active destroyers. On 15 November 1950, Ault was recommissioned at Charleston under the command of Comdr. Harry Marvin-Smith. She steamed to her home port, Norfolk, for the Christmas holidays and to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training in March. After a post-shakedown overhaul in Charleston, the ship returned to her home port, sortied with her sister ships of DesRon 22, and carried out antisubmarine warfare exercises in Cuban waters. She returned to Norfolk on 13 August for upkeep. Ault sailed for the Mediterranean on 3 September for another tour with the 6th Fleet and stopped for liberty calls in ports in Sicily, Italy, France, Greece, and Portugal. On 30 January 1952, she departed Gibraltar in Destroyer Division 222 (DesDiv 222) and steamed via Bermuda to Norfolk where she arrived on 10 February. The warship's activities during the first few months of 1952 consisted of training exercises in the Virginia Capes, Caribbean operations, and an upkeep period in Charleston. On 4 June, she embarked midshipmen for a training cruise that took them to Torbay, England; Le Havre, France; and Guantanamo Bay. Upon her arrival back at Norfolk on 4 August, Ault conducted local type training into the new year. During February 1953, the ship participated in drills in the Caribbean while operating out of St. Thomas and St. Croix, Virgin Islands. On 11 March, she commenced an overhaul in the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Upon completion of the yard work, she steamed back via her home port to Guantanamo Bay where she arrived on 31 July for refresher training. Following two months training and one month loading supplies, Ault departed Norfolk on 2 November with DesDiv 222 for an around-the-world cruise. After transiting the Panama Canal and stopping at San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Midway, she arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 6 December and reported for duty with the 7th Fleet. On 20 December 1953, Ault collided with during antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises in the Sea of Japan. The former's bow was torn off at frame eight, and the damaged destroyer was towed to Yokosuka for repairs by . =1954‚Äì66= On 14 March 1954, Ault once again got underway for training and a subsequent voyage westward through the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, across the Atlantic Ocean, to arrive home at Norfolk on 4 June. She operated with various warships along the way and made port calls at Hong Kong, Singapore; Colombo, Ceylon; Port Said, Egypt; Athens; Naples; Villefranche-sur-Mer, France; Barcelona, Spain; and Gibraltar. For the remainder of 1954, she operated along the east coast. For the first six months of 1955, the destroyer conducted Caribbean exercises and local operations, including plane guard duty off Jacksonville, Florida, with carrier . She entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 1 July for a three-month overhaul which was followed by one month of refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. The warship returned to her home port on 26 November and commenced type training and local operations along the east coast. On 1 May 1956, Ault sailed for the Mediterranean where she participated in Kiel Week ceremonies in Kiel, Germany; 6th Fleet exercises; and a month and one-half in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The cruise ended with her arrival in Norfolk on 17 September. On 28 January 1957, Ault got underway again with DesRon 22 for a five-month tour of duty overseas. The destroyer exercised with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and called at ports in Italy, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, and Sicily before returning to Norfolk in June. After three months of local operations along the east coast, Ault sortied with on 3 September to join other destroyers in North Atlantic and Arctic waters for Operation Strikeback. Upon completion of the exercise, she put into Cherbourg, France, on 30 September for a short leave period before heading home. She moored in Norfolk on 21 October and resumed local operations. On 19 November she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. After a four-month overhaul, refresher training, and upkeep, the destroyer got underway on 17 June 1958 for hunter-killer operations in the Atlantic with . On 2 September, she steamed in company with DesDiv 222 to the Mediterranean for another six-month deployment before resuming local operations out of Norfolk in March 1959. In June, the ship entered the Great Lakes for Operation Inland Seas, a celebration honoring the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Later in the year, she assisted the Fleet Sonar School in Key West, Florida, and participated in Atlantic coast exercises. With the beginning of 1960, Ault was again deployed to the Mediterranean. On 9 March 1960, the destroyer, in company with John W. Weeks, transited the Bosporus and the two became the first U.S. warships to enter the Black Sea since 1945. Her Black Sea entry was, in part, a secret radio probing mission, for which she was fitted with radio eavesdropping gear manned by civilian technicians. As they entered the Black Sea, Ault and John W. Weeks were followed by a Russian trawler, but all three ships soon stopped when John W. Weeks faked a breakdown by hosting a breakdown flag. The ships sat for some time while Ault was building superheat in her boilers; suddenly, Ault got underway at maximum speed toward Russia, leaving the trawler far behind. The trip's mission was kept secret from the crew until she started moving, at which point the captain announced they were heading to Russia. He also indicated there were American fighters circling just outside the Black Sea, and if they got into trouble, the planes could go supersonic and assist in minutes. The ship headed north, approaching Russia, and then turned around to rejoin the Weeks and depart the Black Sea. She returned to Norfolk in September and commenced overhaul in December. Ault emerged from the shipyard in March 1961, sailed to Guantanamo Bay for refresher training, and then resumed normal operations. She returned to the Mediterranean in August to participate in NATO Exercises Checkmate I and Checkmate II, and Operation Greenstone. She also took part in Operation Royal Flush V with the British Navy prior to her steaming back to the United States. In June 1962, Ault entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. Designed to extend the life of the destroyer by eight years, the overhaul enabled her to meet the challenge of newer and faster enemy submarines. Aults 40 mm and 20 mm gun mounts were removed, and her 01 level afterdeck was converted to a helicopter flight deck to facilitate the use of drone antisubmarine helicopters (DASH), one of the Navy's newest weapon systems which enabled the destroyer to reach out farther in search of submarine targets. After completion of the overhaul in February 1963, Ault devoted the rest of the year to improving her readiness and the skill of her crew through various exercises and training cruises. Following a midshipmen cruise during the summer, the ship proceeded to Norfolk to take on DASH and to continue training. Ault was the first destroyer to carry the drones to Europe, when she sortied for the Mediterranean in February 1964 with DesDiv 142. Following participation in NATO exercises and visits at the usual ports in the Mediterranean, the destroyer returned to the United States and a new home port, Naval Station Mayport, Florida. She spent the remainder of the year operating in the Key West area. In January 1965, she participated in Operation Springboard in the Caribbean which was highlighted by several gunnery exercises and the firing of hundreds of rounds of ammunition in shore bombardment exercises at Culebra Island. The warship also trained in Hunter- Killer operations in March and was on station in the western Atlantic for the Gemini 3 space shot. On 17 March, Ault steered a familiar course toward the Mediterranean. Besides a full three-month schedule of drills, the ship made port calls in Marseille, Golfe-Juan, Livorno, Naples, and Palma before returning to Norfolk to spend the last four months of 1965 in the local operating areas training, requalifying in gunfire support, and going to sea for hurricane evasion. As a result of her intensive training, Ault won the DesRon 14 Battle Efficiency award, as well as Battle \\"E\\" awards for both the operations and weapons departments. Ault participated in Operation \\"Springboard\\" in January and February 1966, conducting ASW operations, shore bombardment, a full power run, and various gunnery exercises. She returned to Mayport only to head out to sea again for plane guard duty with . Upon her return to her home port, the destroyer underwent a preoverhaul availability and then entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard on 12 April for major work which ended on 14 September. =Vietnam War= Ault in January 1965, just before her first Vietnam deployment. She arrived back in Mayport on 7 October 1966 and devoted the last quarter of the year to training at Guantanamo Bay in preparation for a lengthy deployment to Vietnam. In company with DesDiv 161, Ault departed Mayport on 7 February 1967, transited the Panama Canal on 12 February, and stopped at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Yokosuka before joining the 7th Fleet on 11 March. After a short period of ASW drills with near Subic Bay, she steamed with to station in the Gulf of Tonkin for plane guard duties. On 16 April, the destroyer was assigned to Task Unit 77.1.1 for Operation Sea Dragon, offensive surface operations against waterborne logistic craft and coastal defense sites in North Vietnam. As part of this unit, she joined , , and in conducting sweeps from Cap Lay north to Thanh H√≥a. The warship was relieved on 30 April and returned to Subic Bay for upkeep. On 7 May, she got underway to the III and IV Corps areas of South Vietnam to provide gunfire support. For the next three weeks, Ault responded to requests for shore bombardment during the day, and for harassment, interdiction, and illumination fire during the night. As the only destroyer available in both Corps areas, she was responsible for the coast from the mouth of the Mekong in the IV Corps area to V≈©ng T√†u and H√†m T√¢n in the III Corps area. From 28 May to 2 June, Ault provided gunfire support in the I Corps area; then proceeded to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for upkeep alongside and then a week of rest and relaxation in Sasebo. On 19 June, the ship returned to the I Corps area of South Vietnam and, in the next three weeks, fired over 6,000 rounds of 5-inch ammunition at targets in the Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i and Chu Lai areas. After a six-day port visit to Hong Kong and five days of upkeep in Subic Bay, she once again operated in Operation Seadragon, came under heavy fire from coastal defense batteries north of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, but suffered no casualties or damage. On 1 August 1967, Ault completed her Vietnam tour and began her voyage home. She stopped at Kaohsiung, Yokosuka, Midway, Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, and Acapulco, and even made a side trip south of the equator to convert \\"Pollywogs\\" into \\"Shellbacks\\". The destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 7 September, arrived in Mayport on 11 September, and devoted the remainder of 1967 and the first six weeks of 1968 to leave and upkeep. =1968‚Äì74= From 12 to 23 February, Ault participated in Operation Springboard 1968 in the San Juan operating area. On 4 March, she participated in another Caribbean exercise, Operation Rugby-Match, a major fleet exercise which simulated a realistic air, surface, and subsurface threat environment. On 27 April, Ault sailed with for the Mediterranean and four months of continuous 6th Fleet operations. She returned to Mayport on 27 September, underwent upkeep, and performed three weeks of planeguard duties in December for . As a reward for her high degree of readiness and training, Ault was again awarded the Battle \\"E\\". For the first quarter of 1969, the destroyer spent most of her time in port at Mayport. She made cruises to the Caribbean in May, June, and July for training and returned to her home port to prepare for her last overseas deployment. Ault sailed for the North Atlantic on 2 September 1969 to participate in the NATO exercise, Operation Peacekeeper. However, her orders were modified on 24 September, and she steamed to the Mediterranean to relieve . She remained with the 6th Fleet for a three-month cruise highlighted by her participationin Operation Emery Cloth, a British ASW exercise in which Ault was the sole representative of the United States Navy. On 4 December, the warship returned home and prepared for Naval Reserve duty. She was designated a Naval Reserve training ship on 1 January 1970, and steamed to Galveston, Texas, on 12 January. There, she relieved as training ship for Houston area naval reservists. Ault spent the next three years making training cruises in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. On 1 May 1973, she departed Galveston for her last cruise, a voyage to NAVSTA Mayport for inactivation. The destroyer was decommissioned on 16 July 1973, ending a career of 29 years service. Struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1973, Ault was sold to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and subsequently scrapped. Awards Ault earned five battle stars for her service in World War II and an additional two for her service off Vietnam.

Haller, who platted the neighborhood in 1905. His father, Granville O. Haller, was one of Seattle's early settlers, an army officer who amassed a large estate in the region. The Duwamish tribe called the lake \\"Calmed Down a Little\\" (Lushootseed: sees√°hLtub), probably referring to the lake site as a place of refuge during slave raids. Early settlers called it Welch Lake after it was claimed in the 1880s by a British immigrant named John Welch. The lake is located between N. 128th Street to the north, N. 122nd Street to the south, Densmore Avenue N. to the west, and Corliss Avenue N. to the east. It covers ; its volume is and its maximum depth is . Its shoreline is private except for two public access points, the Meridian Avenue N. right-of-way on the north shore and the N. 125th Street right-of-way on the west. Haller Lake, which has a drainage area of about , discharges through an outlet control structure on the west side of the lake that drains to Lake Union. The boundaries of the neighborhood are N. 145th Street to the north, beyond which is the city of Shoreline; N. Northgate Way to the south, beyond which is Licton Springs; State Route 99 (Aurora Avenue) to the west, beyond which is Bitter Lake; and Interstate 5 to the east, beyond which is Jackson Park. Within the neighborhood are Northacres Park, a large, forested public park east of the lake on 1st Avenue N.E.; Ingraham High School, north of the lake on N. 130th Street; Lakeside School, alma mater of Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen, actor Adam West, and former Washington Governor Booth Gardner, in the northeast corner of the neighborhood; and Northwest Hospital & Medical Center, which occupies a campus southwest of the lake on N. 115th Street. The Haller Lake Community Club, just northwest of the lake at 12579 Densmore Avenue N., was formed in 1922 as the Haller Lake Improvement Club.

Its southern boundary is East 79th Street, its northern East 96th Street, its western Third Avenue, and its eastern the East River. Yorkville is among the city's most affluent neighborhoods. Yorkville is part of Manhattan Community District 8, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10028, 10075, and 10128. It is patrolled by the 19th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History Looking west at 90th Street and Second Avenue =Early history= In August 1776, George Washington stationed half of his Continental Army in Manhattan, with many troops in the Yorkville area in defensive positions along the East River to protect the other half of his army if they were to retreat from Brooklyn, and to inflict damage on invading land and sea forces. Following the Battle of Long Island defeat on August 27, the Continentals implemented an orderly pivoting retreat in the Yorkville area, leading the enemy to entice the Continentals to fight by piping \\"Fly Away\\", about a fox running away from hounds. The Continentals' disciplined northerly retreat led to the successful Battle of Harlem Heights in September 1776. In 1815, the Upper East Side was a farmland and market garden district. The Boston Post Road traversed the Upper East Side, locally called the Eastern Post Road; milepost 6 was near the northeast corner of Third Avenue and 81st Street. From 1833 to 1837 the New York and Harlem Railroad, one of the earliest railway systems in the United States, was extended through the Upper East Side along Fourth Avenue (later renamed Park Avenue). A hamlet grew near the 86th Street station, becoming the Yorkville neighborhood as gradual yet steady commercial development occurred. The current street grid was laid-out between 1839 and 1844 as part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, so the Eastern Post Road was abandoned. The community had been referred to as Yorkville before 1867. By 1850, a significant proportion of the inhabitants of the area were the Germans and the Irish that helped build the Croton Aqueduct. The area was included in the 19th administrative district whose boundaries were 40th and 86th Street. In 1858, trams were built along Second and Third Avenues. After the American Civil War, mansions replaced slums in Yorkville. On December 30, 1878, the IRT Third Avenue Line opened, followed by the IRT Second Avenue Line in August 1879. =Ethnic settlement= For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, Yorkville was a middle- to working-class neighborhood, inhabited by many people of Czech, Slovak, Irish, Polish, German, Hungarian, and Lebanese descent. The area was a mostly German enclave, though. The neighborhood became more affluent. From 1880, Yorkville became a destination for German-born immigrants. However, by the 1900s, many German residents moved to Yorkville and other neighborhoods from \\"Kleindeutschland\\" (Little Germany) on the Lower East Side after the General Slocum disaster on June 15, 1904. The ship caught fire in the East River just off the shores of Yorkville, leading family members to move closer to the site of the incident.King, Gilbert. \\"A Spectacle of Horror ‚Äì The Burning of the General Slocum; The deadliest disaster in New York before 9/11 killed many women and children and ultimately erased a German community from the map of Manhattan.\\", Smithsonian magazine, February 21, 2012. Accessed May 18, 2016. \\"The men of Little Germany were suddenly without families. Funerals were held for more than a week, and the desolate schoolyards of Kleindeutschland were painful reminders of their loss. Many widowers and broken families moved uptown to Yorkville to be closer to the scene of the disaster, establishing a new Germantown on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper East Side.\\" Most of the passengers on the ship were German. In addition, the general trend towards moving to the suburbs reduced the German population in Manhattan; by 1930, most German New Yorkers lived in Queens. On 86th Street, in the central portion of Yorkville, there were many German shops, restaurants and bakeries. Yorkville became the melting pot of populations arriving from various regions of the Prussian-dominated German Empire and its colonies, where many cultures spoke German. In the 1930s, the neighborhood was the home base of Fritz Julius Kuhn's German American Bund, the most notorious pro-Nazi group in 1930s United States, which led to spontaneous protests by other residents. Yorkville was a haven for refugees from fascist Germany in the 1940s, and from refugees from communist regimes in the 1950s and 1960s. The neighborhood is the site of the annual Steuben Parade, a large German-American celebration. The largest non-German group were the Irish.\\"The History of Yorkville\\" by Kathryn A. Jolowicz Irish mostly lived in an area bounded by 81st and 85th Streets, and Lexington and Fifth Avenues. They attended mass at such churches as St. Ignatius Loyola on 84th Street and Park Avenue, Our Lady of Good Counsel (90th Street) and the Church of St. Joseph (87th Street). There were many Irish bars including Finnegan's Wake, Dorrian's Red Hand Restaurant, Ireland's 32, Carrol's Hideaway, O'Brien's and Kinsale Tavern. Until the late 1990s, New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade ended at 86th Street and Third Avenue, the historical center of Yorkville.\\"A Guide To The NYC St. Patrick's Day Parade\\", CBS New York, March 15, 2013 In addition, Jews also lived on Second Avenue., p. 1428 79th Street was a hub for the Austro- Hungarian populace. Popular restaurants included the Viennese Lantern, Tokay, Hungarian Gardens, Robert Heller's Cafe Abazzia at 2nd Avenue, Budapest and the Debrechen. There were also a number of butcher stores and businesses that imported goods from Hungary. Churches included St. Stephen Catholic Church and the Hungarian Reformed Church on East 82nd Street. In addition, Czechs, Poles and Slovaks lived from 65th to 73rd Street. Besides Ruc, a Czech restaurant off Second Avenue, there were sokol halls on 67th and 71st Streets. There were other Czech and Slovak businesses, such as Czech butcher shops, poultry and grocery stores, and shops that sold imported goods such as Bohemian books, leather products and crystal. =Recent history= A sidewalk clock on 1501 Third Avenue Around the late 1920s, Yorkville's ethnic diversity was beginning to wane. In 1926, the New York Times wrote of Yorkville's changing ethnic makeup: In 1928, a one-block section of Sutton Place north of 59th Street, and all of Avenue A north of that point, was renamed York Avenue to honor U.S. Army Sergeant Alvin York, who received the Medal of Honor for attacking a German machine gun nest during World War I's Meuse-Argonne Offensive.Gray, Christopher. \\" Streetscapes/Sutton Place, Sutton Place South and One Sutton Place North; A Prestigious Enclave With a Name in Question\\", The New York Times, September 21, 2003.

The dismantling of the Third Avenue El in 1955 led to the demolition of many mansions. This led to the acceleration of the exodus of Yorkville residents. Over the years, this trend continued. Thus, in the 1980s, a building for members of the German gymnastic society Turners, at the intersection of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, was demolished. Cafe Mozart, on 86th Street between Second and Third Avenues, was also demolished. In their place were built high-rise residential complexes. By the turn of the 21st century, East 82nd Street was co-named St. Stephen of Hungary Way. The area from East 79th to 83rd Streets, spanning approximately four blocks east-west, is colloquially known as Little Hungary.\\"Little Hungary\\", Forgotten New York  Demographics  76th Street between Second and Third Avenues Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Yorkville was 77,942, an increase of 1,174 (1.5%) from the 76,768 counted in 2000.

From left to right: protective plastic coating, steel structure, inner sleeve to reduce friction, inner cable. Bowden cables controlling an automobile throttle. A Bowden cable ( )Bowden cable. Answers.com. McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, McGraw- Hill Companies, Inc., 2003. Accessed November 21, 2009. is a type of flexible cable used to transmit mechanical force or energy by the movement of an inner cable relative to a hollow outer cable housing. The housing is generally of composite construction, consisting of an inner lining, a longitudinally incompressible layer such as a helical winding or a sheaf of steel wire, and a protective outer covering. The linear movement of the inner cable is most often used to transmit a pulling force, although push/pull cables have gained popularity in recent years e.g. as gear shift cables. Many light aircraft use a push/pull Bowden cable for the throttle control, and here it is normal for the inner element to be a solid wire, rather than a multi-strand cable. Usually, provision is made for adjusting the cable tension using an inline hollow bolt (often called a \\"barrel adjuster\\"), which lengthens or shortens the cable housing relative to a fixed anchor point. Lengthening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster out) tightens the cable; shortening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster in) loosens the cable. History The origin and invention of the Bowden Cable is open to some dispute, confusion and myth. The invention of the Bowden cable has been popularly attributed to Sir Frank Bowden, founder and owner of the Raleigh Bicycle Company who, circa 1902, was reputed to have started replacing the rigid rods used for brakes with a flexible wound cable but no evidence for this exists. The Bowden mechanism was invented by Irishman Ernest Monnington Bowden (1860 to April 3, 1904) of 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. The first patent was granted in 1896 (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570), and the invention was reported in the Automotor Journal of 1897 where Bowden's address was given as 9 Fopstone Rd, Earls Court.\\"A Mechanical Transmission System\\", The Automotor and Horseless Carriage Journal, October 1897, pp27-28 The two Bowdens are not known to be closely related. The principal element of this was a flexible tube (made from hard wound wire and fixed at each end) containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope from one end to the other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes, although it had the potential for other uses. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press in 1896. It consisted of a stirrup, pulled up by the cable from a handlebar mounted lever, with rubber pads acting against the rear wheel rim. At this date bicycles were fixed wheel, additional braking being offered by a 'plunger' brake pressing on the front tyre. The Bowden offered extra braking power still, and was novel enough to appeal to riders who scorned the plunger arrangement, which was heavy and potentially damaging to the (expensive) pneumatic tyre. The problem for Bowden was his failure to develop effective distribution networks and the brake was often incorrectly, or inappropriately fitted, resulting in a good number of complaints being aired in the press. Its most effective application was on those machines fitted with Westwood pattern steel rims which offered flat bearing surfaces for the brake pads. A 1918 Lewis gun on a Foster mounting fitted to an Avro 504K Night Fighter. The gun trigger is operated by a Bowden cable The potential of the Bowden cable and associated brake was not to be fully realised until the free-wheel sprocket became a standard feature of bicycles, over the period 1899-1901, and increasing numbers of applications were found for it, such as gear change mechanisms. Importantly in 1903, Hendee developed the twist-grip throttle using a similar cable for his 'Indian' motorcycles. Its lightness and flexibility recommended it to further automotive use such as clutch and speedometer drive cables. It is reported that \\"on 12th January 1900 E. M. Bowden granted a licence to The Raleigh Cycle Company of Nottingham\\", whose directors were Frank Bowden and Edward Harlow. At this signing they became members of 'E. M. Bowden's Patent Syndicate Limited'. The syndicate included, among others, R. H. Lea & Graham I. Francis of Lea & Francis Ltd, and William Riley of the Riley Cycle Company. The Raleigh company were soon offering the Bowden Brake as an accessory, and were quick to incorporate the cable into handlebar mounted Sturmey-Archer (in which they had a major interest) gear changes. Undoubtedly this is why E. Bowden and F. Bowden are sometimes confused today. Early Bowden cable, from the 1890s and first years of the twentieth century, is characterised by the outer tube being wound from round wire and being uncovered. Each length is usually fitted with a brass collar marked 'BOWDEN PATENT', (this legend is also stamped into the original brake's components). More modern outer tube is wound from square section wire. From c1902 the cable was usually covered in a waterproof fabric sheath, in the early post war period this gave way to plastic. =Possible contribution by Larkin= An unpublished typescript exists in the archives of the National Motor Museum, written by the son of one of Bowden's employees that attempts to claim the invention of the cable for his father to the point of suggesting that it was never applied to bicycles before 1902. Although this is easily disproved by reference to 'Cycling' or the other UK cycle press through 1896‚Äì97, it serves to remind one of the attempts made to rewrite cycle history through priority claims. British National ArchivesNational Archives, National Motor Museum, George Larkin Collection In this narrative a flexible cable brake for cycles was separately 'invented' by George Frederick Larkin, a skilled automobile and motorcycle engineer, who patented his design in 1902.

Bowden cable with a barrel adjuster and locking nut in a BMX rear brake detangler. =Housing= The original, standard Bowden cable housing consists of a close-wound helix of round or square steel wire. This makes a flexible housing but causes the length to change as the housing flexes. Because on the inside of the bend the turns of a close-wound helix can't get any closer together, the bending causes the turns to separate on the outside of the bend, and so at the centerline of the housing, there must also be an increase of length with increasing bend. In order to support indexed shifting, Shimano developed a type of housing that does not change length as it is flexed. This housing has several wire strands running in a multiple helix, with a pitch short enough such that bends in the cable are shared by all strands, but long enough so that the housing's flexibility comes by bending the individual strands rather than by twisting them. A consequence of a long winding pitch in a support helix is that it approaches the case of parallel strands where the wires are bound only by the plastic jacket. Housings with a long helix cannot withstand the high compression that is associated with high cable tensions, and on overload tend to fail by the buckling of the housing strands. For this reason, helical support for brake cables is close wound, while housings with a longer helix are used for less critical applications. Longitudinally arranged support wires are used in applications such as bicycle gear-shifting. A third type of housing consists of short hollow rigid aluminum or carbon fiber cylinders slid over a flexible liner. Claimed benefits over steel wire housing include less weight, tighter curves, and less compression under load. =Inner wire= Inner wire ropes for push applications have an additional winding that runs in the opposite direction to the wind of the actual inner wire. The wind may be like that of a spring or a wind with a flat strip; these are called spring wrap and spiral wrap respectively. Some applications such as lawn mower throttles, automobile manual chokes, and some bicycle shifting systems require significant pushing ability and so use a cable with a solid inner wire. These cables are usually less flexible than ones with stranded inner wires. =Ends= One end of the inner cable may have a small shaped piece of metal, known (from the pear- shaped soldered terminations used in some cases) as a nipple (as can be seen in the BMX rear brake detangler picture) that fits into a shifter or brake lever mechanism. The other end is often clamped (as can be seen in the rear derailleur picture) to the part of the brake or shifter that needs to be moved, or as is most common with motorcycle control cables, fitted with another nipple. Traditionally, in bicycles, shifter cables are anchored on the shifter with a small cylindrical nipple, concentric with the cable. Bicycle brake nipples however, vary between mountain bikes (MTB), with straight handlebars, and road bikes, with drop-handlebars. MTB bikes use a barrel- shaped (cylindrical) nipple to anchor the brake cable at the brake lever, while road bikes have a pear-shaped nipple. Some replacement brake cables for bicycles come with both styles, one on each end. The unneeded end is cut off and discarded upon installation. In bicycle applications, for both brakes and gear-shifting, the outer dimension of the cap or ferrule that terminates a housing, is selected to make a loose fit within the barrel-adjuster's end. In this way the barrel will slip on the ferrule as it is turned during adjustments. If the ferrule were to be jammed into the barrel end, then the cable would twist during fruitless attempts at adjustment. Nipples are also available separately from the cable, for purposes of repair or custom cable construction. They are fitted to the cable by soldering. Where free rotation of nipples, relative to the cable axis is required, the cable end may be finished with a brass ferrule or \\"trumpet\\" soldered to the cable. The barrel nipple will be a sliding fit over the brass ferrule, and can thus rotate, to ensure alignment of the nipples at each end of the cable, and avoidance of twisting of the inner cable. Applying heat to the inner cable for soldering may weaken the steel, and although soft soldering is less strong than silver solder, a lower temperature is required to form the joint, and there is less likelihood of the inner cable being damaged as a result. Silver soldering may require additional heat treatment of the wire to preserve the temper of it in order to prevent it from becoming too soft or too brittle Nipples that clamp to the cable by means of a screw also are available for emergency repair purposes, or where removal is required for maintenance. A small ferrule, also called a crimp, (seen in the rear derailleur picture) may be crimped on to prevent cable ends from fraying. Other methods to prevent fraying include soft or silver soldering the wire ends, or ideally by flash cutting the wires. If the inner wire is solid, as in automotive and lawnmower throttle and choke applications, it may simply have a bend at one or both ends to engage what ever it pushes or pulls. =Donuts= Small rubber tori, called donuts, can be threaded onto a bare run of the inner cable to prevent it from striking the bicycle frame causing rattles or abrasion. =Common practice= The indexed shifting of a bicycle derailleur needs to be exact. A typical 7-speed shifter changes the cable length by either 2.9 mm (Shimano 2:1) or 4.5 mm (SRAM 1:1) for each shift, and any length errors accumulate with the number of shifts. To this end, the housing needs to behave as if it were a solid tube, so it, and its end-pieces have to be compressionless. Currently, the most commonly used compressionless housing for gear shifting has longitudinally spaced steel wires. The flat-cut ends of such housing are tight-terminated with end caps or ferrules, and the ends caps are sized to fit either into a fixture on the frame, or as a loose fitting in the end of a barrel adjuster. Housings for bicycle brakes need not be quite so compressionless, but need to be stronger, and items currently sold for this purpose use a close-wound spiral support wire. One end of a brake housing is tight-terminated in an end cap or ferrule that makes a loose fit within a barrel adjuster, and the other in any of a variety of fittings that includes end caps, or parts to effect a smooth change of direction. In any case, at the point where the cable emerges for attachment to the brake arms, is fitted a nipple. In view of the wide array of cable constructions on offer, confusion as to the best housing can easily result. In general, a housing sold for one purpose should not be used for any other, and in any case the advice of the manufacturer should be followed. In particular, longitudinally reinforced housings should not be used for bicycle brakes, since they are weaker than the spirally wound housings. Housings for bicycles are made in two main diameters; most often 4 mm diameter is used for gear- shifting and 5 mm for brakes. Both shifting and brake housings are manufactured in both sizes. However, some care is needed in changing cables, since, for example, the 4 mm barrel adjuster end of an existing shifter is probably made only for that housing size. Although the individual parts for cable assembly can be acquired, ready-made cables for both brakes and shifting are available. These usually consist of an inner wire within a length of housing, and depending on their purpose, with one or more end caps fitted. However, because of the wide range of fittings in use, it is probable that these universal cables' caps, although suiting many situations, will not suit every purpose, as their name wrongly implies. The shortening of housings requires the use of a special hand tool, designed to make a square cut without closing the cable entry. The same tool is used to cut the internal steel cable. To avoid unraveling of the cable's wires during installation, manufacturers weld or crimp the ends. Housings for cables have habitually been made only in black, though some colored housings can also be found. Maintenance Bowden cables can cease to function smoothly, particularly if water or contaminants get into the housing. (Modern lined and stainless steel cables are less prone to these problems; unlined housings should be lubricated with a light machine oil.) In cold climates Bowden cable mechanisms are prone to malfunction due to water freezing. Cables also wear through use over a long time, and can be damaged through kinking or raveling. A common failure occurs on bicycles at the point where the housing enters a barrel adjuster; loose housing ends tend to fray the housing, making adjustments uncertain. Fraying due to fatigue is most likely if the cable passes over a pulley, which on bicycles is often below the recommended diameter, or where the cable is bent repeatedly where it attaches to the brake lever or caliper. A cable passing around a sharp bend tend to furrow the inner cable sleeve, leading to contact with the outer housing and rub fraying. A frayed cable can suddenly break when force is applied strongly, e.g. during emergency braking. The specifications for cables and housings rarely give any details other than dimensions and the purpose of the products. The specific resistance to compression or bending is never quoted, so there is much rhetorical evidence and comment as to the performance and durability of products, but little available science for the consumer's use. A particularly severe quality test for housings is at or near the hinge of a folding bicycle where a sharp bend is made repeatedly. The radius of curvature of cables on a folded bicycle can be as low as 1.5 inches, (4 cm); therefore it is advisable to shift to the gear with the lowest cable pressure before folding, to minimize any adverse effects on housings or derailleurs. This gear is usually the one with the highest index number on the gear shifter. There is some controversy surrounding the existence of the phenomenon known as \\"cable stretch\\". Newly installed cables can seem to elongate, requiring readjustment. While it is generally agreed that inner wires actually stretch very little - if at all - housings and linings may compress slightly, and all parts may generally \\"settle in\\". Lightweight assemblies such as those used on bicycles are more susceptible to this phenomenon.

It was first published in Australia in 1995 and later published in the United States in 1997. The book revolves around Garner's attempts to interview the two young women at the centre of a sexual assault scandal but who declined to meet her. This sets off a narrative exploring the politics, sexual and otherwise, of the college as well as Garner's personal feelings about the original events and the people she meets in the course of her research. Aside from the events and the harassment itself, Garner explores themes of sexism, masculinity, feminism, gender wars, fraternalism in colleges, \\"Old Boys\\" and the establishment, and power balances in both educational settings and personal relationships. A national bestseller, the book was condemned by some Australian feminists for a variety of reasons. The journalist Virginia Trioli published Generation F: Sex, Power & the Young Feminist in 1996 and a collection of essays critical of The First Stone was published under the title bodyjamming (1997) by Jenna Mead, an Ormond College councillor who acted as an emissary for the two women complainants. Garner gave her first detailed response to the critics in a speech at The Sydney Institute entitled \\"The fate of The First Stone\\" (1995). Despite its controversy, it was critically acclaimed, has been discussed widely academically and sold over 100,000 copies. Background Ormond College, a residential campus of the University of Melbourne, was embroiled in controversy in 1992 after an incident of sexual harassment was disclosed to the press. It involved two students and an Ormond Master. Their names were protected in the book under pseudonyms-Olivia Mayer and Kirsten Campbell (Elizabeth Rosen and Nicole Stewart in The First Stone). Mayer and Campbell accused the college's master, Alan Gregory, (Colin Shepard in the book), of indecently groping them at an end of year party that followed a valedictory dinner. Shortly after the party, which was held in October 1991, Mayer and Campbell took their allegations to the police and the allegations progressed to the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. Gregory was found guilty at the Magistrate's Court, which was later overturned on appeal at the Victorian County Court. Gregory subsequently resigned from his position as Ormond Master in 1993. =Garner's involvement= The ivy-covered exterior of Ormond College. Garner had been a student at the University of Melbourne in the 1960s, was familiar with its environment and had read about the case in the Melbourne newspaper The Age. Immediately struck by what Garner perceived to be a \\"punitive\\" and \\"priggish\\" response to the incident by the complainants, and her own ties to feminism, she called her female friends to discuss their angles. Garner's friends' agreement with her own positioning-that by seeking punitive punishment and enforcement of the law to what she saw as a \\"hapless social blunder\\"-ignited the desire to delve deeper into the case and publish a book as a response to the incident. The trajectory of the book shows the development of Garner's stance: she initially, as the book begins, had intentions to interview the two women to gain more \\"complex sense\\" of the allegations, as well as to understand why the girls went to the police. Their initial reluctance to talk to Garner, which eventually turns into flat-out refusal after a sympathetic letter to The Master written by Garner is circulated throughout the university and in Melbourne publications, drives her stance to be less objective and cements her views of the women as the book progresses. By the book's conclusion, Garner had tried a number of times to contact the women, their legal representatives and intermediaries, and friends to no avail. She interviewed Alan Gregory, the accused, in his office. Later she visits the family home to speak to Gregory's wife, who discussed the damage the accusations had done to their family. Garner accessed transcripts, media publications, and had ties to women who knew the complainants, as well as employing her own experiences as \\"evidence\\" (a device that was of particular scrutiny from the books critics). She concludes the book by highlighting the difference between real sexual violence and assault towards women, compared to what she perceived as a mostly trivial, boorish incident at Ormond. Furthermore, she discusses feminism in general, the power balances between the accused and the women, who she refers to as \\"powerful anima figures\\", but speculated that they were also unaware, or unwilling, to exert their power to the Master on the night of the event, in favour of seeking a more law-based approach later on. Release The First Stone was first published in Australia on 1 April 1995 by Picador, followed by the United States on 14 August 1997 by Bloomsbury Publishing. A 25th anniversary edition with a foreword by Leigh Sales was released in Australia by Picador on 28 January 2020. It also contains an afterword by Bernadette Brennan, as well as a reprint of David Leser's original 1995 Good Weekend interview with Garner, and her own 1995 address \\"The Fate of The First Stone\\". =Reception and controversy= The First Stone was controversial for a number of reasons. As the students involved refused to be interviewed by Helen Garner, the point of view of the accused master of the college was instead used in isolation and the narrator was therefore criticised as being biased towards his point of view. Elements of the story became fictionalised-for example, the tutor who advised the students was split into nine separate characters giving the appearance of a \\"feminist conspiracy\\" at work. She also failed to mention that Gregory is alleged to have assaulted 5 women, three of whom dropped their complaints. Additionally, the book was also criticised for its view that feminism had become weakened and claim that the appropriate response to being groped was \\"a slap in the face\\" rather than a police complaint. Writing for The New Yorker, writer Janet Malcolm gave a mixed review of The First Stone. She called the book's narrative \\"remarkable\\", but also \\"vertiginously turbulent\\", and went onto criticise the approach Garner took towards the young women. In her review, Malcolm references a quote from the book, in which Garner fantasises about a \\"less destructive response\\" to the incident in which she confronts the Master, and tells him \\"this time I'm prepared to let it pass\\". Malcolm wrote that \\"this is not good enough. This is closing ranks with the abuser. Sexual harassment isn't sexual abuse-exactly. It lies on the border between a crime and a mistake. [But] it is a minor offence with major associations\\". In The New York Times, Tamar Lewin wrote: \\"The feminist debate over the politics of victimization has raged in this country [the US] for years; Ms. Garner's book brings Australian feminists squarely into the fray\\", though she lamented on Garner's personal investigation adding very little to the facts of the incident. James Wood, also writing for The New Yorker, wrote in a 2016 article that The First Stone \\"still seems a brilliantly prescient book ‚Äì in its complexity, in the tense torque of its self-argument, and in its very vulnerability and stunned intolerance\\".

The term originated in North America but has now become the accepted term in the English-speaking world for all practitioners of podiatric medicine. In the United States, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) are doctors who practice on the lower extremities, primarily on feet and ankles. The preparatory education of most podiatric physicians are identical that of the M.D and D.O pathways which includes four years of undergraduate work, followed by four years in an accredited podiatric medical school, followed by a three- or four-year hospital-based surgical residency. Optional one- to two-year fellowship in foot & ankle reconstruction, surgical limb salvage, sports medicine, plastic surgery, pediatric foot & ankle surgery, and wound care is also available https://www.acfas.org/Fellowship-Center/Recognized-Fellowship-Intiative/List- of-Available-Fellowships/. Podiatrists are licensed in all fifty states, although each state has its own licensing requirements. The scope of practice may vary from state to state and residency training. In many countries, the term podiatrist refers to allied health professionals who specialize in the treatment of the lower extremity, particularly the foot. Podiatrists in these countries are specialists in the diagnosis and nonsurgical treatment of foot pathology. In some circumstances, these practitioners will further specialise and, following further training, perform reconstructive foot and ankle surgery. In contrast, Most American podiatrists who hold a doctor of podiatric medicine (DPM) degree complete surgical residencies; thus, many practitioners are trained in surgical treatments of the foot and ankle. Though the title chiropodist was previously used in the United States to designate what is now known as a podiatrist, it is now considered to be an antiquated and etymologically incorrect term. The median annual podiatry salary in the USA is approximately $135,000 as of August 2018, with a wide range depending on years in practice. New podiatrists usually earn significantly less. First-year salaries ranging from $75,000 to $150,000 with performance and productivity incentives are common. Private practice revenues for solo podiatrists vary widely, with the majority of solo practices grossing between $200,000 and $600,000 before overhead. Podiatric specialties Podiatrists treat a wide variety of foot and lower extremity conditions through nonsurgical and surgical approaches. The American Board of Podiatric Medicine (ABPM) offers a comprehensive board qualification and certification process in podiatric medicine and orthopedics. Subspecialties of podiatry include: * Reconstructive surgeryThe Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons * General podiatry * Podiatric medicine * Podiatric orthopedics * Podiatric sports medicine * High- risk wound care * Podiatric rheumatologyAUSTRALASIAN PODIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY SPECIALIST INTEREST GROUP * Neuropodiatry * Oncopodiatry (podiatric oncology) * Podiatric vascular medicine * Podiatric dermatology * Podoradiology * Podiatric gerontology * Podiatric diabetology (limb salvage and wound care) * PodopediatricsHealth & Social Care (Podopaediatrics) PT * Forensic podiatry Podiatry assistant In Australia, podiatry assistant Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance qualification.Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance - HLT42507 The podiatry assistant work as a part of a podiatric medical team in both clinical and nonclinical settings. Common professional accreditation pathways to becoming a podiatric assistant include: * Podiatric nurse * Foot carer/nurse * Podiatry support worker * Podiatry technician * Podiatry hygienist * Foot health professional * Podiatric surgical nurse * Foot hygienist * Foot health practitioner * Podiatric medical assistant Podiatric surgery Podiatric surgery is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the foot and ankle: * Structural deformities, including bunions, hammertoes, flat feet, high arches, and bone spurs * Heel pain * Nerve entrapment * Joint degeneration and arthrosis * Skin and nail conditions * Congenital deformities * Trauma, including fractures and dislocations * ankle fractures * total ankle replacements * total or hemi joint replacements Responsibilities Podiatrists' roles include dealing with the conditions resulting from bone and joint disorders such as arthritis and soft-tissue and muscular pathologies as well as neurological and circulatory diseases. Podiatrists are also able to diagnose and treat any complications of the above which affect the lower limb, including skin and nail disorders, corns, calluses and ingrown toenails. Foot injuries and infections gained through sport or other activities are also diagnosed and treated by podiatrists.About Podiatrists. Retrieved on 2012-07-06. Education and training =Australia= Australian podiatrists complete an undergraduate degree of Bachelor of Podiatry or Podiatric Medicine ranging from 3 to 4 years of education. The first 2 years of this program are generally focused on various biomedical science subjects including anatomy, medical chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, pathophysiology, sociology and patient psychology, similar to the medical curriculum. The following two years will then be spent focusing on podiatry specific areas such as podiatric biomechanics and human gait, podiatric orthopaedics or the non-surgical management of foot abnormalities, pharmacology & prescribing, general medicine, general pathology, local and general anaesthesia, and surgical procedural techniques such as partial and total nail avulsions, matricectomy, cryotherapy, wound debridement and care, enucleation, and other cutaneous and electro-surgical procedures such as electro-desiccation, fulagaration and electrosection. Postgraduate courses in podiatric therapeutics and prescribing are required for having endorsements in scheduled medicines. All podiatrists are required to register with AHPRA prior to be licensed to practice in Australia. Registration is required annually. There is a minimum of continuing professional development (CPD) hours a podiatrist must undertake to maintain said registration. Podiatric surgeons are specialist podiatrists who have completed extensive, post graduate medical and surgical training and perform reconstructive surgery of the foot and ankle. The qualifications of podiatric surgeons are recognised by Australian State and Federal Governments. It is an approved specialty by the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency. Podiatric surgeons are included within both the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act.

Eligibility for Fellowship of the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons Podiatric surgical qualifications are a post-graduate speciality of the podiatric profession. Before attaining a podiatric surgical fellowship qualification, a podiatrist must complete an extensive training program, including: 1\\\\. Bachelor of Applied Science degree, majoring in Podiatry (4 years) 2\\\\. Minimum of 2 years post-graduate clinical practice 3\\\\. Master of Podiatry (2 years full-time university degree) 4\\\\. A 3-stage surgical fellowship training under supervision of the ACPS (4 to 6 years) 5\\\\. International residency training (usually in the UK and USA) 6\\\\. Demonstrated mastery of knowledge in foot and ankle surgery by passing oral and written examinations administered by the ACPS =New Zealand= Only one university, Auckland University of Technology (AUT), offers training to become a podiatrist. Podiatrists must have a Bachelor of Health Science majoring in podiatry from AUT, or an overseas qualification recognised by the Podiatrists Board of New Zealand, be registered with the Podiatrists Board of New Zealand and have a current Annual Practising Certificate. =Canada= In Canada, the definition and scope of the practice of podiatry varies provincially. For instance, in some provinces like British Columbia and Alberta, the standards are the same as in the United States where the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) is the accepted qualification. Quebec, too, has recently changed to the DPM level of training, although other academic designations may also register. Also in Quebec, in 2004, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res started the first program of Podiatric Medicine in Canada based on the American definition of podiatry. In the prairie and Atlantic provinces, the standard was originally based on the British model now called podiatry (chiropody). That model of podiatry is currently the accepted model for most of the world including the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa. The province of Ontario has been registering Chiropodists since July 1993 (when the Ontario Government imposed a cap on new podiatrists). If a registered podiatrist from outside of Ontario relocates to Ontario they are required to register with the province and practice as a chiropodist. Podiatrists who were practicing in Ontario previous to the imposed provincial cap were 'grandfathered' and allowed to keep the title of podiatrist as a subclass of chiropody. The scope of these 'grandfathered' (mostly American trained) podiatrists includes boney procedures of the forefoot and the ordering of x-rays in addition to the scope of the chiropodist. In Ontario, podiatrists are required to have a \\"Doctor of Podiatric Medicine/DPM\\" degree (a post-baccalaureate, four-year degree), where the majority of chiropodists currently practicing hold a post-secondary diploma in chiropody, although many also have some university level schooling or a baccalaureate degree in the sciences or in another field. Podiatrists may bill OHIP for their services; chiropodists may not. Podiatrists may \\"communicate a diagnosis\\" to their patients (or to their patients' representatives) and perform surgical procedures on the bones of the forefoot; chiropodists may do neither.http://www.opma.ca/podiatryandchiropody Chiropodists and podiatrists are regulated by the College of Chiropodists of Ontario, which had 594 chiropodists and 65 podiatrists registered as of 29 July 2015.http://www.cocoo.on.ca/index.html The only English-speaking Chiropody program in Canada, in which also has a working Chiropody Clinic on campus for students to treat patients under the supervision of licensed Chiropodists is The Michener Institute. According to The Michener Institute website, Chiropody is a branch of medical science that involves the assessment and management of foot and lower limb disorders. This includes the management of a wide variety of disorders, injuries, foot deformities, infections and local manifestations of systemic conditions. A Chiropodist is a primary care professional practicing in podiatric medicine in Ontario that specializes in assessment, management and prevention of diseases and disorders of the foot. An essential member of the inter professional healthcare team, the Chiropodist is skilled in assessing the needs of their patients and of managing both chronic and acute conditions affecting foot and lower limb function. As a primary care provider capable of independent clinical practice, these skills are often practiced independent of medical referral and medical supervision. =United Kingdom= In the UK, podiatrists usually undertake a 3-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science (Podiatry). Podiatric Surgeons have undertaken fellowships and postgraduate training. The scope of practice of a podiatrist falls into four key categories: General clinics, Biomechanics, High risk patient management and Surgery. There are two levels of surgical practice. As part of general podiatric care, podiatrists as HPC (Health Professions Council) registered practitioners are involved with nail and minor soft tissue surgical procedures and qualified to administer local anaesthetics. From 1 August 2012, the HPC is being rebranded to the HCPC (Health & Care Professions Council) as they are expanding their remit to include Social Workers. The old term of \\"State Registered\\" has been defunct for some time and is no longer used since the creation of the HPC. Some podiatrists go on to develop and train as podiatric surgeons, who surgically manage bone and joint disorders within the foot. It is to this latter group (Podiatric Surgeons) that the guidelines apply. Fellowship requires a minimum of six years postgraduate training. This includes a two or three year surgical residency with an approved centre. Podiatric surgeons acquire comprehensive knowledge of related subjects including pharmacology, regional anaesthetic techniques and radiographic interpretation, as well as in-depth knowledge of foot surgery. The surgical faculty of the College of Podiatrists has set the standards for fellowship. In 2019 a 23% drop in podiatry students in the UK was reported. The Conference of Postgraduate Medical Deans called for full payment of their tuition fees and the introduction of a maintenance grant for healthcare students. =United States= In the United States, medical and surgical care of the foot and ankle is mainly provided by two groups of professionals: podiatrists (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine or DPM) and orthopedists (MDs or DOs). The first two years of podiatric medical school is similar to training that either Doctors of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) receive, but with an emphasized scope on foot, ankle, and lower extremity. To enter a college of podiatric medicine, the student must first complete at least three years or 90 semester hours of college credit at an accredited institution. Biology, Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physics (all science courses require a lab) and English are among the required classes. Over 95% of the students who enter a college of podiatric medicine have a bachelor's degree. Many have also completed some graduate study. Before entering a college of podiatric medicine, the student must take the MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test).Training of a Podiatrist. wvpma.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-27. There are nine colleges of podiatric medicine in the United States.on 2012-06-27. They all receive accreditation from the Council on Podiatric Medical Education, which is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council on Higher Education Accreditation. All of the colleges grant the degree of Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM).PODIATRIC MEDICINE AS A CAREER. mpma.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-27. The four-year podiatric medical school is followed by a surgical based residency, which is hands-on post-doctoral training. Their residency model was standardized to 3-years of post-graduate training in 2011, and the residency is now known as the Podiatric Medicine and Surgery Residency (PMSR). Podiatric residents rotate through core areas of medicine and surgery. They work alongside their MD and DO counterparts in such rotations as emergency medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, behavioral medicine, physical medicine & rehabilitation, vascular surgery, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, dermatology and of course podiatric surgery and medicine. Fellowship training is available after residency in such fields such as foot & ankle traumatology or limb salvage. Upon completion of their residency, podiatrists can decide to become board certified by a number of specialty boards including the American Board of Podiatric Medicine (ABPM) and/or the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery (ABFAS), which are both approved by the profession's credentialing arm, the CPME, and both have been certifying podiatrists since the 1970s. Though the ABPM and ABFAS are more common, other boards not recognized by CPME are challenging the status quo confer board qualified/certified status. The American Board of Podiatric Medical Specialties (ABPMS) is one additional option and has been certifying podiatrists since 1998. The DPM superseded the historical DSC (Doctor of Surgical Chiropody) degree in the 1960s.  References  Podiatry ","title":"Podiatrist"},{"id":"295487","text":"Lagger is a surname.

Sound quality is typically an assessment of the accuracy, fidelity, or intelligibility of audio output from an electronic device. Quality can be measured objectively, such as when tools are used to gauge the accuracy with which the device reproduces an original sound; or it can be measured subjectively, such as when human listeners respond to the sound or gauge its perceived similarity to another sound. The sound quality of a reproduction or recording depends on a number of factors, including the equipment used to make it, processing and mastering done to the recording, the equipment used to reproduce it, as well as the listening environment used to reproduce it. In some cases, processing such as equalization, dynamic range compression or stereo processing may be applied to a recording to create audio that is significantly different from the original but may be perceived as more agreeable to a listener. In other cases, the goal may be to reproduce audio as closely as possible to the original. When applied to specific electronic devices, such as loudspeakers, microphones, amplifiers or headphones sound quality usually refers to accuracy, with higher quality devices providing higher accuracy reproduction. When applied to processing steps such as mastering recordings, absolute accuracy may be secondary to artistic or aesthetic concerns. In still other situations, such as recording a live musical performance, audio quality may refer to proper placement of microphones around a room to optimally use room acoustics. Digital Audio Digital audio is stored in many formats. The simplest form is uncompressed PCM, where audio is stored as a series of quantized audio samples spaced at regular intervals in time. As samples are placed closer together in time, higher frequencies can be reproduced. According to the sampling theorem, any bandwidth-limited signal (that does not contain a pure sinusoidal component), bandwidth B, can be perfectly described by more than 2B samples per second, allowing perfect reconstruction of the bandwidth-limited analog signal. For example, for human hearing bandwidth between 0 and 20 kHz, audio must be sampled at above 40 kHz. Due to the need for filtering out ultrasonic frequencies resulting from the conversion to an analog signal, in practice slightly higher sample rates are used: 44.1 kHz (CD audio) or 48 kHz (DVD). In PCM, each audio sample describes the sound pressure at an instant in time with a limited precision. The limited accuracy results in quantization error, a form of noise that is added to the recording. To reduce quantization error, more precision can be used in each measurement at the expense of larger samples (see audio bit depth). With each additional bit added to a sample, quantization error is reduced by approximately 6 dB. For example, CD audio uses 16 bits per sample, and therefore will have quantization noise approximately 96 dB below the maximum possible sound pressure level (when summed over the full bandwidth) The amount of space required to store PCM depends on the number of bits per sample, the number of samples per second, and the number of channels. For CD audio, this is 44,100 samples per second, 16 bits per sample, and 2 channels for stereo audio leading to 1,411,200 bits per second. However, this space can be greatly reduced using audio compression. In audio compression, audio samples are processed using an audio codec. In a lossless codec audio samples are processed without discarding information by packing repetitive or redundant samples into a more efficiently stored form. A lossless decoder then reproduces the original PCM with no change in quality. Lossless audio compression typically achieves a 30-50% reduction in file size. Common lossless audio codecs include FLAC, ALAC, Monkey's Audio and others. If additional compression is required, lossy audio compression such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC can be used. In these techniques, lossless compression techniques are enhanced by processing audio to reduce the precision of details that are unlikely or impossible for human hearing to perceive using principles from psychoacoustics. After the removal of these details, lossy compression can be applied to the remainder to greatly reduce the file size. Lossy audio compression therefore allows a 75-95% reduction in file size, but runs the risk of potentially reducing audio quality if important information is mistakenly discarded.

He served as vice-president and acting President of the Republic of China under the 1947 Constitution. Biography =Early life= Former residence of Li Zongren in Nanjing. Li Zongren was born in Xixiang Village (Ë•øÈÑâÊùë), near Guilin in Guangxi Province, the second eldest in a Han family of five boys and three girls. His father, Li Peiying (ÊùéÂüπËã±), was a village schoolmaster. After a patchy education Li enrolled in a provincial military school. He joined the Tongmenghui, the revolutionary party of Sun Yat-sen, in 1910 but had little understanding at that time of Sun's wider goals of reform and national reunification.Bonavia 119-120 Li's native province of Guangxi was also the home province of Taiping Gen. Li Xiucheng, to whom Li's family claimed to be related. =Early military service= Schooled under Cai E, Li graduated from the Guilin Military Cadre Training School and in 1916 became a platoon commander in the army of Guangxi warlord Lu Rongting. Li's direct superior was Lin Hu. Lu, the governor of Guangxi, was a former bandit who had ambitions to expand into neighboring provinces, especially Guangdong. For the next few years the warlords of Guangxi and Guangdong were involved in mutually destructive battles, and both occupied portions of each other's territory at various times.Bonavia 119 Lu and his closest associates were collectively known as the Old Guangxi Clique. During a battle with a rival warlord in Hunan in 1918, Li's bravery earned him a promotion to battalion commander. In 1921 Li Zongren accompanied Lin Hu and Lu Rongting in Lu's second invasion of Guangdong, attacking forces under the command of Chen Jiongming. When Lu's invasion suffered a disastrous defeat, Li led the rear guard when the Old Guangxi Clique forces retreated. Most of Lin Hu's officers were former bandits and militia recruited earlier by Lin from the Zhuang areas of Guangdong. During the campaign many of Lin's officers defected to the Guangdong forces, taking their units with them. In the face of defeat Li Zongren's battalion shrunk to about 1000 men and \\"sank into the grasses\\" in order to escape. =Rise to power= After Lu's defeat most of his army dissolved into independent bands of soldiers, many of whom resorted to banditry in order to survive. Foreign missionaries and aid workers active in Guangxi at this time reported that banditry in Guangxi was extremely common and severe, with bandits commonly looting all food and valuables from undefended villages and resorting to murder and public cannibalism in order to extort ransoms from the relatives of people they kidnapped. Li, intending to become more than a bandit, began building a personal military force of professional soldiers that became the equal of any group of bandits or Zhuang irregulars that Lu Rongting drew on in his war to re-establish his power in Guangxi. Li joined Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang after Sun established a base in Guangdong. As chaos became the norm in Guangxi, Li became the independent commander of an area several counties large on the Guangdong border, and was joined by his old friend and colleague Huang Shaoxiong. The administration of Li and Huang was credited with keeping the area they controlled relatively free of the bandits and petty battles that plagued Guangxi at the time. In 1924, while Lu was besieged by rebels in Guilin, Li and his colleagues peacefully occupied the provincial capital, Nanning. Lu then fled and took refuge in French Indochina. The next month Sun Yat-sen, from his base of operations in Guangdong, recognized Li Zongren and his allies Huang Shaoxing and Bai Chongxi as the rulers of Guangxi. Together they became known as the New Guangxi Clique.Bonavia 120 =Kuomintang general= Li reorganized his forces as the \\"Guangxi Pacification Army\\". He was named the Commander in Chief, Huang Shaohong the deputy Commander and Bai Chongxi the Chief of Staff. By August they had driven all other contenders out of the province. Li Zongren was military governor of Guangxi from 1924‚Äì25 and from 1925-49 Guangxi remained under his influence. In 1926 Li allowed his soldiers to enroll in Kuomintang armies, but kept personal control of his troops. A Soviet adviser was sent to Guangxi, and Li's forces were renamed the Seventh Army Corps. Li went on to be a commanding general in the Northern Expedition, during which he was appointed commander of the 4th Army Group, composed of the Guangxi Army and other provincial forces amounting to 16 corps and six independent divisions. Li's first victories as a Nationalist general were in Hunan, where he defeated rival warlord Wu Peifu in two successive battles and captured the provincial capital, Wuhan, in 1926. After these victories Li became a famous and popular general within the KMT, and his army became variously known as the \\"Flying Army\\" and the \\"Army of Steel\\". When Wang Jingwei installed a left- leaning KMT faction in Wuhan, Borodin attempted to recruit Li to join the Communists, but Li was loyal to Chiang Kai-shek and refused.Bonavia 121 Against the advice of his Soviet advisors, Li then marched up the north side of the Yangze to attack the forces of warlord Sun Chuanfang. Sun was the leader of the \\"League of Five Provinces\\" (Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui and Jiangxi), and successfully halted Chiang's advance into his territory in Jiangxi. Li went on to defeat Sun in three successive battles, securing his territories for the KMT. By the time Li Zongren defeated Sun Chanfang, he had gained a reputation as being strongly opposed to communism and highly suspicious of the Comintern in China, and his army was one of the few KMT detachments free from serious Communist influence. After being assured of his support, Chiang had Li's units redeployed to the new capital of Nanjing. He then used Li's Guangxi armies to purge his own First Division of Communists. In the resulting White Terror, thousands of suspected Communists were summarily executed. Li's close subordinate, Bai Chongxi, was notable for his important role in this purge.Bonavia 121-122 In April 1928 Li, with Bai Chongxi, led the Fourth Army group in an advance on Beijing, capturing Handan, Baoding and Shijiazhuang by June 1. Zhang Zuolin withdrew from Beijing on June 3, and Li's army seized the city and Tianjin. After the fall of Wang Jingwei's government in Wuhan and the expulsion of all Soviet advisors from KMT-held territories, Li was put in charge of one of five KMT political councils set up to administer KMT-controlled territories, based in Wuhan. In January 1929 he dismissed Nanjing's appointee to the Hunan provincial committee and, fearing retribution, uncharacteristically fled to the foreign concessions in Shanghai. Chiang then arranged for Li and his two closest subordinates to be stripped of their posts within the government and expelled from the Party for life.Bonavia 124 =Return to Guangxi= After his falling out with Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren returned to Guangxi and devoted himself to that province's internal administration, with some success. In 1929 he supported Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan in his attempt to form an alternative central government based in Beijing, leading to the Central Plains War.Gillin The Journal of Asian Studies 293 Li led troops to reconquer Hunan as far north as Yueyang, before Chiang's decisive defeat of Yan and his ally, Feng Yuxiang, forced Li to withdraw back to Guangxi. Following Yan's defeat in the Central Plains War, Li allied with Chen Jitang after Chen became the chairman of the government of Guangdong in 1931, and prepared to battle Chiang Kai-shek. Another civil war would have broken out if Japan had not invaded Manchuria, prompting Li and Chiang to end their hostilities and unite against the Empire of Japan. =Second Sino- Japanese War= Li Zongren posing after the successful defense of Tai'erzhuang. In 1937 full-scale war between Japan and China broke out, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì45). Chiang Kai-shek attempted to make use of Li's military experience by promoting him to be the director of the KMT Fifth War Zone.Bonavia 125 Li's first action against the Japanese came in the 1938 Battle of Taierzhuang, after the Communist Zhou Enlai (who was aiding the Nationalists as part of the United Front) recognized Li as the most capable Nationalist general available and used his influence to have Li appointed overall commander, despite Chiang's reservations about Li's loyalty.Barnouin and Yu 71 Under Li's command the defense of Tai'erzhuang was a major victory for the Chinese, killing 20,000‚Äì30,000 Japanese soldiers and capturing a large amount of supplies and equipment. The victory was principally credited to Li's planning and use of tactics, luring the Japanese into a trap and then annihilating them. The battle of Taierzhuang was one of the first major Chinese victories in the war against Japan, proving that with good weapons and inspired leadership Chinese armies could hold their own.Spence 424 Li also participated in the Battle of Xuzhou, Battle of Wuhan, Battle of Suixian-Zaoyang, 1939‚Äì40 Winter Offensive, Battle of Zaoyang- Yichang, Central Hopei Operation, and Battle of South Henan. From 1943-45 Li was made Director of the Generalissimo's Headquarters. This was a virtual and unwanted retirement from active command after his earlier successes. Li spent the last years of the war grumbling about his enforced inactivity.Bonavia 126 =Chinese Civil War= Li Zongren and Chiang Kai-shek. After the war Li was given the post of Director of the Peiping Field Headquarters from 1945-47. This was a post without effective power, and he was sidelined from command in the early part of the Chinese Civil War. On 28 April 1948 Li was elected by the National Assembly as the vice-president, five days after his political opponent Chiang Kai-shek became the president (Chiang had opposed Li's appointment, supporting Sun Fo's candidacy instead). Chiang resigned the next year, on 21 January 1949, as a response to several serious Chinese Communist victories in northern China, and Li became the acting president the next day. After the resignation of Chiang from the presidency, Mao Zedong momentarily halted attacks against Kuomintang territories, attempting to negotiate a KMT surrender. Mao's Eight Points, the conditions that he demanded for an end to the civil war, were: # Punish all war criminals (Chiang Kai-shek was considered \\"number one\\")Barnouin and Yu 171 # Abolish the invalid 1947 constitution; # Abolish the KMT legal system; # Reorganize the Nationalist armies; # Confiscate all bureaucratic capital; # Reform the land-tenure system; # Abolish all treasonous treaties; and, # Convene a full Political Consultative Conference to form a democratic coalition government. Recognizing that agreeing to these points would effectively surrender control of China to the CCP, Li attempted to negotiate milder conditions that might have led to an end to the civil war, but in vain. In April 1949, when the Communists recognized that Li was unlikely to accept their conditions, they offered Li an ultimatum to accept within five days. When he refused, the Communists resumed their campaign.Spence 486 Li's attempts to negotiate with the Communists were interpreted by some in the KMT as \\"pacifist attacks\\", and increased tensions between Li and Chiang (whose relationship was already strained). Li attempted to negotiate with the Communists a settlement based on the implementation of Li's Seven Great Peace Policies. The policies that Li wanted to carry out were: # \\"Bandit pacification commands\\" (ÂâøÁ∏Ω) to be controlled by military officers # Overly strict orders are to be more lenient # Eliminate anti- communist special commando units (Êà°‰∫ÇÂª∫ÂúãÁ∏ΩÈöä) # Release political prisoners # Allow press freedom # Eliminate unusual cruelty in punishment # Eliminate arrest of civilians without proper reasons Li's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang's supporters, and were generally unsuccessful. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of (and moving to Taiwan) US$200 million of gold and US dollars belonging to the central government that Li desperately needed to cover the government's soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to Guangdong, instead expressing his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.Gillin Warlord 289 Former warlord Yan Xishan, who had fled to Nanking only one month before, quickly inserted himself into the Li-Chiang rivalry, attempting to have Li and Chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the Communists. At Chiang's request Yan visited Li in order to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangdong. Li agreed to return under the condition that Chiang surrender most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and that Chiang stop overriding Li's authority. After Yan communicated these demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong. In Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both Chiang supporters and those opposed to Chiang. Li's first choice of premier was Chu Cheng, a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to Chiang. After the Legislative Yuan rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By this time Yan was well known for his adaptability, and Chiang welcomed his appointment. Conflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li's return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless.Gillin Warlord 290 Although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang rather than Li. The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated as early as 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of this strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side. Chiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a \\"stooge\\" of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Guangxi and Guangdong, with the result that Communist forces occupied Guangdong in October 1949.Gillin Warlord 291 =Exile= After Guangdong fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to Chongqing, while Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to New York City for treatment of his chronic duodenum illness at the Hospital of Columbia University. Li visited the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman, and denounced Chiang as a \\"dictator\\" and an \\"usurper.\\" Li vowed that he would \\"return to crush\\" Chiang's movements once he returned to China.TIME Magazine The Kuomintang defenses continued to fall apart. General Hu Zongnan ignored Li's orders, and the Muslim General Ma Hongkui was furious at this. Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Li to submit his resignation from all positions he held, then Ma Hongkui fled to Taiwan, and his cousin Ma Hongbin took charge of his positions.Li, Li, and Tong 547 In December 1949, Chongqing fell too, and Chiang relocated his government to Taipei, but he did not formally re-assume the presidency until March 1, 1950. On January 1952, Chiang commanded the Control Yuan, now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the \\"Case of Li Zongren's Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct\\" (ÊùéÂÆó‰ªÅÈÅïÊ≥ïÂ§±ËÅ∑Ê°à), and officially relieved Li of the position as vice-president in the National Assembly on 10 March 1954.‰∏≠Â§ÆÈÅ∏ËàâÂßîÂì°ÊúÉÔºö„Ää‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÈÅ∏ËàâÂè≤„ÄãÔºåÂè∞ÂåóÔºö‰∏≠Â§ÆÈÅ∏ËàâÂßîÂì°ÊúÉÂç∞Ë°åÔºå1987Âπ¥ =Return to mainland China= national day celebration Li remained in exile until July 20, 1965, when he caused a sensation by returning to Communist-held China with the support of Zhou Enlai. Li's return to China was used as propaganda by the Chinese government to encourage other KMT members to return to China, regardless of their politics. Li died of duodenal cancer in Beijing at 78, in the darkest period of the Cultural Revolution. Li's residence in mainland China is viewed by some Chinese Communists as Li's \\"patriotic return to the embrace of his Motherland with smiles\\", something similar to the former Qing Emperor Puyi's \\"reformation\\". Personal life During the course of his career Li gained a reputation as an ardent militarist and confirmed anti-intellectual, but with a rugged sense of integrity. He was known for disliking music. Like many Chinese leaders in the 1930s, Li was once an admirer of European Fascism, seeing it as a solution to the problems of a once proud nation humbled by internal dissension and external weakness. His ethical attitudes were self-consciously drawn from Confucianism. After his falling out with Chiang Kai-shek in 1929, Li often expressed himself in terms of frustrated patriotism. Li was an admirer of the British historian Edward Gibbon and his monumental historical work, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Li and his close staff member, the Muslim General Bai Chongxi, were powerful partners in politics and military affairs. They were once given the nickname Li Bai (ÊùéÁôΩ), after the famous poet. Li was married to Li Xiuwen (ÊùéÁßÄÊñá) at 20 in an arranged marriage, but they separated soon afterwards. Li Zongren and Li Xiuwen had a son, Li Youlin (ÊùéÂπºÈÑ∞). In 1924, Li married Guo Dejie (ÈÉ≠Âæ∑ÊΩî), who died of breast cancer soon after returning with Li to Beijing. Li and Guo had one son: Li Zhisheng (ÊùéÂøóËÅñ). Li then remarried, to Hu Yousong (ËÉ°ÂèãÊùæ), who was 48 years younger than Li, and the daughter of actress Hu Die. Hu changed her name to Wang Xi (ÁéãÊõ¶) after Li died, and remarried. Li Zongren's nephew Alan Lee (ÊùéÂÄ´) runs a Kung Fu school in New York City since 1967. A set of Samurai swords and dagger of the Edo period given to Li Zongren as a \\"gift of truce between enemies who are now friends\\" by either Seishir≈ç Itagaki or Rensuke Isogai were passed on to Alan Lee as part of the family legacy. Li co-wrote Memoirs of Li Zongren with historian Tong Tekong. Li's memoir is notable for its vehement criticism of Chiang Kai-shek and its analysis of Japan's strategic failure to conquer China. A more detailed account of Li's life is depicted in the less popular biography My Trusted Aide (Wode Gugong), written by Li's distant relative Namgo Chai.

Originally developed on the Commodore 64 and published in June 1985 by Melbourne House, ports were made for Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Commodore 16. Gameplay The player takes part in a series of one-on-one karate matches, all overseen by a wise old expert who appears in the background. Once the player defeats an opponent they move up to the next stage and a more difficult adversary. Fights are not won using the energy-bar style found in modern fighting games; instead, the player needed to get two complete yin-yangs. Any move that connected with the opponent would end the round; a loosely timed or borderline kick or punch would obtain half a yin-yang icon, while a well- executed move would obtain a full icon. Two complete icons ended the bout and progressed to the next level. This system of scoring, known as shobu nihon kumite, is used in real life in many traditional styles of karate. A half yin- yang represents a waza-ari (a committed but not decisive technique) and a full yin-yang represents an ippon score (full point, decisive finishing blow). The game control is via joystick or direction keys and a \\"fire\\" key. 18 different movements can be made, including jumping kick, roundhouse kick and a variety of punches and kicks, high and low. The game features a variety of backgrounds against which the fighting takes place. After completing a number of progressively harder stages, the player is charged at by a bull in a bonus round. The player must knock the bull out with a single hit. The bonus round mirrors the feats of Mas Oyama, a karate expert who purportedly killed bulls with a single strike. This bonus round was not present in the ZX Spectrum version and some of the early Commodore 64 versions.

Reception The Commodore 64 version was a \\"Sizzler\\" in Zzap!64 magazine, scoring 93% overall. The game's sound and graphics were acclaimed.

Of these two, Fist 2 is not a fighting game, but a scrolling action game with one-on-one fighting elements. Exploding Fist +, on the other hand, returns to the style of the first game. It features combat with three characters, an idea followed from International Karate +, though in this case it is possible for players to control the three characters simultaneously.

She described her candidacy against frontrunner Arnold Schwarzenegger as \\"the hybrid versus the Hummer\\", making reference to her ownership of a hybrid vehicle, the Toyota Prius, and Schwarzenegger's Hummer. The two would proceed to have a high-profile clash during the election's debate, during which both candidates were rebuked for making personal attacks. She dropped out of the race on September 30, 2003, and endorsed Governor Gray Davis' campaign to vote against the recall. Polls showed that only about 2 percent of California voters planned to vote for her at the time of her withdrawal. Though she failed to stop the recall, Huffington's name remained on the ballot and she placed 5th, capturing 47,505 votes - less than 1% of the vote. =Presence in media= Huffington was a panelist on the weekly BBC Radio 4 political discussion programme Any Questions?, and the BBC television panel games Call My Bluff and Face the Music.

Huffington with Steve Buscemi, Moby and Lou Reed at a screening of the film Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers, 2006 Huffington was spoofed by actress Tracey Ullman in her Showtime comedy series Tracey Ullman's State of the Union. Huffington spoke glowingly of the impersonation. Huffington was further impersonated by actresses Michaela Watkins and Nasim Pedrad on Saturday Night Live. She appeared as herself in the May 10, 2010, episode of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother. Huffington participated in the 24th annual \\"Distinguished Speaker Series\\" at the University at Buffalo, New York, on September 16, 2010. She headlined a debate against radio co-host Mary Matalin on current world events, political issues, and the local Buffalo economy. The University at Buffalo \\"Distinguished Speaker Series\\" has featured a multitude of world-renowned politicians and celebrities such as Tony Blair, Bill Nye, Jon Stewart, and the Dalai Lama. Huffington offered to provide as many buses as necessary to transport those who wanted to go to Jon Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, from The Huffington Post headquarters in New York City. Ultimately, she paid for 150 buses to ferry almost 10,000 people from Citi Field in Queens to RFK Stadium in DC. Huffington played herself in the Family Guy episode \\"Brian Writes a Bestseller\\" along with Dana Gould and Bill Maher in a live segment of Real Time with Bill Maher. In 2012, Huffington became a LinkedIn influencer, writing about success and sharing professional insights. Claims of plagiarism Huffington was accused of plagiarism for copying material for her book Maria Callas (1981); the claims were settled out of court in 1981, with Callas' biographer Gerald Fitzgerald being paid \\"in the low five figures\\".Orth, Maureen (2005) The Importance of Being Famous.

Lydia Gasman, an art history professor at the University of Virginia, has claimed that Huffington's 1988 biography of Pablo Picasso, Picasso: Creator and Destroyer, included themes similar to those in her unpublished four-volume PhD thesis. \\"What she did was steal twenty years of my work\\", Gasman told Maureen Orth in 1994. Gasman did not file suit. Columnist Maureen Orth also claimed that Huffington \\"borrowed heavily for her 1993 book, The Gods of Greece\\". Religious views Huffington has had a lifelong interest in spirituality; in her youth, together with Bernard Levin, she explored the Rajneesh movement, later dating est founder Werner Erhard and going on to become affiliated with John-Roger Hinkins' Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. In 1994, she published a self-help book titled The Fourth Instinct, outlining her view that people should rise above the three basic instincts of survival, power, and sex to find their higher and better selves. Personal life Huffington is Greek by birth and became a naturalized American citizen in 1990. She met her husband Michael Huffington in 1985.

Early life Quivers was born on August 8, 1952, in Pikesville, Maryland, to Lula Louise Quivers, a homemaker and housekeeper, and Charles Quivers Sr., a steelworker at Bethlehem Steel. She has a brother, Charles Jr., and two adopted brothers, Harry and Howard. Both parents were educated only to the seventh grade. Career =Military= In 1974, Quivers graduated from the University of Maryland School of Nursing. Her first position was at the Maryland Shock Trauma facility of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services System, where she described her role as that of \\"a shock-trauma, intensive care kind of nurse, so I saw unpleasantness all the time\\". Knowing she could use her degree, Quivers joined the United States Air Force in July 1975, where she was commissioned as a second lieutenant. She entered active duty on January 11, 1976, before she was promoted to first lieutenant after six months of service. By June 1978, she had acquired the rank of captain. Quivers was discharged a month later. =Radio= In 1979, Quivers returned to Baltimore, where she studied at the Broadcasting Institute of Maryland and worked in a hospital. She landed her first job in the radio industry with a newscasting position at WIOO in Carlisle, Pennsylvania followed by WCMB in nearby Harrisburg. She then moved back to Baltimore for a consumer reporter role at WJZ (AM), where she also read newscasts with morning disc jockey Johnny Walker. In March 1981, radio personality Howard Stern started his new morning program at WWDC (FM) in Washington, DC. He wanted an on-air newscaster to riff with him in the studio on the news and current affairs. Station program director Denise Oliver played Quivers a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air. Awards At the 45th NAACP Image Awards in February 2014, Quivers won for Outstanding Literary Work ‚Äì Instructional, for her book The Vegucation of Robin: How Real Food Saved My Life. Personal life Quivers resides in Manhattan, New York City. From the mid-1990s until April 2007, her long-time boyfriend Tony was mysteriously referred to on the radio show as \\"Mr. X\\". On April 23, 2007, Quivers called in to the Bubba the Love Sponge Show on Howard 101, announcing their separation. In 1990, she underwent breast reduction surgery. In June 2007, Quivers began a strict vegan diet, which she says helped to increase her energy and helped her to lose 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a six-month period. Quivers was set to release a book about her experiences as a vegan in March 2013, but it was pushed back to October. In August 2007, comedian Jim Florentine asked Quivers on the air to go on a date with him. Due to the attention this garnered, Quivers became tight-lipped about the topic. On July 28, 2008, Quivers announced on Bubba the Love Sponge‚Äôs radio show that she and Florentine had ended their relationship. She stated that the breakup was amicable, that Florentine was \\"genuine and honest\\", and that he was the one who initiated the breakup. Quivers has had many different hobbies, including race car driving, painting, rock climbing and other physical activities. She claimed she would be a successful racer and challenged radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge, an experienced driver, to a future race. Quivers competed in the 2007 Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race, finishing in fourteenth place out of seventeen racers. To promote his book The Mirror Effect, Drew Pinsky administered a test designed to measure narcissism of many celebrities, including the staff of The Howard Stern Show. At 34 out of 40, Quivers scored the highest of all celebrities polled; the average for Americans is 15. Quivers‚Äôs voice is often joked about on the Howard Stern show as being condescending and \\"snooty.\\" Quivers works with The Girl Fund, a program organized by the United Nations that advocates for education of girls in countries where they are often exploited. Quivers also founded the 15 Foundation, a nonprofit organization. Robin has learned the Transcendental Meditation technique, as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. =Health= Quivers announced in May 2012 that she needed to have surgery to remove a tumor from her bladder. Shortly afterward, she continued to provide commentary for the show from her New York home via an ISDN line, though this was hidden from listeners. Stern stated that Quivers was such an instrumental part of the show that he would quit radio if he ever lost her as a partner. On September 9, 2013, Quivers announced that her cancer was in complete remission after successful surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. After seventeen months, Quivers returned to the studio on October 2, 2013. Quivers' official diagnosis was stage 3C endometrial cancer.

Jenkins Jr. in 1993.Robert J. Jenkins Jr., ISAAC. Fast Software Encryption 1996, pp. 41-49. The reference implementation source code was dedicated to the public domain.The ISAAC Cipher  Operation  The ISAAC algorithm has similarities with RC4. It uses an array of 256 four-octet integers as the internal state, writing the results to another 256 four-octet integer array, from which they are read one at a time until empty, at which point they are recomputed. The computation consists of altering i-element with (i‚äï128)-element, two elements of the state array found by indirection, an accumulator, and a counter, for all values of i from 0 to 255. Since it only takes about 19 32-bit operations for each 32-bit output word, it is very fast on 32-bit computers.  Cryptanalysis  Cryptanalysis has been undertaken by Marina Pudovkina (2001).Marina Pudovkina, A known plaintext attack on the ISAAC keystream generator, 2001, Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2001/049, . Her attack can recover the initial state with a complexity that is approximated to be less than the time needed for searching through the square root of all possible initial states. In practice this means that the attack needs 4.67 \\\\times 10^{1240} instead of 10^{2466}. This result has had no practical impact on the security of ISAAC. In 2006 Jean-Philippe Aumasson discovered several sets of weak states.Jean-Philippe Aumasson, On the pseudo- random generator ISAAC. Cryptology ePrint archive, report 2006/438, 2006. The fourth presented (and smallest) set of weak states leads to a highly biased output for the first round of ISAAC and allows the derivation of the internal state, similar to a weakness in RC4. It is not clear if an attacker can tell from just the output whether the generator is in one of these weak states or not. He also shows that a previous attackSouradyuti Paul, Bart Preneel, On the (In)security of Stream Ciphers Based on Arrays and Modular Addition.Asiacrypt 2006. is flawed, since the Paul-Preneel attack is based on an erroneous algorithm rather than the real ISAAC. An improved version of ISAAC is proposed, called ISAAC+.  Usage outside cryptography  Many implementations of ISAAC are so fast that they can compete with other high speed PRNGs, even with those designed primarily for speed not for security. Only a few other generators of such high quality and speed exist in usage.

He was a brother to theologian Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten (1706‚Äì1757). Biography Baumgarten was born in Berlin as the fifth of seven sons of the pietist pastor of the garrison, Jacob Baumgarten, and of his wife Rosina Elisabeth. Both his parents died early, and he was taught by Martin Georg Christgau where he learned Hebrew and became interested in Latin poetry. In 1733, during his formal studies at the University of Halle, he attended lectures on the philosophy of Christian Wolff by at the University of Jena.Robert Theis, Alexander Aichele (eds.), Handbuch Christian Wolff, Springer-Verlag, 2017, p. 442.Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762) Philosophical work While the meanings of words often change as a result of cultural developments, Baumgarten's reappraisal of aesthetics is often seen as a key moment in the development of aesthetic philosophy. Previously the word aesthetics had merely meant \\"sensibility\\" or \\"responsiveness to stimulation of the senses\\" in its use by ancient writers. With the development of art as a commercial enterprise linked to the rise of a nouveau riche class across Europe, the purchasing of art inevitably led to the question, \\"what is good art?\\". Baumgarten developed aesthetics to mean the study of good and bad \\"taste\\", thus good and bad art, linking good taste with beauty. By trying to develop an idea of good and bad taste, he also in turn generated philosophical debate around this new meaning of aesthetics. Without it, there would be no basis for aesthetic debate as there would be no objective criterion, basis for comparison, or reason from which one could develop an objective argument. =Views on aesthetics= Aesthetica (1750) by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten Baumgarten appropriated the word aesthetics, which had always meant \\"sensation\\", to mean taste or \\"sense\\" of beauty. In so doing, he gave the word a different significance, thereby inventing its modern usage. The word had been used differently since the time of the ancient Greeks to mean the ability to receive stimulation from one or more of the five bodily senses. In his Metaphysic, ¬ß 607,Metaphysics: A Critical Translation with Kant's Elucidations Baumgarten defined taste, in its wider meaning, as the ability to judge according to the senses, instead of according to the intellect. Such a judgment of taste he saw as based on feelings of pleasure or displeasure. A science of aesthetics would be, for Baumgarten, a deduction of the rules or principles of artistic or natural beauty from individual \\"taste\\". Baumgarten may have been motivated to respond to Pierre Bonhours' opinion, published in a pamphlet in the late 17th century, that Germans were incapable of appreciating art and beauty. Reception In 1781, Kant declared that Baumgarten's aesthetics could never contain objective rules, laws, or principles of natural or artistic beauty. Nine years later, in his Critique of Judgment, Kant conformed to Baumgarten's new usage and employed the word aesthetic to mean the judgment of taste or the estimation of the beautiful. For Kant, an aesthetic judgment is subjective in that it relates to the internal feeling of pleasure or displeasure and not to any qualities in an external object. In 1897, Leo Tolstoy, in his What is Art?, criticized Baumgarten's book on aesthetics. Tolstoy opposed \\"Baumgarten's trinity -- Good, Truth and Beauty‚Ä¶.\\"What is Art?, VII Tolstoy asserted that \\"these words not only have no definite meaning, but they hinder us from giving any definite meaning to existing art‚Ä¶.\\" Baumgarten, he said, claimed that there are three ways to know perfection: \\"Beauty is the perfect (the absolute) perceived by the senses. Truth is the perfect perceived by reason. The good is the perfect attained by the moral will.\\"What is Art?, III Tolstoy, however, contradicted Baumgarten's theory and claimed that good, truth, and beauty have nothing in common and may even oppose each other. Whatever the limitations of Baumgarten's theory of aesthetics, Frederick Copleston credits him with playing a formative role in German aesthetics, extending Christian Wolff's philosophy to topics that Wolff did not consider, and demonstrating the existence of a legitimate topic for philosophical analysis that could not be reduced to abstract logical analysis.Frederick Copleston (1946‚Äì1975). A History of Philosophy, vol. VI. Metaphysics For many years, Kant used Baumgarten's Metaphysica as a handbook or manual for his lectures on that topic. Georg Friedrich Meier translated the Metaphysics from Latin to German, an endeavour which - according to Meier - Baumgarten himself had planned, but could not find the time to execute.

It is bounded by the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the Pamir Mountains and Tian Shan (ancient Mount Imeon) to the west and north and the Gobi Desert to the east. Etymology While most researchers agree on being the Persian word for \\"place\\", etymology of Takla is less clear. The word may be an Uyghur borrowing of the Persian , \\"to leave alone/out/behind, relinquish, abandon\\" + makan. Another plausible explanation suggests it is derived from Turki taqlar makan, describing \\"the place of ruins\\".Tamm (2011), p. 139. But see Christian Tyler, Wild West China, John Murray 2003, p.17 Chinese scholars Wang Guowei and Huang Wenbi linked the name to the Tocharians, a historical people of the Tarim Basin, making the meaning of \\"Taklamakan\\" similar to \\"Tocharistan\\". In folk etymology, it is said to mean \\"Place of No Return\\", more commonly interpreted as \\"once you get in, you'll never get out\\" or similar. Geography Settlements, 3rd century AD. Taklamakan by NASA World Wind The Taklamakan Desert has an area of , making it slightly smaller than Germany and is part of the Tarim Basin, which is long and wide. It is crossed at its northern and at its southern edge by two branches of the Silk Road as travellers sought to avoid the arid wasteland. It is the world's second largest shifting sand desert with about 85% made up of shifting sand dunes ranking 16th in size in a ranking of the world's largest deserts. Dunes range in altitude from up to as much as . The few breaks in this sea of sand are small patches of alluvial clay. Generally, the steeper sides of the dunes face away from the prevailing winds. The People's Republic of China has constructed two cross-desert highways. The Tarim Desert Highway links the cities of Hotan (on the southern edge) and Luntai (on the northern edge) and the Bayingol to Ruoqiang road crosses the desert to the east. In recent years, the desert has expanded in some areas, its sands enveloping farms and villages as a result of desertification. The Golmud-Korla Railway (presently, under construction; expected completion time, 2020) will cross the Taklamakan as well. Named areas in the desert include Ha-la-ma, A-lang-ha and Mai-k'o-tsa-k'o. The Mazartag mountains are located in the western part of the desert. Climate Yarkand Sand Dunes captured by NASA's Landsat-7 Because it lies in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, Taklamakan is a cold desert climate. Given its relative proximity with the cold to frigid air masses in Siberia, extreme temperatures are recorded in wintertime, sometimes well below , while in summer they can rise up to . During the 2008 Chinese winter storms episode, the Taklamakan was reported to be covered, for the first time in its recorded history, entirely with a thin layer of snow reaching , with a temperature of in some observatories. Its extreme inland position, virtually in the very heartland of Asia and thousands of kilometres from any open body of water, accounts for the somewhat wide diurnal temperature variation. Oasis Map including the Taklamakan Desert (1917) Molcha (Moleqie) River forms a vast alluvial fan at the southern border of the Taklamakan Desert, as it leaves the Altyn-Tagh mountains and enters the desert in the western part of the Qiemo County. The left side appears blue from water flowing in many streams. The picture is taken in May, when the river is full with the snow/glacier meltwater. The Taklamakan Desert has very little water, therefore it is hazardous to cross. Merchant caravans on the Silk Road would stop for relief at the thriving oasis towns. It was in close proximity to many of the ancient civilizations‚Äîto the Northwest is the Amu Darya basin, to the southwest the Afghanistan mountain passes lead to Iran and India, to the east is China, and even to the north ancient towns such as Almaty can be found. The key oasis towns, watered by rainfall from the mountains, were Kashgar, Miran, Niya, Yarkand, and Khotan (Hetian) to the south, Kuqa and Turpan in the north, and Loulan and Dunhuang in the east. Now, many, such as Miran and Gaochang, are ruined cities in sparsely inhabited areas in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. The archaeological treasures found in its sand-buried ruins point to Tocharian, early Hellenistic, Indian, and Buddhist influences. Its treasures and dangers have been vividly described by Aurel Stein, Sven Hedin, Albert von Le Coq, and Paul Pelliot. Mummies, some 4000 years old, have been found in the region. Later, the Taklamakan was inhabited by Turkic peoples. Starting with the Han Dynasty, the Chinese sporadically extended their control to the oasis cities of the Taklamakan Desert in order to control the important silk route trade across Central Asia. Periods of Chinese rule were interspersed with rule by Turkic, Mongol and Tibetan peoples. The present population consists largely of Turkic Uyghur people and ethnic Han people.Xinjiang territory profile , BBC News. May 7, 2011. Scientific exploration This desert was explored by several scientists such as Xuanzang, a monk in the 7th century, and by the archaeologist Aurel Stein in the 20th century. Atmospheric studies have shown that dust originating from the Taklamakan is blown over the Pacific, where it contributes to cloud formation over the Western United States. Further, the traveling dust redistributes minerals from the Taklamakan to the western U.S.A. via rainfall. Studies have shown that a specific class of mineral found in the dust, known as K-feldspar, triggers ice formation particularly well. K-feldspar is particularly susceptible to corrosion by acidic atmospheric pollution, such as nitrates and phosphates; exposure to these constituents reduces the ability of the dust to trigger water droplet formation. In popular culture The desert is the main setting for Chinese film series Painted Skin and Painted Skin: The Resurrection. The Chinese TV series Candle in the Tomb is mostly spent in this desert as they are searching for the ancient city of Jinjue (see Niya (Tarim Basin).) The issue #39 'Soft Places' of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman takes place in the desert, when Marco Polo gets lost in the desert. A portion of the Korean quasi-historical TV drama series Queen Seondeok takes place in the Taklamakan Desert. Sohwa escapes from Silla with baby Deokman and raises her in the desert. As a teenager, Deokman returns to Silla and uses the knowledge and experience gained from life among international traders in the Taklamakan trading centers to gain the throne of Silla. The desert is showcased in the Japanese animation Mobile Suit Gundam 00, set in the year 2307. On the series, the Taklamakan Desert is the setting of a large-scale military joint operation performed by all the world's blocks of power, and interdicted by the paramilitary organization Celestial Being. Code Geass depicts a fictionalized version of Taklamakan Desert within the Chinese Federation, one of three superstates in the series. It serves as the setting of a key battle between the Holy Britannian Empire and Japanese insurrectionists backed by the Chinese Federation. Later, the presence of an underground city is revealed, where members of the Geass Order are being used by Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his consort Marianne vi Britannia to bring about the Ragnar√∂k Connection. In the third book of the Temeraire series, Black Powder War by Naomi Novik, Captain Laurence and his crew must cross the desert to return home to England from China.

In the following generation came Hester Lynch Piozzi (1741‚Äì1821), Hannah More (1745‚Äì1833) and Frances Burney (1752‚Äì1840).Tinker, 1915. The term now more broadly applies to women who show interest in literary or intellectual matters. Until the late 18th century, the term had referred to learned people of both sexes. It was later applied primarily to intellectual women and the French equivalent bas bleu had a similar connotation. The term later developed negative implications and is now often used in a derogatory manner. The reference to blue stockings may arise from the time when woollen worsted stockings were informal dress, in contrast to formal, fashionable black silk stockings. The most frequent such reference is to a man, Benjamin Stillingfleet, who reportedly lacked the formal black stockings, yet participated in the Blue Stockings Society. As Frances Burney, a Bluestocking, recounts the events, she reveals that Benjamin Stillingfleet was invited to a literary meeting by Elizabeth Vesey but was told off because of his informal attire. Her response was \\"don‚Äôt mind dress! Come in your blue stockings!\\" History The Blue Stockings Society was a literary society led by Elizabeth Montagu and others in the 1750s in England. Elizabeth Montagu was an anomaly in this society because she took possession of her husband's property when he died. This allowed her to have impact in her world.Beckett, J. V. \\"Elizabeth Montagu: Bluestocking Turned Landlady.\\" Huntington Library Quarterly 49, no. 2 (1986): 149-64. This society was founded by women, and included many prominent members of English society, both male and female, including Harriet Bowdler, Edmund Burke, Sarah Fielding, Samuel Johnson, and Frances Pulteney. M.P., an 1811 comic opera by Thomas Moore and Charles Edward Horn, was subtitled The Blue Stocking. It contained a character Lady Bab Blue who was a parody of bluestockings. A reference to bluestockings has been attributed to John Amos Comenius in his 1638 book, where he mentioned the ancient tradition of women being excluded from higher education, citing Bible and Euripides. That reference, though, comes from Keatinge's 1896 translation and is not present in Comenius's original Latin text. The name may have been applied in the 15th century to the blue stockings worn by the members of the Compagnie della Calza in Venice, which then was adopted in Paris and London; in the 17th century to the Covenanters in Scotland, who wore unbleached woollen stockings, in contrast to the bleached or dyed stockings of the more affluent. In 1870 Henry D. Wheatley noted that Elizabeth Montagu's coterie were named \\"blue stockings\\" after the blue worsted stockings worn by the naturalist Benjamin Stillingfleet. William Hazlitt said, \\"The bluestocking is the most odious character in society...she sinks wherever she is placed, like the yolk of an egg, to the bottom, and carries the filth with her.\\" Recent use In Japan, a literary magazine Seit≈ç (Bluestocking) was launched in 1911 under the leadership of Raich≈ç Hiratsuka. It ran until 1916, providing a creative outlet and political platform for Japanese feminists even while it faced public outcry and government censorship. The Toledo Blue Stockings was a major league baseball team in Toledo, Ohio from 1883-1885. Historically, the team is best known for being the only major league team with black players (Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother, Weldy Walker) prior to Jackie Robinson's appearance with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Bluestockings is the name of a volunteer-run and collectively-owned radical bookstore, fair trade cafe, and activist center located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, which opened in 1999. \\"The Bluestocking\\" is the name of the yearbook of Mary Baldwin College, a traditionally all-women's school in Staunton, Virginia. \\"Blue Stocking\\" was an \\"unabashedly feminist\\" (tag line) newspaper published in Portland, Oregon 1993 to 1996.

Valldemossa is a village and municipality on the island of Majorca, part of the Spanish autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. It is famous for one landmark: the Royal Charterhouse of Valldemossa, built at the beginning of the 14th century, when the mystic and philosopher Ramon Llull lived in this area of Majorca. Since the 19th century Valldemossa has been promoted internationally as a place of outstanding beauty, largely as a result of the affection of distinguished traveller and cultural writer, the Austrian Archduke Ludwig Salvator. Valldemossa is a very attractive tourist destination, as it shows early Spanish culture. There are many shops and restaurants to indulge in Spanish culture. History In the 1830s the Spanish government confiscated monasteries and the historic estate was sold to private owners, who have since hosted some prominent guests. These have included the Polish composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and his lover the pioneering French writer Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin, better known by her pseudonym George Sand, who wrote a notable account of A Winter in Majorca, describing their 1838‚Äì39 visit and praising the island's natural beauty, but criticizing what she perceived as the prejudice and vices of the natives. Later the Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o was guest of the Sureda y Montaner families who own the Chartreuse estate. To fight his own nightmares Rub√©n Dario would sleep in monk habits, however his drinking habits caused a rift with his private hosts and thus his departure from the former monastery and from Majorca. Also Jorge Luis Borges lived in the town with his parents and his sister Norah, after the First World War let them free from their refuge in Geneva. Borges passionate friendship with the young artist Jacobo Sureda Montaner, son of the painter Pilar Montaner, was decisive for Borges writing mainly in Spanish. In 1956 British composer Joseph Horovitz visited the island, with his wife Anna, on their honeymoon, and later named a clarinet piece, based on Spanish folk- tunes he had heard there, after the village. Until the elections of 2007 the town's mayor was the only one in the democratic Kingdom of Spain to remain in office from the times of the Francoist dictatorship, which legally disappeared as the current Spanish Constitution of 1978 was passed. Valldemossa is the birthplace of Catalina Thomas, Mallorca's patron saint. Chopin and Sand in Valldemossa In October 1836, Chopin met a French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant) at Liszt‚Äôs house. In the summer of 1838, Sand and Chopin became lovers. They spent the following winter from 8 November 1838 to 11 February 1839 together with Sand‚Äôs two children in Mallorca. At first, they stayed in Palma de Mallorca and then at the Charterhouse in Valldemossa. Already after a month, Chopin was writing about Valldemossa in rather sad tones, complaining about the weather and local cuisine. The Mediterranean climate was to agree with the composer; however, that year‚Äôs winter was particularly rainy and Chopin caught a cold. On top of that, the piano that was imported from Europe especially for him, was lost during the transport. After the piano was found, it was waiting later for weeks at the Palma port for the duty to be paid. During this time, Chopin was forced to play on a poor Majorcan piano. Despite the difficulties, he was working on his next pieces. It was in Mallorca where the collection of 24 preludes was completed (including prelude in D-flat major nicknamed Raindrop). There was not much left after the visit of the couple of lovers. The locals, afraid of tuberculosis, burnt most of the furniture of the rooms Chopin and Sand had lived in. Museums dedicated to the famous couple are located in the monastery cells 2 and 4. Memorabilia collected there include letters and manuscripts, portraits and sketches, as well as the Majorcan piano, on which Chopin had been composing since January 1836. There are also a Chopin‚Äôs death mask and a lock of his hair, preserved in a George Sand‚Äôs book. The museum is private and was founded in 1929 by Anne-Marie Boutroux de Ferr√† and her husband Bartomeu Ferr√† i Juan. The Chopin Festival organised by Festivals Chopin de Valldemossa has been held since 1930 in August at the Carthusian monastery. In cell 4, visitors can see the Pleyel piano ordered by the composer in Paris, which arrived in Valldemossa three weeks before his departure. When Chopin and Sand were leaving, they did not want to pay a high duty for the second time and left the piano to the director of the bank where Sand had opened an account. The piano, not yet fully paid off, was probably a form of a settlement. The piano was passed on in the banker‚Äôs family from one generation to another. Its current owners are the heirs of the bank director, the Quetglas brothers, who administer Chopin‚Äôs and G. Sand‚Äôs cell. The instrument is the greatest pride of their Chopin museum. Tourism Valldemossa is a very popular tourist destination in the Balearic Islands of Spain. Some main attractions include the 13th century monastery, where the musician Frederic Chopin spent a winter (1838-39). The monastery was originally built as a royal palace, however in 1399 it was converted into a monastery. =Events and festivals= There are many spectacular festivals that take place in Valldemossa, including: *Festes de la Beata: takes place during July 28, celebrates the Patron Saint of Valldemossa. Many parades take place on the streets during this festival. *Festival of Saint Bartomeu: on 24 August, also celebrates the Patron Saint. There are magnificent performances in the Cloisters of the Monastery. *Annual Artdemossa: this festival, ae the end of July, includes art and performance exhibitions. =Activities= In Valldemossa, one should enjoy the setting in the countryside and the views. However, there are also hikes, cycling, rock climbing, golfing, and horseback riding that is available in the near vicinity. =Restaurants= Mallorcan Cuisine Ca'n Mario and Es Roquissan are very good options.

It is Greenland's main air transport hub and the site of Greenland's largest commercial airport. The airport dates from American settlement during and after World War II, when the site was known as Bluie West-8 and then Sondrestrom Air Base. The Kangerlussuaq area is also home to Greenland's most diverse terrestrial fauna, including muskoxen, caribou, and gyrfalcons. The settlement's economy and population of 508 is almost entirely reliant on the airport and tourist industry.  Geography  Midnight sun under Sugarloaf, Kangerlussuaq Kangerlussuaq occupies an alluvial flatland on the far end of the 190 km long Kangerlussuaq Fjord, straddling both sides of the Qinnguata Kuussua river estuary. East of Kangerlussuaq there is a confluence of the two major regional rivers, the Qinnguata Kuussua and Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua. The valley of the latter forms large quicksand plains. Both rivers originate from the Russell Glacier. The edge of the glacier is easily accessible and is a major tourist attraction from the town, as is the edge of the ice sheet in the Isunngua highlands to its northeast. Highlands such as Tarajornitsut bound Kangerlussuaq from the north and south. To the southeast behind lake Tasersuatsiaq, which provides fresh water to the town, is the vast highland of Ammalortup Nunaa, the original region artificially populated with 27 muskoxen. The town is situated about north of the Arctic Circle. History Russell Glacier, flowing down from Sermersuaq. Visible is the fresh meltwater outflow and remains of berg bombardment. While Inuit hunters certainly visited Kangerlussuaq, there appears never to have been a settlement at the location. Kangerlussuaq was founded at the east end of Kangerlussuaq fjord as Bluie West-8 on 7 October 1941, under the supervision of Colonel Bernt Balchen of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Following the fall of Denmark to Germany in World War II, US forces assumed security for Greenland, building several bases including Bluie West-1 to the south in Narsarsuaq and Bluie West-8 at the Kangerlussuaq fjord. The base briefly came under Danish control in 1950, but following mounting concerns about the Cold War threat, a new agreement saw the United States reopen Bluie West-8 under the name of Sondrestrom Air Base on 27 April 1951. It served as one of the Distant Early Warning Line bases and a supply station for similar early warning facilities. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the usefulness of the base was greatly diminished and the last U.S. Air Force personnel left the base on 30 September 1992. The base subsequently came under Greenlandic Home Rule and was renamed using the Kalaallisut dialect of the West Greenland Inuit. This site and Bluie West-1 in Narsarsuaq remain Greenland's best-equipped airports. Almost all of the permanent structures in the town were built during the American occupation of the site. Climate The climate in Kangerlussuaq is subarctic (K√∂ppen Dfc), bordering on tundra climate (K√∂ppen ET) and unusually for somewhere this far north (In the arctic circle), a cold-semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk), with the area receiving very little rainfall. In July 2012 a gust of warm air resulted in glacier meltwater which wiped out a key crossing of the Watson River.Greenland's ice sheet is melting fast ‚Äì I'm not surprised. The ice sheet has been living on borrowed time for many years, with dire consequences 26 July 2012  Population  The population of Kangerlussuaq dropped significantly after the liquidation of the Sondrestrom Air Base. Since then it has increased by more than 80%, although it has begun dropping again in recent years.  Transport  Hotel Tuttu / Reindeer Inn installed in the former American Army barracks A front view of Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. = Air = As the only civilian airport in Greenland large enough to support large long- range airplanes such as Boeing 747s, Kangerlussuaq Airport is Greenland's most important transport hub. Hotel Kangerlussuaq operates at the airport. = Sea = Kangerlussuaq Fjord is navigable in its entire length. There is a seaport at Kangerlussuaq, 20 km west of Kangerlussuaq Airport. It is fairly shallow and suitable for small ships only, mainly used by supply ships of the Royal Arctic Line, and unusable in winter. (Danish) Cruise ships, such as Norway's Hurtigruten, navigate the fjord, anchoring outside the port. They go to Kangerlussuaq mainly to exchange passenger by air, because the travel time to and from Greenland is too long for many passengers. Plans were approved in 2018 to build a new deep port, around 10 km west of the present one, together with a road to it. = Road = Musk ox () road sign just outside Kangerlussuaq Kangerlussuaq has the largest road network outside any settlement in Greenland (not counting streets inside the settlement). A gravel road through Isunngua connects Kangerlussuaq with the ice sheet, initially serving as venue for car endurance experiments. Since then it has been mainly used for tourist purposes.Sisimiut.gl There are plans to construct a road to Sisimiut (170 km) as of 2017. http://naalakkersuisut.gl/da/Naalakkersuisut/Nyheder/2017/11/1411_arbejdsgruppe The cost estimates have been between 250-500 million Danish kroner (DKK), depending on road quality, and therefore the plans are delayed. The drive time would be much longer than the fly time, and there are also considerations to move the main hub of Air Greenland to Nuuk Airport, closing Kangerlussuaq airport. On 17 June 2020, Qeqqata Kommunia approved the plans to build the road. Construction of the first 21 km of the road, connecting Kangerlussuaq with the Tasersuaq area, is scheduled to begin in late July 2020. Greenland‚Äôs first road project connecting settlements clears its last hurdleFirst overland road project between Greenlandic towns Scientific research Sondrestrom Upper Atmospheric Research Facility There is an ionospheric and atmospheric research facility known as the Sondrestrom Upper Atmospheric Research Facility, situated at about west of Kangerlussuaq. It is commonly known around the town as Kellyville. It is operated by SRI International for the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Danish Meteorological Institute. This facility is host to more than 20 instruments, the majority of which provide unique and complementary information about the arctic upper atmosphere. The centerpiece instrument of the facility is an L band incoherent scatter (IS) radar with a fully steerable antenna. It has been operational since the ionospheric radar was transported from Alaska to Kangerlussuaq in 1983 and it continues to be in high demand by the scientific communities. Kangerlussuaq hosted the Greenland Space Science Symposium in May 2007. The selection of Greenland as a place for the symposium celebrated the rich history of Greenland in using scientific instruments to provide a window into the geospace system.

It was named after Thomas Cullinan, the mine's chairman. In April 1905, it was put on sale in London, but despite considerable interest, it was still unsold after two years. In 1907, the Transvaal Colony government bought the Cullinan and then presented it to Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom, who had it cut by Joseph Asscher & Co. in Amsterdam. Cullinan produced stones of various cuts and sizes, the largest of which is named Cullinan I or the Great Star of Africa, and at it is the largest clear cut diamond in the world. The stone is mounted in the head of the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. The second-largest is Cullinan II or the Second Star of Africa, weighing , mounted in the Imperial State Crown. Both are part of the Crown Jewels. Seven other major diamonds, weighing a total of , are privately owned by Elizabeth II, who inherited them from her grandmother, Queen Mary, in 1953. The Queen also owns minor brilliants and a set of unpolished fragments.  Discovery and early history  Wells and the diamond The Cullinan is estimated to have formed in Earth's mantle transition zone at a depth of 410‚Äì660 km (255‚Äì410 miles) and reached the surface 1.18 billion years ago.Smith, et al., pp. 1403‚Äì1405 It was found below the surface at Premier Mine in Cullinan, Transvaal Colony, by Frederick Wells, surface manager at the mine, on 26 January 1905. It was approximately long, wide, deep, and weighed . Newspapers called it the \\"Cullinan Diamond\\", a reference to Sir Thomas Cullinan, who opened the mine in 1902.Scarratt and Shor, p. 122. It was three times the size of the Excelsior Diamond, found in 1893 at Jagersfontein Mine, weighing . Four of its eight surfaces were smooth, indicating that it once had been part of a much larger stone broken up by natural forces. It had a blue-white hue and contained a small pocket of air, which at certain angles produced a rainbow, or Newton's rings.Hatch, pp. 170‚Äì172. Shortly after its discovery, Cullinan went on public display at the Standard Bank in Johannesburg, where it was seen by an estimated 8,000‚Äì9,000 visitors. In April 1905, the rough gem was deposited with Premier Mining Co.'s London sales agent, S. Neumann & Co.Scarratt and Shor, p. 123. Due to its immense value, detectives were assigned to a steamboat that was rumoured to be carrying the stone, and a parcel was ceremoniously locked in the captain's safe and guarded on the entire journey. It was a diversionary tactic ‚Äì the stone on that ship was fake, meant to attract those who would be interested in stealing it. Cullinan was sent to the United Kingdom in a plain box via registered post.Dickinson, pp. 110‚Äì111. On arriving in London, it was conveyed to Buckingham Palace for inspection by King Edward VII. Although it drew considerable interest from potential buyers, Cullinan went unsold for two years. =Presentation to Edward VII= Transvaal Prime Minister, Louis Botha, suggested buying the diamond for Edward VII as \\"a token of the loyalty and attachment of the people of the Transvaal to His Majesty's throne and person\\".Lee, pp. 489‚Äì490. In August 1907, a vote was held in Parliament on the Cullinan's fate, and a motion authorising the purchase was carried by 42 votes in favour to 19 against. Initially, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, then British Prime Minister, advised the king to decline the offer, but he later decided to let Edward VII choose whether or not to accept the gift.Helme, p. 86. Eventually, he was persuaded by Winston Churchill, then Colonial Under- Secretary. For his trouble, Churchill was sent a replica, which he enjoyed showing off to guests on a silver plate.Field, p. 72. The Transvaal Colony government bought the diamond on 17 October 1907 for ¬£150,000,Bariand and Duchamp, p. 97. which adjusted for pound-sterling inflation is equivalent to ¬£ in . Due to a 60% tax on mining profits, the Treasury received some of its money back from the Premier Diamond Mining Company.Cartwright, p. 73. The diamond was presented to the king at Sandringham House by Agent-General of the colony, Sir Richard Solomon, on 9 November 1907 ‚Äì his sixty-sixth birthday ‚Äì in the presence of a large party of guests, including the Queen of Sweden, the Queen of Spain, the Duke of Westminster and Lord Revelstoke. The king asked his colonial secretary, Lord Elgin, to announce that he accepted the gift \\"for myself and my successors\\" and that he would ensure \\"this great and unique diamond be kept and preserved among the historic jewels which form the heirlooms of the Crown\\". =Cutting process= Joseph Asscher making the split The king chose Joseph Asscher & Co. of Amsterdam to cleave and polish the rough stone into brilliant gems of various cuts and sizes. Abraham Asscher collected it from the Colonial Office in London on 23 January 1908.Balfour, p. 71. He returned to the Netherlands by train and ferry with the diamond in his coat pocket. Meanwhile, to much fanfare, a Royal Navy ship carried an empty box across the North Sea, again throwing off potential thieves. Even the captain had no idea that his \\"precious\\" cargo was a decoy.Seff and Seff, p. 252. On 10 February 1908, the rough stone was split in half by Joseph Asscher at his diamond-cutting factory in Amsterdam.Helme, p. 88. At the time, technology had not yet evolved to guarantee the quality of modern standards, and cutting the diamond was difficult and risky. After weeks of planning, an incision deep was made to enable Asscher to cleave the diamond in one blow. Making the incision alone took four days, and a steel knife broke on the first attempt, but a second knife was fitted into the groove and split it clean in two along one of four possible cleavage planes.Crookes, pp. 77‚Äì79. In all, splitting and cutting the diamond took eight months, with three people working 14 hours per day to complete the task. \\"The tale is told of Joseph Asscher, the greatest cleaver of the day,\\" wrote Matthew Hart in his book Diamond: A Journey to the Heart of an Obsession (2002), \\"that when he prepared to cleave the largest diamond ever known ‚Ä¶ he had a doctor and nurse standing by and when he finally struck the diamond ‚Ä¶ he fainted dead away\\".Hart, p. 204. Lord Ian Balfour, in his book Famous Diamonds (2009), dispels the fainting story, suggesting it was more likely Joseph would have celebrated, opening a bottle of champagne. When Joseph's nephew Louis heard the story, he exclaimed \\"No Asscher would ever faint over any operation on any diamond\\".Koskoff, p. 174. Diamonds cut from the Cullinan Cullinan produced 9 major stones of in total,Spencer, pp. 318‚Äì326. plus 96 minor brilliants and some unpolished fragments weighing .Balfour, p. 73. All but the two largest stones ‚Äì Cullinans I and II ‚Äì remained in Amsterdam by arrangement as the fee for Asscher's services,Balfour, p. 73. until the South African government bought them (except Cullinan VI, which Edward VII had purchased and given to his wife Queen Alexandra in 1907), and the High Commissioner for Southern Africa presented them to Queen Mary on 28 June 1910. Mary also inherited Cullinan VI from Alexandra, and she left all her Cullinan diamonds to her granddaughter Elizabeth II in 1953.Dickinson, p. 114. Cullinans I and II are part of the Crown Jewels, which belong to the Queen in right of the Crown. Asscher sold the minor stones to the South African government, which distributed them to Queen Mary; Louis Botha, then prime minister of South Africa; the diamond merchants Arthur and Alexander Levy, who supervised the cutting of Cullinan;Scarratt and Shor, p. 125. and Jacob Romijn (later Romyn), who co- founded the first trade union in the diamond industry.Balfour, pp. 73‚Äì75. Some were set by Mary into a long platinum chain, which Elizabeth has never worn in public, saying that \\"it gets in the soup\\". In the 1960s, two minor Cullinan diamonds owned by Louis Botha's heirs were analysed at the De Beers laboratory in Johannesburg and found to be completely free of nitrogen or any other impurities.Helme, p. 90. Cullinans I and II were examined in the 1980s by gemologists at the Tower of London and both graded as colourless type IIa.Scarrat and Shor, pp. 126, 131. =Cullinan I= The nine major stones. Top: Cullinans II, I, and III. Bottom: Cullinans VIII, VI, IV, V, VII and IX. Cullinan I, or the Great Star of Africa, is a pendeloque-cut brilliant weighing and has 74 facets.Manutchehr-Danai, p. 118. It is set at the top of the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross which had to be redesigned in 1910 to accommodate it. Cullinan I was surpassed as the world's largest cut diamond of any colour by the brown Golden Jubilee Diamond in 1992, but is still the largest clear cut diamond in the world. In terms of clarity, it has a few tiny cleavages and a small patch of graining. The diamond is fitted with loops and can be taken out of its setting to be worn as a pendant suspended from Cullinan II to make a brooch.Scarratt and Shor, p. 128. Queen Mary, wife of George V, often wore it like this.Mears, et al., p. 30. In 1908, the stone was valued at US$2.5 million (equivalent to US$ million in )‚Äì two and a half times the rough Cullinan's estimated value.Morgan, p. 262. =Cullinan II= Cullinan II, or the Second Star of Africa, is a cushion-cut brilliant with 66 facets weighing set in the front of the Imperial State Crown, below the Black Prince's Ruby (a large spinel). It measures . The diamond has a number of tiny flaws, scratches on the table facet, and a small chip at the girdle. Like Cullinan I, it is held in place by a yellow gold enclosure, which is screwed onto the crown. =Cullinan III= Cullinan III, or the Lesser Star of Africa, is pear-cut and weighs . In 1911, Queen Mary, wife and queen consort of George V, had it set in the top cross patt√©e of a crown that she personally bought for her coronation.Keay, p. 175. In 1912, the Delhi Durbar Tiara, worn the previous year by Mary instead of a crown at the Delhi Durbar, where her husband wore the Imperial Crown of India, was also adapted to take Cullinans III and IV. In 1914, Cullinan III was permanently replaced on the crown by a crystal model. Today, it is most frequently worn in combination with Cullinan IV by Elizabeth II as a brooch. In total, the brooch is long and wide. Cullinan III has also been used as a pendant on the Coronation Necklace, where it occasionally replaced the Lahore Diamond. =Cullinan IV= Queen Mary wearing Cullinans I and II as a brooch on her chest, III as a pendant on the Coronation Necklace, and IV in the base of her crown, below the Koh-i-Noor Cullinan IV, also referred to as a Lesser Star of Africa, is square-cut and weighs . It was also set in the base of Queen Mary's Crown but was removed in 1914. On 25 March 1958, while she and Prince Philip were on a state visit to the Netherlands, Queen Elizabeth II revealed that Cullinan III and IV are known in her family as \\"Granny's Chips\\". They visited the Asscher Diamond Company, where Cullinan had been cut 50 years earlier. It was the first time the Queen had worn the brooch publicly. During her visit, she unpinned the brooch and offered it for examination to Louis Asscher, nephew of Joseph Asscher, who split the rough diamond. Aged 84, he was deeply moved that the Queen had brought the diamonds with her, knowing how much it would mean to him seeing them again after so many years.Mears, p. 150. =Cullinan V= Cullinan V is an heart-shaped diamond set in the centre of a platinum brooch that formed a part of the stomacher made for Queen Mary to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. The brooch was designed to show off Cullinan V and is pav√©-set with a border of smaller diamonds. It can be suspended from the VIII brooch and can be used to suspend the VII pendant. It was often worn like this by Mary. =Cullinan VI= Cullinan VI is marquise-cut and weighs . It hangs from the brooch containing Cullinan VIII and forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure. Cullinan VI along with VIII can also be fitted together to make yet another brooch, surrounded by some 96 smaller diamonds. The design was created around the same time that the Cullinan V heart-shaped brooch was designed, both having a similar shape. =Cullinan VII= Cullinan VII is also marquise-cut and weighs . It was originally given by Edward VII to his wife and consort Queen Alexandra. After his death she gave the jewel to Queen Mary, who had it set as a pendant hanging from the diamond-and-emerald Delhi Durbar necklace, part of the parure. =Cullinan VIII= Cullinan VIII is an oblong- cut diamond weighing . It is set in the centre of a brooch forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure. Together with Cullinan VI it forms a brooch. =Cullinan IX= Cullinan IX is smallest of the principal diamonds to be obtained from the rough Cullinan. It is a pendeloque or stepped pear-cut stone, weighs , and is set in a platinum ring known as the Cullinan IX Ring.

According to the 28 August 2019 edition of Motorsport News, he is the United Kingdom's number one British motorsport hero. He was awarded the BARC Gold Medal in 2002, the first saloon car driver to be presented with the honour and was a life member of the prestigious BRDC. He took 625 overall and class wins and countless championship wins throughout his motor racing career. He was also well known in motoring circles for his successful car dealership, Marshall Wingfield, originally located on the Finchley Road, London, before moving to Brook Street in Tring and through his adult life lived in Harrow, Chiswell Green, Bricket Wood, Hemel Hempstead, Northchurch, Aston Clinton and Pitstone. His ashes are buried at St. Leonards Church in Southoe, where his grandparents are also buried, and this is where he was relocated to during the Second World War WWII and an area that he knew well.  Career  His professional driving career spans four decades, in 2000 chalking up his 600th win in a race at Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit, Norfolk in an Aston Martin DB4. His first Sprint victory was in 1963 driving a Mini, with his first race win following in 1964 (again in a Mini) and his last (and 625th) on 11 September 2004. He is probably best remembered for his flamboyant and crowd-pleasing style during the 1970s driving for Dealer Team Vauxhall in the racing Firenzas \\"Old Nail\\" and \\"Baby Bertha\\", and also the V8 Holden-Repco Ventora, \\"Big Bertha\\". He also won the 1971 Escort Mexico championship, beating future Formula 1 World Champion Jody Scheckter and finished 2nd in the 1974 Avon Tour of Britain driving for the same team as the equally respected rally driver Roger Clark. Marshall's style has been described as \\"sideways, on-the-edge cornering that was to distinguish his driving in any car, large or small, front or rear drive.\\" This outward appearance belied an extraordinary cool-headed ability and intelligence behind the wheel. His first biography, published in 1978, is titled Only Here For The Beer and a tribute edition was re-issued shortly after his death and his new biography (published by Haynes and written by Jeremy Walton and Gregor Marshall) was released in April 2010 and was great success. He died of a heart related illness whilst testing the ex-Richard Petty's IROC Chevrolet Camaro at Silverstone. His son, Gregor, is also a race driver and he also has two daughters. Some of Gerry's career highlights:- In 1963, Gerry started his first footsteps into motor journalism, something he was to enjoy for many years and he brought a smile to the face of many a reader with his \\"Marshall Art\\" and \\"From the Hot Seat\\" columns that he regularly used to write. You could often find club event reports in Autosport with glowing tributes to a Gerry Marshall and then notice at the end of the report that it was written by a certain GDRM, G.Marshall or G.Maynard (his first wife's maiden name!!). Gerry's first official race was at Brands Hatch in March 1964 and in qualifying he was quickest in his class, but the weather (for once) and lady luck conspired against him and the race was snowed off. Therefore, Gerry's first proper race was at Snetterton on the Easter Monday of 1964. Beginning what would quickly become a habit, he won the 1000cc class and continued winning that season. Although he rolled the car at Mallory Park in practice he was able to keep racing until money and impending engagement (to Carol) forced the sale of the Mini and absence from the tracks for a few months. But not for long‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Driving Newtune's 1275s in the Snetterton 500 km with David Warnsborough the pair won the 1300 cc class in the European Saloon Car Championship race. Whilst working in London for Robbie Gordon and James Boothby he was offered a drive in June 1965 in a TVR Grantura. Gerry handled this with his usual verve and impressed Martin Lilley of Barnet Motor Company enough for him to offer a drive in a Lotus Elan and Gerry also went to work for the Barnet Motor Company, becoming sales manager and a director of TVR. This change for Gerry proved to be a good one and as the sales manager he got to buy and sell many sports, GT and competition cars. Towards the end of 1965 and at the beginning of 1966 Gerry had a string of wins at Brands Hatch and also drove the company's TVR Griffith. It was reported at the time \\"This was a converted road car and only had a mildly-tweaked V8 motor, but it still went like stink!\\". With this car Gerry enhanced his blossoming reputation and photographers rushed out of their usual hiding spots whenever he was on track and got dramatic pictures of Gerry driving the TVR in his now customary sideways fashion. \\"It was the only way to drive the car\\" said Gerry, \\"although the Elan had to be driven neatly\\". Also in 1966 Gerry raced Roy Ensor's 1275 Mini-Cooper S and a near-standard TVR 1800S Mk 3 in marque events, with some success. In the Brands Hatch six-hour race the car was very well placed when a wheel fell off with only a few minutes to go. Gerry and co-driver, his great friend Tony Lanfranchi, had got the car extremely well-placed whilst it was wet at the beginning of the race and it was only towards the end of the race when the track started to dry that several more potent cars managed to pass them. \\"The meeting Gerry Marshall will want to forget\\" was the headline Auto News gave for a Brands Hatch sprint in the July. On a wet track Gerry had aquaplaned off the circuit at Paddock Hill Bend and pretty much wrote off the Barnet Motor Company's Elan, which had only been raced a handful of times. Gerry didn't let this worry him and just a week later, with a couple of broken ribs strapped up, Gerry raced a TVR at Silverstone in the Six-Hour Relay Race and probably wished he hadn't, as he lost a wheel, twice! All in all 1966 was a successful year for Gerry. He won numerous club races and gained a massive amount of publicity for the Barnet Motor Company. With Martin Lilley now being in charge of TVR Engineering (him and his father had rescued TVR from bankruptcy) Gerry's racing plans for 1967 seemed to naturally revolve around TVR; the TVR Griffith was ideal, especially with the planned 400 bhp 5.3 litre Ford V8, there was the possibility of the 1-litre TVR Tina (named after Gerry's eldest daughter and one of the two prototypes is owned by the Marshall family) and also the TVR 1800S. In addition Gerry had the use of a Lotus Elan and there was a plan to go into partnership with Ken Ayres in a hot Mini 850. Gerry also wanted to prove his \\"sideways\\" critics wrong by racing a single- seater and in one of the Motor Racing Stables Lotus cars at Brands Hatch he had already lapped as fast as the senior instructors (I'm sure that cost Lanfranchi a beer or two!!). Whatever Gerry was due to drive in 1967, you could be sure that he'd be thoroughly enjoying himself. As reported in Sporting Motorist \\"Gerry Marshall really gets to grips with his motor cars and flings them about with such gay abandon that people expect him to fly off the road ‚Äì he has been named the Jochen Rindt of club racing, also the Mr. Dunlop Benefit (by commentator Barry Simons) but he rarely does and more often than not wins\\". 1967 saw the beginning of the Vauxhall relationship and not wanting to go over what's written in Only Here for the Beer I hope we have provided a little bit more information about Gerry's beginnings in motorsport and his racing in the 1960s. The 1970s really were Gerry's most prolific decade of motor racing. Club motor racing in Britain then was on the BBC every week (on Grandstand) and you always knew that if you saw Gerry lining up and Murray Walker commentating you would be in for a fun Saturday or Sunday afternoon. It has always been widely reported that Gerry was not shy and retiring and this made him ideal for interviews, quotes, guest speaking at club and charity events and columns (he wrote in Car and Car Conversions, Motor and Autosport). He even had several films made, most notably Barry Hinchcliff's \\"There's Only One Gerry\\" and of course the publications of Only Here for the Beer and Competition Driving. Not only was there the numerous race and championship wins for Gerry in the DTV Vauxhalls but there was also his own forays into racing cars of his own (when DTV commitments didn't clash), sponsoring others (including F1 World Champion Denis Hulme, Tony Lanfranchi and even offering Colin Chapman and Graham Hill a drive in Gerry's Lotus XI!) and his blossoming business, Marshall Wingfield, in partnership with John Wingfield. Gerry also won the final car meeting to be held at Crystal Palace in 1972. Run by AMOC, the final race was a Historic Sports Car race. Gerry won in a Lister Jaguar, WTM446. Gerry raced Lotus Elans, the special Costin Amigo, Ford Escorts (winning the inaugural Mexico Championship from Jody Scheckter in 1971 and also finishing runner up to Roger Clark in the 1974 Avon Tour of Britain), Lola T70, Holden Torana at Bathurst, Hillman Avenger, Clan Crusader, Austin Marina, Birdcage Maserati, Mk2 Jaguar, Sunbeam Tiger Le Mans, Porsche 924, an Alfa Romeo, Chevrolet Camaro and BMWs. Gerry competed in hundreds of events, ranging from the one-make Ford Escort Mexico Championship, competed in many rallies (including second to Roger Clark in a Ford Escort in the '74 Avon Tour of Britain). When in 1977 DTV and Vauxhall decided to go rallying everyone thought Gerry would be okay and there were rumours flying around of offers and deals involving Ford and Leyland products. The truth for '78 was somewhat different and he managed to scrape a deal together to race Colin Vandervell's '77 spec Ford Capri for the national Tricentrol championship and a Triumph Dolomite Sprint for the two production car championships, the Derwent TV/Shellsport and the Britax championships, with both cars being sponsored by Triplex, who were Colin's sponsor but due to work commitments he wouldn't be competing in '78. Gerry asked if Triplex would be prepared to throw in a few extra bob for the Dolomite. The Dolomite was prepared by Roger Dowson and Alistair Barrie under the Downie racing banner and the Capri was prepared by John Westwood. The Dolomite turned out to be the far more successful of the two cars with 21class wins and three second places from 25 starts, with Gerry winning both the Derwent TV/Shellsport and the Britax championships in the Dolomite. The Capri driving was not the success that Gerry had hope, with the Tricentrol Championship costing more than anticipated and the only result of note was the start of the season, in the wet at the International Trophy at Silverstone, when he finished first in class and second overall. There were other flashes of brilliance but bad luck always seemed to prevail, like when leading at Donington when the gearlever broke off. The start of the 1979 season looked promising, with Gerry forming GMR (Gerry Marshall Racing) in partnership with Roger Dowson to run two Triumph Dolomites in the Group 1 RAC Tricentrol Championship (with Rex Greenslade in the second car) and one car in both the Production Saloon car championships (which had both been one the season before). Both cars had continued sponsorship from Triplex and new deals with Esso, Motor and significant backing from BL Motorsport. Also, the engines were being prepared by Don Moore, who also built the engine for Gerry's Lister Jaguar for the Lloyds & Scottish series. 1979 was also the first season Gerry really started preparing cars for other people with GMR. Things started well and even though being in a lower class he managed to battle for outright wins. There was also the accolade of John Webb and the BARC organising the Gerry Marshall Benefit Races at Brands Hatch and sharing the Dolomite with Roger Clark at the TT event at Silverstone and all seemed to be going well with Gerry really being at the height of his career when disaster struck at the Grand Prix support race in the July of '79 which was supposed to be the highlight of the year, with good rides in the Dolomite and Lister Jaguar. \\"As the Capris stormed off on their second lap, one of the nastiest accidents in recent saloon racing befell Gerry Marshall. Almost flat out down the straight from Stowe to Club, Marshall was fractionally ahead of Walkinshaw's Mazda and keen to stop him moving up to challenge class leader Greenslade. A few feet before the 100yds marker board, the two cars touched and Marshall was launched into a series of rolls, the severely damaged Sprint landing in the catch fencing at Club\\" Autosport, 19 July 1979. Gerry would have been travelling over 100 mph and was extremely lucky to survive. During the accident, the sheer force made his helmet come off (still intact and fastened) and the mountings of his seat had broken, which meant he was thrown around the inside of the car, unprotected. He was knocked unconscious, had severe lacerations to his face and head (needing over 100 stitches), had three fractures to his skull, cracked ribs, damaged jaw, teeth, kidneys and damage to his back and spine (these plagued him through the rest of his life). As bad as this was, the doctors told him if his helmet hadn't of come off he would probably have broken his neck. Remarkably he was out of hospital in ten days and back behind the wheel of a Dolomite and his Lister in the August Bank Holiday races at Brands Hatch and before the season was out he was back to winning ways, looking forward to the eighties and the possibility of more to come with his relationship with British Leyland. For the 1980s Gerry decided to retire from full-time Group One racing as he wasn't happy with the current regulations and there was a disagreement with British Leyland. He therefore decided to concentrate on his racing team and Productions Saloons and also re-kindled his love affair for Historic racing. He won various Production Saloon Championships (Wilcomatic, Monroe Shock Absorbers, etc.) and drove an even more diverse range of cars than ever before (also winning the Lloyds and Scottish Championship. More racing (and winning) followed in the 1990s, notably in the TVR Tuscans (narrowly missing the title in 1991 due to political moves) and also the famous Marsh Plant Aston Martins. Gerry also found time to squeeze himself into the Multisport Van Dieman and Caterham Vauxhall for various one-off drives and a return to Production Saloons in Sierra and Sierra Sapphire Cosworths. There were more historic outings in Jaguar E-Types, Austin-Healey 3000, Austin-Healey 100S, Chevrolet Corvettes, Ford Anglia, Lotus Cortinas, Ford Mustangs and who will forget his drive in the rain at the 1999 Goodwood Revival St Marys Trophy race, narrowly beating another saloon car legend John Rhodes. This drive also netted Gerry the coveted driver of the day award. 2000 was a great year for Gerry, on 6 August he scored his 600th win at Snetterton in the Marsh Plant Aston Martin DB4 and also made a return to racing a Vauxhall Firenza, driving one of the original 1974 Thruxton racecar Droop Snoots. There was also a reunion with Baby Bertha at the 2001 Goodwood Festival of Speed (as well as 2002/3 and several other demonstration runs). Gerry continued to race with forays into Europe, as well as various British event. There were also outings at the Goodwood Revival in Mk1 Jaguars, Chevrolet Corvettes and Austin-Healey 100s, plus an Alvis Grey Lady and Ferrari 330LM that he shared with Ivan Dutton and Peter Hardman at the 2004 Revival, with his last race at Silverstone in November 2004.

She was among the leading female rhythm and blues singers of the 1940s, with a sensual soprano voice. Gospel singer R.H. Harris has lauded her voice, and her interpretation of religious songs Life and career Originally named Lillian Green or Lillie May Johnson, she was born in Mississippi. After the early deaths of her parents, she began performing in her teens and, having (like many African- American singers) honed her craft in the church performing gospel, she sang in Mississippi jukes, before heading to Chicago, Illinois, in 1929, where she would make all of her recordings. Green was noted for superb timing and a distinctively sinuous voice. She was reportedly 18 when she recorded her first session for the 35-cent Bluebird subsidiary of RCA. In the 1930s she and Big Bill Broonzy had a nightclub act together. Her two biggest hits were her own composition \\"Romance in the Dark\\" (1940), which was later covered by many artists, such as Dinah Washington and Nina Simone (in 1967) (Billie Holiday recorded a different song with the same title), and Green's 1941 version of Kansas Joe McCoy's minor-key blues- and jazz-influenced song \\"Why Don't You Do Right?\\", which was covered by Peggy Lee in 1942 and many others since. As well as performing in Chicago nightclubs, Green toured with Tiny Bradshaw and other bands but never broke away from the black theatre circuit. By 1949, Green had changed direction with the foresight to become a jazz vocalist, and tried to emulate the Jazz style of Billie Holiday. She signed with Atlantic Records in 1951, but at this point was already in poor health. She died of pneumonia in Chicago in 1954 and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, in Gary, Indiana.

In mathematics, a function f from a topological space A to a set B is called locally constant, if for every a in A there exists a neighborhood U of a, such that f is constant on U. Every constant function is locally constant. Every locally constant function from the real numbers R to R is constant, by the connectedness of R. But the function f from the rationals Q to R, defined by f(x) = 0 for x < œÄ, and f(x) = 1 for x > œÄ, is locally constant (here we use the fact that œÄ is irrational and that therefore the two sets {x‚ààQ : x < œÄ} and {x‚ààQ : x > œÄ} are both open in Q). If f : A ‚Üí B is locally constant, then it is constant on any connected component of A. The converse is true for locally connected spaces (where the connected components are open). Further examples include the following: * Given a covering map p : C ‚Üí X, then to each point x of X we can assign the cardinality of the fiber p‚àí1(x) over x; this assignment is locally constant. * A map from a topological space A to a discrete space B is continuous if and only if it is locally constant. Connection with sheaf theory There are sheaves of locally constant functions on X. To be more definite, the locally constant integer- valued functions on X form a sheaf in the sense that for each open set U of X we can form the functions of this kind; and then verify that the sheaf axioms hold for this construction, giving us a sheaf of abelian groups (even commutative rings). This sheaf could be written ZX; described by means of stalks we have stalk Zx, a copy of Z at x, for each x in X. This can be referred to a constant sheaf, meaning exactly sheaf of locally constant functions taking their values in the (same) group. The typical sheaf of course isn't constant in this way; but the construction is useful in linking up sheaf cohomology with homology theory, and in logical applications of sheaves. The idea of local coefficient system is that we can have a theory of sheaves that locally look like such 'harmless' sheaves (near any x), but from a global point of view exhibit some 'twisting'.

The core of the family is considered to be established, but its boundaries and overall membership are uncertain. The languages are spoken by around 3 million people. There have been three main proposals as to its internal classification. History of the proposal Although Papuan languages for the most part are poorly documented, several of the branches of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea have been recognized for some time. The Eleman languages were first proposed by S. Ray in 1907, parts of Marind were recognized by Ray and JHP Murray in 1918, and the Rai Coast languages in 1919, again by Ray. The precursor of the Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea family was Stephen Wurm's 1960 proposal of an East New Guinea Highlands family. Although broken up by Malcolm Ross in 2005, it united different branches of what became TNG for the first time, linking Engan, Chimbu‚ÄìWahgi, Goroka, and Kainantu. (Duna and Kalam were added in 1971.) Then in 1970 Clemens Voorhoeve and Kenneth McElhanon noted 91 lexical resemblances between the Central and South New Guinea (CSNG) and Finisterre‚ÄìHuon families, which they had respectively established a few years earlier. Although they did not work out regular sound correspondences, and so could not distinguish between cognates due to genealogical relationship, cognates due to borrowing, and chance resemblances, their research was taken seriously. They chose the name Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea because this new family was the first to span New Guinea, from the Bomberai Peninsula of western West Irian to the Huon Peninsula of eastern PNG. They also noted possible cognates in other families Wurm would later add to TNG: Wurm's East New Guinea Highlands, Binandere in the 'Bird's Tail' of PNG, and two families that John Z'graggen would later (1971, 1975) unite in his 100-language Madang‚ÄìAdelbert Range family. In 1975 Wurm accepted Voorhoeve and McElhanon's suspicions about further connections, as well as Z'graggen's work, and postulated additional links to, among others, the languages of the island of Timor to the west of New Guinea, Angan, Goilalan, Koiarian, Dagan, Eleman, Wissel Lakes, the erstwhile Dani-Kwerba family, and the erstwhile Trans- Fly‚ÄìBulaka River family (which he had established in 1970), expanding TNG into an enormous language phylum that covered most of the island of New Guinea, as well as Timor and neighboring islands, and included over 500 languages spoken by some 2 300 000 people. However, part of the evidence for this was typological, and Wurm stated that he did not expect it to stand up well to scrutiny. Although he based the phylum on characteristic personal pronouns, several of the branches had no pronouns in common with the rest of the family, or even had pronouns related to non-TNG families, but were included because they were grammatically similar to TNG. Other families that had typical TNG pronouns were excluded because they did not resemble other TNG families in their grammatical structure. Because grammatical typology is readily borrowed‚Äîmany of the Austronesian languages in New Guinea have grammatical structures similar to their Papuan neighbors, for example, and conversely many Papuan languages resemble typical Austronesian languages typologically‚Äîother linguists were skeptical. William A. Foley rejected Wurm's and even some of Voorhoeve's results, and broke much of TNG into its constituent parts: several dozen small but clearly valid families, plus a number of apparent isolates. In 2005 Malcolm Ross published a draft proposal re-evaluating Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea, and found what he believed to be overwhelming evidence for a reduced version of the phylum, based solely on lexical resemblances, which retained as much as 85% of Wurm's hypothesis, though some of it tentatively. The strongest lexical evidence for any language family is shared morphological paradigms, especially highly irregular or suppletive paradigms with bound morphology, because these are extremely resistant to borrowing. For example, if the only recorded German words were gut \\"good\\" and besser \\"better\\", that alone would be enough to demonstrate that in all probability German was related to English. However, because of the great morphological complexity of many Papuan languages, and the poor state of documentation of nearly all, in New Guinea this approach is essentially restricted to comparing pronouns. Ross reconstructed pronouns sets for Foley's basic families and compared these reconstructions, rather than using a direct mass comparison of all Papuan languages; attempted to then reconstruct the ancestral pronouns of the proto-Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea language, such as *ni \\"we\\", *≈ãgi \\"you\\", *i \\"they\\"; and then compared poorly supported branches directly to this reconstruction. Families required two apparent cognates to be included. However, if any language in a family was a match, the family was considered a match, greatly increasing the likelihood of coincidental resemblances, and because the plural forms are related to the singular forms, a match of 1sg and 1pl, although satisfying Ross's requirement of two matches, is not actually two independent matches, again increasing the likelihood of spurious matches. In addition, Ross counted forms like *a as a match to 2sg *ga, so that all counted as matches to *ga. And although and occur in Papuan pronouns at twice the level expected by their occurrence in pronouns elsewhere in the world, they do not correlate with each other as they would if they reflected a language family. That is, it is argued that Ross's pronouns do not support the validity of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea, and do not reveal which families might belong to it.Harald Hammarstr√∂m (2012) \\"Pronouns and the (Preliminary) Classification of Papuan languages\\", Journal of the Linguistic Society of Papua New Guinea Ross also included in his proposal several better- attested families for non-pronominal evidence, despite a lack of pronouns common to other branches of TNG, and he suggested that there may be other families that would have been included if they had been better attested. Several additional families are only tentatively linked to TNG. Because the boundaries of Ross's proposal are based primarily on a single parameter, the pronouns, all internal structure remains tentative. The languages TNG is strongly associated with the New Guinea Highlands (red), and may have spread with the spread of highland agriculture starting c. 10,000 BP, probably in the east, and only more recently south of the highlands. Most TNG languages are spoken by only a few thousand people, with only seven (Melpa, Kuman, Enga, Huli, Western Dani, Makasae, and Ekari) being spoken by more than 100,000. The most populous language outside of mainland New Guinea is Makasae of East Timor, with 100,000 speakers throughout the eastern part of the country. Enga is the most populous Trans-New Guinea language spoken in New Guinea, with more than 200,000 speakers. Golin, Sinasina, Mid Grand Valley Dani, Kamano, and Bunaq have between 50,000-100,000 speakers (Galela of Halmahera, usually not classified as Trans-New Guinea, also has between 50,000-100,000 speakers.) All other Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea languages have fewer than 50,000 speakers. The greatest linguistic diversity in Ross's Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea proposal, and therefore perhaps the location of the proto-Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea homeland, is in the interior highlands of Papua New Guinea, in the central-to-eastern New Guinea cordillera where Wurm first posited his East New Guinea Highlands family. Indonesian Papua and the Papuan Peninsula of Papua New Guinea (the \\"bird's tail\\") have fewer and more widely extended branches of TNG, and were therefore likely settled by TNG speakers after the proto-language broke up. Ross speculates that the TNG family may have spread with the high population densities that resulted from the domestication of taro, settling quickly in the highland valleys along the length of the cordillera but spreading much more slowly into the malarial lowlands, and not at all into areas such as the Sepik River valley where the people already had yam agriculture, which thus supported high population densities. Ross suggests that TNG may have arrived at its western limit, the islands near Timor, perhaps four to 4.5 thousand years ago, before the expansion of Austronesian into this area. Roger Blench associates the spread of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea languages with the domestication of the banana.Roger Blench (2017) \\"Things your classics master never told you: a borrowing from Trans New Guinea languages into Latin\\", McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research Classification =Wurm (1975)= The classification here follows Wurm, and includes some later modifications to his 1975 proposal.Wurm's classification at MultiTree Wurm identifies the subdivisions of his Papuan classification as families (on the order of relatedness of the Germanic languages), stocks (on the order of the Indo- European languages), and phyla (on the order of the Nostratic hypothesis). Trans-New Guinea is a phylum in this terminology. A language that is not related to any other at a family level or below is called an isolate in this scheme.

Foley accepted the core of TNG: \\"The fact, for example, that a great swath of languages in New Guinea from the Huon Peninsula to the highlands of Irian Jaya mark the object of a transitive verb with a set of verbal prefixes, a first person singular in /n/ and second person singular in a velar stop, is overwhelming evidence that these languages are all genetically related; the likelihood of such a system being borrowed vanishingly small.\\"DELP: Papuan languages He considered the relationship between the Finisterre‚ÄìHuon, Eastern Highlands (Kainantu‚ÄìGorokan), and Irian Highlands (Dani ‚Äì Paniai Lakes) families (and presumably some other smaller ones) to be established, and said that it is \\"highly likely\\" that the Madang family belongs as well. He considered it possible but not yet demonstrated that the Enga, Chimbu, Binandere, Angan, Ok, Awyu, Asmat (perhaps closest to Ok and Awyu), Mek, Sentani and the seven small language families of the tail of Papua New Guinea (Koiarian, Goilalan, etc., which he maintains have not been shown to be closely related to each other) may belong to TNG as well. =Ross (2005)= thumbThe various families constituting Malcolm Ross' conception of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea. The greatest TNG diversity is in the eastern highlands. (After Ross 2005.) Irian Jaya, W to E PNG highlands, W to E Southern PNG, E to W * Mor, Tanah Merah, Dem, Uhunduni, Oksapmin, Wiru, Pawaia, Kamula, Moraori, Mombum Ross does not use specialized terms for different levels of classification as Donald Laycock and Stephen Wurm did. In the list given here, the uncontroversial families that are accepted by Foley and other Papuanists and that are the building blocks of Ross's TNG are printed in boldface. Language isolates are printed in italics. Ross removed about 100 languages from Wurm's proposal, and only tentatively retained a few dozen more, but in one instance he added a language, the isolate Porome. Ross did not have sufficient evidence to classify all Papuan groups. In addition, the classification is based on a single feature ‚Äì shared pronouns, especially 1sg and 2sg ‚Äì and thus is subject to false positives as well as to missing branches that have undergone significant sound changes, since he does not have the data to establish regular sound correspondences. ;Unclassified Wurmian languages Although Ross based his classification on pronoun systems, many languages in New Guinea are too poorly documented for even this to work. Thus there are several isolates that were placed in TNG by Wurm but that cannot be addressed by Ross's classification. A few of them (Komyandaret, Samarokena, and maybe Kenati) have since been assigned to existing branches (or ex-branches) of TNG, whereas others (Massep, Momuna) continue to defy classification. * Kenati (‚Üí Kainantu?) * Komyandaret (‚Üí Greater Awyu) * Massep isolate * Molof isolate * Momuna family (2) * Samarokena (‚Üí Kwerba) * Tofamna isolate * Usku isolate ;Reclassified Wurmian languages Ross removed 95 languages from TNG.

Additional families may eventually prove to belong as well, as Usher has initially excluded any that don't have a regular reflex of the 2sg pronoun. Timothy Usher has reconstructed lowel-level constituents of Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea to verify, through the establishment of regular sound changes, which purported members truly belong to it, and to determine their subclassification. In many cases Usher has created new names for the member families to reflect their geographic location. Much of his classification is accepted by Glottolog (though his names are not, as Glottolog invents its own names). As of 2020, his classification is as follows, including correspondences to the names in earlier classifications. He expects to expand the membership of the family as reconstruction proceeds.NewGuineaWorld, Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea *Berau Gulf **Mor **North Berau Gulf (= South Bird's Head) ***Yabin ***South Bird's Head (= nuclear South Bird's Head plus Inanwatan) **West Bomberai (incl.

The families from the Ross and Glottolog classifications that are not included are Kaure, Pauwasi, Engan, Chimbu‚ÄìWahgi, Madang, Eleman, Kiwaian, Binanderean, Goilalan, and the several Papuan Gulf families. Usher only includes families that have a regular reflex of the 2sg pronoun, so there may be additional TNG families that have changed their pronouns. Lexical semantics A number of colexification patterns (called ‚Äòsemantic conflations‚Äô by Donald Laycock), particularly in the nominal domain, are commonly found among Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea languages: *[man, husband] *[woman, wife] *[bird, bat] *[hair, fur, feather, leaf] *[tree, firewood, fire] *[water, river] *[bark, skin of animal, peel or skin of fruit] *[bark, skin, body] *[egg, fruit, seed; some other round objects, e.g. kidney, eye, heart] *[hand, foreleg of quadruped, wing] *[heart, seat of emotions] *[blood, red] *[garden, work], [to make gardens, to work] *[joint, elbow, knee] *[milk, sap, semen, white of egg, bone marrow] *[nose, face] *[teeth, internal mouth] *[leg, foot, hindleg] *[finger, toe] *[father, owner; mother, owner] Proto-language See also *Indo-Pacific languages *Proto-Trans-New Guinea reconstructions (Wiktionary) References Bibliography  External links *TransNewGuinea.org - database of the languages of New Guinea (by Simon Greenhill) *Timothy Usher's Newguineaworld site Proposed language families Language families Languages of Indonesia Languages of Papua New Guinea Papuan languages ","title":"Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea languages"},{"id":"295641","text":"Firaxis Games, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Sparks, Maryland. The company was founded in May 1996 by Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds following their departure from MicroProse, Meier's earlier venture. They were acquired by Take-Two Interactive in August 2005, and subsequently became part of the publisher's 2K label. Firaxis Games is best known for developing the Civilization and XCOM series, as well as many other games bearing Meier's name.  History  Executive Plaza III on 11350 McCormick Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland, home to Firaxis Games' former headquarters Firaxis Software was founded on May 1, 1996, by Sid Meier, Brian Reynolds and Jeff Briggs, three video game designers formerly employed by MicroProse, a video game venture founded by Meier and partner Bill Stealey in 1982. The name \\"Firaxis\\", a portmanteau of \\"fiery\\" and \\"axis\\", was derived from the name of an eponymous piece of music created by Briggs. Briggs explained that they decided to stay in the Baltimore area, rather than moving to Silicon Valley, because it was \\"just a great place to be\\". Unlike MicroProse, Firaxis Software aimed at being a \\"design house\\", leaving manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their games to outside contractors. As such, the company talked to six potential video game publishers for their games, and finally signed an agreement with Electronic Arts, through which their games would be distributed under Electronic Arts' Origin Systems label. The studio's opening was announced on June 24, 1996. Firaxis Software was originally located in a 2,500-square-foot office on Gilroy Road in Hunt Valley, Maryland, temporarily sharing office space. To accommodate their growth, in February 1997, they announced that they were moving their corporate headquarters to a 7,200-square-foot office suite in Executive Plaza III, an office building on 11350 McCormick Road and part of the Hunt Valley Business Community. The deal, assisted by MacKenzie/O'Conor, Piper & Flynn Commercial Real Estate Services broker William W. Whitty Jr., was expected to be completed by March that year. The company had 13 employees at the time. Firaxis Software announced their first title, Sid Meier's Gettysburg!, in June 1997. Interimly, on July 24, 1997, the company was legally renamed Firaxis Games. Electronic Arts announced to have acquired a minority interest in Firaxis Games, to undisclosed terms, in August 1997. By September 1997, Firaxis Games signed life insurances for its three founders. Gettysburg! was released in October 1997 to critical and commercial success, scoring near-perfect reviews from critics, and selling 200,000 copies by August 1999. Starting with Gettysburg!, Firaxis Games prefixed all games designed by Meier with \\"Sid Meier's\\", a trend the three founders carried over from MicroProse, as they believed that Meier's name added more recognizability to their games. For his works on many MicroProse games, as well as Gettysburg! and Firaxis Games' second title, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Meier became the second-ever person in the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences's Hall of Fame, following Shigeru Miyamoto. Co-founder Reynolds left Firaxis Games to pursue his personal interests in February 2000. To compensate his departure, the company started hiring various industry veterans by March 2000. For his executive engagement at Firaxis Games, co-founder and chief executive officer Briggs was named \\"CEO of the Year\\" by SamrtCEO Magazine in October 2004. Briggs later left the company in November 2006, and was succeeded by Steve Martin. Also for his executive work at Firaxis Games, Martin was awarded the \\"Maryland International Business Leadership Award\\" by the World Trade Center Institute in March 2011. In November 2004, Infogrames, at the time owner of the Civilization franchise and parent to the series' publisher, sold all intellectual property (IP) to an undisclosed buyer for . The buyer was announced to be Take-Two Interactive on January 26, 2005. The publisher announced that the franchise would be managed by their 2K label, which was founded the day before, and that Firaxis Games would stay in charge of the series' development. In March 2005, NDL announced a partnership with Firaxis Games, wherein their Gamebryo engine would be used for the development of Civilization IV, which was to be released later that year. On November 7, 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced that they had acquired Firaxis Games. Through the deal, Firaxis Games became part of 2K, although its present management and development plans would stay intact. Meier and Briggs both expressed that the acquisition saw a great opportunity for Firaxis Games in terms of creative development and marketing capabilities, and were fortunate to have re-gained full control over the Civilization franchise. In April 2007, Soren Johnson, lead designer on Civilization IV, left the company to move to Maxis and work on Spore. Similarly, Civilization V lead designer Jon Shafer departed following the game's release, in December 2010. In August 2014, Firaxis Games announced Firaxicon, a convention dedicated to Firaxis games. The event was held from September 27 to 28, 2014, at a hotel in Hunt Valley, and included meet and greets with the company's staff, a presentation titled \\"An Evening with Sid Meier\\", and early playtests of Civilization: Beyond Earth. A tour of Firaxis Games' offices was also held at the event. The event was renewed for a second edition in July 2015, and held on October 3, 2015, at the Baltimore Convention Center. Events were similar to that of the 2014 event, with XCOM 2 and Civilization: Beyond Earth ‚Äì Rising Tide up for early testing. By December 2015, Firaxis Games expanded their Sparks headquarters, which they moved to in 2009, to 40,000 square feet (3,700 m¬≤), and employed 40 new staff, totaling to 180 employees present at the company. In June 2016, at the Games for Change festival, Firaxis Games announced that they had partnered with GlassLab to develop CivilizationEDU, an educational derivative of Civilization V optimized for classrooms. On July 23, 2018, David Ismailer of 2K confirmed that Firaxis Games was working on a new IP.

Incumbents * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammed Daoud Khan April 1961 Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan visits the Soviet Union at the personal invitation of Nikita Khrushchev. They issue a statement of full mutual understanding and identity of long-range views. June 1961 Mohammad Daud announces that his government seeks $700 million in aid from the United States and the U.S.S.R. to implement the second five- year plan, which aims at an increase of 8% to 10% annually in the national income over the plan period. Industrial production is to rise 375% and investment 500%. Late August 1961 Due to the controversy over Pakhtunistan (or Pathanistan; the Afghan demand for self-determination for about 7,000,000 members of border tribes), the Pakistan government closes Afghan consulates and trade missions in its territory. Afghanistan thereupon sets September 6, 1961, as a deadline for Pakistan to rescind the order. Pakistan does not. September 1961 On September 3, 1961 Afghanistan seals its side of the border and on September 6, 1961, breaks relations. The consequences are far- reaching, as Afghanistan then demands that all trade, including U.S. economic aid, be channeled through Soviet access routes. Sixty percent of the Afghan population is Pakhtun (Pathan) and Afghanistan has steadfastly refused to accept the old Afghan-British Durand line of 1893 as a suitable permanent boundary between the Pathans of Afghanistan and of Pakistan, while Pakistan refused to draw a new frontier. Throughout 1961 the two nations exchanged charges, Afghanistan saying that Pakistan brutally suppressed tribal leaders and bombed them with U.S.-made aircraft, while Pakistan alleged that Afghan armed forces, using Soviet equipment, constantly violated the border. The Afghan representative to the United Nations, A.R. Pazhwak, strongly defended the concept of Pathan self-determination. Afghanistan completes its first five-year plan, with some sectors described as over-fulfilled. Daud attends the Belgrade conference of non-aligned nations, visiting Britain and West Germany first.

P. Herbert or simply A. P. H., was an English humorist, novelist, playwright and law reform activist, and an Independent Member of Parliament for Oxford University from 1935 until 1950, when university constituencies were abolished. Born in Ashtead, Surrey, Herbert attended Winchester College and New College, Oxford, graduating as a first in Jurisprudence in 1914. He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an ordinary seaman in World War I, later serving as an officer with the Royal Naval Division. He fought in Gallipoli and on the Western Front, becoming battalion adjutant in 1917, before injury excluded him from the front line. After the war, he published The Secret Battle and joined the staff of Punch in 1924. He also wrote librettos for musicals. Elected as Independent MP for Oxford University in the 1935 general election, Herbert campaigned for private member's rights, piloted the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 through Parliament, opposed the Entertainments Duty, and campaigned against the Oxford Group. He joined the River Emergency Service in 1938 and served in World War II as a petty officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. He captained his river boat, the Water Gipsy, on the River Thames. In 1943, he joined a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the Dominion of Newfoundland. Early life and education Herbert was born at Ashtead Lodge, Ashtead, Surrey, on 24 September 1890. His father, Patrick Herbert Coghlan Herbert (1849‚Äì1915), was a civil servant (assistant secretary of the Judicial and Public Department)The India List and India Office List, p. 519.A. P. Herbert: A Biography, Reginald Pound, 1976, p. 17. in the India Office, of Irish origin, and his mother, Beatrice Eugenie (n√©e Selwyn), was the daughter of Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn, a Lord Justice of Appeal.Pound, pp. 16‚Äì17. He had two younger brothers, both of whom died in battle ‚Äì Owen William Eugene, 2nd lieutenant, Royal Field Artillery, killed at Mons in 1914, and Sidney Jasper, captain R.N., killed 1941 aboard HMS Hood. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was eight years old, shortly before he left to attend The Grange in Folkestone, a preparatory school.Pound, pp. 21‚Äì22. Herbert then attended Winchester College, where he won the King's Medal for English Verse and the King's Medal for English Speech, which was presented by H. H. Asquith, Prime Minister at the time. He took an active part in the College's debating society and Shakespeare society. As a Winchester student, Herbert sent verses to the offices of Punch and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor, Owen Seaman. Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the College's three football divisions.Pound, pp. 22‚Äì26. From Winchester, Herbert went to New College, Oxford as an Exhibitioner. He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the Tariff Reform League, speaking extempore on home rule. His first contribution to Punch was printed on 24 August 1910, being a set of verses with the title \\"Stones of Venus\\". Herbert went up to Oxford in October and made his first speech at the Oxford Union in November. His work began appearing not only in Punch, but in The Observer, the Pall Mall Gazette and Vanity Fair.Pound, pp. 25‚Äì33. Herbert received a \\"not very good Second\\" in Honour Moderations, and apparently disenchanted with Classics, changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with Walter Monckton and others and was also good friends with the notables Duff Cooper, Harold Macmillan and Philip Guedalla. Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914 with \\"a very good First\\" in Jurisprudence. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at Oxford House in Bethnal Green for a year. He spent the time \\"doing what I could:\\" washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money.Pound, pp. 33‚Äì36. First World War service, 1914‚Äì1918 On 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an ordinary seaman in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, which later became one of the constituent bodies of the Royal Naval Division. In early October, the news reached him that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted \\"missing, believed killed\\" in the retreat from Mons. Herbert reached the rank of acting leading seaman before being commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division).Pound, pp. 40‚Äì43. \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" companies of the Hawke Battalion departed for Gallipoli in early 1915, briefly stopping in Malta, before arriving at the Moudros on 17 May. The battalion finally arrived at Gallipoli on 27 May. Herbert was put in command of No. 11 Platoon, \\"C\\" Company, which was composed mostly of Tynesiders and also two men from a remote Durham mining town. A week after his arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the Third Battle of Krithia. In July 1915, Herbert went down with an illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed \\"fit for light duty\\", he was seconded to the Naval Intelligence Division at Whitehall. It was at this time that he decided to begin renting 12 Hammersmith Terrace as a dwelling.Pound, pp. 43‚Äì39. Soldiers of the Royal Naval Division training to leave a trench during Gallipoli, 1915 In summer 1916, when he was passed fit for duty, Herbert returned to Hawke Battalion at their base camp in Abbeville, where he was made assistant adjutant. The battalion moved to the front line at Souchez in July 1916, and in mid-November it took part in an attack on Beaucourt during the Battle of the Ancre, which saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers who came out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at Pozi√®res in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion's adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on Gavrelle, west of Arras.Pound, pp. 50‚Äì53. On medical leave back in England after the injury, Herbert began writing his first book, The Secret Battle, which was finished \\"in a few weeks\\". He was also elected a member of the Savage Club, and raised by Punch to the \\"exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.\\"Pound, pp. 54‚Äì55. On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed out of Liverpool in a convoy bound for Alexandria. His role was as assistant to the Commodore. After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit a number of places on the North African coast, and from Tunis took a train to Constantine, Algeria and then to Algiers. On 11 November, he went by train from Oran to Tlemcen. Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. As he wrote, \\"I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.\\"Pound, pp. 57‚Äì59. Herbert was granted shore leave at Gibraltar and took the opportunity to travel to Seville and then to C√≥rdoba. He arrived in Madrid on 22 November and dined with the Embassy's naval attache, Captain John Harvey, as well as Filson Young and others, before making the return journey to Gibraltar.Pound, pp. 60‚Äì61. Interwar career, 1918‚Äì35 The Secret Battle was recommended to Methuen Publishing by E. V. Lucas and was announced in their spring list in 1919. The book was \\"read all night\\" by Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, who also brought it to the attention of Churchill, then Secretary of State for War. Montgomery considered it \\"the best story of front line war\\", and Herbert himself believed that court martial arrangements were subsequently \\"altered in some way\\" as a result of the book. However, the book was not a great commercial success, which his biographer Reginald Pound puts down to the fact that \\"Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.\\"Pound, pp. 64‚Äì64. Herbert was called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1919 and entered the chambers of Leslie Scott. He was joined by two of his Oxford friends, Walter Monckton and Henry Strauss, who were called on the same day. Although he spent some time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later declared himself \\"forever sorry\\" that he was \\"not of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.\\"Pound, pp. 65‚Äì66. Unable to sustain himself on Punchs \\"eccentric rates of payment\\", Herbert wrote his second book, The House by the River, in two months, and it was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to The House by the River and also published a collection of his prose submissions to Punch under the title Light Articles Only.Pound, pp. 66‚Äì67. In January 1924, Owen Seaman, the editor of Punch, invited Herbert to join its staff. Herbert accepted and his accession meant he would receive a salary of ¬£50 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of Punch, where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in Melbourne, where it was described as \\"delectably witty\\" by Sir Harry Brittain.Pound, pp. 84‚Äì85. In 1926, Herbert was invited by Nigel Playfair to write \\"an entertainment\\" for the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. The result was Riverside Nights, performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play, The White Witch, was performed at Haymarket Theatre in September 1926. Blue plaque, 12 Hammersmith Terrace Early parliamentary career, 1935‚Äì1939 Herbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence. Hewart, LCJ ruled that the court would not hear the complaint, because the matter fell within parliamentary privilege. Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, this led to a unique situation, where there was uncertainty as to \\"the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.\\" When in the following year Herbert published Uncommon Law, Hewart contributed a generous introduction. Herbert first entertained the idea of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the 1935 general election, when he ran into Frederick Lindemann, who had just been rejected as Conservative candidate for Oxford University. Herbert decided to stand as an Independent candidate, aided by Frank Pakenham, who served as his election agent. Herbert wrote an \\"unconventional\\", 5,000-word election address, which included the statement, \\"Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.\\" Herbert was elected as an Independent supporter of the National Government.Pound, p. 135. Defying the advice of more experienced members, including Austen Chamberlain, he made his maiden speech on 4 December 1935, the second day of the opening session of the new Parliament. He protested to the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over private member's bills. He went into the \\"No\\" lobby alongside the members of the Independent Labour Party and fellow university member Eleanor Rathbone, but the motion was passed by 232 to 5.Pound, pp. 135‚Äì136. Churchill praised Herbert for his \\"composure and aplomb\\", and also famously said: \\"Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.\\"Herbert, p. 38. During the speech, Herbert promised to introduce his Matrimonial Causes Bill into law by the end of the Parliament. In 1936, Herbert failed to be drawn in the private members' ballot, but managed to get the Conservative Rupert De la B√®re to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and was passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937. This allowed divorce to be given without requiring proof of adultery, although fake adulteries and bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the Divorce Reform Act 1969 came into force in 1971. During the pre-war period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse.Herbert, pp. 41‚Äì42. Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a \\"temporary, war-time tax\\" in 1916.Herbert, p. 91. In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with William Mabane, and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon reduced the duty.Herbert, p. 95. Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937, making a speech that was received with \\"loud laughter\\" in the Commons chamber, making it, according to Punch, \\"an astonishing occasion\\". Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938.Pound, pp. 151‚Äì153. Herbert was also a fervent opponent of the Oxford Group and its leader, Frank Buchman. In particular, he opposed the use of \\"Oxford\\" in their name and their supposed association with the University of Oxford. He was supported by the University in his endeavours, particularly by the Oxford Union, which unanimously passed a resolution in support of him. Support for Herbert was also expressed by H. A. L. Fisher, the warden of New College, Oxford, and Douglas Veale, the Registrar of the University of Oxford.Pound, pp. 155‚Äì156. Second World War service, 1939‚Äì1945 On 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the Water Gipsy, in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the Port of London Authority.Herbert, p. 113. Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raids and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to their war stations. Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Victor Pasmore, Magnus Pyke and John Pudney. At the sounding of the first air-raid siren in London in 1939, the Water Gipsy was anchored off the Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the Water Gipsy as the only naval vessel in sight, before saluting it.Pound, pp. 158‚Äì159. During the Second World War, Herbert was the only non-commissioned officer in the House of Commons and wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war years. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, despite once appearing before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill's war cabinet when asked, saying \\"No, thank you, sir. I'm quite happy where I am.\\"Pound, p. 178. Herbert was sent to Newfoundland and Labrador in 1943 with Derrick Gunston and Charles Ammon as members of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence rather than a confederation with Canada. Later parliamentary career, 1945‚Äì1950 After his re-election in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that \\"the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.\\" The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs, \\"Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty.\\" Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including ones covering betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of decree nisi. However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time ‚Äì later in the Parliament, it would be restored.Pound, pp. 197‚Äì98. In autumn 1945, George Orwell had the essay Notes on Nationalism published in the magazine Polemic. In it, he named Herbert as one of the followers of \\"neo-Toryism\\", who according to Orwell, were marked by a \\"desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined.\\" Herbert's biographer, Reginald Pound, notes that \\"APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.\\"Pound, p. 208. From July 1945 through to 1946, Herbert worked on the libretto for Charles B. Cochran's new musical, Big Ben. This opened at the Adelphi Theatre on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, Montgomery, Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran himself was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of ¬£4,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high, so that there was no fortune in it for Cochran or for Herbert.Pound, pp. 199‚Äì201. The show ended its run at the end of 1946, after 172 performances.Pound, p. 207. Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, Bless the Bride, which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two-and-a-quarter years, and was the source of \\"an accretion of cash\\" for Herbert, as well as being Cochran's most successful musical.Pound, p. 211. Herbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by Raymond Evershed, which was investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He also accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the Festival of Britain, to be held in 1951. At this time, he was already a member of the Thames Conservancy Board, a trustee of the National Maritime Museum, president of the Inland Waterways Association and a vice president of the Pedestrians' Association for Road Safety. In addition he authored a critical study of royal commissions for the Institute of Economic Affairs, which was dismissed for its \\"light touch\\". Herbert commented: \\"Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.\\"Pound, p. 212‚Äì214. Herbert was re- elected in the 1945 general election and continued as an MP until the University seats were abolished in 1950 under the Representation of the People Act 1948.Herbert, p. 31. Herbert's last speech, on 23 November 1949, was in favour of the Festival of Britain, a cause he strongly supported. He was knighted in 1945 in Winston Churchill's Resignation Honours. The Times noted \\"his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member's rights, including not least the right to legislate.\\" In 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons: Independent Member (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1951). Ten years later he was the subject of a This Is Your Life TV programme in 1961, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Personal life 12 Hammersmith Terrace Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, the daughter of Harry Quilter, in the summer of 1914.Pound, p. 37. They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by Frederic Iremonger, the Vicar of St James the Great in Bethnal Green. Herbert wore his formal dress uniform as an Acting Leading Seaman during the wedding. They spent their honeymoon in a room in Fulham Road.Pound, pp. 42‚Äì43. Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club Chess Club site in 1966 and was a well-known face on the chess circuit at that time. They had four children Crystal, Lavender, Jocelyn and John. The present Labour Party Member of Parliament for Chesterfield, Toby Perkins, is Herbert's great-grandson. =The Thames= Herbert loved the River Thames. He lived beside it at Hammersmith, West London. He was a Conservator (a member of the Thames Conservancy Board) and a Freeman of the Company of Watermen and Lightermen. In 1966 he wrote a book, The Thames (Weidenfeld & Nicolson), in which he explored the \\"machinery\\" of the river in all its aspects. Death In the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to Middlesex Hospital in Fitzrovia, after a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, but over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to The Times, an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from \\"witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr Harold Wilson\\" and of the \\"marine activities\\" of Edward Heath. By then, he was describing himself as \\"a recumbent nuisance\\". A. P. Herbert died on 11 November 1971. Obituaries were published in both The Times and Punch. The Times supplemented their obituary notice with a leading article. They described him as having done \\"more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.\\" A memorial service was held on 6 December in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, which was \\"crowded to overflowing\\". On 7 December, the Congressional Record of the US House of Representatives appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert, by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the Library of Congress, later said that \\"[there is no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.\\"Pound, pp. 299‚Äì301. References by other authors In a 1957 article entitled \\"Over Seventy\\", lamenting the decline of the humorist, P. G. Wodehouse wrote: \\"I want to see an A. P. Herbert on every street corner, an Alex Atkinson in every local.\\" The title of Alexandra Fuller's 2001 memoir Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood is taken from a Herbert quote, \\"Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.\\"[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight] Cited from epigraph. \\"Misleading cases\\" Uncommon Law, collecting Misleading Cases in the Common Law Starting in 1910, he contributed regularly to Punch. One series of his that it took was Misleading Cases in the Common Law ‚Äì the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of \\"law reports\\" or \\"legal judgments\\" on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock, also known as \\"The Negotiable Cow\\". Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious \\"Smith's Leading Cases\\". Herbert often referred to himself as \\"A. P. Haddock\\" in skits in Punch magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting. Thanks to their realism, Herbert's satires were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers, both in Britain and elsewhere, as factual. One of the \\"cases\\", supposedly establishing a novel crime of \\"doing what you like\\", was sharply criticised by an American law review article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity.Uncommon Law, Rex v Haddock: Is it a free country?, 5, pp. 24‚Äì29. Haddock is arrested for jumping into the River Thames from Hammersmith Bridge. When questioned about his motive, Haddock replies, \\"For fun.\\" The judge sums up: \\"The appellant made the general answer that this was a free country and a man can do what he likes if he does nobody any harm.... It cannot be too clearly understood that this is not a free country, and it will be an evil day for the legal profession when it is... and least of all may they do unusual actions 'for fun'. People must not do things for fun. There is no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament.\\" As such, Herbert's contributions are examples of the literary technique known as false document. Whereas in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as Henry de Bracton, they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagining, such as \\"Wedderburn on Water Courses\\" and \\"A. Capone's Handbook for Bootleggers\\". More importantly, these cases were Herbert's vehicles for his law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often carried cogent and sharp legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are, consequently, sometimes quoted in judicial decisions,See for example Messing v Bank of America (2002) at paragraph 1, and Victor Chandler International Ltd v The Commissioners of Custom and Excise and Teletext Limited 1999 EWHC Ch 214, para 11, where Mr Justice Lightman stated that a document, in the context of the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981, \\"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A. P. Herbert's 'negotiable cow' can constitute a document.\\" and are also the subject of academic research.Uncommon Law, Rumpelheimer v Haddock: Port to Port, 37, pp. 237‚Äì242. A misleading case hangs on the question of right of way when a car collides with Haddock's dinghy on a flooded road. The English use left-hand traffic, but the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea dictate right-hand traffic. Over his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled Misleading Cases in the Common Law, More Misleading Cases, Still More Misleading Cases, Codd's Last Case and Bardot M.P.?. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as General Cargo. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, Uncommon Law in 1935 and More Uncommon Law in 1982. A shorter selection, Wigs at Work, appeared in 1966. The BBC successfully adapted these for television, as three series of A P Herbert's Misleading Cases (1967, 1968 and 1971), with Roy Dotrice as Haddock and Alastair Sim as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow. Novels and other writings Herbert wrote eight novels, including The Water Gipsies (1930), and 15 plays, including the light operas Tantivy Towers (1931) and Big Ben (1946), and the comedy Bless the Bride (1947), which ran for two-and-a-quarter years in London. In addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote What a Word! in 1935, continuing his campaign in Punch for better use of English, including a section on \\"Plain English\\", more than a decade ahead of Sir Ernest Gowers's more celebrated work. Characteristically, Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing. He was the author of the lyrics of the patriotic song \\"Song of Liberty\\", set in 1940 to the music of Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4. In 1944, a set of posters by Eric Kennington, a personal friend, called Seeing It Through, were accompanied by poems by Herbert. They describe the work of certain professionals in London in the war. After the war he wrote a booklet called \\"The War Story of Southend Pier\\" detailing an account of when the pier was taken over by the Royal Navy in World War II. In 1967, Herbert published Sundials Old and New; or, Fun with the Sun; a book describing in detail his long fascination with and experiments in sundial technology. In the book, he describes all manner of sundials, and recounts many of his experiments in designing and building a number of different models, including a few that could be used to tell your position on the earth as well as the local time. In 1970 Herbert published A.P.H., His Life and Times, dedicated to \\"My dear wife, for our 56th anniversary\\".

Crime by type  =Murder= In 2015, Estonia had a murder rate of 3.19 per 100,000 population.https://dataunodc.un.org/crime/intentional-homicide-victims There were a total of 42 murders in Estonia in 2015. The murder rate was considerably higher in the 1990s and the 2000s. An average of 9.4 people per 100,000 per year were killed in Estonia between 1999 and 2001. =Organised crime= Organized crime is characterized by a loose alliance of mobster groups, principally of Russian origins, with a wide range of different rackets: prostitution, motor vehicle theft, drug trafficking, and previously also \\"providing\\" workers to building contracts in Finland, where the criminal organizations were confiscating a share of workers' wages.http://www2.helsinginsanomat.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20020423IE11 Estonia's Obtshak crime organisation a major supplier of Finnish illegal drug market. Helsingin Sanomat 23.4.2002 Although small, the mafia is hierarchical and well-organized, which has enabled its survival. The Common Fund The Common Fund () is a traditional umbrella organisation of criminal groups, a trade union of sorts which settles conflicts and establishes the boundaries of the spheres of interest of the various groups. In 2003, the Common Fund had been dominated for about 15 years by Nikolai Tarankov of Ukrainian or Belarusian heritage and KGB training.Eesti P√§evaleht February 11, 2002: Kuritegelik s√µpruskond keerutab √ºhiskassa miljoneid by Risto BerendsonEesti Ekspress March 12, 2003: Nikolai Tarankov ‚Äì vaikne valitseja by Raul Ranne However, Tarankov was killed by his godson in 2016.http://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/art-2000005353261.html The Common Fund pays for lawyers of caught members, purchases and delivers packages to imprisoned members and covers other expenses. Such \\"insurance\\" increases the loyalty of the members. In 2005, the Estonian Central Criminal Police noticed a decline in revenues of the Common Fund, leading to capture of several high-ranking members.Eesti Ekspress January 27, 2005: √úhiskassa lahjad p√§evad by Janar Filippov The decline has been attributed to changes in Estonian society, particularly those experienced in the lead-up to accession to European Union. In 2010s, the police have been successful in disrupting the operations of the Obtshak by arresting high-ranking members. One of the kingpins, Assar Paulus, was convicted in 2016 for founding a criminal organization and funding drug trafficking. The gang got its income through illegal debt collection and extortion, and some members committed tax fraud, drug crimes and violent crimes. In general, violent crime and protection rackets have become a thing of the past: it is no longer necessary for ordinary businessmen to pay protection money. Instead, the mafia is more involved in drug trade and white- collar crime such as tax fraud. Also, many former mafia \\"businessmen\\" have moved to legitimate business. =Fraud= Aarni Neuvonen is the largest ever perpetrator of employment fraud in Estonia. He is known for having collected money with promise of overseas jobs from thousands of people and disappearing after having caused over (estimated) 10 million of EEK of damages in 1993. Avo Viiol was convicted for embezzlement in 2003. The neologism viioldama, has become a slang veb meaning \\"to embezzle\\".Estonian Slang Dictionary maintained by Estonian Language Institute: entry #37 to steal = Drugs = The illegal drug trade's turnover in Estonia according to 2008 estimates might be several billion EEK. According to the opinion of senior superintendent of narcotic crimes department at North Police Prefecture only 1% of the whole amount of drugs on the market is confiscated in Estonia. In 2011, the EUROPOL Trafficking Unit designated the Baltic states and Kaliningrad as a transit hub for drug trafficking in and out of Russia.Europol Assesses Baltic Organized Crime Hub, May 24, 2011 = Corruption = In 2008, Transparency International has measured the Corruption Perception Index for Estonia to be at 6.6 (CI 6.2‚Äì6.9), ranking it 27th in a list of 180 countries.Transparency International: 2008 Corruption Perception Index In comparison, neighbouring Sweden was ranked 1st‚Äì3rd with a CPI at 9.3 (CI 9.2‚Äì9.4), Finland 5th‚Äì6th with a CPI at 9.0 (CI 8.4‚Äì9.4), Russia 147th‚Äì150th with a CPI at 2.1 (CI 1.9‚Äì2.5), and Latvia 52nd with a CPI at 5.0 (CI 4.8‚Äì5.2). Higher index means perception of more transparency and less corruption. As of 2014 the Corruption Perception Index for Estonia is 6.9, placing it at the 26th position (in the context of EU above France and below Austria).Transparency International: A total of 326 corruption-related offenses were identified and registered in 2008, considerably below the number registered in 2006, when 511 instances of corruption were found, but 17% higher than in 2007, and slightly higher than in 2003.\\"Crime in Estonia in 2008.\\" Criminal Policy Studies No 10. Pp. 48‚Äì52 Tallinn: Ministry of Justice. Criminal Policy Department. 2009. These accounted for just 0.6% of all criminal offenses. Foreign investors do not consider corruption as a main problem of doing business in Estonia. In general, the public sector is transparent and has good compliance with anti- corruption initiatives and demonstrates adherence to ethical principles on the cultural level. In February 2012, the government passed an anti-corruption act in order to further improve transparency in the public sector, such as asset disclosure by government officials. Public trust in the electoral system is high. However, the government still faces challenges in combating corruption. Local-level government corruption still remains a problem, and public awareness of corruption-prevention needs to be raised. =Human trafficking= According to Interpol in 2002, since the fall of the Soviet Union the largest group of prostitutes working in Finland has consisted of trafficked women from Estonia and Russia.Leskinen, Jari. \\"Finland Report 2002: Organised Pandering and Prostitution in Finland\\". March 2003. Interpol. Retrieved June 6, 2009. The 2012 \\"Trafficking in Persons Report\\" issued by the US Trafficking state departmentTrafficking in Persons Report 2012 repeats the claims of previous years that Estonia is \\"source, transit, and destination\\" for adult human trafficking, and that Estonia fails to comply with their minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. It now adds that the government \\"is making significant efforts to do so\\". Trafficking is now treated as a serious matter by the Estonian government, which enacted a law in 2012 criminalizing trafficking in persons with penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment. The Estonian government identified 56 victims in 2011; 39 women, 17 men, and no children; 37 were sex trafficking victims, 19 were labor trafficking. The report also states that the Estonian government funds ($US42k) an active anti- trafficking hotline, and that it has increased funding ($US158k) for anti- trafficking victim care and that it maintains a \\"strong and supportive\\" relationship with organisations active in anti-trafficking. To this end the government has published a victim identification guide in Estonian and Russian, for use by law enforcement officials. The government has distributed anti-trafficking material at tourism and job fairs. Consular officials have visited schools to discuss dangers of trafficking. The government has also co- ordinated efforts in trafficking-reduction/elimination with other countries and has taken various other anti-trafficking measures.  Crime dynamics  According to statistics published in Britain in 2008 relating to the period 1991‚Äì2001, the number of crimes increased by 84% from 1991 to 2001.Archer, Clive. New Security Issues in Northern Europe: The Nordic and Baltic States and the ESDP. London: Routledge, 2008. , . P. 25. The number of discovered drug-related crimes increased by 21 between 1997 and 2001. Overall, crime has fallen precipitously between 1995 and 2010, by close to 70%.https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21582041-rich-world-seeing-less- and-less-crime-even-face-high-unemployment-and-economic Crime of Estonian residents overseas = Jewellery robberies = In December 2006, it was estimated that residents of Estonia were responsible for 140 robberies of jewellery and watch stores in Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden during the three years prior.

Various types of Internet sites permit user comments, such as: Internet forums, blogs, and news sites powered by scripts such as phpBB, a Wiki, or PHP-Nuke. Depending on the site's content and intended audience, the webmaster will decide what kinds of user comments are appropriate, then delegate the responsibility of sifting through comments to lesser moderators. Most often, webmasters will attempt to eliminate trolling, spamming, or flaming, although this varies widely from site to site. Social media sites may also employ content moderators to manually inspect or remove content flagged for hate speech or other objectionable content. In the case of Facebook, the company has increased the number of content moderators from 4,500 to 7,500 in 2017 due to legal and other controversies. In Germany, Facebook is responsible for removing hate speech within 24 hours of when it is posted. Supervisor moderation Also known as unilateral moderation, this kind of moderation system is often seen on Internet forums. A group of people are chosen by the webmaster (usually on a long-term basis) to act as delegates, enforcing the community rules on the webmaster's behalf. These moderators are given special privileges to delete or edit others' contributions and/or exclude people based on their e-mail address or IP address, and generally attempt to remove negative contributions throughout the community. =Commercial content moderation (CCM)= Commercial Content Moderation is a term coined by Sarah T. Roberts to describe the practice of \\"monitoring and vetting user-generated content (UGC) for social media platforms of all types, in order to ensure that the content complies with legal and regulatory exigencies, site/community guidelines, user agreements, and that it falls within norms of taste and acceptability for that site and its cultural context.\\" While at one time this work may have been done by volunteers within the online community, for commercial websites this is largely achieved through outsourcing the task to specialized companies, often in low-wage areas. Employees work by viewing, assessing and deleting disturbing content, and may suffer psychological damage. Secondary trauma may arise, with symptoms similar to PTSD. Some large companies such as Facebook offer psychological support, but critics claim that it is insufficient. Facebook Facebook has decided to create an oversight board that will decide what content remains and what content is removed. This idea was proposed in late 2018. The \\"Supreme Court\\" at Facebook is to replace making decisions in an ad hoc manner. Distributed moderation Distributed moderation comes in two types: user moderation and spontaneous moderation. =User moderation= User moderation allows any user to moderate any other user's contributions. On a large site with a sufficiently large active population, this usually works well, since relatively small numbers of troublemakers are screened out by the votes of the rest of the community. Strictly speaking, wikis such as Wikipedia are the ultimate in user moderation, but in the context of Internet forums, the definitive example of a user moderation system is Slashdot. For example, each moderator is given a limited number of \\"mod points,\\" each of which can be used to moderate an individual comment up or down by one point. Comments thus accumulate a score, which is additionally bounded to the range of -1 to 5 points. When viewing the site, a threshold can be chosen from the same scale, and only posts meeting or exceeding that threshold will be displayed. This system is further refined by the concept of karma‚Äîthe ratings assigned to a user's' previous contributions can bias the initial rating of contributions he or she makes. On sufficiently specialized websites, user moderation will often lead to groupthink, in which any opinion that is in disagreement with the website's established principles (no matter how sound or well-phrased) will very likely be \\"modded down\\" and censored, leading to the perpetuation of the groupthink mentality. This is often confused with trolling. =Spontaneous moderation= Spontaneous moderation is what occurs when no official moderation scheme exists. Without any ability to moderate comments, users will spontaneously moderate their peers through posting their own comments about others' comments. Because spontaneous moderation exists, no system that allows users to submit their own content can ever go completely without any kind of moderation.

Urban ecology is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms with each other and their surroundings in the context of an urban environment. The urban environment refers to environments dominated by high- density residential and commercial buildings, paved surfaces, and other urban- related factors that create a unique landscape dissimilar to most previously studied environments in the field of ecology. The goal of urban ecology is to achieve a balance between human culture and the natural environment. Urban ecology is a recent field of study compared to ecology as a whole. The methods and studies of urban ecology are similar to and comprise a subset of ecology. The study of urban ecology carries increasing importance because more than 50% of the world's population today lives in urban areas. At the same time, it is estimated that within the next forty years, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in expanding urban centers. The ecological processes in the urban environment are comparable to those outside the urban context. However, the types of urban habitats and the species that inhabit them are poorly documented. Often, explanations for phenomena examined in the urban setting as well as predicting changes because of urbanization are the center for scientific research.  History  The creation of an important stream water garden in Metz's centre during the early 70s was one of the materializations of Jean-Marie Pelt's works on urban ecology. Ecology has historically focused on \\"pristine\\" natural environments, but by the 1970s many ecologists began to turn their interest towards ecological interactions taking place in, and caused by urban environments. Jean-Marie Pelt's 1977 book The Re-Naturalized Human, Brian Davis' 1978 publication Urbanization and the diversity of insects, and Sukopp et al.'s 1979 article \\"The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin's wastelands\\" are some of the first publications to recognize the importance of urban ecology as a separate and distinct form of ecology the same way one might see landscape ecology as different from population ecology. Forman and Godron's 1986 book Landscape Ecology first distinguished urban settings and landscapes from other landscapes by dividing all landscapes into five broad types. These types were divided by the intensity of human influence ranging from pristine natural environments to urban centers. Urban ecology is recognized as a diverse and complex concept which differs in application between North America and Europe. The European concept of urban ecology examines the biota of urban areas, while the North American concept has traditionally examined the social sciences of the urban landscape, as well as the ecosystem fluxes and processes.  Methods  Since urban ecology is a subfield of ecology, many of the techniques are similar to that of ecology. Ecological study techniques have been developed over centuries, but many of the techniques use for urban ecology are more recently developed. Methods used for studying urban ecology involve chemical and biochemical techniques, temperature recording, heat mapping remote sensing, and long-term ecological research sites. =Chemical and biochemical techniques = Chemical techniques may be used to determine pollutant concentrations and their effects. Tests can be as simple as dipping a manufactured test strip, as in the case of pH testing, or be more complex, as in the case of examining the spatial and temporal variation of heavy metal contamination due to industrial runoff. In that particular study, livers of birds from many regions of the North Sea were ground up and mercury was extracted. Additionally, mercury bound in feathers was extracted from both live birds and from museum specimens to test for mercury levels across many decades. Through these two different measurements, researchers were able to make a complex picture of the spread of mercury due to industrial runoff both spatially and temporally. Other chemical techniques include tests for nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, etc. which are commonly associated with urban pollutants such as fertilizer and industrial byproducts. These biochemical fluxes are studied in the atmosphere (e.g. greenhouse gasses), aquatic ecosystems and soil vegetation. Broad reaching effects of these biochemical fluxes can be seen in various aspects of both the urban and surrounding rural ecosystems. =Temperature data and heat mapping= Temperature data can be used for various kinds of studies. An important aspect of temperature data is the ability to correlate temperature with various factors that may be affecting or occurring in the environment. Oftentimes, temperature data is collected long-term by the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), and made available to the scientific community through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data can be overlaid with maps of terrain, urban features, and other spatial areas to create heat maps. These heat maps can be used to view trends and distribution over time and space. = Remote sensing = Remote sensing allows collection of data using satellites. This map shows urban tree canopy in Boston. Remote sensing is the technique in which data is collected from distant locations through the use of satellite imaging, radar, and aerial photographs. In urban ecology, remote sensing is used to collect data about terrain, weather patterns, light, and vegetation. One application of remote sensing for urban ecology is to detect the productivity of an area by measuring the photosynthetic wavelengths of emitted light. Satellite images can also be used to detect differences in temperature and landscape diversity to detect the effects of urbanization. = LTERs and long-term data sets = Long-term ecological research (LTER) sites are research sites funded by the government that have collected reliable long-term data over an extended period of time in order to identify long-term climatic or ecological trends. These sites provide long-term temporal and spatial data such as average temperature, rainfall and other ecological processes. The main purpose of LTERs for urban ecologists is the collection of vast amounts of data over long periods of time. These long-term data sets can then be analyzed to find trends relating to the effects of the urban environment on various ecological processes, such as species diversity and abundance over time. Another example is the examination of temperature trends that are accompanied with the growth of urban centers.  Urban effects on the environment  Humans are the driving force behind urban ecology and influence the environment in a variety of ways, such as modifying land surfaces and waterways, introducing foreign species, and altering biogeochemical cycles. Some of these effects are more apparent, such as the reversal of the Chicago River to accommodate the growing pollution levels and trade on the river.Hill, L. The Chicago River: A Natural and Unnatural History. Lake Claremont Press. 2000. Other effects can be more gradual such as the change in global climate due to urbanization. = Modification of land and waterways = Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The \\"fishbone pattern\\" is a result of the roads in the forest created by loggers.Humans place high demand on land not only to build urban centers, but also to build surrounding suburban areas for housing. Land is also allocated for agriculture to sustain the growing population of the city. Expanding cities and suburban areas necessitate corresponding deforestation to meet the land-use and resource requirements of urbanization. Key examples of this are Deforestation in the United States and Brazil. Along with manipulation of land to suit human needs, natural water resources such as rivers and streams are also modified in urban establishments. Modification can come in the form of dams, artificial canals, and even the reversal of rivers. Reversing the flow of the Chicago River is a major example of urban environmental modification. Urban areas in natural desert settings often bring in water from far areas to maintain the human population and will likely have effects on the local desert climate. Modification of aquatic systems in urban areas also results in decreased stream diversity and increased pollution. = Trade, shipping, and spread of invasive species = A ship navigates through the Firth of Clyde in Scotland, potentially carrying invasive species. Invasive kudzu vines growing on trees in Atlanta, Georgia, USA Both local shipping and long-distance trade are required to meet the resource demands important in maintaining urban areas. Carbon dioxide emissions from the transport of goods also contribute to accumulating greenhouse gases and nutrient deposits in the soil and air of urban environments. In addition, shipping facilitates the unintentional spread of living organisms, and introduces them to environments that they would not naturally inhabit. Introduced or alien species are populations of organisms living in a range in which they did not naturally evolve due to intentional or inadvertent human activity. Increased transportation between urban centers furthers the incidental movement of animal and plant species. Alien species often have no natural predators and pose a substantial threat to the dynamics of existing ecological populations in the new environment where they are introduced. Such invasive species are numerous and include house sparrows, ring-necked pheasants, European starlings, brown rats, Asian carp, American bullfrogs, emerald ash borer, kudzu vines, and zebra mussels among numerous others, most notably domesticated animals. In Australia, it has been found that removing Lantana (L. camara, an alien species) from urban green spaces can surprisingly have negative impacts on bird diversity locally, as it provides refugia for species like the superb fairy (Malurus cyaneus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), in the absence of native plant equivalents . Although, there seems to be a density threshold in which too much Lantana (thus homogeneity in vegetation cover) can lead to a decrease in bird species richness or abundance . = Human effects on biogeochemical pathways = Urbanization results in a large demand for chemical use by industry, construction, agriculture, and energy providing services. Such demands have a substantial impact on biogeochemical cycles, resulting in phenomena such as acid rain, eutrophication, and global warming. Furthermore, natural biogeochemical cycles in the urban environment can be impeded due to impermeable surfaces that prevent nutrients from returning to the soil, water, and atmosphere. Graphical representation of the carbon cycle. Demand for fertilizers to meet agricultural needs exerted by expanding urban centers can alter chemical composition of soil. Such effects often result in abnormally high concentrations of compounds including sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus used in fertilizers have caused severe problems in the form of agricultural runoff, which alters the concentration of these compounds in local rivers and streams, often resulting in adverse effects on native species. A well-known effect of agricultural runoff is the phenomenon of eutrophication. When the fertilizer chemicals from agricultural runoff reach the ocean, an algal bloom results, then rapidly dies off. The dead algae biomass is decomposed by bacteria that also consume large quantities of oxygen, which they obtain from the water, creating a \\"dead zone\\" without oxygen for fish or other organisms. A classic example is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico due to agricultural runoff into the Mississippi River. Just as pollutants and alterations in the biogeochemical cycle alter river and ocean ecosystems, they exert likewise effects in the air. Some stems from the accumulation of chemicals and pollution and often manifests in urban settings, which has a great impact on local plants and animals. Because urban centers are often considered point sources for pollution, unsurprisingly local plants have adapted to withstand such conditions.  Urban effects on climate  Urban environments and outlying areas have been found to exhibit unique local temperatures, precipitation, and other characteristic activity due to a variety of factors such as pollution and altered geochemical cycles. Some examples of the urban effects on climate are urban heat island, oasis effect, greenhouse gases, and acid rain. This further stirs the debate as to whether urban areas should be considered a unique biome. Despite common trends among all urban centers, the surrounding local environment heavily influences much of the climate. One such example of regional differences can be seen through the urban heat island and oasis effect. = Urban heat island effect = Graphical representation of the rising temperature in Kanto, Japan due to urban heat island. The urban heat island is a phenomenon in which central regions of urban centers exhibit higher mean temperatures than surrounding urban areas. Much of this effect can be attributed to low city albedo, the reflecting power of a surface, and the increased surface area of buildings to absorb solar radiation. Concrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures. Brazel et al. found that the urban heat island effect demonstrates a positive correlation with population density in the city of Baltimore. The heat island effect has corresponding ecological consequences on resident species. However, this effect has only been seen in temperate climates. = Greenhouse gases = Greenhouse gas emissions include those of carbon dioxide and methane from the combustion of fossil fuels to supply energy needed by vast urban metropolises. Other greenhouse gases include water vapor, and nitrous oxide. Increases in greenhouse gases due to urban transport, construction, industry and other demands have been correlated strongly with increase in temperature. Sources of methane are agricultural dairy cows and landfills. = Acid rain and pollution = Smokestacks from a wartime production plant releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. Processes related to urban areas result in the emission of numerous pollutants, which change corresponding nutrient cycles of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and other elements. Ecosystems in and around the urban center are especially influenced by these point sources of pollution. High sulfur dioxide concentrations resulting from the industrial demands of urbanization cause rainwater to become more acidic. Such an effect has been found to have a significant influence on locally affected populations, especially in aquatic environments. Wastes from urban centers, especially large urban centers in developed nations, can drive biogeochemical cycles on a global scale. =Urban environment as an anthropogenic biome = The urban environment has been classified as an anthropogenic biome, which is characterized by the predominance of certain species and climate trends such as urban heat island across many urban areas. Examples of species characteristic of many urban environments include, cats, dogs, mosquitoes, rats, flies, and pigeons, which are all generalists. Many of these are dependent on human activity and have adapted accordingly to the niche created by urban centers.  Biodiversity and urbanization  Research thus far indicates that, on a small scale, urbanization often increases the biodiversity of non-native species while reducing that of native species. This normally results in an overall reduction in species richness and increase in total biomass and species abundance. Urbanization also reduces diversity on a large scale. Urban stream syndrome is a consistently observed trait of urbanization characterized by high nutrient and contaminant concentration, altered stream morphology, increased dominance of dominant species, and decreased biodiversity The two primary causes of urban stream syndrome are storm water runoff and wastewater treatment plant effluent. = Changes in diversity = Diversity is normally reduced at intermediate-low levels of urbanization but is always reduced at high levels of urbanization. These effects have been observed in vertebrates and invertebrates while plant species tend to increase with intermediate-low levels of urbanization but these general trends do not apply to all organisms within those groups. For example, McKinney‚Äôs (2006) review did not include the effects of urbanization on fishes and of the 58 studies on invertebrates, 52 included insects while only 10 included spiders. There is also a geographical bias as most of the studies either took place in North America or Europe. The effects of urbanization also depend on the type and range of resources used by the organism. Generalist species, those that use a wide range of resources and can thrive under a large range of living conditions, are likely survive in uniform environments. Specialist species, those that use a narrow range of resources and can only cope with a narrow range of living conditions, are unlikely to cope with uniform environments. There will likely be a variable effect on these two groups of organisms as urbanization alters habitat uniformity. Surprisingly, endangered plant species have been reported to occur throughout a wide range of urban ecosystems, many of them being novel ecosystems. A study of 463 bird species reported that urban species share dietary traits. Specifically, urban species were larger, consumed more vertebrates and carrion, and fed more frequently on the ground or aerially, and also had broader diets than non‚Äêurban species. = Cause of diversity change = The urban environment can decrease diversity through habitat removal and species homogenization‚Äîthe increasing similarity between two previously distinct biological communities. Habitat degradation and habitat fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat by urban development and separates suitable patches by inhospitable terrain such as roads, neighborhoods, and open parks. Although this replacement of suitable habitat with unsuitable habitat will result in extinctions of native species, some shelter may be artificially created and promote the survival of non-native species (e.g. house sparrow and house mice nests). Urbanization promotes species homogenization through the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species that already have a widespread abundance. Changes to the habitat may promote both the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species. The effects of habitat change will likely be similar in all urban environments as urban environments are all built to cater to the needs of humans. The urban environment can also increase diversity in a number of ways. Many foreign organisms are introduced and dispersed naturally or artificially in urban areas. Artificial introductions may be intentional, where organisms have some form of human use, or accidental, where organisms attach themselves to transportation vehicles. Humans provide food sources (e.g. birdfeeder seeds, trash, garden compost) and reduce the numbers of large natural predators in urban environments, allowing large populations to be supported where food and predation would normally limit the population size. There are a variety of different habitats available within the urban environment as a result of differences in land use allowing for more species to be supported than by more uniform habitats.  Ways to improve urban ecology: civil engineering and sustainability  Cities should be planned and constructed in such a way that minimizes the urban effects on the surrounding environment (urban heat island, precipitation, etc.) as well as optimizing ecological activity. For example, increasing the albedo, or reflective power, of surfaces in urban areas, can minimize urban heat island, resulting in a lower magnitude of the urban heat island effect in urban areas. By minimizing these abnormal temperature trends and others, ecological activity would likely be improved in the urban setting. = Need for remediation = Urbanization has indeed had a profound effect on the environment, on both local and global scales. Difficulties in actively constructing habitat corridor and returning biogeochemical cycles to normal raise the question as to whether such goals are feasible. However, some groups are working to return areas of land affected by the urban landscape to a more natural state. This includes using landscape architecture to model natural systems and restore rivers to pre-urban states. = Species reintroduction = Reintroduction of species to urban settings can help improve the local biodiversity previously lost; however the following guidelines should be followed in order to avoid undesired effects. # No predators capable of killing children will be reintroduced to urban areas. # There will be no introduction of species that significantly threaten human health, pets, crops or property. # Reintroduction will not be done when it implies significant suffering to the organisms being reintroduced, for example stress from capture or captivity. # Organisms that carry pathogens will not be reintroduced. # Organisms whose genes threaten the genetic pool of other organisms in the urban area will not be reintroduced. # Organisms will only be reintroduced when scientific data support a reasonable chance of long term survival (if funds are insufficient for the long term effort, reintroduction will not be attempted). # Reintroduced organisms will receive food supplementation and veterinary assistance as needed. # Reintroduction will be done in both experimental and control areas to produce reliable assessments (monitoring must continue afterwards to trigger interventions if necessary). # Reintroduction must be done in several places and repeated over several years to buffer for stochastic events. # People in the areas affected must participate in the decision process, and will receive education to make reintroduction sustainable (but final decisions must be based on objective information gathered according to scientific standards). = Sustainability = Pipes carrying biogas produced by anaerobic digestion or fermentation of biodegradable materials as a form of carbon sequestration. With the ever- increasing demands for resources necessitated by urbanization, recent campaigns to move toward sustainable energy and resource consumption, such as LEED certification of buildings, Energy Star certified appliances, and zero emission vehicles, have gained momentum. Sustainability reflects techniques and consumption ensuring reasonably low resource use as a component of urban ecology. Techniques such as carbon recapture may also be used to sequester carbon compounds produced in urban centers rather continually emitting more of the greenhouse gas. = Urban green space =  Summary  Urbanization results in a series of both local and far-reaching effects on biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, hydrology, and climate, among many other stresses. Many of these effects are not fully understood, as urban ecology has only recently emerged as a scientific discipline and much more research remains to be done. Research on cities outside the US and Europe remains limited. Observations on the impact of urbanization on biodiversity and species interactions are consistent across many studies but definitive mechanisms have yet to be established. Urban ecology constitutes an important and highly relevant subfield of ecology, and further study must be pursued to more fully understand the effects of human urban areas on the environment.

The concept of X-inefficiency was introduced by Harvey Leibenstein.‚Ä¢ Leibenstein, Harvey ([1987] 2008). \\"X-efficiency,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Snippet preview. ‚Ä¢ Stigler, George J. (1976). \\"The Xistence of X-Efficiency,\\" American Economic Review 66(1): 213-216. Frantz, R. S. (2007). Empirical evidence on X-efficiency, 1967‚Äì2004. In Frantz, R., editor, Renaissance in Behavioral Economics: Essays in Honour of Harvey Leibenstein, pages 221‚Äì227. New York, NY: Routledge. Overview Mainstream economic theory tends to assume that the management of firms act to maximize profit by minimizing the inputs used to produce a given level of output. Competition energizes firms to seek productive efficiency gains and produce at lowest unit costs or risk losing sales to more efficient rivals. With market forms other than perfect competition, such as monopoly, productive inefficiency can persist, because the lack of competition makes it possible to use inefficient production techniques and still stay in business. In addition to monopoly, sociologists have identified a number of ways in which markets may be organizationally embedded, and thus may depart in behavior from economic theory. Organizational slack occurs when firms opt to employ more resources than are needed to produce a given level of output. Unused capacity results in X-inefficiency. Organizational slack can be explained by the agent-principal problem. In companies ownership and management are separate. Shareholders (the principal) elect directors (the agent) to act on their behalf and maximize shareholder value. Managers may take decisions that maximize their own and not shareholder objectives e.g. hiring extra staff to reduce manager workloads. This increases unit costs. X-inefficiency only looks at the outputs that are produced with given inputs. It doesn't take account of whether the inputs are the best ones to be using, or whether the outputs are the best ones to be producing. For example, a firm that employs brain surgeons to dig ditches might still be X-inefficient, even though reallocating the brain surgeons to curing the sick would be more efficient for society overall. In this sense, X-inefficiency focuses on productive efficiency and minimising costs rather than allocative efficiency and maximising welfare. For more extensive discussions, see Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, p. 1-8, 469) and references therein. Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981  Examples  =Monopoly= A monopoly is a price maker in that its choice of output level affects the price paid by consumers. Consequently, a monopoly tends to price at a point where price is greater than long-run average costs. X-inefficiency, however tends to increase average costs causing further divergence from the economically efficient outcome. The sources of X-inefficiency have been ascribed to things such as overinvestment and empire building by managers, lack of motivation stemming from a lack of competition, and pressure by labor unions to pay above-market wages.

Its chemical formula is '. The compound is classified as a transition metal dichalcogenide. It is a silvery black solid that occurs as the mineral molybdenite, the principal ore for molybdenum.Sebenik, Roger F. et al. (2005) \\"Molybdenum and Molybdenum Compounds\\", Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. is relatively unreactive. It is unaffected by dilute acids and oxygen. In appearance and feel, molybdenum disulfide is similar to graphite. It is widely used as a dry lubricant because of its low friction and robustness. Bulk is a diamagnetic, indirect bandgap semiconductor similar to silicon, with a bandgap of 1.23 eV.  Production  MolybdeniteMoS2 is naturally found as either molybdenite, a crystalline mineral, or jordisite, a rare low temperature form of molybdenite. Molybdenite ore is processed by flotation to give relatively pure . The main contaminant is carbon. also arises by thermal treatment of virtually all molybdenum compounds with hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur and can be produced by metathesis reactions from molybdenum pentachloride.  Structure and physical properties  Electron microscopy of antisites (a, Mo substitutes for S) and vacancies (b, missing S atoms) in a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide. Scale bar: 1 nm. = Crystalline phases = All forms of have a layered structure, in which a plane of molybdenum atoms is sandwiched by planes of sulfide ions. These three strata form a monolayer of MoS2. Bulk MoS2 consists of stacked monolayers, which are held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Crystalline MoS2 is found in nature as one of two phases, 2H-MoS2 and 3R-MoS2, where the \\"H\\" and the \\"R\\" indicate hexagonal and rhombohedral symmetry, respectively. In both of these structures, each molybdenum atom exists at the center of a trigonal prismatic coordination sphere and is covalently bonded to six sulfide ions. Each sulfur atom has pyramidal coordination and is bonded to three molybdenum atoms. Both the 2H- and 3R-phases are semiconducting. A third, metastable crystalline phase known as 1T-MoS2 was discovered by intercalating 2H-MoS2 with alkali metals. This phase has tetragonal symmetry and is metallic. The 1T-phase can be stabilized through doping with electron donors like rhenium, or converted back to the 2H-phase by microwave radiation. =Allotropes= Nanotube-like and buckyball-like molecules composed of are known. =Exfoliated MoS2 flakes= While bulk MoS2 in the 2H-phase is known to be an indirect-band gap semiconductor, monolayer MoS2 has a direct band gap. The layer-dependent optoelectronic properties of MoS2 have promoted much research in 2-dimensional MoS2-based devices. 2D MoS2 can be produced by exfoliating bulk crystals to produce single-layer to few-layer flakes either through a dry, micromechanical process or through solution processing. Micromechanical exfoliation, also pragmatically called \\"Scotch-tape exfoliation\\", involves using an adhesive material to repeatedly peel apart a layered crystal by overcoming the van der Waals forces. The crystal flakes can then be transferred from the adhesive film to a substrate. This facile method was first used by Novoselov and Geim to obtain graphene from graphite crystals. However, it can not be employed for a uniform 1-D layers because of weaker adhesion of MoS2 to the substrate (either Si, glass or quartz). The aforementioned scheme is good for graphene only. While Scotch tape is generally used as the adhesive tape, PDMS stamps can also satisfactorily cleave MoS2 if it is important to avoid contaminating the flakes with residual adhesive. Liquid-phase exfoliation can also be used to produce monolayer to multi-layer MoS2 in solution. A few methods include lithium intercalation to delaminate the layers and sonication in a high-surface tension solvent. = Mechanical properties = MoS2 excels as a lubricating material (see below) due to its layered structure and low coefficient of friction. Interlayer sliding dissipates energy when a shear stress is applied to the material. Extensive work has been performed to characterize the coefficient of friction and shear strength of MoS2 in various atmospheres. The shear strength of MoS2 increases as the coefficient of friction increases. This property is called superlubricity. At ambient conditions, the coefficient of friction for MoS2 was determined to be 0.150, with a corresponding estimated shear strength of 56.0 MPa. Direct methods of measuring the shear strength indicate that the value is closer to 25.3 MPa. The wear resistance of MoS2 in lubricating applications can be increased by doping MoS2 with chromium. Microindentation experiments on nanopillars of Cr-doped MoS2 found that the yield strength increased from an average of 821 MPa for pure MoS2 (0 at. % Cr) to 1017 MPa for 50 at. % Cr. The increase in yield strength is accompanied by a change in the failure mode of the material. While the pure MoS2 nanopillar fails through a plastic bending mechanism, brittle fracture modes become apparent as the material is loaded with increasing amounts of dopant. The widely used method of micromechanical exfoliation has been carefully studied in MoS2 to understand the mechanism of delamination in few-layer to multi-layer flakes. The exact mechanism of cleavage was found to be layer dependent. Flakes thinner than 5 layers undergo homogenous bending and rippling, while flakes around 10 layers thick delaminated through interlayer sliding. Flakes with more than 20 layers exhibited a kinking mechanism during micromechanical cleavage. The cleavage of these flakes was also determined to be reversible due to the nature of van der Waals bonding. In recent years, MoS2 has been utilized in flexible electronic applications, promoting more investigation into the elastic properties of this material. Nanoscopic bending tests using AFM cantilever tips were performed on micromechanically exfoliated MoS2 flakes that were deposited on a holey substrate. The yield strength of monolayer flakes was 270 GPa, while the thicker flakes were also stiffer, with a yield strength of 330 GPa. Molecular dynamic simulations found the in-plane yield strength of MoS2 to be 229 GPa, which matches the experimental results within error. Bertolazzi and coworkers also characterized the failure modes of the suspended monolayer flakes. The strain at failure ranges from 6 to 11%. The average yield strength of monolayer MoS2 is 23 GPa, which is close to the theoretical fracture strength for defect-free MoS2. The band structure of MoS2 is sensitive to strain.  Chemical reactions  Molybdenum disulfide is stable in air and attacked only by aggressive reagents. It reacts with oxygen upon heating forming molybdenum trioxide: : 2 + 7 ‚Üí 2 + 4 Chlorine attacks molybdenum disulfide at elevated temperatures to form molybdenum pentachloride: : 2 + 7 ‚Üí 2 + 2 =Intercalation reactions= Molybdenum disulfide is a host for formation of intercalation compounds. This behavior is relevant to its use as a cathode material in batteries. One example is a lithiated material, . With butyl lithium, the product is .  Applications  = Lubricant = A tube of commercial graphite powder lubricant with molybdenum disulfide additive (called \\"molybdenum\\")High Performance, Dry Powdered Graphite with sub-micron molybdenum disulfide. pinewoodpro.com Due to weak van der Waals interactions between the sheets of sulfide atoms, has a low coefficient of friction. in particle sizes in the range of 1‚Äì100 ¬µm is a common dry lubricant. Few alternatives exist that confer high lubricity and stability at up to 350 ¬∞C in oxidizing environments. Sliding friction tests of using a pin on disc tester at low loads (0.1‚Äì2 N) give friction coefficient values of <0.1. is often a component of blends and composites that require low friction. For example, it is added to graphite to improve sticking. A variety of oils and greases are used, because they retain their lubricity even in cases of almost complete oil loss, thus finding a use in critical applications such as aircraft engines. When added to plastics, forms a composite with improved strength as well as reduced friction. Polymers that may be filled with include nylon (trade name Nylatron), Teflon and Vespel. Self-lubricating composite coatings for high-temperature applications consist of molybdenum disulfide and titanium nitride, using chemical vapor deposition. Examples of applications of -based lubricants include two-stroke engines (such as motorcycle engines), bicycle coaster brakes, automotive CV and universal joints, ski waxes and bullets. Other layered inorganic materials that exhibit lubricating properties (collectively known as solid lubricants (or dry lubricants)) includes graphite, which requires volatile additives and hexagonal boron nitride. = Catalysis = Fingerprint revealed by molybdenum disulfide is employed as a cocatalyst for desulfurization in petrochemistry, for example, hydrodesulfurization.The effectiveness of the catalysts is enhanced by doping with small amounts of cobalt or nickel. The intimate mixture of these sulfides is supported on alumina. Such catalysts are generated in situ by treating molybdate/cobalt or nickel-impregnated alumina with or an equivalent reagent. Catalysis does not occur at the regular sheet- like regions of the crystallites, but instead at the edge of these planes. MoS2 finds use as a hydrogenation catalyst for organic synthesis. It is derived from a common transition metal, rather than group 10 metal as are many alternatives, MoS2 is chosen when catalyst price or resistance to sulfur poisoning are of primary concern. MoS2 is effective for the hydrogenation of nitro compounds to amines and can be used produce secondary amines via reductive alkylation. The catalyst can also can effect hydrogenolysis of organosulfur compounds, aldehydes, ketones, phenols and carboxylic acids to their respective alkanes. The catalyst suffers from rather low activity however, often requiring hydrogen pressures above 95 atm and temperatures above 185 ¬∞C.  Research  =Hydrogen evolution= and related molybdenum sulfides are efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution, including the electrolysis of water; thus, are possibly useful to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells. =Microelectronics= As in graphene, the layered structures of and other transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit electronic and optical properties that can differ from those in bulk. Bulk has an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV, while monolayers have a direct 1.8 eV electronic bandgap, supporting switchable transistors and photodetectors. nanoflakes can be used for solution-processed fabrication of layered memristive and memcapacitive devices through engineering a / heterostructure sandwiched between silver electrodes. -based memristors are mechanically flexible, optically transparent and can be produced at low cost. The sensitivity of a graphene field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor is fundamentally restricted by the zero band gap of graphene, which results in increased leakage and reduced sensitivity. In digital electronics, transistors control current flow throughout an integrated circuit and allow for amplification and switching. In biosensing, the physical gate is removed and the binding between embedded receptor molecules and the charged target biomolecules to which they are exposed modulates the current. MoS2 has been investigated as a component of flexible circuits. In 2017 a 115-transistor, 1-bit microprocessor implementation using two-dimensional . MoS2 has been used to create 2D 2-terminal memristors and 3-terminal memtransistors. =Photonics and photovoltaics= also possesses mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and can emit light, opening possible applications such as photodetectors. has been investigated as a component of photoelectrochemical (e.g. for photocatalytic hydrogen production) applications and for microelectronics applications. =Superconductivity of monolayers= Under an electric field monolayers have been found to superconduct at temperatures below 9.4 K.Electric-field-induced superconductivity at 9.4 K in a layered transition metal disulphide MoS2 2012  See also  * Molybdenum diselenide  References  Molybdenum(IV) compounds Sulfides Non-petroleum based lubricants Dry lubricants Semiconductor materials Transition metal dichalcogenides Hydrogenation catalysts Monolayers ","title":"Molybdenum disulfide"},{"id":"295685","text":"George Thomas Saimes (September 1, 1941 ‚Äì March 8, 2013) was an American football defensive back and fullback for Michigan State University and the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League, which produced American Football League Championships in 1964 and 1965.

He played college football for Bluffton College (now Bluffton University) in northwest Ohio. Dubenion, the longest-tenured member of the team's inaugural roster despite being 27 years old at the start of his professional career, is considered one of the best players in the team's history and was an archetype of the AFL's emphasis on speed and the long bomb, both of which were two of Dubenion's greatest strengths. Career Dubenion was drafted in the fourteenth round of the 1959 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. His relatively old age (26 at the time) and hailing from a smaller college meant that he was never considered a serious prospect, and the Browns released him prior to the start of the season. Dubenion was among many AFL players from smaller and less renowned colleges that the league was signing in search of talent that the NFL had overlooked, and the Buffalo Bills signed him as a free agent. During his rookie season, one of his quarterbacks, Johnny Green, gave Dubenion a backhanded compliment regarding his speed and alleged inability to catch a football, noting that he had \\"golden wheels.\\" The nickname Golden Wheels stuck for the remainder of his career. In his rookie season, Dubenion had seven touchdowns and 752 receiving yards on 42 catches, a 17.9 yd/catch average. He ran 16 times for 94 yards and a touchdown, a 5.6 yd/carry average. In 1961, facing tighter and deeper coverages, he upped his production as a runner, rushing for 173 yards and a touchdown on just 17 carries, a 10.3 yd/carry average. He had 31 catches for 461 yards and six touchdowns. In 1964, Dubenion had one of the most sensational seasons of any receiver in pro football history, scoring 10 touchdowns among his 42 receptions for 1,139 yards, while collecting 27.1 yards per catch. In nine seasons, he totalled 296 receptions for 5,424 yards and 36 TDs for a career average of 18.3 yd/catch, and rushed for 360 yards and three touchdowns on 48 carries, a career average of seven yds/carry. When Wray Carlton was released by the Bills on September 2, 1968, it made Dubenion the last player from the Bills original roster in 1960 to still be with the club.Rockin‚Äô the Rockpile: The Buffalo Bills of the American Football League, p.393, Jeffrey J. Miller, ECW Press, 2007, Dubenion ranks seventh all-time in the AFL in receptions and reception yardage. He holds the record for the longest reception in AFL playoff history, a 93-yd touchdown reception from quarterback Daryle Lamonica against the Boston Patriots in 1963. He was a 1993 inductee of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and his number 44 is officially in \\"reduced circulation,\\" meaning although it is not officially retired, current players cannot wear the number out of deference to Dubenion.

It is located in Paris, in the 5th arrondissement, or Latin Quarter, across the street from the historical campus of La Sorbonne. Overview The Coll√®ge is considered to be France's most prestigious research establishment. As of 2017, 21 Nobel Prize winners and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with the Coll√®ge. It does not grant degrees. Each professor is required to give lectures where attendance is free and open to anyone. Professors, about 50 in number, are chosen by the professors themselves, from a variety of disciplines, in both science and the humanities. The motto of the Coll√®ge is Docet Omnia, Latin for \\"It teaches everything\\"; its goal is to \\"teach science in the making\\" and can be best summed up by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phrase: \\"Not acquired truths, but the idea of freely-executed research\\"\\"Non pas des v√©rit√©s acquises, mais l'id√©e d'une recherche libre\\". The entire sentence is in fact: \\"Ce que le Coll√®ge de France, depuis sa fondation, est charg√© de donner √† ses auditeurs, ce ne sont pas des v√©rit√©s acquises, c'est l'id√©e d'une recherche libre.\\" From Merleau-Ponty's inaugural lecture at the Coll√®ge de France, reproduced in: Maurice Merleau-Ponty, √âloge de la philosophie et autres essais, Paris: Gallimard, 1989, p. 13. which is inscribed in golden letters above the main hall. It is a constituent college (associate-member) of University PSL. The Coll√®ge has research laboratories and one of the best research libraries of Europe, with sections focusing on history with rare books, humanities, social sciences and also chemistry and physics. As of June 2009, over 650 audio podcasts of Coll√®ge de France lectures are available on iTunes. Some are also available in English and Chinese. Similarly, the Coll√®ge de France's website hosts several videos of classes. The classes are followed by various students, from senior researchers to PhD or master students, or even bachelor students. Moreover, the \\"le√ßons inaugurales\\" (first lesson) are important events in Paris intellectual and social life and attract a very large public of curious Parisians.  History  The Coll√®ge was established by King Francis I of France, modeled after the Collegium Trilingue in Louvain, at the urging of Guillaume Bud√©. Of humanist inspiration, the school was established as an alternative to the Sorbonne to promote such disciplines as Hebrew, Ancient Greek (the first teacher being the celebrated scholar Janus Lascaris) and Mathematics.Byzance et l'Europe : Colloque √† la Maison de l'Europe, Paris, 22 avril 1994, H. Antoniadis-Bibicou (Ed.), 2001, ISBN/ISSN/EAN: 291142720. Initially called Coll√®ge royal, and later Coll√®ge des trois langues (Collegium Trilingue), Coll√®ge national, and Coll√®ge imp√©rial, it was named Coll√®ge de France in 1870. In 2010, it became a founding associate of PSL Research University (a community of Parisian universities).

The common thread is a call for people to take up smallholding and to grow food from the land with an emphasis on a greater degree of self-sufficiency, autonomy, and local community than found in a prevailing industrial or postindustrial way of life. There have been a variety of motives behind such movements, such as social reform, land reform, and civilian war efforts. Groups involved have included political reformers, counterculture hippies, and religious separatists. The concept was popularized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century by activist Bolton Hall, who set up vacant lot farming in New York City and wrote many books on the subject.\\"Bolton Hall, 84, Single Taxer, Dies,\\" New York Times, December 11, 1938 Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website. The practice, however, was strong in Europe even before that time.\\"Helping the Poor Back to the Land,\\" New York Times, August 24, 1909 Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website. During World War II, when Great Britain faced a blockade by Nazi U-boats, a \\"Dig for Victory\\" campaign urged civilians to fight food shortages by growing vegetables on any available patch of land. In the USA between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s there was a revived back-to-the-land movement, with substantial numbers migrating from cities to rural areas. The back-to-the-land movement has ideological links to distributism, a 1920s and 1930s attempt to find a \\"Third Way\\" between capitalism and socialism.Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4  The movement throughout history  The American social commentator and poet Gary Snyder has related that there have been back-to-the-land population movements throughout the centuries, and throughout the world, largely due to the occurrence of severe urban problems and people's felt need to live a better life, often simply to survive.Snyder, Gary (Sept/Oct 1984) \\"Choosing Your Place-and Taking a Stand\\" interview with G.S., The Mother Earth News The historian and philosopher of urbanism Jane Jacobs remarked in an interview with Stewart Brand that with the Fall of Rome city dwellers re-inhabited the rural areas of the region. From another point of departure, Yi-Fu Tuan takes a view that such trends have often been privileged and motivated by sentiment. \\"Awareness of the past is an important element in the love of place,\\" he writes, in his 1974 book Topophilia. Tuan writes that an appreciation of nature springs from wealth, privilege, and the antithetical values of cities. He argues that literature about land (and, subsequently, about going back to the land) is largely sentimental; \\"little,\\" he writes, \\"is known about the farmer's attitudes to nature...\\" Tuan finds historical instances of the desire of the civilized to escape civilization in the Hellenistic, Roman, Augustan, and Romantic eras, and, from one of the earliest recorded myths, the Epic of Gilgamesh. The movement in North America  Regarding North America, many individuals and households have moved from urban or suburban circumstances to rural ones at different times; for instance, the economic theorist and land-based American experimenter Ralph Borsodi (author of Flight from the City) is said to have influenced thousands of urban-living people to try a modern homesteading life during the Great Depression. The New Deal town of Arthurdale, West Virginia was built in 1933 using the back-to-the-land ideas current at the time.C.J. Maloney. Back to the Land: Arthurdale, FDR's New Deal, and the Costs of Economic Planning (2013) Wiley, , pp. 195‚Äì196 There was again a fair degree of interest in moving to rural land after World War II. In 1947, Betty MacDonald published what became a popular book, The Egg and I, telling her story of marrying and then moving to a small farm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. This story was the basis of a successful comedy film starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray. The Canadian writer Farley Mowat says that many returned veterans after World War II sought a meaningful life far from the ignobility of modern warfare, regarding his own experience as typical of the pattern. In Canada, those who sought a life completely outside of the cities, suburbs, and towns frequently moved into semi-wilderness environs. But what made the later phenomenon of the 1960s and 1970s especially significant was that the rural- relocation trend was sizable enough that it was identified in the American demographic statistics. Roots of this movement can perhaps be traced to some of Bradford Angier's books, such as At Home in the Woods (1951) and We Like it Wild (1963), Louise Dickinson Rich's We Took to the Woods (1942) and subsequent books, or perhaps even more compellingly to the 1954 publication of Helen and Scott Nearing's book, Living the Good Life. This book chronicles the Nearings' move to an older house in a rural area of Vermont and their self- sufficient and simple lifestyle. In their initial move, the Nearings were driven by the circumstances of the Great Depression and influenced by earlier writers, particularly Henry David Thoreau. Their book was published six years after A Sand County Almanac, by the ecologist and environmental activist Aldo Leopold, was published, in 1948. Influences aside, the Nearings had planned and worked hard, developing their homestead and life according to a twelve- point plan they had drafted. The narrative of Phil Cousineau's documentary film Ecological Design: Inventing the Future asserts that in the decades after World War II, \\"The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry... There was a clarion call for a return to a life of human scale.\\" By the late 1960s, many people had recognized that, leaving their city or suburban lives, they completely lacked any familiarity with such basics of life as food sources (for instance, what a potato plant looks like, or the act of milking a cow) ‚Äî and they felt out of touch with nature, in general. While the back-to-the-land movement was not strictly part of the counterculture of the 1960s, the two movements had some overlap in participation. Many people were attracted to getting more in touch with the basics just mentioned, but the movement could also have been fueled by the negatives of modern life: rampant consumerism, the failings of government and society, including the Vietnam War, and a perceived general urban deterioration, including a growing public concern about air and water pollution. Events such as the Watergate scandal and the 1973 energy crisis contributed to these views. Some people rejected the struggle and boredom of \\"moving up the company ladder.\\" Paralleling the desire for reconnection with nature was a desire to reconnect with physical work. Farmer and author Gene Logsdon expressed the aim aptly as: \\"the kind of independence that defines success in terms of how much food, clothing, shelter, and contentment I could produce for myself rather than how much I could buy.\\"Logsdon, Gene 1995 The Contrary Farmer. White River Junction, Vt:Chelsea Green There was also a segment within the movement who already had a familiarity with rural life and farming, who already had skills, and who wanted land of their own on which they could demonstrate that organic farming could be made practical and economically successful. Besides the Nearings and other authors writing later along similar lines, another influence from the world of American publishing was the unprecedented, vigorous, and intelligent Whole Earth Catalogs. Stewart Brand and a circle of friends and family began the effort in 1968, because Brand believed that there was a groundswell of biologists, designers, engineers, sociologists, organic farmers, and social experimenters who wished to transform civilization along lines that might be called \\"sustainable\\". Brand and cohorts created a catalog of \\"tools\\" - defined broadly to include useful books, design aids, maps, gardening implements, carpentry and masonry tools, metalworking equipment, and a great deal more. Another important publication was The Mother Earth News, a periodical (originally on newsprint) that was founded a couple years after the Catalog. Ultimately gaining a large circulation, the magazine was focused on how-to articles, personal stories of successful and budding homesteaders, interviews with key thinkers, and the like. The magazine stated its philosophy was based on returning to people a greater measure of control of their own lives. Many of the North American back-to-the-landers of the 1960s and 1970s made use of the Mother Earth News, the Whole Earth Catalogs and derivative publications. But as time went on, the movement itself drew more people into it, more or less independently of impetus from the publishing world.

His music reflects the transition from the classical to the romantic musical era.  Life  Hummel's birthplace in Klobuƒçn√≠cka St., Bratislava Hummel was born as an only child (which was unusual for that period) in Pressburg, Kingdom of Hungary, then a part of the Habsburg Monarchy (now Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia). He was named after the Czech patron saint John of Nepomuk. His father, Johannes Hummel,Hust, Christoph. 2003. \\"Hummel, Johann Nepomuk.\\" In: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart. 2nd ed. Ludwig Finscher (ed.). Kassel: B√§renreiter, pp. 503‚Äì511. was the director of the Imperial School of Military Music in Vienna; his mother, Margarethe Sommer Hummel, was the widow of the wigmaker Josef Ludwig. The couple married just four months beforehand. Hummel was a child prodigy. At the age of eight, he was offered music lessons by the classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was impressed with his ability. Hummel was taught and housed by Mozart for two years free of charge and made his first concert appearance at the age of nine at one of Mozart's concerts. Hummel's father then took him on a European tour, arriving in London where he received instruction from Muzio Clementi and where he stayed for four years before returning to Vienna. In 1791 Joseph Haydn, who was in London at the same time as young Hummel, composed a sonata for Hummel, who gave its first performance in the Hanover Square Rooms in Haydn's presence. When Hummel finished, Haydn reportedly thanked the young man and gave him a guinea. The outbreak of the French Revolution and the following Reign of Terror caused Hummel to cancel a planned tour through Spain and France. Instead, he returned to Vienna, giving concerts along his route. Upon his return to Vienna he was taught by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, Joseph Haydn, and Antonio Salieri. At about this time, young Ludwig van Beethoven arrived in Vienna and also took lessons from Haydn and Albrechtsberger, thus becoming a fellow student and a friend. Beethoven's arrival was said to have nearly destroyed Hummel's self- confidence, though he recovered without much harm. The two men's friendship was marked by ups and downs, but developed into reconciliation and mutual respect. Hummel visited Beethoven in Vienna on several occasions with his wife Elisabeth and pupil Ferdinand Hiller. At Beethoven's wish, Hummel improvised at the great man's memorial concert. It was at this event that he made friends with Franz Schubert, who dedicated his last three piano sonatas to Hummel. However, since both composers had died by the time of the sonatas' first publication, the publishers changed the dedication to Robert Schumann, who was still active at the time. Hummel, c. 1814, Goethe-Museum, D√ºsseldorf In 1804, Hummel became ' to Prince Esterh√°zy's establishment at Eisenstadt. Although he had taken over many of the duties of Kapellmeister because Haydn's health did not permit him to perform them himself, he continued to be known simply as the Concertmeister out of respect to Haydn, receiving the title of Kapellmeister, or music director, to the Eisenstadt court only after the older composer died in May 1809. He remained in the service of Prince Esterh√°zy for seven years altogether before being dismissed in May 1811 for neglecting his duties. He then returned to Vienna where, after spending two years composing, he married the opera singer Elisabeth R√∂ckel in 1813. The following year, at her request, was spent touring Russia and the rest of Europe. The couple had two sons. The younger, Carl (1821‚Äì1907), became a well-known landscape painter. The older, , worked as pianist, conductor and composer; he moved to the U.S. and died in Troy, New York. Hummel later held the positions of Kapellmeister in Stuttgart from 1816 to 1819 and in Weimar from 1819 to 1837, where he formed a close friendship with Goethe, learning among other things to appreciate the poetry of Schiller, who had died in 1805. During Hummel's stay in Weimar he made the city into a European musical capital, inviting the best musicians of the day to visit and make music there. He brought one of the first musicians' pension schemes into existence, giving benefit concert tours when the retirement fund ran low. Hummel was one of the first to agitate for musical copyright to combat intellectual piracy. In 1825, the Parisian music-publishing firm of Aristide Farrenc announced that it had acquired the French publishing rights for all future works by Hummel. In 1830, Hummel gave three concerts in Paris; at one of them, a rondo by Hummel was performed by Aristide Farrenc's wife, the composer Louise Farrenc, who also \\"sought Hummel's comments on her keyboard technique.\\"Bea Friedland, Louise Farrenc, 1804‚Äì1875: Composer, Performer, Scholar, 1980, Ann Arbor, UMI Press, pp. 15‚Äì16, ISN=0-8357-1111-0 In 1832, at the age of 54 and in failing health, Hummel began to devote less energy to his duties as music director at Weimar. In addition, after Goethe's death in March 1832 he had less contact with local theatrical circles and as a result found himself in partial retirement from 1832 until his death in 1837.  Influence  Deutsches Nationaltheater in Weimar While in Germany, Hummel published A Complete Theoretical and Practical Course of Instruction on the Art of Playing the Piano Forte (1828), which sold thousands of copies within days of its publication and brought about a new style of fingering and of playing ornaments. Later 19th century pianistic technique was influenced by Hummel, through his instruction of Carl Czerny who later taught Franz Liszt. Czerny had transferred to Hummel after studying three years with Beethoven. Hummel's influence can also be seen in the early works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Robert Schumann, and the shadow of Hummel's Piano Concerto in B minor as well as his Piano Concerto in A minor can be particularly perceived in Chopin's concertos. This is unsurprising, considering that Chopin must have heard Hummel on one of the latter's concert tours to Poland and Russia, and that Chopin kept Hummel's piano concertos in his active repertoire. Harold C. Schonberg, in The Great Pianists, writes \\"...the openings of the Hummel A minor and Chopin E minor concertos are too close to be coincidental\\".Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Pianists, p. 110 In relation to Chopin's Preludes, Op. 28, Schonberg says: \\"It also is hard to escape the notion that Chopin was very familiar with Hummel's now-forgotten Op. 67,Scans from Universal Edition c. 1900, and symbolic data for Op. 67 preludes composed in 1815 ‚Äì a set of twenty-four preludes in all major and minor keys, starting with C major\\". Robert Schumann also practiced Hummel (especially the Sonata in F-sharp minor, Op. 81), and considered becoming his pupil. Liszt's father Adam refused to pay the high tuition fee Hummel was used to charging (thus Liszt ended up studying with Czerny). Czerny, Friedrich Silcher, Ferdinand Hiller, Sigismond Thalberg, and Adolf von Henselt were among Hummel's most prominent students. He also briefly gave some lessons to Felix Mendelssohn.Joel Sachs, \\"Hummel, Johann Nepomuk\\", ¬ß6 'Performance and teaching', Oxford Music Online (subscription only), accessed 29 May 2011  Music  A surviving manuscript of Hummel's work, probably in his own hand Hummel's music took a different direction from that of Beethoven. Looking forward, Hummel stepped into modernity through pieces like his Sonata in F-sharp minor, Op. 81, and his Fantasy, Op. 18, for piano. These pieces are examples where Hummel may be seen to both challenge the classical harmonic structures and stretch the sonata form. His main oeuvre is for the piano, on which instrument he was one of the great virtuosi of his day. He wrote eight piano concertos, a double concerto for violin and piano, ten piano sonatas (of which four are without opus numbers, and one is still unpublished), eight piano trios, a piano quartet, a piano quintet, a wind octet, a cello sonata, two piano septets, a mandolin concerto, a mandolin sonata, a Trumpet Concerto in E major written for the keyed trumpet (usually heard in the more convenient E-flat major), a \\"Grand Bassoon Concerto\\" in F, a quartet for clarinet, violin, viola, and cello, four hand piano music, 22 operas and Singspiels, masses, and much more, including a variation on a theme supplied by Anton Diabelli for part 2 of Vaterl√§ndischer K√ºnstlerverein. Although thought of in terms of the piano in modern times, Hummel was seriously and constantly interested in the guitar, and he was talented with the instrument. He was prolific in his writing, and his compositions for it begin with opus 7 and finish with opus 93. Other guitar works include Opp. 43, 53, 62, 63, 66, 71 and 91, which are written for a mixture of instruments.Philip J. Bone, The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914. Hummel's output is marked by the conspicuous lack of a symphony. Of his eight piano concertos the first two are early Mozartesque compositions (S. 4/WoO 24 and S. 5) and the later six were numbered and published with opus numbers (Opp. 36, 85, 89, 110, 113, and posth.) A full list of Hummel's works is available online., compiled and formatted by Mr. Mikio Tao of Japan. His sources were The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, as well as Dieter Zimmerschied's Thematisches Verzeichnis der Werke von Johann Nepomuk Hummel  Last years and legacy  Hummel's grave in the Historical Cemetery, Weimar At the end of his life, Hummel saw the rise of a new school of young composers and virtuosi, and found his own music slowly going out of fashion. His disciplined and clean Clementi-style technique, and his balanced classicism, opposed him to the rising school of tempestuous bravura displayed by the likes of Liszt. Composing less and less, but still highly respected and admired, Hummel died peacefully in Weimar in 1837. A freemason (like Mozart), Hummel bequeathed a considerable portion of his famous garden behind his Weimar residence to his masonic lodge. His grave is in the Historical Cemetery, Weimar. Although Hummel died famous, with a lasting posthumous reputation apparently secure, he and his music were quickly forgotten at the onrush of the Romantic period, perhaps because his classical ideas were seen as old-fashioned. Later, during the classical revival of the early 20th century, Hummel was passed over. Like Haydn (for whom a revival had to wait until the second half of the 20th century), Hummel was overshadowed by Mozart and especially Beethoven, his contemporary. Due to a rising number of available recordings and an increasing number of live concerts across the world, his music is now becoming reestablished in the classical repertoire. Notable students include Alexander M√ºller.  References  Notes Sources Further reading * Johann Nepomuk Hummel: Der Mensch und K√ºnstler.

The final resident of nearby Sermermiut moved to Ilulissat in 1850.Guide to Ilulissat Museum, Ilulissat Museum =Ilulissat Declaration= The town was the site of the Arctic Ocean Conference in May 2008. The joint meeting between Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States was held to discuss key issues relating to territorial claims in the Arctic (particularly Hans Island and Arktika 2007) and Arctic shrinkage produced by climate change. The Ilulissat Declaration arose from the conference. It stated that the law of the sea provided for important rights and obligations concerning the delineation of the outer limits of the continental shelf, the protection of the marine environment (including ice-covered areas), freedom of navigation, marine scientific research, and other uses of the sea. It also said that it remained committed to this legal framework and to the orderly settlement of any possible overlapping claims. With this existing legal framework providing a solid foundation for responsible management, there was no need to develop a new comprehensive international legal regime to govern the Arctic Ocean. The states involved would continue the developments within the Arctic Ocean and continue to implement appropriate measures to further said developments.

T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements. Transact- SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application. Stored procedures in SQL Server are executable server-side routines. The advantage of stored procedures is the ability to pass parameters. Variables Transact-SQL provides the following statements to declare and set local variables: \`DECLARE\`, \`SET\` and \`SELECT\`. DECLARE @var1 NVARCHAR(30); SET @var1 = 'Some Name'; SELECT @var1 = Name FROM Sales.Store WHERE CustomerID = 100; Flow control Keywords for flow control in Transact-SQL include \`BEGIN\` and \`END\`, \`BREAK\`, \`CONTINUE\`, \`GOTO\`, \`IF\` and \`ELSE\`, \`RETURN\`, \`WAITFOR\`, and \`WHILE\`. \`IF\` and \`ELSE\` allow conditional execution. This batch statement will print \\"It is the weekend\\" if the current date is a weekend day, or \\"It is a weekday\\" if the current date is a weekday. (Note: This code assumes that Sunday is configured as the first day of the week in the \`@@DATEFIRST\` setting.) IF DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 1 PRINT 'It is the weekend.'; ELSE PRINT 'It is a weekday.'; \`BEGIN\` and \`END\` mark a block of statements. If more than one statement is to be controlled by the conditional in the example above, we can use \`BEGIN\` and \`END\` like this: IF DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR DATEPART(dw, GETDATE()) = 1 BEGIN PRINT 'It is the weekend.'; PRINT 'Get some rest on the weekend!'; END; ELSE BEGIN PRINT 'It is a weekday.'; PRINT 'Get to work on a weekday!'; END; \`WAITFOR\` will wait for a given amount of time, or until a particular time of day. The statement can be used for delays or to block execution until the set time. \`RETURN\` is used to immediately return from a stored procedure or function. \`BREAK\` ends the enclosing \`WHILE\` loop, while \`CONTINUE\` causes the next iteration of the loop to execute. An example of a \`WHILE\` loop is given below. DECLARE @i INT; SET @i = 0; WHILE @i < 5 BEGIN PRINT 'Hello world.'; SET @i = @i + 1; END; Changes to DELETE and UPDATE statements In Transact-SQL, both the \`DELETE\` and \`UPDATE\` statements are enhanced to enable data from another table to be used in the operation, without needing a subquery: * \`DELETE\` accepts joined tables in the \`FROM\` clause, similarly to \`SELECT\`. When this is done, the name or alias of which table in the join is to be deleted from is placed between \`DELETE\` and \`FROM\`. * \`UPDATE\` allows a \`FROM\` clause to be added. The table to be updated can be either joined in the \`FROM\` clause and referenced by alias, or referenced only at the start of the statement as per standard SQL. This example deletes all \`users\` who have been flagged with the 'Idle' flag. DELETE u FROM users AS u INNER JOIN user_flags AS f ON u.id = f.id WHERE f.name = 'idle'; BULK INSERT \`BULK\` is a Transact-SQL statement that implements a bulk data- loading process, inserting multiple rows into a table, reading data from an external sequential file. Use of \`BULK INSERT\` results in better performance than processes that issue individual \`INSERT\` statements for each row to be added. Additional details are available in MSDN.

It is included with several collections but has never been released as a standalone work. It first appeared in The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book (1986) which Adams also co-edited. It also appears in slightly modified form in the Adams retrospective The Salmon of Doubt. The story also appears in some versions of the complete omnibus editions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as well as the 1996 anthology The Wizards of Odd, edited by Peter Haining. Plot The story is a prequel to the events in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and has the young Zaphod Beeblebrox working as a salvage ship operator. He guides some bureaucrats to a crashed spaceship that may be leaking some dangerous materials, radioactive, toxic and otherwise hazardous by-products which were destined to be thrown into a black hole. The bureaucrats swear that it is \\"perfectly safe.\\" When asked why they want to see it if that is true, they claim that they \\"like looking at things that are perfectly safe.\\" The comic asides in the story include some of the time travel paradoxes which are a common running theme in Adams' SF work, and plenty of material about lobsters. Since this was before Zaphod blocked off sections of his own brain for the presidency, readers are able to glimpse what his original personality was like. His general speech patterns and goof-off personality are the same, but he seems to have moral views and is more likely to go off on life- threatening and exciting quests for the greater good. Throughout the story, it is emphasised that there is something particularly dangerous on board that ought to have been utterly destroyed, but is feared to have escaped. Ultimately, it is revealed that the something was actually three identical \\"Designer People\\". The personalities seem totally benign, which is what makes them so dangerous. The ship is filled with substances so dangerous that they are safe because no one who would actually use them would be let near. The personalities, products of a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation project, however, have custom personalities that could not naturally exist. There is \\"nothing they will not do if allowed, and there is nothing they will not be allowed to do.\\" Since no one will recognise that they are capable of mass destruction (despite their good intentions), no one will stop them from doing the unspeakable. The story culminates with the revelation that one of the personalities has escaped and headed off into Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, which is where the Earth was located in the original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Notes  Though it's not stated specifically, Adams implies that this unspeakably dangerous creation was then-President Ronald Reagan, a reflection of his critical views of the Reagan's policies which also surface in Mostly Harmless. A version of the story included in the posthumously- published The Salmon of Doubt makes this explicit.

Steinheil was born in Hapsal, Estonia. His father's family was from region of Upper Rhine in Germany (where they had been burghers and officials of their hometowns); and his mother was from a cadet branch of the ancient Baltic House of Tiesenhausen, daughter of nobleman Fromhold Fabian Tiesenhausen, lord of Orina in Estonia. Stenheil's uncle and father had received a baronial title from the imperial authorities. Fabian von Steinheil became a lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Army in 1782. He took part in the war in Finland in 1788 and in 1791-92 he worked with construction of fortifications in Old Finland, after which he served in military cartography. He became a Major General in 1789 and took part in the campaigns in Prussia in 1806-1807 and Poland in 1805-1807. He became a Lieutenant General in 1807 and commanded the Russian troops on √Öland in 1809 during the Finnish War. In 1810 he was appointed as the Governor- General of Finland, to succeed Prince Michael Andrew Barclay de Tolly. He was well regarded by the Finnish population and was made a count in 1812. In 1813 he took part in the war against Napoleon as the commander of an army in Courland and Livonia, and was succeeded as Governor-General by the influential Count Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt. However, due to Armfelt's fragile health, Steinheil soon returned to the post of Governor-General which he held to 1824, being then succeeded by Count Arseniy Zakrevskiy. He remained in Finland and died in Helsinki in 1831.

It was played between the hosting United States and the Soviet Union on February 22, 1980, during the medal round of the men's hockey tournament. Though the Soviet Union was a four-time defending gold medalist and heavily favored, the United States upset them and won 4‚Äì3. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and they were the favorites to win once more in Lake Placid. The team consisted primarily of veteran players with significant experience in international play. By contrast, none of the young players on the United States' team, led by head coach Herb Brooks, had any National Hockey League experience, and largely came from college hockey ranks. With only four players with minimal professional experience, the United States was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and U.S. teams were unbeaten; the U.S. achieved surprising results, including a 2‚Äì2 draw against Sweden, and a 7‚Äì3 upset victory over second-place favorite Czechoslovakia. For the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2‚Äì2, and the Soviets leading 3‚Äì2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead midway in the third and final period, then held on and won 4‚Äì3. Two days later, the U.S. won the gold medal by beating Finland in their final game. The Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden. The victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports. Equally well-known was the television call of the final seconds of the game by Al Michaels for ABC, in which he declared: \\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\\" In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the \\"Miracle on Ice\\" the top sports moment of the 20th century. As part of its centennial celebration in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) named the \\"Miracle on Ice\\" as the best international ice hockey story of the past 100 years. History =The Soviet and American teams= The Soviet team's Vladislav Tretiak (pictured here in 2008) was considered the best goaltender in ice hockey in 1980. The Americans scored two goals against him before he was pulled from the game at the end of the first period. The Soviet Union entered the Lake Placid games as the heavy favorite, having won four consecutive gold medals dating back to the 1964 games. In the four Olympics following their 1960 bronze-medal finish at Squaw Valley, Soviet teams had gone 27‚Äì1‚Äì1 (wins-losses-ties) and outscored their opponents 175‚Äì44.Coffey, p. 35 In head-to-head matchups against the United States, the cumulative score over that period was 28‚Äì7.Coffey, p. 17 The Soviet team had not lost a game in Olympic play since 1968. The Soviets were led by legendary players in world ice hockey, such as Boris Mikhailov (a top line right winger and team captain), Vladislav Tretiak (the consensus best goaltender in the world at the time), the speedy and skilled Valeri Kharlamov, and talented, dynamic players such as defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov and forwards Vladimir Krutov and Sergei Makarov. From that team, Tretiak, Kharlamov, Makarov, and Fetisov were eventually enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Many of the Soviet players had gained attention in the Summit Series eight years before and, in contrast to the American players, were de facto professionals with long histories of international play,Podnieks, Andrew: Team Canada 1972: The Official 40th Anniversary Celebration of the Summit Series p.212 employed by industrial firms or military organizations for the sole purpose of playing hockey on their organization's team. Western nations protested the Soviet Union's use of full-time athletes, as they were forced to use amateur (mainly college) players due to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) amateur-only policy. The situation even led to Canadian withdrawal from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, but the IOC did not change the rules until the late 1980s.Coffey, p. 59 U.S. head coach Herb Brooks held tryouts in Colorado Springs in the summer of 1979. Of the 20 players who eventually made the final Olympic roster, Buzz Schneider was the only one returning from the 1976 Olympic team.Coffey, pp. 19‚Äì20 Nine players had played under Brooks at the University of Minnesota (including Rob McClanahan, Mike Ramsey, and Phil Verchota), while four more were from Boston University (Dave Silk, Jack O'Callahan, goaltender Jim Craig, and team captain Mike Eruzione).Coffey, p. 21 As Boston University and Minnesota were perennial rivals in college hockey (for instance, they had faced off in a bitter NCAA national semifinal in 1976), Brooks' selection process was a 300-question psychological test that would give him insight on how every player would react under stress; anyone who refused to take the test would automatically fail. Brooks had to select from 68 players who started the tryout. The average age of the U.S. team was 21 years old, making it the youngest team in U.S. history to play in the Olympics (in addition to being the youngest team in the 1980 Olympic tournament), but Brooks had selected carefully and he knew the limits of every player. As forward John Harrington said, \\"He knew exactly where to quit. He'd push you right to the limit where you were ready to say, 'I've had it, I'm throwing it in' ‚Äî and then he'd back off.\\" Brooks continued the organization by campaigning for the players' selection of Eruzione as the captain, and Craig had been the goalie for him in the 1979 World Championship tournament. Assistant coach Craig Patrick had played with Brooks on the 1967 U.S. national team.Coffey, p. 25 The Soviet and American teams were natural rivals due to the decades-old Cold War. In addition, President Jimmy Carter was at the time considering a U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics, to be held in Moscow, in protest of the December 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. On February 9, the same day the American and Soviet teams met in an exhibition game in New York City, U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance denounced the impending Moscow games at an IOC meeting.Coffey, pp. 159‚Äì160 President Carter eventually decided in favor of the boycott. =Exhibitions= In exhibitions that year, Soviet club teams went 5‚Äì3‚Äì1 against National Hockey League (NHL) teams and, a year earlier, the Soviet national team had routed the NHL All-Stars 6‚Äì0 to win the Challenge Cup. In 1979‚Äì80, virtually all the top North American players were Canadians, although the number of U.S.-born professional players had been on the rise throughout the 1970s. The 1980 U.S. Olympic team featured several young players who were regarded as highly promising, and some had signed contracts to play in the NHL immediately after the tournament. In September 1979, before the Olympics, the American team started exhibition play. They played a total of 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and the United States.Coffey, p. 26 Through these games, Brooks instilled a European style of play in his team, emphasizing wide-open play with sufficient body contact. He believed it would be the only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets. From the start of the exhibition matches, he conducted the team through skating wind sprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and back. Some of the players took to calling these \\"Herbies\\". On September 17, the team played to a 3‚Äì3 tie in Norway. Believing the team wasn't putting up sufficient effort, an angry Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game and, after a while, arena custodians turned the lights off and the Herbies continued in the dark. The two teams played again the next night, with the US winning handily 9-0. Near the end of the exhibition season, Brooks, because of subpar play, threatened to cut Eruzione (the captain) from the team and replace Craig with Steve Janaszak as the starting goaltender, although he had supported them throughout. In their last exhibition game, against the Soviets at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, February 9, the Americans were crushed 10‚Äì3.Coffey, pp. 46‚Äì48 Soviet head coach Viktor Tikhonov later said that this victory \\"turned out to be a very big problem\\" by causing the Soviets to underestimate the American team.Coffey, p. 51 The game was also costly for the Americans off-ice, as defenseman Jack O'Callahan pulled a ligament in his knee; however, Brooks kept O'Callahan on the roster, which meant the U.S. was virtually playing with only 19 players throughout the tournament. O'Callahan eventually returned for the game against the Soviets, playing limited minutes. =Olympic group play= In Olympic group play, the Americans surprised many observers with their physical, cohesive play. In their first game on February 12 against favored Sweden, Team USA earned a dramatic 2‚Äì2 draw by scoring with 27 seconds left after pulling goalie Jim Craig for an extra attacker. Then came a stunning 7‚Äì3 victory over Czechoslovakia, who were a favorite for the silver medal. With its two toughest games in the group phase out of the way, the U.S. team reeled off three more wins, beating Norway 5‚Äì1, Romania 7‚Äì2, and West Germany 4‚Äì2 to go 4‚Äì0‚Äì1 and advance to the medal round from its group, along with Sweden. In the other group, the Soviets stormed through their opposition undefeated, often by grossly lopsided scores. They defeated Japan 16‚Äì0, the Netherlands 17‚Äì4, Poland 8‚Äì1, Finland 4‚Äì2, and Canada 6‚Äì4 to easily qualify for the next round, although both the Finns and the Canadians gave the Soviets tough games for two periods. In the end, the Soviet Union and Finland advanced from their group. Game summary Prior to the Friday game, ABC requested that it be rescheduled from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST, so that it could be broadcast live in primetime. However, the IIHF declined the request after the Soviets complained that it would cause the game to air at 4 a.m. Moscow Time, as opposed to 1 a.m. As a result, ABC decided not to broadcast the game live for the U.S. audience and tape delayed it for broadcast during its primetime block of Olympics coverage. Before the game aired, ABC's Olympics host Jim McKay openly stated that the game had already occurred but that they had promised not to spoil its results. In order to accommodate coverage of the men's slalom competition, portions of the game were also edited for time. ABC's 8 to 8:30 p.m. timeslot was instead devoted to the animated special The Pink Panther in: Olym-Pinks. To this day, some who watched the game on television in the United States still believe that it was live. With a capacity of 8,500, the Field House was packed.Coffey, p. 68 The home crowd waved U.S. flags and sang patriotic songs such as \\"God Bless America\\". Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out on a piece of paper, telling them that \\"You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours.\\"Coffey, p. 45 Brooks believed they could win and later said, \\"The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. But we had to get to the point to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, 'It's meant to be. This is your moment and it's going to happen.' It's kind of corny and I could see them thinking, 'Here goes Herb again....' But I believed it.\\" =First period= As in several previous games, the U.S. team fell behind early. Vladimir Krutov deflected a slap shot by Alexei Kasatonov past U.S. goaltender Jim Craig at the 9:12 mark to give the Soviets a 1‚Äì0 lead. At the 14:03 mark, Buzz Schneider scored for the United States on a 50-foot shot from the left boards to tie the game. The Soviets struck again when Sergei Makarov scored with 17:34 gone. With his team down 2‚Äì1, Craig improved his play, turning away many Soviet shots before the U.S. team had another shot on goal. In the waning seconds of the first period, Dave Christian fired a slap shot on Tretiak from away. The Soviet goalie saved the shot but misplayed the rebound, which bounced out some in front of him. Mark Johnson sliced between the two defenders, found the loose puck, and fired it past a diving Tretiak to tie the score with one second left in the period. The first period ended with the game tied 2‚Äì2. =Second period= Tikhonov replaced Tretiak with backup goaltender Vladimir Myshkin immediately after Johnson's tying goal,Coffey, p. 150 a move that shocked players on both teams. Tikhonov later identified this as the \\"turning point of the game\\" and called it \\"the biggest mistake of my career\\".Coffey, p. 152 Years later, when Johnson asked Viacheslav Fetisov, now an NHL teammate, about the move, Fetisov responded with \\"Coach crazy.\\" Myshkin allowed no goals in the second period. The Soviets dominated play in the second period, outshooting the Americans 12‚Äì2, but scored only once, on a power play goal by Aleksandr Maltsev 2:18 into play. After two periods the Soviet Union led, 3‚Äì2. =Third period= Vladimir Krutov was sent to the penalty box at the 6:47 mark of the third period for high-sticking. The Americans, who had managed only two shots on Myshkin in 27 minutes, had a power play and a rare offensive opportunity. Myshkin stopped a Mike Ramsey shot, then U.S. team captain Mike Eruzione fired a shot wide. Late in the power play, Dave Silk was advancing into the Soviet zone when Valeri Vasiliev knocked him to the ice. The puck slid to Mark Johnson.Coffey, pp. 350‚Äì52 Johnson fired off a shot that went under Myshkin and into the net at the 8:39 mark, as the power play was ending, tying the game at 3.Coffey, p. 358 Only a couple of shifts later, Mark Pavelich passed to Eruzione, who was left undefended in the high slot. Eruzione, who had just come onto the ice, fired a shot past Myshkin, who was screened by Vasili Pervukhin.Coffey, p. 374 This goal gave Team USA a 4‚Äì3 lead, its first of the game, with exactly 10 minutes remaining to play. The Soviets, trailing for the first time in the game, attacked ferociously. Moments after Eruzione's goal, Maltsev fired a shot which ricocheted off the right goal post.Coffey, p. 377 As the minutes wound down, Brooks kept repeating to his players, \\"Play your game. Play your game.\\"Coffey, p. 379 Instead of going into a defensive crouch, the United States continued to play offense, even getting off a few more shots on goal.Coffey, p. 381 The Soviets began to shoot wildly, and Sergei Starikov admitted that \\"we were panicking.\\" As the clock ticked down below a minute, the Soviets got the puck back into the American zone, and Mikhailov passed to Vladimir Petrov, who shot wide.Coffey, p. 383 The Americans fully expected Tikhonov to pull the goalie in the waning seconds. To their surprise, Myshkin stayed in the game. Starikov later explained that \\"We never did six-on-five,\\" not even in practice, because \\"Tikhonov just didn't believe in it.\\"Coffey, p. 384 Craig kicked away a Petrov slap shot with 33 seconds left. Kharlamov fired the puck back in as the clock ticked below 20 seconds. A wild scramble for the puck ensued, ending when Johnson found it and passed it to Ken Morrow. As the U.S. team tried to clear the zone (move the puck over the blue line, which they did with seven seconds remaining), the crowd began to count down the seconds left. Sportscaster Al Michaels, who was calling the game on ABC along with former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden, picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call: The March 3, 1980 cover of Sports Illustrated ran without any accompanying captions or headlines. As his team ran all over the ice in celebration, Herb Brooks sprinted back to the locker room and cried.Coffey, p. 387 In the locker room afterwards, players spontaneously broke into a chorus of \\"God Bless America\\". After the gold medal-securing victory over Finland, they received a congratulatory phone call from President Jimmy Carter. During the broadcast wrap-up after the game, ABC Olympic sports anchor Jim McKay compared the American victory over the Soviet professionals to a group of Canadian college football players defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers (the recent Super Bowl champions and at the height of their dynasty).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxnXqnRS3XQ American aftermath =Gold medal= Jim Craig's gear from 1980, at the Hockey Hall of Fame The United States did not win the gold medal by defeating the USSR. In 1980, the medal round was a round-robin, not a single elimination format as it is today. Under Olympic rules at the time, the group game with Sweden was counted along with the medal round games versus the Soviet Union and Finland, so it was mathematically possible for the United States to finish anywhere from first to third. Needing to win to secure the gold medal, Team USA came back from a 2‚Äì1 third-period deficit to defeat Finland 4‚Äì2. According to Mike Eruzione, coming into the dressing room for the second intermission, Brooks turned to his players, looked at them, and said, \\"If you lose this game, you'll take it to your fucking graves.\\" He then walked towards the locker room door, paused, looked over his shoulder, and said to them again, \\"Your fucking graves.\\" At the time, the players ascended a podium to receive their medals and then lined up on the ice for the playing of the national anthem, as the podium was only meant to accommodate one person. Only the team captains remained on the podium for the duration. After the completion of the anthem, Eruzione motioned for his teammates to join him on the podium.Coffey, pp. 412‚Äì13 Today, podiums are not used for ice hockey; the teams line up on their respective blue lines after the final game. The cover of the March 3, 1980, issue of Sports Illustrated was a photograph by Heinz Kluetmeier of the American players celebrating and waving an American flag; it did not feature any explanatory captions or headlines, because, as Kluetmeier put it, \\"It didn't need it. Everyone in America knew what happened.\\" The U.S. team also received the magazine's \\"Sportsmen of the Year\\" award, and were also named Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press and ABC's Wide World of Sports. In 2004, ESPN, as part of its 25th anniversary, declared the Miracle on Ice to be the top sports headline moment and game of the period 1979‚Äì2004. The victory was voted the greatest sports moment of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated. Olympic cauldron at the 2002 Winter Olympics. =After the 1980 Winter Olympics= At the 1981 Canada Cup, the United States, with seven players from their 1980 Olympic team, again faced the Soviet Union. The Soviets took the opening round encounter 4‚Äì1 in Edmonton. At the 1982 World Championship in Finland, with Mike Ramsey, Mark Johnson, Buzz Schneider, and John Harrington, the Americans again met the Soviets, but once again the U.S. lost, 8‚Äì4. =Later careers= Of the 20 players on Team USA, 13 eventually played in the NHL.Coffey, p. 318 Five of them played over 500 NHL games, and three of them played over 1,000 NHL games. *Neal Broten played one more season for the Golden Gophers before moving on to the NHL, and he appeared in 1,099 NHL games over 17 seasons‚Äî992 of them with the Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars franchise. He captained the Stars before being traded midway through the 1994‚Äì95 season to the New Jersey Devils. A two-time All-Star, he tallied 923 career points (289 goals, 634 assists), became the first American player to record 100 points in a season, and he won a Stanley Cup as a member of the Devils in 1995. Broten had already won the NCAA championship in 1979 at the University of Minnesota; this, combined with the Olympic gold medal in 1980 and the 1995 Cup win (Broten scored the Cup-winning goal in Game 4 as Viacheslav Fetisov, playing for the opposing Detroit Red Wings, fell down), made him the first player in the history of the sport to win a championship at the collegiate, professional, and Olympic levels. The Dallas Stars have since retired number 7 for Broten. *Ken Morrow won the Stanley Cup in 1980 as a member of the New York Islanders, becoming the first hockey player to win an Olympic gold medal and the Cup in the same year.Coffey, p. 200 He played 550 NHL games and won three more Cups, all with the Islanders. Morrow later worked for the Islanders as Director of Pro Scouting. *Mike Ramsey played in 1,070 games over 18 years. Fourteen of those years were spent with the Buffalo Sabres, with whom he played 911 games and was a five-time All-Star, captaining the team from 1990 to 1992. In 1995, he played in the Stanley Cup Finals with the Detroit Red Wings, but his team was swept by Neal Broten and the New Jersey Devils. In 2000, Ramsey became an assistant coach for the Minnesota Wild. *Dave Christian spent 14 years in the NHL, the bulk of them for the original Winnipeg Jets (for whom he served as team captain) and Washington Capitals. In 1990, he played in the Stanley Cup Finals while with the Boston Bruins, but the Bruins lost in five games to the Edmonton Oilers. He ended his career with 783 points (340 goals, 443 assists) in 1,009 games and made the All-Star team in 1991. *Mark Johnson played for several teams in the NHL before finding a home in New Jersey, tallying 508 career points (203 goals, 305 assists) in 669 games over 11 seasons. Like Christian, Ramsey, and Broten, he became an NHL All-Star (in 1984) and served as Hartford Whalers team captain. In 2002, Johnson became the coach of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison women's team, leading the Badgers to National Championships in 2006, 2007 (which the Badgers won in the same Lake Placid arena in which the Miracle took place), 2009, 2011, and 2019. Johnson also served as head coach of the women's ice hockey team that won the silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics. *Jack O'Callahan played 390 NHL regular season games between 1982 and 1989 for the Chicago Blackhawks and New Jersey Devils. *Mark Pavelich played 355 NHL regular season games in the NHL for the New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars, and San Jose Sharks between 1981 and 1992. *Dave Silk played 249 NHL regular season games for the Boston Bruins, Winnipeg Jets, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers between 1980 and 1985. The Miracle on Ice launched the careers of several players and made broadcaster Al Michaels famous. *Jim Craig appeared in 30 NHL games for the Atlanta Flames, Boston Bruins, and Minnesota North Stars between 1980 and 1984. *Team captain Mike Eruzione did not play any high-level ice hockey after the 1980 Olympics, as he felt that he had accomplished all of his hockey goals with the gold medal win. He did work as a hockey television analyst in the 1980s and 1990s. *Craig Patrick, Brooks' assistant coach and assistant general manager, both managed and coached the New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. As a result of his success with the Penguins, who won two Stanley Cups while Patrick was general manager, he was enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002. During that same year, he served as general manager of the Herb Brooks-coached 2002 U.S. hockey team that won the silver medal at the Salt Lake City games. *Herb Brooks, the team coach, coached several NHL teams following the Olympics, with mixed results. He returned to the Olympics as coach of the French team in 1998, the first Olympics in which NHL players competed. Brooks then led Team USA to the silver medal in 2002, which included a 2‚Äì2 round-robin draw and a 3‚Äì2 semi-final victory over Russia (the successor to the Soviet Union), the semi-final match coming 22 years to the day after the \\"Miracle on Ice\\" game. Brooks died in a car crash near Forest Lake, Minnesota on August 11, 2003 at the age of 66. In 2005, the Olympic Center ice arena in Lake Placid where the Miracle on Ice took place was renamed in his honor. *Al Michaels got the job as play-by-play announcer for ice hockey at Lake Placid because he was the only member of ABC's broadcasting team who had previously called the sport (at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan). Michaels was named \\"Sportscaster of the Year\\" in 1980 for his coverage of the event. Michaels spent 26 more years covering sport for ABC before moving to NBC to call Sunday Night Football alongside John Madden and then Cris Collinsworth. Soviet aftermath =Silver medal= In the Soviet locker room, Tikhonov singled out first-line players Tretiak, Kharlamov, Petrov, and Mikhailov, and told each of them, \\"This is your loss!\\"Coffey, p. 389 Two days after the Miracle on Ice, the Soviet team defeated Sweden 9‚Äì2, winning the silver medal. The Soviet players were so upset at their loss that they did not turn in their silver medals to get their names inscribed on them, as is custom.Coffey, p. 413 The result stunned the Soviet Union and its news media. =After the 1980 Winter Olympics= Despite the loss, the USSR remained the pre-eminent power in Olympic hockey until its 1991 break-up. The Soviet team did not lose a World Championship game until 1985 and did not lose to the United States again until 1991.Coffey, pp. 396‚Äì97 Throughout the 1980s, NHL teams continued to draft Soviet players in hopes of enticing them to eventually play in North America. Soviet emigrant Victor Nechayev made a brief appearance with the Los Angeles Kings in the 1982‚Äì83 season and, during the 1988‚Äì89 season, the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation agreed to let veteran Sergei Pryakhin join the Calgary Flames. =NHL careers= Former Soviet National team player Helmuts Balderis, pictured in 2014. Balderis played a season late in his career with the Minnesota North Stars of the NHL. In the 1989-90 season, Soviet authorities permitted six more 1980 Olympians - Helmuts Balderis, Viacheslav Fetisov, Alexei Kasatonov, Vladimir Krutov, Sergei Makarov, and Sergei Starikov - to join NHL clubs, but only after they agreed to play in their final World Championship (where they won gold). Makarov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year in 1989‚Äì90, becoming the oldest player to win that award. Fetisov was a teammate of Mike Ramsey on the 1995 Detroit Red Wings team that lost the Stanley Cup Final to Neal Broten and the New Jersey Devils. Fetisov completed his career by winning Cups with the Red Wings in 1997 and 1998; the first Cup win also made Fetisov a member of the Triple Gold Club, consisting of individuals who have won a Stanley Cup plus gold medals at the Olympics and World Championships. Notable rematches The U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Winter Olympics in 1988. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7‚Äì5 and won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh. The two teams met again at the 1992 Olympics in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5‚Äì2. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth. The U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by Viacheslav Fetisov, met twice in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which included a 2‚Äì2 round-robin draw and a 3‚Äì2 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \\"Miracle on Ice\\" game. The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze. The U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2‚Äì2 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T.J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \\"Marathon on Ice\\" due to its length. Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing to Canada in the semifinals), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals). Popular culture A made-for-TV movie Miracle on Ice, starring Karl Malden as Brooks and Steve Guttenberg as Craig, aired on ABC television in 1981. Retrieved May 3, 2008 It incorporated actual game footage and original commentary from the 1980 Winter Games. The final episode of People's Century, \\"Fast Forward\\", featured the Miracle on Ice as illustrating the Cold War. The documentary film Do You Believe in Miracles?, narrated by Liev Schreiber, premiered on HBO in 2001 and was subsequently released on home video. Retrieved May 23, 2008 In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures released the film Miracle, directed by Gavin O'Connor and starring Kurt Russell as Brooks. Al Michaels recreated his commentary for most of the games. The final ten seconds, however, and his \\"Do you believe in miracles? YES!\\" call, were from the original broadcast and used in the film since the filmmakers felt that they could not ask him to recreate the emotion he felt at that moment. The film was dedicated to Brooks, who died shortly after principal photography completed. The documentary Of Miracles And Men, which was directed by Jonathan Hock, premiered on ESPN in 2015 as part of the channel's 30 for 30 series. The story of the 1980 matchup is told from the Soviet perspective.

He was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, to a socially prominent family. After attending Phillips Academy, Andover Fletcher went on to Harvard University from 1903 to 1907, when he dropped out shortly after his father's death. Background Fletcher lived in England for a large portion of his life. While in Europe he associated with Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, and other Imagist poets; he was one of the six Imagists who adopted the name and stuck to it until their aims were achieved.Glenn Hughes, Imagism and the Imagists, Stanford University Press, New York, 1931 Fletcher resumed a liaison with Florence Emily \\"Daisy\\" Arbuthnot (n√©e Goold) at her house in Kent. She had been married to Malcolm Arbuthnot and Fletcher's adultery with her was the grounds for the divorce. The couple married on July 5, 1916. The marriage produced no children, but Arbuthnot's son and daughter from her previous marriage lived with the couple, who later divorced. On January 18, 1936, Fletcher married a noted author of children's books, Charlie May Simon. The two of them built \\"Johnswood\\", a residence on the bluffs of the Arkansas River, then outside Little Rock. They traveled frequently to New York for the intellectual stimulation, and to the American West and South for the climate, after Fletcher developed chronic arthritis. Fletcher suffered from depression, and on May 10, 1950, committed suicide by drowning himself in a pond near his home in Little Rock, Arkansas. Fletcher is buried at historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock. A branch of the Central Arkansas Library System is named in his honor. Poetry Fletcher circa 1917 In 1913 Ezra Pound in his New Freewoman review commended Fletcher for the individuality of rhythm in his first volume of poems.Imagist Poetry, (ed. Peter Jone s) Penguin Books Ltd, London 1972 Those early works include Irradiations: Sand and Spray (1915), and Goblins and Pagodas (1916). Amy Lowell said of him, \\"No one is more absolute master of the rhythm of verse libre\\".Lowell Amy, Tendencies of Modern American Poetry, Macmillan, New York, 1917 Fletcher invented the term 'polyphonic prose' to describe some poetic experiments of Amy Lowell,Miss Lowell's Discovery: Polyphonic Prose Poetry, Chicago 1915 a form he experimented with in Goblins & Pagodas.Imagist Poetry, (ed. Peter Jones) Penguin Books Ltd, London 1972 In later poetic works Fletcher returned to more traditional forms. These include The Black Rock (1928), Selected Poems (1938), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1939, \\"South Star\\" published by Macmillan (1941), and The Burning Mountain (1946). Fletcher later moved back to Arkansas to reconnect with his roots. The subject of his works turned increasingly towards Southern issues and traditionalism. In the late 1920s and 1930s Fletcher was active with a group of Southern writers and poets known as the Southern Agrarians. This group published the classic Agrarian manifesto I'll Take My Stand, a collection of essays rejecting Modernity and Industrialism. In 1937 he wrote his autobiography, Life is My Song, and in 1947 he published Arkansas, a history of his home state. Johnswood, his Little Rock home, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

His biography of the American labor leader and socialist Eugene Victor Debs is widely considered definitive, and his account of the Scopes trial has also received high praise. Both titles are still in print, and both, along with many of his other works, have been widely used in college courses across the United States. Early life Ginger was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the fourth son and next-to-last child of an affluent Southern family that moved to Indiana (Debs' home state) while he was very young. The family soon plunged into abject poverty with the Great Depression. After four years \\"squatting\\" in a series of unoccupied houses in Greencastle while their eldest son attended DePauw college, the Ginger family settled in Indianapolis, still in extremely difficult circumstances. These experiences deeply influenced Ray Ginger's political convictions and much of his historical work: in later life he frequently recounted his childhood humiliation when sent to collect the bag of flour that was the only form of public welfare available, and also the intense personal rage that dominated his youth. Education Despite his troubled childhood, and the resulting troubled personality, he was accepted to both Harvard College and the University of Chicago before his 17th birthday. He later joked that he chose Chicago in the belief that it would be easier to augment his scholarship with part-time employment \\"in a big city like Chicago than in a small town like Cambridge.\\" He didn't think to look at a map, and wouldn't have dreamed of asking for advice. At Chicago he soon took a step towards fulfilling his supreme ambition at that time‚Äîto become a sportswriter‚Äîby landing a post as a copyboy at the Chicago Tribune‚Äî\\"the only time my father was ever really proud of me.\\" As the United States entered World War II, most of the reporters became foreign correspondents, and Ginger was promoted to a writing job in the city room. His journalistic career was ended by the military draft, but the interruption to his academic education proved only temporary. Soon after basic training, Military Intelligence sent him to the University of Michigan for Japanese language training, where he met his first wife, later civil-liberties lawyer Ann Fagan Ginger. Ginger was next a code-breaker near Washington‚Äîwork for which an education in statistical analysis would have been more appropriate than linguistic studies. There, in the closing days of the war, he joined the Communist Party, thinking the revolution was just around the corner. His interest in Eugene Debs had already begun to crystallize into a determination to write a definitive biography, drawing on both archival sources and interviews with some of the many individuals then living who had known Debs well. Fortunately the recently enacted GI Bill provided an easy means of support for this enterprise. Ann Arbor, which was close to his wife's family home and where he had already accumulated academic credits while studying Japanese, seemed the obvious place to begin; he completed his bachelor's degree there, and then (the book not being finished) stayed for a master's degree in economics. Still drawing on GI benefits in the cause of literature, he then entered a Ph.D program in American Studies at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio (now Case Western Reserve University), where he completed The Bending Cross (Rutgers University Press, 1949). This classic biography met great critical acclaim, including an assessment by the eminent American historian Henry Steele Commager as \\"the best biography of Debs.\\" It has almost never been out of print in the intervening years; Haymarket Books issued the most recent edition in 2006. Academic career and blacklisting After earning a Western Reserve Ph.D. in 1951 after having his published biography accepted as his dissertation, Ginger took up a post at Harvard Business School as editor of the Business History Review, with a little teaching on the side. Besides his editorial duties there, he wrote numerous scholarly articles in economics, labor history, and business history, researched a projected biography of Clarence Darrow, and enjoyed every prospect for a distinguished academic career. The McCarthy Era ended his time at Harvard. When it seemed probable that both Ginger and his wife might be subpoenaed by the Massachusetts equivalent of the U.S. House Committee on Unamerican Activities, on June 16, 1954, Harvard University officials threatened him with immediate dismissal despite his three-year contract if he did not sign an oath declaring that he was not a member of the Communist Party. They required a similar oath from his wife, who had no connection to the university. When Ginger instead chose to resign, Harvard insisted that he leave the state immediately as a condition of receiving the two weeks salary remaining on his existing contract. Ginger, his pregnant wife, and their small son went to New York on two days notice to stay with relatives they had never met. Ann Ginger gave birth as a charity patient, and the marriage came to a rancorous halt not long thereafter. Ginger worked in New York for the next six years, first in advertising and then as an editor at the book publishers Alfred A. Knopf and Henry Holt. He remarried in 1956 and published of two works of history, Altgeld's America and Six Days or Forever?. He remained bitter for being ejected from the academic world and then apparently blacklisted. Later career In 1960, Brandeis University offered him an assistant professorship in the history department. He stayed there for six years, becoming a tenured full professor, chairing the Committee on American Civilization, writing several more books, coaching the tennis team, and evolving rare pedagogical gifts. This remarkable talent received tangible acknowledgment many years after his death, when a former student (William Friedman, Brandeis '65), raised $2.5 million to endow the Ray Ginger Professorship of History at the university. After leaving Brandeis in 1966, Ginger taught briefly at Stanford University and moved on to tenured positions at Wayne State University in Detroit and the University of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada. He died in Boston in 1975 of complications from acute alcoholism, survived by his third wife and two sons from his first marriage. Most of his papers were presented to the Labor History Archives at Wayne State University, where they are available for scholarly consultation. Continuing controversy The details of Ginger's dismissal from Harvard remain unclear. In September 2000, Ann Fagan Ginger wrote a letter to the Harvard Board of Overseers demanding an apology for Harvard's actions. She also made public FBI files that document Ginger's account of being required to sign an oath. It was the first documented instance in which Harvard had made such a demand. Harvard had publicly announced it would remove members of the Communist Party but not those who refused to answer questions about party affiliation. Harvard replied a few months later, admitting that Ginger had been forced out but not apologizing. Board of Overseers President Sharon Gagnon wrote: \\"I would not presume to ... second-guess the motives or judgments of individuals in that difficult time. It seems clear, however, that Harvard took an action in the case of Mr. Ginger that many thoughtful people today, looking back, would not find appropriate.\\" Ann Ginger found the response insufficient and said Harvard needed a truth and reconciliation commission to make it face what it had done. Francis Boyle, law professor at the University of Illinois, and a 1976 graduate of Harvard Law School, has led a national campaign to lobby Harvard to conduct a public inquiry, issue a meaningful apology, and endow a chair in the Gingers' name for the study of peace, justice, and human rights.

Hongqiao Airport mainly serves domestic and regional flights, although the airport also serves international flights. The airport is located near the town of Hongqiao in Changning District and Minhang District, west of downtown, and is closer to the city center than the area's primary international airport, Shanghai Pudong. Hongqiao Airport is a hub for China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Juneyao Airlines and Spring Airlines. In 2016, Hongqiao Airport handled 40,460,135 passengers, making it the 7th busiest airport in China and the 45th busiest in the world.ACI releases World Airport Traffic Report 2010 By the end of 2011 Hongqiao Airport hosted 22 airlines serving 82 scheduled passenger destinations. Shanghai Hongqiao Airport was also certified with the Skytrax 5-Star Airport Rating for facilities, terminal comfort and cleanliness, shopping, food & beverages and staff service in 2019. History Jimmy Choo store in Terminal 2 The construction of Hongqiao airport was started in 1921. In May 1923, the airport was opened for mixed civilian use. In 1937, Hongqiao was the site of the so-called 'Oyama Incident' in which a Japanese lieutenant was shot dead by Chinese Peace Preservation Corps soldiers in the lead-up to the Battle of Shanghai. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the airport was occupied by the Japanese and used as an air force base. Its military use continued after being handed over to the Republic of China government and, later, the People's Republic of China government. From late 1963, it was rebuilt for civilian use, and was re-opened in April 1964. A major expansion took place from March to September 1984, and another from December 1988 to December 1991. Hongqiao Airport served as Shanghai's primary airport until the completion of Pudong International Airport in 1999, when almost all international flights were moved to Pudong. The airport presently offers mainly domestic flights, as well as five international routes to central Tokyo's Haneda Airport, central Seoul's Gimpo International Airport, central Taipei Songshan Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, and Macau's Macau International Airport. Since 1 January 2013, holders of valid passports issued by 45 countries have not needed a visa if transiting through Hongqiao Airport. Domestic passenger flights gate of the Terminal 1 The check-in hall of the new Terminal 2 In preparation for the Shanghai Expo, on 16 March 2010 Hongqiao Airport completed a five-year 15.3-billion-yuan expansion project, which included a 3,300-meter second runway and the new Terminal 2, boosting Hongqiao's capacity to 40 million passengers a year. Terminal 2 is four times the size of Terminal 1 and houses 90 percent of all airlines at the airport (Terminal 1 is now used only for international flights and Spring Airlines and XiamenAir). With the new runway, Shanghai became the first city in China to have five (now seven) runways for civilian use (Pudong and Hongqiao combined). Starting from the end of 2014, Hongqiao Airport Terminal 1 underwent its biggest renovation since 1921. The entire project was scheduled for completion in 2017. On March 26, 2017, Building A of Terminal 1 was fully renovated and reopened to public. The old Building B was closed for reconstruction, and it was expected to be revamped and open to public in mid-2018.

Air traffic control at Hongqiao ordered Juneyao Airlines Flight 1112, en route from Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport to Hongqiao, to terminate its approach and allow the Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER to land. The pilot of Juneyao Airlines Flight 1112 ignored repeated orders to abort their landing and give Flight 888 priority, ultimately forcing the Qatar Airways flight to go-around. Both aircraft landed safely without injury or damage to the aircraft.

The airport and the railway station are served by three stations of the metro network: * Hongqiao Railway Station: Line 2, Line 10, Line 17 * Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2 station: Line 2, Line 10 * Hongqiao Airport Terminal 1 station: Line 10 The proposed extension of the Shanghai Maglev Train from Longyang Road through Shanghai South Railway Station to Hongqiao would connect the two airports. At top speed, the maglev would take only 15 minutes to travel the 55 km route. Original plans called for completing the extension by 2010, in time for the Expo 2010; however, the Hongqiao extension has been indefinitely postponed due to protests.

They and their essay collection, I‚Äôll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition, contributed to the Southern Renaissance of Southern literature in the 1920s and 1930s. They were based at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. John Crowe Ransom was their unofficial leader, though Robert Penn Warren became their most prominent member. The membership overlaps with The Fugitives. Members The twelve authors of the Southern Agrarians manifesto, I'll Take My Stand, were: *Donald Davidson, poet, essayist, reviewer and historian *John Gould Fletcher, poet and historian *Henry Blue Kline *Lyle H. Lanier *Andrew Nelson Lytle, poet, novelist and essayist *Herman Clarence Nixon *Frank Lawrence Owsley, historian *John Crowe Ransom, poet, professor, essayist *Allen Tate, poet *John Donald Wade, biographer and essayist *Robert Penn Warren, poet, novelist, essayist and critic, later first poet laureate of the United States *Stark Young, novelist, drama and literary critic, playwright Other writers associated with the Agrarians include Richard M. Weaver, Caroline Gordon, Brainard Cheney and Herbert Agar. Background and general ideas The Agrarians, evolved from a philosophical discussion group known as the \\"Fugitives\\" or \\"Fugitive Poets\\". Many of the Southern Agrarians and Fugitive poets were connected to Vanderbilt University, either as students or as faculty members. Davidson, Lytle, Ransom, Tate, and Warren all attended the university; Davidson and Ransom later joined the faculty, along with Wade and Owsley. They were known also as \\"Twelve Southerners\\", the \\"Vanderbilt Agrarians\\", the \\"Nashville Agrarians\\", the \\"Tennessee Agrarians\\", and the \\"Fugitive Agrarians\\". They were offended by H. L. Mencken's attacks on aspects of Southern culture that they valued, such as its agrarianism, conservatism, and religiosity.Shapiro, Edward S. (1972). Southern Agrarians, H. L. Mencken, and the Quest for Southern Identityrticle/view/2401/2360 \\"\\", American Studies 13: 75-92. They sought to confront the widespread and rapidly increasing effects of modernity, urbanism, and industrialism on American (but especially Southern) culture and tradition. The informal leader of the Fugitives and the Agrarians was John Crowe Ransom, but in a 1945 essay, he announced that he no longer believed in either the possibility or the desirability of an Agrarian restoration, which he declared a \\"fantasy\\".Ransom, John Crowe (1945). \\"Art and the Human Economy\\", Kenyon Review 7: 686. = I'll Take My Stand = I'll Take My Stand was criticized at the time, and since, as a reactionary and romanticized defense of the Old South and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. It ignored slavery and denounced \\"progress\\", for example, and some critics considered it to be moved by nostalgia... A key quote from the \\"Introduction: A Statement of Principles\\" to their 1930 book I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition: Though the book was reviewed widely, it only sold about 2000 copies as of 1940. =Other publications= The Southern Agrarians were the most prolific contributors to The American Review, edited by Seward Collins. Various Agrarians contributed as many as 70 articles, led by Donald Davidson with 21. Collins eventually became a public supporter of fascism. Several of the Agrarians came to regret (and renounce) their relationship with Collins, however, after his political views became better known. Agrarian Allen Tate wrote a rebuttal of fascism for the liberal The New Republic in 1936. Nevertheless, Tate remained in contact with Collins and continued to publish in The American Review until its demise, in 1937. Chapel Hill Sociologists In the 1930s, the Agrarians were challenged by the modernizing social scientists (the \\"Chapel Hill Sociologists\\") based at the University of North Carolina (in Chapel Hill) and led by Howard W. Odum, on issues of urbanism, social progress, and the very nature and definition of the South. The sociologists produced Rupert Vance's The Human Geography of the South (1932), and Odum's Southern Regions of the United States (1936), as well as numerous articles in the journal Social Forces. The sociologists argued that the problems in the South stemmed from traditionalism which ought to and could be cured by modernization, the opposite of the Agrarian viewpoint.. Warren Robert Penn Warren emerged as the most accomplished of the Agrarians. He became a major American poet and novelist, winning the Pulitzer Prize for his 1946 All the King's Men. At a reunion of the Fugitive Poets in 1956, Warren confessed that for about a decade ‚Äî from just before World War II to some years after ‚Äî he had shut Agrarianism from his mind as irrelevant to the cataclysmic social and political events then playing out in the world. Now, however, he believed that, rather than being irrelevant, his old Agrarian enthusiasms were tied into the major problems of the age. In the modern world, the individual had been marginalized, stripped of any sense of responsibility, or of past or place. \\"In this context,\\" writes Paul V. Murphy, \\"the Agrarian image of a better antebellum South came to represent for Warren a potential source of spiritual revitalization. The past recalled, not as a mythical 'golden age' but 'imaginatively conceived and historically conceived in the strictest readings of the researchers', could be a 'rebuke to the present'.\\"Murphy, Paul V. (2001). The Rebuke of History: Introduction , University of North Carolina Press. It was Warren's concern with democracy, regionalism, personal liberty and individual responsibility that led him to support the civil rights movement, which he depicted in his nonfiction works Segregation (1956) and Who Speaks for the Negro? (1965) as a struggle for identity and individualism. As Hugh Ruppersburg, among others, has argued, Warren's support for the civil rights movement paradoxically stemmed from Agrarianism, which by the 1950s, meant for him something very different from the Agrarianism of I'll Take My Stand.Ruppenburg, Hugh (1990). Robert Penn Warren and the American Imagination, University of Georgia Press. As Warren's political and social views evolved, his notion of Agrarianism evolved with them. He came to support more progressive ideas and racial integrationSmith, Sandy (2008). \\"Voices from the Past\\" and was a close friend of the eminent African-American author Ralph Ellison.Ealy, Steven D. (2006). \\"'A Friendship That Has Meant So Much': Robert Penn Warren and Ralph W. Ellison\\", The South Carolina Review Vol. 38, No. 2: 162-172. While Donald Davidson took a leading role in the attempt to preserve the system of segregation, Warren took his stand against it. As Paul V. Murphy writes, \\"Loyalty to the southern past and the ambiguous lessons of Agrarianism led both men in very different directions.\\" Recent conservatives In recent decades, some traditionalistic conservatives such as Allan C. Carlson, Joseph Scotchie, and Eugene Genovese have praised the Agrarian themes in light of what they see as the failures of highly urbanized and industrialized modern societies.. Today, the Southern Agrarians are regularly lauded in the conservative media such as the Southern Partisan. Some of their social, economic, and political ideas have been refined and updated by writers such as Allan C. Carlson and Wendell Berry. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute has published books which further explore the ideas of the Agrarians.  See also  * Agrarianism * Tennessee literature References Bibliography * . * .

She is best known for her novel Miss MacIntosh, My Darling. In her later years, she was known for teaching creative writing and as a mentor to young authors. \\"She was a respected literary figure as well as a cherished Greenwich Village eccentric.\\" During her lifetime, Young wrote two books of poetry, two historical studies, one collection of short stories, one novel, and one collection of essays. Background Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913, during Marguerite Young's childhood Young was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. Through her father, Chester Ellis Young, she was a collateral descendant of Brigham Young, and by her mother, Fay Herron Knight, she was a direct descendant of John Knox. Young's parents separated when she was very young, and she and her sister, Naomi, were brought up by their maternal grandmother, Marguerite Herron Knight, who was convinced the child Marguerite was the reincarnation of her dead cousin, Little Harry. Her grandmother nurtured Young's love of literature. Career =Education= Young studied at Butler University in Indianapolis, receiving a BA in French and English. She then attended the University of Chicago, auditing Thornton Wilder's writing class at his invitation. She also attended the University of Iowa. In 1936, she earned her MA in Elizabethan and Jacobean Literature. She wrote her master's thesis on Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit by John Lyly (1578). While attending the University of Chicago, Young had a part-time position reading Shakespeare to Minna K. Weissenbach. A patron of Edna St. Vincent Millay, Weissenbach was sometimes known as \\"the opium lady of Hyde Park\\" and she became the inspiration for the Opium Lady in Young's Miss MacIntosh, My Darling. Drug-based flights of fantasy were to make their way into the novel. Later, Young received a Ph.D. in philosophy and English from the University of Iowa, where she taught at the prestigious Iowa Writers' Workshop. =Teaching= She briefly taught at Shortridge High School before embarking on a distinguished literary career. In New York she held a contract lectureship in English literature during the 1960s at Fordham University. =Works= 1965 cover of Miss MacIntosh, My Darling by Marguerite Young Young's first book of poetry, Prismatic Ground, was published in 1937, while she was teaching English at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis. In that same year, she visited the commune of New Harmony, Indiana, where her mother and stepfather resided. After her MA, she taught at an Indianapolis high school and at the University of Iowa. In 1943, she moved to New York, where she became known for her works Moderate Fable (1944 or 1945) and Angel in the Forest (1945). She relocated to New Harmony and spent seven years there, beginning work on Angel in the Forest, a study of utopian concepts and communities, at the same time producing Moderate Fable (1944), which won the poetry prize from the National Academy of Arts and Letters. Angel in the Forest appeared in 1945 and was well received, winning Guggenheim and Newberry Library awards. Over the next fifty years, while maintaining an address in New York City's Greenwich Village, Young traveled extensively and was part of a wide literary circle that included Mari Sandoz, Richard Wright, Ana√Øs Nin, Flannery O'Connor, Marianne Hauser and Allen Tate, with whom she had an affair. She also had a complex friendship with Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. She wrote articles, poetry, and book reviews while also teaching creative writing at various venues, including the New School for Social Research, Fordham University, and the Iowa Writers' Workshop. In 1944, Scribners commissioned her to write a new work, ultimately published as the epic novel Miss MacIntosh, My Darling (1965). Although she had intended to take just two years, she did not finish her novel until 1963. Young described it as \\"an exploration of the illusions, hallucinations, errors of judgment in individual lives, the central scene of the novel being an opium addict's paradise.\\" Ana√Øs Nin, in The Novel of the Future, calls it \\"an epic American novel written in a poetic style.\\" Miss MacIntosh, My Darling was not well received critically but developed a cult following. Young's next project was to be a biography of Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, the creator of Little Orphant Annie. Her experiences in joining the protests against the Vietnam War made her turn her focus to Riley's friendship with Eugene V. Debs. The digression was to occupy the rest of her life, becoming an ambitious biography of Debs, the union organizer who evolved into the first Socialist candidate for President of the United States (1904, 1908, 1912, 1920). She projected a three-volume epic history of the people, through Debs's battles for workers rights and the development of the Locomotive Firemen's workers union. Harp Song for a Radical: The Life and Times of Eugene Victor Debs remained unfinished at the time of her death. Part I, ‚ÄúPrelude in a Golden Key,‚Äù portrays Swiss agnostic Wilhelm Weitling‚Äôs cross-country tour of the pioneer utopian communities built during the settlement of the western United States. He visits the Mormon communities in Nauvoo, Missouri and Salt Lake City, Utah; the Shakers; the Amish communities in Pennsylvania; the Oneida community; the Icarians; the Rappites, and many other settlements in the wilderness. Through this perspective Young establishes that this nation was founded and settled on the principles of communal ownership and mutual assistance. In Part II of Harp Song for a Radical, Young establishes that Eugene Debs was the catalyst through which these principles became the basic tenets of the labor movement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. During Marguerite Young's final illness, her unfinished manuscript was compiled by Marilyn Hamilton and Suzanne Oboler and was then submitted to her publisher. After her death, the manuscript was edited by Charles Ruas to include Young's survey of utopian communities as well as her portraits of major historical figures encountered by Debs in his struggles as a labor organizer: the portraits of Mary Todd Lincoln, James Whitcomb Riley, Joe Hill, Sojourner Truth, Brigham Young, Joseph Smith and Susan B. Anthony. This edited version of Harp Song for a Radical was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1999. Also in her last illness, Marguerite Young returned to writing poetry. Inviting the Muses, a collection of her stories, essays, and reviews, was published by Dalkey Archive Press in 1994. Young‚Äôs papers are at the Beinecke Library, Yale University. Personal and death Young died on November 17, 1995, in Indianapolis, Indiana.

It has been free and open to the public since 1887. Its collections encompass a variety of topics related to the history and cultural production of Western Europe and the Americas over the last six centuries. The Library is named to honor the founding bequest from the estate of philanthropist Walter Loomis Newberry. Core collection strengths support research in several subject areas, including maps, travel, and exploration; music from the Renaissance to the early twentieth century; early contact between Western colonizers and Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere; the personal papers of twentieth-century American journalists; the history of printing; and genealogy and local history. Although the Newberry is a noncirculating library, it welcomes researchers into the reading rooms who are at least 14 years old or in the ninth grade, and have a research topic corresponding to the nature of the collections. Additional public services are offered through exhibitions, meet- the-author lectures, adult education seminars, and other programming. History Library from Washington Square on a c. 1910 postcard The Newberry was established in 1887 as the result of a bequest by Walter Loomis Newberry, an early Chicago resident and business leader involved in banking, shipping, real estate, and other commercial ventures. Newberry died at sea in 1868, while on a trip to France. He included in his will a provision of funds for the creation of a \\"free public library\\" should his daughters die without heirs. They did, and so, following the death of Newberry's widow, Julia Butler Newberry, in 1885, it was up to Newberry estate trustees William H. Bradley and Eliphalet W. Blatchford to bring the library to fruition. Without much direction (Newberry did not leave behind many details regarding his vision for the library) and without its founder's personal collection as a foundation (Newberry's own collection of books perished in the Great Fire of 1871), the first officers and staff members were instrumental in forming the character of the Newberry. The Newberry's first librarian, William Frederick Poole, was a major figure in the library world when he came to the Newberry. Poole saw the Newberry as a blank canvas on which he could project his ideas, which included and perhaps found their most impassioned articulation in the design and construction of libraries. In 1887-88 it was located at 90 La Salle Street, in 1889-90 at 338 Ontario Street, and in 1890-93 at the northwest corner of State and Oak Streets. The present building, designed by PooleWilliam Landram Williamson, \\"William Frederick Poole and the Modern Library Movement,\\" Columbia University Press, 1963. and architect Henry Ives Cobb (1859‚Äì1931), opened in 1893. It is located at 60 West Walton Street, across from Washington Square. It is a structure in the Spanish Romanesque architectural style, built of Connecticut granite. Poole and Cobb feuded bitterly over their different visions for the library building. Poole favored a number of reading rooms with open shelving of materials that could be easily accessed by patrons; Cobb preferred the majestic grandiosity in vogue in Europe and the centralization of collection items. Poole's influence with the library's trustees coerced Cobb to temper the grand staircase he had envisioned and to accommodate open shelving. Over time, however, the open shelving would put too much strain on the Newberry's staff and the security of its collections, and the library would convert to a centralized storage system. Poole served as Newberry librarian until his death in 1894. Under his leadership, the library built broad reference collections that would be useful to many different Chicagoans, especially professionals and tradespeople. The Newberry's medical department, created in 1890, is an example of this emphasis. Poole also steered the Newberry toward the acquisition of rare materials for use by professional scholars. Two en bloc acquisitions made during his tenure, the private collections of Henry Probasco and Count Pio Resse, yielded notable rarities in music and early printed specimens (incunables), as well as Shakespeare folios and editions of Homer, Dante, and Horace. To focus its own collecting and to avoid the duplication of resources in Chicago at large, the Newberry entered into a cooperative agreement in 1896 with the Chicago Public Library and the John Crerar Library, by which each institution would specialize in certain fields of knowledge and areas of service. As a consequence, the Newberry came to specialize in the humanities, and the natural sciences became the province of the Crerar. The Newberry immediately transferred its holdings in this area, including its copy of Audubon's Birds of America. The Newberry's medical department was transferred to the Crerar in 1906. Stanley Pargellis, the fifth Newberry librarian (1942‚Äì1962), emphasized not just the \\"passive\\" collection of materials but also the active orchestration of programs and events to encourage scholarly inquiries into the insights those materials might contain. Under Pargellis, a fellowship program was inaugurated and academic conferences were held at the Newberry, out of which emerged new scholarship using the library's collections. Pargellis also expanded the scope of the collection. Understanding the important role corporations played in American life and believing that those corporations could only be properly assessed if their records were freely accessible, Pargellis started a trend across the library world with the acquisition of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company's private archives. Since this acquisition, in 1943, the Newberry would continue to add to its CB&Q; archives, while collecting the records of other major corporations of the Midwest. Between 1962 and 1986, the library was greatly expanded under the leadership of president Lawrence William \\"Bill\\" Towner. During this time, the Newberry acquired many important collections, a stacks building dedicated to the storage of collection items was constructed, and the library's four research centers were formed. The research centers continue to support and produce important scholarship in their fields, while providing programming for more general audiences. They are the Center for Renaissance Studies, the D'Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian and Indigenous Studies, the Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography, and the William M. Scholl Center for American History and Culture. Under Towner the library assembled a major collection on Herman Melville and co-sponsored the Northwestern-Newberry Melville Edition. In 2017-18, the lobby spaces of the library underwent a $12 million renovation to improve visitor access and exhibition space. Current services Newberry main entrance Washington Square Park The library houses more than 1.5 million books, 5 million manuscript pages, and 500,000 historic maps. Collection strengths include materials on the European Renaissance, genealogy, Indigenous peoples of the Americas, early music, cartography, the history of printing, Chicago history, railroad archives, Luso-Brazilian history, and Midwestern authors' manuscripts. The Newberry's Modern Manuscript Collection includes work by Mike Royko, Elmo Scott Watson, Ben Hecht, Floyd Dell, Sherwood Anderson, Malcolm Cowley, John T. McCutcheon, and Fanny Butcher. Among its most notable collection items are a Shakespeare First Folio, correspondence from Thomas Jefferson, Oswald Cooper's sketches for the Cooper Black typeface, original woodblocks made by Thomas Bewick, a fur trade contract from 1692 containing one of the earliest references to \\"Chicagou,\\" and the oldest copy in existence of the Popol Vuh. It also houses a series of occult books, including the Book of Magical Charms, the Commonplace-Book, and the Cases of Conscience Concerning Witchcrafts, which it invites visitors to its website to translate and transcribe. The Newberry also offers a variety of exhibitions, meet-the-author lectures, continuing education classes, concerts, teacher programs, and other public programming related to its collections. Recent exhibitions have featured Daniel Burnham's famous Plan of Chicago of 1909, artifacts of World War I, and a crowd-sourced aggregation of materials related to love, from heart-shaped Renaissance maps to early twentieth-century American sheet music. The Newberry's Research and Academic Programs Division offers short- and long-term fellowships for local, national, and international scholars, in addition to managing two separate semester-long seminars for undergraduate students. The four research centers foster, generate, and disseminate scholarship in their areas of focus: medieval, early modern, and Renaissance studies; American Indian and Indigenous Studies; the history of cartography; and American history and culture. Reference staff are available in the Newberry's two reading rooms and in its third-floor reference room whenever the library is open. Reference librarians work with all readers and offer orientation, in-depth bibliographical instruction, and specialized assistance as needed. The library is open to all researchers over 14 years of age. The Newberry was the primary institution responsible for the production of the 2004 Encyclopedia of Chicago, a landmark single-volume work that covered Chicago's history from 1630 to 2000. The Atlas of Historical County Boundaries Project, a historical GIS project that aims to map every county boundary configuration in the United States from the early seventeenth century to the present, is also based at the Newberry. The Newberry Bookstore, located in the lobby of the library, curates a selection of books reflecting the Newberry's collection strengths and upcoming public programming, while offering other goods such as cards, posters, and literary action figures.  Newberry Library Award  In 1987, the Newberry established the Newberry Library Award in honor of its 100th anniversary. The Newberry Library Award is an honor bestowed to individuals, and in the case of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, organizations, who have made \\"outstanding contributions to the humanities, particularly in fields of endeavor related to the Newberry‚Äôs collection.\\" The award itself is a scale-sized model of the full-sized Virginio Ferrari sculpture created in 1987 called Umanit√° that greets visitors as they enter the Newberry Library. * 1987: Paul Oskar Kristeller * 1990: Jaroslav Pelikan * Richard J.

ASE is predominantly used on the Unix platform, but is also available for Microsoft Windows. In 1988, Sybase, Microsoft and Ashton-Tate began development of a version of SQL Server for OS/2, but Ashton-Tate later left the group and Microsoft went on to port the system to Windows NT. When the agreement expired in 1993, Microsoft purchased a license for the source code and began to sell this product as Microsoft SQL Server. MS SQL Server and Sybase SQL Server share many features and syntax peculiarities to this day. History Originally for Unix platforms in 1987, Sybase Corporation's primary relational database management system product was initially marketed under the name Sybase SQL Server. In 1988, SQL Server for OS/2 was co- developed for the PC by Sybase, Microsoft, and Ashton-Tate. Ashton-Tate divested its interest and Microsoft became the lead partner after porting SQL Server to Windows NT. Microsoft and Sybase sold and supported the product through version 4.2.1. Sybase released SQL Server 4.2 in 1992. This release included internationalization and localization and support for symmetric multiprocessing systems. In 1993, the co-development licensing agreement between Microsoft and Sybase ended, and the companies parted ways while continuing to develop their respective versions of SQL Server. Sybase released Sybase SQL Server 10.0, which was part of the System 10 product family, which also included Back-up Server, Open Client/Server APIs, SQL Monitor, SA Companion and OmniSQL Gateway. Microsoft continued on with Microsoft SQL Server. Sybase provides native low-level programming interfaces to its database server which uses a protocol called Tabular Data Stream. Prior to version 10, DBLIB (DataBase LIBrary) was used. Version 10 and onwards uses CTLIB (ClienT LIBrary). In 1995, Sybase released SQL Server 11.0. Starting with version 11.5 released in 1996, Sybase moved to differentiate its product from Microsoft SQL Server by renaming it to Adaptive Server Enterprise. Sybase 11.5 added Asynchronous prefetch, case expression in sql, the optimizer can use a descending index to avoid the need for a worktable and a sort. The Logical Process Manager was added to allow prioritization by assigning execution attributes and engine affinity. In 1998, ASE 11.9.2 was rolled out with support for data pages locking, data rows (row-level locking), distributed joins and improved SMP performance. Indexes could now be created in descending order on a column, readpast concurrency option and repeatable read transaction isolation were added. A lock timeout option and task-to- engine affinity were added, query optimization is now delayed until a cursor is opened and the values of the variables are known. In 1999, ASE 12.0 was released, providing support for Java, high availability and distributed transaction management. Merge joins were added, previous all joins were nested loop joins. In addition, cache partitions were added to improve performance. In 2001, ASE 12.5 was released, providing features such as dynamic memory allocation, an EJB container, support for XML, SSL and LDAP. Also added was compressed backups, unichar UTF-16 support and multiple logical page sizes 2K, 4K, 8K, or 16K. In 2005, Sybase released ASE 15.0. It included support for partitioning table rows in a database across individual disk devices, and \\"virtual columns\\" which are computed only when required. In ASE 15.0, many parameters that had been static (which required server reboot for the changes to take place) were made dynamic (changes take effect immediately). This improved performance and reduced downtime. For example, one parameter that was made dynamic was the \\"tape retention in days\\" (the number of days that the backup is kept on the tape media without overwriting the existing contents in the production environment). On January 27, 2010 Sybase released ASE 15.5. It included support for In-Memory and Relaxed-Durability Databases, Distributed transaction management in the shared-disk cluster, faster compression for backups as well as Backup Server Support for the IBM¬Æ Tivoli¬Æ Storage Manager. Deferred Name Resolution for User-Defined Stored Procedures, FIPS 140-2 Login Password Encryption, Incremental Data Transfer, bigdatetime and bigtime Datatypes and tempdb groups were also added. In July 2010, Sybase became a wholly owned subsidiary of SAP America.Press release of Sybase & SAP merger. On September 13, 2011 Sybase released ASE 15.7 at Techwave. It included support for: New Security features - Application Functionality Configuration Groups, a new threaded kernel, compression for large object (LOB) and regular data, End-to-End CIS Kerberos Authentication, Dual Control of Encryption Keys and Unattended Startup and extension for securing logins, roles, and password management, Login Profiles, ALTER... modify owner, External Passwords and Hidden Text, Abstract Plans in Cached Statements, Shrink Log Space, In-Row Off-Row LOB, using Large Object text, unitext, and image Datatypes in Stored Procedures, Using LOB Locators in Transact-SQL Statements, select for update to exclusively lock rows for subsequent updates within the same transaction, and for update-able cursors, Non-materialized, Non-null Columns with a default value, Fully Recoverable DDL (select into, alter table commands that require data movement, reorg rebuild), merge command, Expanded Variable-Length Rows, Allowing Unicode Noncharacters. In April 2014, SAP released ASE 16. It included support for partition locking, CIS Support for HANA, Relaxed Query Limits, Query Plan Optimization with Star Joins, Dynamic Thread Assignment, Sort and Hash Join Operator improvements, Full-Text Auditing, Auditing for Authorization Checks Inside Stored Procedures, create or replace functionality, Query Plan and Execution Statistics in HTML, Index Compression, Full Database Encryption, Locking, Run-time locking, Metadata and Latch enhancements, Multiple Trigger support, Residual Data Removal, Configuration History Tracking, CRC checks for dump database and the ability to calculate the transaction log growth rate for a specified time period. Structure A single standalone installation of ASE typically comprises one \\"dataserver\\" and one corresponding \\"backup server\\". In multi server installation many dataservers can share one backup server. A dataserver consists of system databases and user databases. Minimum system databases that are mandatory for normal working of dataserver are 'master', 'tempdb', 'model', 'sybsystemdb' and 'sybsystemprocs'. 'master' database holds critical system related information that includes, logins, passwords, and dataserver configuration parameters. 'tempdb' is used for storage of data that are required for intermediate processing of queries, and temporary data. 'model' is used as a template for creating new databases. 'sybsystemprocs' consists of system supplied stored procedures that queries system tables and manipulates data in them. ASE is a single process multithreaded dataserver application. Editions There are several editions, including an express edition that is free for productive use but limited to four server engines and 50 GB of disk space per server.

Life and career Zwicky received her BA from the University of Calgary and earned her PhD at the University of Toronto in 1981 where her studies focussed on the philosophy of logic and science. She subsequently taught philosophy at Princeton University; philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities at the University of Waterloo; philosophy at the University of Western Ontario; philosophy, English, and creative writing at the University of New Brunswick; and philosophy at the University of Alberta. Zwicky is Professor Emerita in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Victoria, where she taught both philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities courses from 1996 until 2009. She has served as a faculty member at the Banff Centre Writing Studio, has conducted numerous writing workshops, and served as an editor for Brick Books from 1985 to 2018. From 2017 through 2019, she was the series editor of Oskana Poetry and Poetics, an imprint of the University of Regina Press. Philosophy Zwicky's philosophical work challenges the hegemonic status of logico-linguistic analysis in 20th and 21st century Anglo- American philosophy. She is a realist who aims to defeat analytic skepticism by exploring the relationship between philosophical and poetic thinking, and by developing the notions of resonance and lyric understanding in ontology and epistemology: \\"Lyric shares with the coherentists, pragmatists, and nihilists the view that foundationalism is intellectually bankrupt: that what analytic system cannot sustain is anything like the claim of naive realism. However, lyric shares with naive realism the view that skepticism is false. What it does not share is the view that it is demonstrably, within system, false.\\" (Lyric Philosophy L264) Her books, Lyric Philosophy and Wisdom & Metaphor, discuss but also enact this idea of resonance. They consist of many voices that range across diverse disciplines, so that Zwicky's aphoristic remarks on the left-hand pages are read with and against excerpts from the history of philosophy, musical scores, paintings, photographs, and poems on the right- hand pages. While Zwicky orders her remarks carefully and has a linear philosophical argument to make, each page is also designed to evoke remarks or images from other pages, prompting non-linear connections and directly demonstrating what she refers to as lyric structure, characterized by resonance. Zwicky believes that Heraclitus, Plato, and Wittgenstein have purposefully constructed philosophical texts in this way before her. She cites Freud's distinction between primary and secondary processes, as well as Max Wertheimer's work in gestalt psychology, as support for the concepts she promotes. She references pieces of music, works of art, and natural eco- systems as objects that also exhibit lyric structure. Zwicky presents logical analysis and lyric thinking as complementary and includes both in a broader, more total conception of reason. She believes that the Anglo-American notion of what constitutes good philosophy is excessively narrow, and criticizes Continental and poststructural views for their anti-realist vision of the world as nothing more than a projection of human thought and desire. Zwicky promotes balance, arguing that neglect of either logical or lyric thinking leads to our ontological, epistemological, ethical and environmental peril. Dr. James O. Young, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Victoria has said: \\"There‚Äôs a reasonable chance that people will be reading her work a century from now. This is something that one says about only a very small number of philosophers.\\" Poetry Zwicky's poetry is influenced by music in the classical European, blues, and jazz traditions. It also deals with the natural world, and has often been cited for its intense lyricism. Thirty-seven Small Songs and Thirteen Silences has appeared in Swedish (translated by Roy Isaakson; Palaver Press). Numerous individual poems have been translated into Czech, French, German, Serbian, Spanish and Italian. Among her many accolades, both Zwicky's Songs for Relinquishing the Earth and Robinson's Crossing were shortlisted for Governor General's Awards for Poetry. Songs for Relinquishing the Earth won the award in 1999. Robinson‚Äôs Crossing won the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize in 2004.

An English professor at Vanderbilt University from 1920 to 1965, he was a founding member of the Fugitives and the overlapping group Southern Agrarians, two literary groups based in Nashville, Tennessee. He was a supporter of segregation in the United States. Early life Davidson was born on August 8, 1893 in Campbellsville, Tennessee. His father, William Bluford Davidson, was \\"a teacher and school administrator,\\" and his mother, Elma Wells, was \\"a music and elocution teacher.\\" He had two brothers, John and William. Davidson received a classical education at Branham and Hughes Military Academy, a preparatory school in Spring Hill, Tennessee. He earned both his bachelor's (1917) and master's (1922) degrees at Vanderbilt University. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Army during World War I. Career Davidson was an English professor at Vanderbilt University from 1920 to 1965. While at Vanderbilt, Davidson became associated with the Fugitives, who met to read and criticize each other's verse. Later, they founded a review of the same name, which launched the literary careers of the poets and critics John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren, the poet Laura Riding, and the poet and psychiatrist Merrill Moore. He enjoyed a national reputation as a poet, in part due to the inclusion of his dramatic monologue, \\"Lee in the Mountains\\", in early editions of the influential college literature textbook Understanding Poetry. Its editors were his former students Warren and Cleanth Brooks. From 1923 to 1930, Davidson reviewed books and edited the Nashville Tennessean book page, where he assessed more than 370 books. Around 1930, Davidson began his association with the Southern Agrarians. He was chiefly responsible for the decision of the group to write essays, published as the Agrarian manifesto I'll Take My Stand. Davidson shared the Agrarians' distaste for industrial capitalism and its destructive effect on American culture. Davidson's romantic outlook, however, led him to interpret Agrarianism as a straightforward politics of identity. \\"American\\" identity had become \\"characterless and synthetic,\\" he argued in 1933. He encouraged Americans to embrace their identities as \\"Rebels, Yankees, Westerners, New Englanders or what you will, bound by ties more generous than abstract institutions can express, rather than citizens of an Americanized nowhere, without family, kin, or home.\\" He was in favor of segregation.Susan V. Donaldson, 'Introduction', in I'll Take my Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition, 75th Anniversary Edition, Louisiana State University Press, 2006, p. xxxii In 1931, Davidson began a long association with Middlebury College's Breadloaf School of English. He bought a house in Vermont where he did much of his later writing. He taught at the Breadloaf School every summer until his death. In 1939 his textbook, American Composition and Rhetoric, was published and widely adopted for English courses in American universities.Mark Royden Winchell, Where No Flag Flies: Donald Davidson and the Southern Resistance (2000). Perhaps most widely read today is Davidson's two-volume history: The Tennessee (1946 and 1948), in the Rivers of America series. The second volume is notable for its critique of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the impact of its dam-building and eminent domain land seizure on local society. Although originally a supporter of the New Deal, he was suspicious that the TVA was a plot of northern business interests to exploit and dominate the South. He denounced the TVA as an instrument of political collectivism, run by outsiders, designed to destroy the South's traditions.Edward S. Shapiro, \\"Donald Davidson and the Tennessee Valley Authority: The Response of a Southern Conservative.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly 33.4 (1974): 436-451. In 1952 his ballad opera, Singin' Billy, with music by Charles F. Bryan, was performed at the Vanderbilt Theater. His work as book page editor for the Nashville Tennessean was commemorated in 1963 with the publication of The Spyglass: Views and Reviews, 1924‚Äì1930. A comprehensive collection of his poetry, Poems: 1922‚Äì61, was published in 1966.Ellison, Curtis and Pratt, William. Afterword, The Big Ballad Jamboree, by Donald Davidson. University Press of Mississippi, 1996. Segregationist political activism Davidson was a proponent of racial segregation and racial inequality. In an essay defending segregation in the Sewanee Review, described by Paul V. Murphy as his major work on the topic, he wrote: > The white South denies the Negro equal participation in society, not only > because it does not consider him entitled to equality, but because it is > certain that social mingling would lead to biological mingling, which it is > determined to prevent, both for any given contemporary generation and for > its posterity. Davidson supported the 1948 presidential candidacy of Strom Thurmond, who was running as a Dixiecrat in opposition to President Harry Truman's civil rights proposals. He joined the Tennessee States' Rights Committee in 1950, and became the chairman of the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government (TFCG), the local analogue of the White Citizens Councils, at its founding in 1955. Under his leadership, TFCG led the failed effort to oppose the desegregation of Nashville's public schools. Davidson warned that if black students attended, \\"The capital city of Tennessee would become an uneasy island of integration surrounded by a tumultuous ocean of protest and discontent.\\" Personal life and death Davidson married Theresa Sherrer, a legal scholar and artist, in June 1918.Special Collections : Virtual Reading Room : Fugitives and Agrarians Biographical Sketches They had a daughter, who married Eric Bell, Jr. They resided at 410 Fairfax Avenue in Nashville. He died on April 25, 1968, at age 72, at his home. He was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Nashville.

He served as Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley from 1981 to 2003 after having also held teaching appointments at Stanford University, Rockefeller University, Princeton University, and the University of Chicago. Davidson was known for his charismatic personality and the depth and difficulty of his thought.McGinn, Colin. \\"Cooling it\\". London Review of Books. 19 August 1993. Accessed 28 October 2010. His work exerted considerable influence in many areas of philosophy from the 1960s onward, particularly in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and action theory. While Davidson was an analytic philosopher, and most of his influence lies in that tradition, his work has attracted attention in continental philosophy as well, particularly in literary theory and related areas.Dasenbrock, Reed Way, ed. Literary Theory After Davidson. Penn State Press, 1989. Although published mostly in the form of short, terse essays that do not explicitly rely on any overriding theory, his work is nonetheless noted for a highly unified character, the same methods and ideas brought to bear on a host of apparently unrelated problems, and for synthesizing the work of a great number of other philosophers. He developed an influential truth-conditional semantics, attacked the idea of mental events as governed by strict psychological laws, and rejected the conception of linguistic understanding as having to do with conventions or rules, concluding famously that \\"there is no such thing as a language, not if a language is anything like what many philosophers and linguists have supposed. There is therefore no such thing to be learned, mastered, or born with.\\" His philosophical work, as a whole, is said to be concerned with how human beings communicate and interact with one another. Life and career Davidson was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on March 6, 1917, to Clarence (\\"Davie\\") Herbert Davidson and Grace Cordelia Anthony. The family lived in the Philippines from shortly after Davidson's birth until he was about 4. Then, having lived in Amherst and Philadelphia, the family finally settled on Staten Island when Davidson was 9 or 10. He then began to attend public school and had to begin in first grade with much younger children. He then attended the Staten Island Academy, starting in fourth grade. At Harvard University, he switched his major from English and comparative literature (Theodore Spencer on William Shakespeare and the Bible, Harry Levin on James Joyce) to classics and philosophy. Among his influences was Alfred North Whitehead; Davidson said that \\"Whitehead took me under his wing; he would invite me to his apartment for afternoon tea all the time.\\"\\"An Interview with Donald Davidson\\". He graduated in 1939, with a B.A. magna cum laude. Davidson was a pianist and always had an interest in music, later teaching philosophy of music at Stanford. At Harvard, he was in the same class as the conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, with whom Davidson played piano four hands. Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for the production which Davidson mounted of Aristophanes' play The Birds in the original Greek. Some of the music was later to be reused in Bernstein's ballet Fancy Free. After graduation, he went to California, where he wrote radio scripts for the private-eye drama Big Town, starring Edward G. Robinson. He returned to Harvard on a scholarship in classical philosophy, teaching philosophy and concurrently undergoing the intensive training of Harvard Business School. Before he had the opportunity to graduate from Harvard Business School, Davidson was called up by the US Navy, for which he had volunteered. He trained pilots to recognize enemy planes and participated in the invasions of Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio. After three and a half years in the Navy, he tried unsuccessfully to write a novel before returning to his philosophy studies and earning his doctorate in philosophy in 1949 under Raphael Demos and Donald Cary Williams. Plato's Philebus was the topic of his dissertation which was eventually published in 1990. Under the influence of W. V. O. Quine, whom he often credited as his mentor, he began to gradually turn toward the more formal methods and precise problems characteristic of analytic philosophy. In the 1950s, Davidson worked with Patrick Suppes on developing an experimental approach to Decision Theory. They concluded that it was not possible to isolate a subject's beliefs and preferences independently of one another so there would always be multiple ways to analyze a person's actions in terms of what they wanted or were trying to do or valued. That result was comparable to Quine's thesis on the indeterminacy of translation and figured significantly in much of Davidson's later work on philosophy of mind. His most noted work (see below) was published in a series of essays from the 1960s onward, moving successively through philosophy of action into philosophy of mind and philosophy of language, and dabbling occasionally in aesthetics, philosophical psychology, and the history of philosophy. Davidson was widely traveled and had a great range of interests he pursued with enormous energy. Apart from playing the piano, he had a pilot's license, built radios, and he was fond of mountain climbing and surfing. He was married three times. His first wife was the artist Virginia Davidson, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Elizabeth (Davidson) Boyer.Baghramian, Maria, ed. Donald Davidson: Life and Words. Routledge, 2013. Following his divorce from Virginia Davidson, he married for the second time to Nancy Hirschberg, Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later at Chicago Circle. She died in 1979.\\"Nancy Ann Hirschberg, In Memoriam, 1937 - 1979\\" In 1984, Davidson married for the third and last time, to philosopher Marcia Cavell.\\"In Memoriam: Donald Davidson \\" He served terms as president of both the Eastern and Western Divisions of the American Philosophical Association, and held various professional positions at Queens College (now part of CUNY), Stanford (1961-1967), Princeton (1967-1970), Rockefeller University (1970-1976), and the University of Chicago (1976-1981). From 1981 to his death he was at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor of Philosophy. In 1995, he was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize. Philosophical work =Actions, reasons, and causes= Davidson's most noted work began in 1963 with an essay, \\"Actions, Reasons, and Causes,\\" which attempted to refute the prevailing orthodox view, widely attributed to Ludwig Wittgenstein but already present in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, that an agent's reasons for acting cannot be the causes of his action (Malpas, 2005, ¬ß2). Instead, Davidson argued that, \\"rationalization (the providing of reasons to explain an agent's actions) is a species of ordinary causal explanation\\" (1963, p. 685). In particular, action A is explained by what Davidson called a primary reason, which involves a pro-attitude (roughly, a desire) toward some goal G and an instrumental belief that performing action A is a means to attaining G. For example, someone's primary reason for taking an umbrella outside on a rainy day might be that wanting to stay dry and believing that taking an umbrella is a means to stay dry today. This view, which largely conforms to common-sense folk psychology, was held in part on the ground that while causal laws must be strict and deterministic, explanation in terms of reasons need not. Davidson argued that the fact that the expression of a reason was not so precise did not mean that the having of a reason could not itself be a state capable of causally influencing behavior. Several other essays pursue consequences of this view and elaborate Davidson's theory of actions. =Mental events= In \\"Mental Events\\" (1970) Davidson advanced a form of token identity theory about the mind: token mental events are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was that it did not seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing that the sky is blue or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain. Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating types (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to types of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything more than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position anomalous monism: monism, because it claims that only one thing is at issue in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from a-, \\"not,\\" and homalos, \\"regular\\", also nomos (law)) because mental and physical event types could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions). Davidson argued that anomalous monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, he assumes the denial of epiphenomenalism, the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, he assumes a nomological view of causation, according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing the relation between the events. Thirdly, he assumes the principle of the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between mental event types and physical event types. By these three theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the mental and the physical hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the mental and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, ¬ß2). =Truth and meaning= In 1967 Davidson published \\"Truth and Meaning,\\" in which he argued that any learnable language must be statable in a finite form even if it is capable of a theoretically infinite number of expressions, as may be assumed that natural human languages are, at least in principle. If it could not be stated in a finite way, it could not be learned through a finite, empirical method such as the way humans learn their languages. It follows that it must be possible to give a theoretical semantics for any natural language that could give the meanings of an infinite number of sentences on the basis of a finite system of axioms. Following, among others, Rudolf Carnap (Introduction to Semantics, Harvard 1942, 22) Davidson also argued that \\"giving the meaning of a sentence\\" was equivalent to stating its truth conditions, so stimulating the modern work on truth-conditional semantics. To sum up, he proposed that it must be possible to distinguish a finite number of distinct grammatical features of a language, and for each of them explain its workings in such a way as to generate trivial (obviously correct) statements of the truth conditions of all the (infinitely many) sentences making use of that feature. Thus, a finite theory of meaning can be given for a natural language; the test of its correctness is that it would generate (if applied to the language in which it was formulated) all the sentences of the form \\"'p' is true if and only if p\\" (\\"'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white\\"). (They are called T-sentences: Davidson derives the idea from Alfred Tarski.) This work was originally delivered in his John Locke Lectures at Oxford and launched a large endeavor by many philosophers to develop Davidsonian semantical theories for natural language. Davidson himself contributed many details to such a theory, in essays on quotation, indirect discourse, and descriptions of action. =Knowledge and belief= After the 1970s Davidson's philosophy of mind picked up influences from the work of Saul Kripke, Hilary Putnam, and Keith Donnellan, all of whom had proposed a number of troubling counterexamples to what can be generally described as descriptivist theories of content. The views, which roughly originate in Bertrand Russell's Theory of Descriptions, held that the referent of a name, which object or person the name refers to, is determined by the beliefs a person holds about that object. Kripke et al. argued that this was not a tenable theory, and that in fact whom or what a person's beliefs were about was in large part (or entirely) a matter of how they had acquired those beliefs, and those names, and how if at all the use of those names could be traced \\"causally\\" from their original referents to the current speaker. Davidson picked up this theory, and his work in the 1980s dealt with the problems in relating first-person beliefs to second- and third-person beliefs. It seems that first person beliefs (\\"I am hungry\\") are acquired in very different ways from third person beliefs (someone else's belief, of me, that \\"He is hungry\\"). How can it be that they have the same content? Davidson approached the question by connecting it with another one: how can two people have beliefs about the same external object? He offers, in answer, a picture of triangulation: beliefs about oneself, beliefs about other people, and beliefs about the world come into existence jointly. Many philosophers throughout history had, arguably, been tempted to reduce two of these kinds of belief and knowledge to the other one: Ren√© Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds. =Radical interpretation= Davidson's work is well noted for its unity, as he has brought a similar approach to a wide variety of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning. The significance of this conclusion is that it allows Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively. Davidson points out that beliefs and meanings are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true based on what he believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time. Davidson argues that because the language is compositional, it is also holistic: sentences are based on the meanings of words, but the meaning of a word depends on the totality of sentences in which it appears. That holistic constraint, along with the requirement that the theory of truth is law-like, suffices to minimize indeterminacy just enough for successful communication to occur. In summary, what radical interpretation highlights is what is necessary and sufficient for communication to occur. The conditions are to recognize speakers as speakers, their beliefs must be mostly coherent and correct, according to the principle of charity; indeterminacy of meaning does not undermine communication, but it must be constrained just enough.

Macy, Greg Kinnear, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Reubens, Kel Mitchell, Wes Studi, Geoffrey Rush, Lena Olin, Eddie Izzard, Claire Forlani, and Tom Waits. The film details the story of a team of lesser superheroes with unimpressive powers who are required to save the day. Despite its list of stars, Mystery Men made a little over $33 million worldwide against a $68 million budget. Plot In Champion City, would-be superhero team of Mr. Furious, the Shoveler and the Blue Raja attempt to make a name for themselves, but their suspect skills make them ineffective and they are always upstaged by the city's powerful and arrogant superhero, Captain Amazing. However, Amazing‚Äôs crime fighting prowess has practically made his job obsolete. Without any worthy adversaries (most are either dead, in exile, or in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to pull out. To create a need for his services, Amazing uses his alter ego, billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of his nemesis, supervillain Casanova Frankenstein, from an insane asylum. The plan backfires; once released and reunited with his henchman Tony P and his Disco Boys, Casanova Frankenstein blows up the asylum, easily outwits and captures Amazing, and prepares to unleash the \\"Psycho-frakulator\\", which lethally bends reality, on the city. On a stakeout of Casanova Frankenstein's mansion, Mr. Furious observes Amazing's capture and informs his team. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the three realize that they need more allies. Through word-of- mouth and auditions they recruit Invisible Boy, the Spleen, and the Bowler. The emboldened team ambush Casanova‚Äôs limousine, but only succeed in annoying him. While drunk from celebrating their ‚Äúvictory,‚Äù the team is nearly killed in retaliation by Tony P and the Disco Boys. They are saved by the Sphinx, a mysterious superhero who agrees to train them. The Sphinx‚Äôs unconventional team-building exercises and antimetabole rhetoric annoy Mr. Furious, who temporarily quits. The group also seek out Doc Heller, who specializes in non- lethal weaponry, to equip them for their battle. The team break into Casanova's mansion during a gathering of several of the city's gangs; but, while attempting to free Captain Amazing, they inadvertently set off the Psycho-frakulator and kill him. Without Amazing, the team despairs of saving the city, but the Shoveler delivers a pep talk that succeeds in uniting and inspiring them. With new resolve, the team assaults the mansion again. Making effective use of their negligible superpowers and Heller's quirky weapons, they manage to subdue Casanova Frankenstein's henchmen. But Casanova Frankenstein holds Mr. Furious' new girlfriend, Monica, hostage and activates the Psycho-frakulator, which begins to wreak havoc upon the city. While the team works to disable the device, Mr. Furious takes on Casanova Frankenstein, unleashes his inner rage and fights effectively for the first time. Casanova Frankenstein is thrown into the core of the Psycho-frakulator and killed by its reality-bending powers. The rest of the team helps The Bowler to destroy the device and escape the mansion as it implodes. The team is swarmed by reporters who want to know the group's name. As they argue possible names among themselves, one reporter states, \\"Well, whatever you may call them, Champion City will forever owe a debt of gratitude to these 'Mystery Men',\\" but the others are too busy arguing to hear it. Cast Production In 1997, Mike Richardson, publisher of Dark Horse Comics, pitched the \\"Mystery Men\\" concept to producers Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin at Universal. \\"My first impression was just how relatable the characters are,\\" Levin said \\"Bob [Burden] has a real surrealistic sensibility, but at the core of his work is something that's thematically so identifiable. I think there is an almost childlike persistence of all the characters. And they ultimately hold on to the conviction that with courage and sacrifice, they can become what they dream.\\"Drawn to the Odd; Cult comic book artist Bob Burden created the offbeat Mystery Men and now his unlikely ragtag superheroes are moving to the big screen. Los Angeles Times; 02 Aug 1999: 1. The film was announced in mid-1997 along with a raft of comic book adaptations including Blade, Virus, Superman Lives, X-Men, The Fantastic Four, The Hulk, Captain America, The Sub-Mariner, Iron Man, Daredevil and Silver Surfer, Hellboy, Concrete, Green Hornet and 26 other titles.USA TODAY; 01 Aug 1997: D, 1:2. That fall, Danny DeVito was in talks for a $13-million deal to both star and direct, but negotiations broke down over who would produce the soundtrack. \\"It was a big deal for me,\\" DeVito said. \\"I really wanted it, so I walked away from the project.\\"Los Angeles Times, 16 Nov 1997: CAL, 5:1.

Usher, who had been approached for other films, was discouraged when he saw the script for Mystery Men . \\"I thought it was boring,\\" he said. \\"However, the premise was great.\\" He continued, \\"Most of the movies made by commercial directors are heavy on visuals and thin on content.

Stiller was originally offered the Blue Raja role, but was not interested in playing what he called a \\"nerdy guy\\" again. \\"The minute you start doing the same thing in comedy, people go, 'Oh, I've seen that,'\\" he said. He took the role of Mr. Furious but explained, \\"In the original script, he was just angry all the time, but I thought that would be boring, so one of the changes I made is that he has the least power.

I don't know what that says.\\"\\"Reubens camps it up.\\" New York Times Special Features. Orlando Sentinel; 01 Aug 1999: F3. According to Stiller, the script was fluid. \\"The script was being reworked all the time by... everybody! Because everybody kind of wanted to personalize their part, and try to make it as funny as possible. So yeah, that was welcome. That was the idea we had going in, to just have everybody kind of get together and try to make it as funny as we could. Especially in the context of a big action, special effects type movie. You know, a lot of the time what gets lost is the specific character stuff, and the small moments that really have to work for the whole thing to work. So that's what we were concentrating on as much as possible. And it's good if everybody's on board with that, you know what I mean? And I think Hank, myself and Paul and Janeane were probably most involved in that process, for our characters. We're used to working that way.\\"Star Interviews; Rye, (Sep 6, 1999). Usher said, \\"We did a lot of unscripted stuff. I let Ben and Janeane go. They were totally free.\\" Usher said he wanted \\"the film to look flat, like a comic book. I tried to capture that alternate reality but keep the edgy humor.\\"\\"Enemies of crime and pithiness.\\" Spin. Aug 1, 1999: 72-73. Shooting began on October 21, 1998 in Los Angeles, and was completed the following April. \\"I thought it would be quick, but it ended up being this six month shoot,\\" Stiller recalled.Star Interviews; Rye (Sep 6, 1999). Bob Burden was on the set for some of the shoot, answering questions that came up about his creations. \\"There were times when we were kind of stumped in a scene and we asked him what he thought,\\" Levin said. \\"The great thing about him is that 10 minutes later, we'd get 30 pages in the fax machine with probably 29 pages filled with the lousiest ideas that you've ever read but that one page of pure genius.\\"Drawn to the Odd; Cult comic book artist Bob Burden created the offbeat Mystery Men and now his unlikely ragtag superheroes are moving to the big screen.

Los Angeles Times; 25 July 1999: 6. Music The musical score for Mystery Men was composed by Stephen Warbeck. Written within a 28-day time span, the score was recorded on the Sony Scoring Stage. \\"I was quite liberal in the choice of instruments, because I've chosen a couple of Hungarian instruments, the t√°rogat√≥ and the cimbalom, and also a Greek instrument, the bouzouki,\\" said Warbeck on the film's range of sounds. \\"And then Mike Fisher and the other percussionists have brought along an exciting range of stuff which are so interesting and varied that we keep picking bits of those and adding them in.\\" After Warbeck's contributions were completed, the film's producers decided to alter various scenes. Because of this, composer Shirley Walker was brought in to create additional music and rearrange Warbeck's score to fit the new running time. A soundtrack album was released on July 6, 1999 by Interscope Records. Additional songs featured in the film include: * \\"Planet Claire\\" ‚Äì The B-52s * \\"O Mio Babbino Caro\\" (Composed by Giacomo Puccini) ‚Äì Miriam Gauci * \\"Play That Funky Music\\" ‚Äì Wild Cherry * \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\" - Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band Release =Box office= Universal delayed the film's release one week to avoid competing with the opening of The Blair Witch Project.\\"'Blair Witch' has 'em running scared: Abbott, Jim.

By the end of its run, on October 14, the film had grossed $29,762,011 domestically and $3,699,000 internationally, for a worldwide total of $33,461,011. Given its $68 million budget, the film is a box office bomb. =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 61% based on 104 reviews, with average rating of 5.75/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Absurd characters and quirky gags are brought to life by a talented cast, providing this superhero spoof with lots of laughs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 65 out of 100 rating based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Variety thought the film \\"may contain more yuks than the summer's other big pop sendup, the second 'Austin Powers,' but it also spreads them over an ultimately tiresome two hours...Though pic boasts several action sequences that are expertly handled and laden with dazzling effects, its most engaging passages by far are the ones focusing on the central sextets' banter and interaction.\\" Kenneth Turan wrote, \\"Watching 'Mystery Men' is a bit like sitting next to a brilliant person at a dinner party who just won't shut up. Because this film is so self-conscious and, like Mr. Furious and friends, has a tendency to try too hard, it's an effort you end up admiring more than completely loving. Influenced by its betters, films such as Brazil, Buckaroo Banzai and even Blade Runner, it's destined to join them all in cult film heaven.\\"Los Angeles Times, 06 Aug 1999: 1. Jonathan Romney said that it was \\"a desperately hit-and-miss affair\\". Michael Dequina of The Movie Report said that it \\"fails to come up with worthy gags and one-liners for the able cast.\\" Steve Murray of Cox News Service gave it a negative review, saying \\"Mystery Men is like its hapless heroes. It's a wannabe that has the best intentions ‚Äì including a pronounced anti-gun stance ‚Äì but none of the knack it takes to save the day, or itself.\\" Newsday wrote, \\"'Mystery Men' manages to exalt both the terminally weird and the frighteningly mundane with such flamboyant good spirits that you overlook its occasional dead zones and dull patches. Try as it might to prop up its static plot, the movie is more comic revue than action comedy. Viewed within these parameters, 'Mystery Men' is as satisfying as a heaping helping of Abbott-and-Costello shorts. And much smarter than the average doofus blockbuster.\\"Newsday. 06 Aug 1999: B06.

Remains of Norse buildings were found at L'Anse aux Meadows near the northern tip of Newfoundland in 1960. This discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the Norse in the North Atlantic.Fitzhugh, William W, ‚ÄòVikings: The north Atlantic saga', Anthronotes museum of natural history publication for education, available at www.anthropology.si.edu. The Norse settlements on the North American island of Greenland lasted for almost 500 years. L'Anse aux Meadows, the only confirmed Norse site in present-day Canada, was small and did not last as long. Voyages (for example to collect timber) are likely to have occurred for some time, but there is no evidence of any lasting Norse settlements on mainland North America.Irwin, Constance; Strange Footprints on the Land; Harper&Row;, New York, 1980; Norse Greenland A map of the Eastern Settlement on Greenland, covering approximately the modern municipality of Kujalleq.

There is no special reason to doubt the authority of the information that the sagas supply regarding the very beginning of the settlement, but they cannot be treated as primary evidence for the history of Norse Greenland because they embody the literary preoccupations of writers and audiences in medieval Iceland that are not always reliable.Grove, Jonathan. 2009. , in Norse Greenland: Selected Papers of the Hvalsey Conference 2008, Journal of the North Atlantic Special Volume 2, 30‚Äì51 Erik the Red (Old Norse: Eir√≠kr rau√∞i), having been banished from Iceland for manslaughter, explored the uninhabited southwestern coast of Greenland during the three years of his banishment.He remained there making explorations for three years and decided to found a settlement there (). He made plans to entice settlers to the area, naming it Greenland on the assumption that \\"people would be more eager to go there because the land had a good name\\". The inner reaches of one long fjord, named Eiriksfjord after him, was where he eventually established his estate Brattahlid. He issued tracts of land to his followers.Wernick, Robert; The Seafarers: The Vikings, (1979), 176 pages, Time-Life Books, Alexandria, Virginia: . Map showing the extent of the Norse world Norse Greenland consisted of two settlements. The Eastern was at the southwestern tip of Greenland, while the Western Settlement was about 500 km up the west coast, inland from present-day Nuuk. A smaller settlement near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the Middle Settlement. The combined population was around 2,000‚Äì3,000. At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists. Norse Greenland had a bishopric (at Gar√∞ar) and exported walrus ivory, furs, rope, sheep, whale or seal blubber, live animals such as polar bears, supposed \\"unicorn horns\\" (in reality narwhal tusks), and cattle hides. In 1126, the population requested a Bishop (headquartered at Gar√∞ar), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King. They continued to have their own law and became almost completely politically independent after 1349, the time of the Black Death. In 1380, the Norwegian Kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. =Western trade and decline= There is evidence of Norse trade with the natives (called Skraelings by the Norse). The Norse would have encountered both Native Americans (the Beothuk, related to the Algonquin) and the Thule, the ancestors of the Inuit. The Dorset had withdrawn from Greenland before the Norse settlement of the island. Items such as comb fragments, pieces of iron cooking utensils and chisels, chess pieces, ship rivets, carpenter's planes, and oaken ship fragments used in Inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of Norse colonization. A small ivory statue that appears to represent a European has also been found among the ruins of an Inuit community house. Map showing the expansion of the Thule people (900 to 1500) The settlement began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Gar√∞ar died in 1377. After a marriage was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent radiocarbon date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (¬±15 years). Several theories have been advanced to explain the decline. The Little Ice Age of this period would have made travel between Greenland and Europe, as well as farming, more difficult; although game and seal hunting provided a healthy diet, there was more prestige in cattle farming, and there was increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and plague epidemics. In addition, Greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in European markets by cheaper ivory from Africa. Despite the loss of contact with the Greenlanders, the Norwegian-Danish crown continued to consider Greenland a possession. Not knowing whether the old Norse civilization remained in Greenland or not‚Äîand worried that if it did, it would still be Catholic 200 years after the Scandinavian homelands had experienced the Reformation‚Äîa joint merchant-clerical expedition led by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland in 1721. Though this expedition found no surviving Europeans, it marked the beginning of Denmark's re- assertion of sovereignty over the island. = Climate and Norse Greenland = Norse Greenlanders were limited to scattered fjords on the island that provided a spot for their animals (such as cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and cats) to be kept and farms to be established. In these fjords, the farms depended upon byres to host their livestock in the winter, and routinely culled their herds in order to survive the season. The coming warmer seasons meant that livestocks were taken from their byres to pasture, the most fertile being controlled by the most powerful farms and the church. What was produced by livestock and farming was supplemented with subsistence hunting of mainly seal and caribou as well as walrus for trade. The Norse mainly relied on the Nordrsetur hunt, a communal hunt of migratory harp seals that would take place during spring. Trade was highly important to the Greenland Norse and they relied on imports of lumber due to the barrenness of Greenland. In turn they exported goods such as walrus ivory and hide, live polar bears, and narwhal tusks. Ultimately these setups were vulnerable as they relied on migratory patterns created by climate as well as the well-being of the few fjords on the island. A portion of the time the Greenland settlements existed was during the Little Ice Age and the climate was, overall, becoming cooler and more humid. As climate began to cool and humidity began to increase, this brought longer winters and shorter springs, more storms and affected the migratory patterns of the harp seal. Pasture space began to dwindle and fodder yields for the winter became much smaller. This combined with regular herd culling made it hard to maintain livestock, especially for the poorest of the Greenland Norse. In spring, the voyages to where migratory harp seals could be found became more dangerous due to more frequent storms, and the lower population of harp seals meant that Nordrsetur hunts became less successful, making subsistence hunting extremely difficult. The strain on resources made trade difficult, and as time went on, Greenland exports lost value in the European market due to competing countries and the lack of interest in what was being traded. Trade in elephant ivory began competing with the trade in walrus tusks that provided income to Greenland, and there is evidence that walrus over-hunting, particularly of the males with larger tusks, led to walrus population declines. In addition, it seemed that the Norse were unwilling to integrate with the Thule people of Greenland, either through marriage or culture. There is evidence of contact as seen through the Thule archaeological record including ivory depictions of the Norse as well as bronze and steel artifacts. However, there is essentially no material evidence of the Thule among Norse artifacts. In older research it was posited that it was not climate change alone that led to Norse decline, but also their unwillingness to adapt. For example, if the Norse had decided to focus their subsistence hunting on the ringed seal (which could be hunted year round, though individually), and decided to reduce or do away with their communal hunts, food would have been much less scarce during the winter season. Also, had Norse individuals used skin instead of wool to produce their clothing, they would have been able to fare better nearer to the coast, and wouldn't have been as confined to the fjords. However, more recent research has shown that the Norse did try to adapt in their own ways. Some of these attempts included increased subsistence hunting. A significant number of bones of marine animals can be found at the settlements, suggesting increased hunting with the absence of farmed food. In addition, pollen records show that the Norse didn't devastate the small forests and foliage as previously thought. Instead the Norse ensured that overgrazed or overused sections were given time to regrow and moved to other areas. Norse farmers also attempted to adapt. With the increased need for winter fodder and smaller pastures, they would self-fertilize their lands in an attempt to keep up with the new demands caused by the changing climate. However, even with these attempts, climate change was not the only thing putting pressure on the Greenland Norse. The economy was changing, and the exports they relied on were losing value. Current research suggests that the Norse were unable to maintain their settlements because of economic and climatic change happening at the same time. Vinland Leif Erikson traveling to North America Christian Krogh (1893). According to the Icelandic sagasEirik the Red's Saga, Saga of the Greenlanders, plus chapters of the Hauksb√≥k and the Flatey Bookthe Norse started to explore lands to the west of Greenland only a few years after the Greenland settlements were established. In 985, while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400‚Äì700 settlers and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named Bjarni Herj√≥lfsson was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his findings to Leif Erikson who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later. The sagas describe three separate areas that were explored: Helluland, which means \\"land of the flat stones\\"; Markland, \\"the land of forests\\", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and Vinland, \\"the land of wine\\", found somewhere south of Markland. It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded. =Leif's winter camp= The 1590 Sk√°lholt Map showing Latinized Norse placenames in North Americahttp://www.myoldmaps.com/renaissance-maps-1490-1800/4316-skalholt- map/4316-skalholt-map.pdf: * Land of the Risi (a mythical location) * Greenland * Helluland (Baffin Island) * Markland (the Labrador Peninsula) * Land of the Skr√¶lingjar (location undetermined) * Promontory of Vinland (the Great Northern Peninsula) Using the routes, landmarks, currents, rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed from Greenland westward across the Labrador Sea, with a crew of 35‚Äîsailing the same knarr Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as \\"level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline.\\" Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it. However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind. Leif wintered in 1001, probably near Cape Bauld on the northern tip of Newfoundland, where one day his foster father Tyrker was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \\"wine-berries.\\" Squashberries, gooseberries, and cranberries all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing fermented berries as \\"wine.\\" Leif spent another winter at \\"Leifsb√∫√∞ir\\" without conflict, and sailed back to Brattahl√≠√∞ in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father. =Thorvald's voyage (1004 AD)= In 1004, Leif's brother Thorvald Eiriksson sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered canoes. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the barricade. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland. Summer in the Greenland coast circa year 1000 by Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen (1841‚Äì1893) =Karlsefni's expedition (1009 AD)= In 1009, Thorfinn Karlsefni, also known as \\"Thorfinn the Valiant\\", supplied three ships with livestock and 160 men and womenOxenstierna, Eric; The Norsemen (1965), 320 pages, New York Graphic Soc.: (although another source sets the number of settlers at 250). After a cruel winter, he headed south and landed at Straumfjord. He later moved to Straums√∂y, possibly because the current was stronger there. A sign of peaceful relations between the indigenous peoples and the Norsemen is noted here. The two sides bartered with furs and gray squirrel skins for milk and red cloth, which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of headdress. There are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to Karlsefni came storming out of the wood, so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats and rowed away. They returned three days later, in force. The natives used catapults, hoisting \\"a large sphere on a pole; it was dark blue in color\\" and about the size of a sheep's belly, which flew over the heads of the men and made an ugly din. The Norsemen retreated. Leif Erikson's half-sister Freyd√≠s Eir√≠ksd√≥ttir was pregnant and unable to keep up with the retreating Norsemen. She called out to them to stop fleeing from \\"such pitiful wretches\\", adding that if she had weapons, she could do better than that. Freyd√≠s seized the sword belonging to a man who had been killed by the natives. She pulled one of her breasts out of her bodice and struck it with the sword, frightening the natives, who fled. Pseudohistory Purported runestones have been found in North America, most famously the Kensington Runestone. These are generally considered to be hoaxes or misinterpretations of Native American petroglyphs.Annette Kolodny, \\"Fictions of American Prehistory: Indians, Archeology, and National Origin Myths\\", American Literature 75 4: 693‚Äì721, December 2003 full text at Project MUSE There are many claims of Norse colonization in New England, none well founded.

He published several books on the topic and had plaques, monuments, and statues erected in honor of the Norse. His work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.Steven Williams, Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory, 1991.Gloria Polizzotti Greis . Needham Historical Society Other nineteenth-century writers, such as Horsford's friend Thomas Gold Appleton, in his A Sheaf of Papers (1875), and George Perkins Marsh, in his The Goths in New England, seized upon such false notions of Viking history also to promote the superiority of white people (as well as to oppose the Catholic Church). Such misuse of Viking history and imagery reemerged in the twentieth century among some groups promoting white supremacy. Duration of Norse contact Settlements in continental North America aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland.Diamond, Jared: Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed It is unclear why the short-term settlements did not become permanent, though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples, referred to as Skr√¶lings by the Norse. Nevertheless, it appears that sporadic voyages to Markland for forages, timber, and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400 years.Schledermann, Peter. 1996. Voices in Stone.

Historiography A reconstruction of Norse buildings at the UNESCO listed L'Anse aux Meadows site in Newfoundland, Canada. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that iron working, carpentry, and boat repair were conducted at the site. For centuries it remained unclear whether the Icelandic stories represented real voyages by the Norse to North America. The sagas first gained serious historic respectability in 1837 when the Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name Winland, first appeared in written sources in a work by Adam of Bremen from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the Sagas of Icelanders, were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. These Norse sites were also depicted in the Sk√°lholt Map, made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570 and depicting part of northeastern North America and mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland. Evidence of the Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad and her husband, outdoorsman and author Helge Ingstad, excavated a Norse site at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. The location of the various lands described in the sagas remains unclear, however. Many historians identify Helluland with Baffin Island and Markland with Labrador. The location of Vinland poses a thornier question. In 2012 Canadian researchers identified possible signs of Norse outposts in Nanook at Tanfield Valley on Baffin Island, as well as on Nunguvik, Willows Island, and Avayalik. Unusual fabric cordage found on Baffin Island in the 1980s and stored at the Canadian Museum of Civilization was identified in 1999 as possibly of Norse manufacture; that discovery led to more in-depth exploration of the Tanfield Valley archaeological site for points of contact between Norse Greenlanders and the indigenous Dorset people. Archeological findings in 2015 at Point Rosee, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, were originally thought to reveal evidence of a turf wall and the roasting of bog iron ore, and therefore a possible 10th century Norse settlement in Canada. Findings from the 2016 excavation suggest the turf wall and the roasted bog iron ore discovered in 2015 were the result of natural processes. The possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery in 2014, and archaeologists excavated the area in 2015 and 2016. Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, one of the leading experts of Norse archaeology in North America and an expert on the Norse site at L'Anse aux Meadows, is unsure of the identification of Point Rosee as a Norse site. Archaeologist Karen Milek was a member of the 2016 Point Rosee excavation and is a Norse expert. She also expressed doubt that Point Rosee was a Norse site as there are no good landing sites for their boats and there are steep cliffs between the shoreline and the excavation site. In their November 8, 2017, report Sarah Parcak and Gregory Mumford, co- directors of the excavation, wrote that they \\"found no evidence whatsoever for either a Norse presence or human activity at Point Rosee prior to the historic period\\" and that \\"none of the team members, including the Norse specialists, deemed this area as having any traces of human activity.\\" See also * Settlement of the Americas * Timeline of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact * Point Rosee * Danish-Norwegian colonization of the Americas References External links * L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site of Canada website * Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website * Freda Harold Research Papers at Dartmouth College Library Populated places established in the 10th century 10th century in North America 15th century in North America ","title":"Norse colonization of North America"},{"id":"295765","title":"Lego Technic"},{"id":"295767","text":"Old Forge may refer to: * Old Forge, Herefordshire, England * Old Forge, New York, USA * Old Forge, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, USA * Old Forge, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, USA * Old Forge, County Antrim, a townland in County Antrim, Northern Ireland ","title":"Old Forge"},{"id":"295768","title":"Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565"},{"id":"295772","text":"The epact (, from Greek: = added days) used to be described by medieval computists as the age of a phase of the Moon in days on 22 March; in the newer Gregorian calendar, however, the epact is reckoned as the age of the ecclesiastical moon on 1 January. Its principal use is in determining the date of Easter by computistical methods. It varies (usually by 11 days) from year to year, because of the difference between the solar year of 365366 days and the lunar year of 354355 days.Latin text and French translation of the Second Canon of the Gregorian calendar Lunar calendar Epacts can also be used to relate dates in the lunar calendar to dates in the common solar calendar. =Solar and lunar years= A (solar) calendar year has 365 days (366 days in leap years). A lunar year has 12 lunar months which alternate between 30 and 29 days (in leap years, one of the lunar months has a day added). If a solar and lunar year start on the same day, then after one year, the start of the solar year is 11 days after the start of the lunar year; after two years, it is 22 days after. These excess days are epacts, and are added to the day of the solar year to determine the day of the lunar year. Whenever the epact reaches or exceeds 30, an extra (embolismic or intercalary) month is inserted into the lunar calendar, and the epact is reduced by 30. Leap days extend both the solar and lunar year, so they do not affect epact calculations for any other dates. =19-year cycle= The tropical year is about 365¬º days, while the synodic month is slightly longer than 29¬Ω days, on average; both are non- integers. This gets corrected in the following way. Nineteen tropical years are as long as 235 synodic months (Metonic cycle). A cycle can last 6939 or 6940 full days, depending on whether there are 4 or 5 leap days in this 19-year period. After 19 years the lunations should fall the same way in the solar years, so the epact should repeat after 19 years. However, 19 √ó 11 = 209, and this is not an integer multiple of the full cycle of 30 epact numbers (209 modulo 30 = 29, not 0). So after 19 years the epact must be corrected by +1 in order for the cycle to repeat over 19 years. This is the saltus lunae (leap of the moon). The sequence number of the year in the 19-year cycle is called the Golden Number. The extra 209 days fill 7 embolismic months, for a total of 19√ó12 + 7 = 235 lunations. =Lilian (Gregorian) epacts= When the Gregorian calendar reform was instituted in 1582, the lunar cycle previously used with the Julian calendar to complete the calculation of Easter dates was adjusted also, in accordance with a (modification of a) scheme devised by Aloysius Lilius. There were two adjustments of the old lunar cycle: * a \\"solar equation\\", decrementing the epact by 1, whenever the Gregorian calendar drops a leap day (3 times in 400 calendar years), and * a \\"lunar equation\\", incrementing the epact by 1, 8 times in 2500 calendar years (seven times after an interval of 300 years, and the eighth time after an interval of 400 years). The \\"solar equation\\" would adjust for the Gregorian change in the solar calendar, if they were applied at 1 January of the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar as the reformers implemented it; moreover the corrections to the solar calendar are leap days, whereas there are 30 epact values for a mean lunar month of 29.5 days and a bit: therefore changing the epact by one does not exactly compensate for a dropped leap day. The \\"lunar equation\\" adjusts approximately for what had (by 1582) become the experience of many centuries, that the Moon moves a little faster than the expectation of its rate embodied in the old lunar cycle. By 1582 it was noted (e.g. in the text of the bull Inter gravissimas itself) that the new and full moons were occurring \\"four days and something more\\" sooner than the old lunar cycle had been indicating.  History  The discovery of the epact for computing the date of Easter has been attributed to Patriarch Demetrius I of Alexandria, who held office from 189 to 232. In the year 214 he used the epact to produce an Easter calendar, which has not survived, which used an eight-year luni-solar cycle. A subsequent application of the epact to an Easter calendar, using a sixteen-year cycle, is found in the Paschal Table of Hippolytus, a 112-year list of Easter dates beginning in the year 222 which is inscribed on the side of a statue found in Rome. Augustalis, whose dates have been disputed from the third to the fifth century, computed a laterculus (little tablet) of Easter dates. As reconstructed, it uses epacts (here the age of the moon on 1 January) and an 84-year luni-solar cycle to compute the dates of Easter using a base date of A.D. 213. If we accept Augustalis's earlier dates, his laterculus extends from 213 to 312 and Augustalis originated the use of epacts to compute the date of Easter. As early as the fourth century. we see Easter computus using the epact and the nineteen-year Metonic cycle in Alexandria, and subsequent computistical tables were influenced by the structure of the Alexandrian calendar. The epact was taken as the age of the Moon on 26 Phamenoth (22 March in the Julian calendar) but that value of the epact also corresponded to the age of the Moon on the last epagomenal day of the preceding year. Thus the epact can be seen as having been established at the beginning of the current year. Subsequent Easter tables, such as those of Bishop Theophilus or Alexandria, which covered 100 years beginning in A.D. 380, and of his successor Bishop Cyril, which covered 95 years beginning in A.D. 437 discussed the computation of the epact in their introductory texts. Under the influence of Dionysius Exiguus and later, of Bede, the Alexandrian Easter Tables were adopted throughout Europe where they established the tradition that the epact was the age of the Moon on 22 March. This Dionysian epact fell into disuse after the introduction of a perpetual calendar based on the golden number, which made the calculation of epacts unnecessary for ordinary computistical calculations. Two factors led to the creation of three new forms of the epact in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The first was the increasing error of computistical techniques, which led to the introduction of a new Julian epact around 1478, to be used for practical computations of the phase of the Moon for medical or astrological purposes. With the Gregorian reform of the calendar in 1582, two additional epacts came into use. The first was the Lilian epact, developed by Aloisius Lilius as an element of the ecclesiastical computations using the Gregorian calendar. The Lilian epact included corrections for the motions of the Sun and the Moon that broke the fixed relationship between the epact and the golden number. The second new epact was a simple adjustment of the practical Julian epact to account for the ten-day change produced by the Gregorian Calendar.

Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern train wreck in the University District, 20 August 1894. The name \\"Brooklyn\\" began to fade soon thereafter. Electric trolley tracks had been laid up Columbus Avenue (later 14th Avenue) in 1892, and the neighborhood soon began to be called \\"University Station\\" after the heated waiting house at the corner of what is now NE 42nd Street (1895). The name Brooklyn is not lost, however, for Brooklyn Avenue NE runs parallel to University Way, one block west. North and west of the campus, within the University District, the University Heights‚Äîa name now little used‚Äîwas named for its elementary school (1903‚Äìc.1988; since 1990 the University Heights Center for the Community Association, hosts numerous activities small and large from the University District Community Clean Up to the University District Farmer's Market.Long; Eskenazi. Neighborhoods within some districts in Seattle are more or less no longer in common usage.

District Downtown was a trek, a boat, and a horsecart ride away. Given these early transportation difficulties, the U. District was largely self-sufficient, with area businesses for people with ties to the University. Construction of family homes increased in the early 1900s, as did churches, theaters, stores, and a YMCA. The district's first bank and the first local public library opened in 1906, the modest library organized by local merchants.Burrows As a result of a contest held by the University Commercial Club in 1919, 14th Avenue (by then already known as \\"The Avenue\\" or \\"The Ave\\") was renamed University Way, and the neighborhood was renamed the University District (1919). The neighborhood's north-south arterials are (from west to east) Roosevelt Way NE (southbound)), 11th Avenue NE (northbound), Brooklyn Avenue NE, University Way NE, and 15th Avenue NE. NE Pacific, 45th, and part of 50th streets are principal east-west arterials, NE Campus Parkway is a minor east-west arterial, running only west of the campus.

The neighborhood's skyline landmarks (other than the UW campus) are its tallest buildings: UW Tower (formerly Safeco Plaza) and the Meany Hotel (which became the Best Western University Tower and is now known as Hotel Deca). The former, originally headquarters of Safeco Corporation, is located at the corner of Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 45th Street. It was built in 1973, and at 22 stories high is the city's tallest building outside Downtown. The latter is Art Deco (1931, restored). The architect Robert Reamer gave every room a corner window.University District Arts and Heritage Committee (Part 2 of 2, North Side) A jewel of the neighborhood is the formal Neo-classical Carnegie Library (1910) on Roosevelt Way at 50th Street. Hotel Deca (formerly Meany Hotel) In recent decades, the University District has suffered commercial decline, due at least in significant part to the more competitive planning, capital investment, and popularity of the University Village shopping center east of the campus, and Northgate Mall about 1-1/2 miles (2-1/2 km) north beside I-5. From 2002 to 2004, the city and the neighborhood have made some steps countering this trend by giving the Ave a repaving facelift including the addition of benches, bus bulbs, and period lighting.Marmor; Dorpat; Kim The addition of benches represented the reversal of a decades-long neighborhood trend away from providing free places to sit. The district will be served by two Link Light Rail stations: University of Washington Station near Husky Stadium opened in 2016 as part of the University Link Extension; and U District on Brooklyn Avenue near NE 45th Street is set to open in 2021 as part of the Northgate Link Extension. Light rail service will connect the U District to Capitol Hill, Downtown Seattle, Rainier Valley, and Sea-Tac Airport. The area around U District Station was upzoned to allow for taller buildings in 2017, and 12 new high-rise buildings are planned to begin construction . The local year-round and seasonal homeless population, referred to as \\"Ave Rats\\", is well-known around Seattle. (See The Ave.) Fraternity and sorority members make up a sizeable portion of the local cafes' and bars' clientele, especially such establishments as Earl's and Fourno's, though well outnumbered by the Seattle campus student body of more than 39,250.3,600 instructional faculty, 27,600 faculty and staff, 39,251 student enrollment on Seattle campus (Autumn 2005), 26,444 extension enrollment (non-graded programs). Other bars have a wider base of patrons, including the College Inn (built for the Alaska-Yukon Exposition in 1909)University District Arts and Heritage Committee (Part 1 of 2, South Side) and the Irish Emigrant. The University District is home to all of the UW's fraternity and sorority houses, most of them clustered along 17th Avenue NE between NE 45th and 50th Streets (\\"Frat Row\\" or \\"Greek Row\\").

Players take on the role of \\"Stalkers\\", persons who have risen above their own mortality to act as servants of the guardians of Reality, tracking down and apprehending rogue gods who have invaded Reality and returning them to the realm of the Unseen where they are cast into The Whispering Vault. History In 1993, at Gen Con 26, Mike Nystul sold a pre-publication \\"black book\\" version of his self-published horror RPG called The Whispering Vault. Buoyed by positive comments, Nystul formed Pariah Press the following year to publish an expanded and professionally printed 88-page spiral-bound edition. Shannon Applecline, in the book Designers & Dragons, highlighted the horror- themed art and evocative background material. Applecline also mentioned the \\"brutal and quick\\" combat system and the simple task resolution system that reduced dice-rolling to a minimum and brought the adventure storyline to the fore. The following year, Nystul published two supplements: the Dangerous Prey sourcebook (1995) and a three-panel GM screen (1995). In 1996, Chris Pramas acquired rights to The Whispering Vault from Mike Nystul and formed Ronin Publishing with his brother, Jason Pramas, and their mutual friend, Neal Darcy. The company's first publication was The Book of Hunts (1997), a series of adventures. Ronin created a second supplement called Mortal Magic, but it was left unpublished when Ronin folded in 1998. Pharos Press acquired the rights for The Whispering Vault in 2000, but did not publish anything. In 2003, Ronin Arts acquired the rights, and released Mortal Magic, the unpublished work by Ronin Publishing. Ronin Arts then quickly published seven more PDFs that year, before discontinuing the line. Description Characters within The Whispering Vault used to be human, but after a life dedicated to protecting humanity against supernatural beings they have been recruited into the ranks of the Stalkers, the main heroes of the game. Now armed with supernatural powers and able to summon ghostly servitors, their mission is to hunt down the Unbidden: rebellious gods who have escaped into the Realm of Flesh ‚Äî what humanity calls \\"Reality\\". The Stalkers have other enemies: *The Shadows are creatures who were denied existence and live in the Rift between the Realms of Flesh and Essence. Sometimes they manage to awaken into the Dream by themselves, sometimes the Unbidden bind them as Minions. *Mortals may also be dangerous: the use of Magic may endanger the Dream, too. The Hunts of the Stalkers can happen in any era, and Stalkers may come from any period of History as time flows differently in the Realm of Essence and the Realm of Flesh. Gameplay =Character creation= The player divides 22 points among four attributes. The number of points assigned to each attribute determines how many six-sided dice the player will roll for task and combat resolution. =Combat and task resolution= For both combat and task resolution, players try to achieve success by rolling a number of dice equal to their relevant skill level. As in Yahtzee, players try to roll matched sets or special combinations. Players can spend a point of kharma to reroll any number of the dice in search of better dice combinations. In combat, resulting damage is divided by the target's Fortitude. When fighting supernatural creatures, mortals must ignore any sixes that are rolled, making combat against these creatures much more difficult.

Smith also liked the new mechanics for combat and task resolution, which he found \\"works surprisingly well\\". However, he did find several important elements missing, including \\"the keys to humanity\\", which apparently were supposed to explain the motivation for the player's characters. (Allen noted that this missing material would be included in the Pariah Press version that was being prepared for publication at the time the review was printed.) Allen concluded by giving The Whispering Vault a rating of 4 out of 6, saying \\"I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes heroic horror. It is one of the most inventive treatments of the subject I have yet encountered.\\" Six months later, in the May 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue #217), Lester Smith again reviewed the game, this time looking at the official first edition of the game, and called the book's presentation \\"excellent, nearly flawless.\\" He found designer Mike Nystul's \\"unique vision both shockingly strange and yet universal in scope.\\" Smith concluded by giving the game a perfect rating of 6 out of 6, saying, \\"This product is pure, distilled horror, with some of the most concise yet effective mechanics ever published; its relative slimness simply means that you‚Äôll digest the game more quickly initially, and reference it more easily during play.\\" In the following edition of Dragon (Issue #218 ‚Äì June 1994), Rick Swan called The Whispering Vault \\"Only one of the smartest, spookiest horror RPGs that ever clawed its way from a crypt.\\" In the November 1994 edition of Pyramid (Issue #10), William Spencer-Hale recommended the game, saying, \\"All in all, The Whispering Vault is a game worthy of the attention of any fan of horror roleplaying. This game is a welcome addition to any library and, out of all the roleplaying materials that I own, this is one that I will actually enjoy playing.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #40 (1994) *White Wolf #44 (June, 1994) References External links *Ronin Arts - official site *Steve Jackson Games article about the design of the game Horror role-playing games Role-playing games introduced in 1993 ","title":"The Whispering Vault"},{"id":"295782","text":"View of downtown Orereta Errenteria (, ) is a town located in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community, in the north of Spain, near the French border.
