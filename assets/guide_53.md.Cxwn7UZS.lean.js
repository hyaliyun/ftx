StoneHall, Wellesley College remodeled by Newkirk 1921 Biography Eliza Newkirk grew up in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, and pursued undergraduate degrees in art and math at Wellesley College, beginning in 1896 and graduating in 1900. She garnered a fellowship in architecture and attended classes from 1902-4 at MIT and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Subsequently, she spent 15 months in Italy researching her thesis \\"Domes of Renaissance Italy\\", which was completed in 1906; she received a master's degree from Wellesley in 1907. Newkirk taught for more than thirty years. After her undergraduate degree, she taught at a girls school for two years. While working on her thesis, she taught art history at Mount Holyoke College in 1905. In 1906, she began teaching art history and drawing at Wellesley. In 1926 she taught \\"New England Architecture\\" at Wellesley College. She photographed for and otherwise assisted the press board and director of publicity at Wellesley. In the late 1930s, she lectured on architectural topics at Rosemont College. Newkirk also practiced architecture beginning in the 1900s. She worked for ten years at the practices of Prince and McLanahan in Philadelphia, Kendall, Taylor, and Stevens in Boston, and for Lois Lilley Howe in Boston. She opened her own firm in 1913 and designed, renovated, and added to facilities at Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts and Wellesley; as well as residential projects. She consulted for Frank Miles Day, the supervising architect in charge of reconstructing the campus after the 1914 fire. Newkirk toured England with her colleague Eleanor Manning and wrote several articles in House Beautiful in 1926. She had previous authored articles for them in 1918. Additionally she wrote for the Journal of the American Institute of Architects in 1926. Newkirk married George Benjamin Rogers, the head master of Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, in 1924. She commuted between there and Boston from then until 1936, when her husband died. Then, she moved to Philadelphia to live with her family. Eliza Newkirk Rogers shaped the art history department at Wellesley, and left behind numerous students. Her papers may be found at Wellesley; as well, she donated her art collection to the Davis Museum at Wellesley College. She continues to be remembered through \\"The Eliza Newkirk Rogers Prize for Architecture\\" at Wellesley.

The show is currently rated 6.3/10 on IMDb. The show is also rated three stars out of five by Common Sense Media, which states \\"Talking Tom and Friends centers on the animated stars of a popular app series, so kids who know and love them will want to watch their TV antics. On the whole, the content is fine for kids, and there's plenty of silliness (and some body noises and humor) to keep them entertained. That's the show's main intent, so don't expect many teaching moments. The characters argue and get on each other's nerves at times, and some squabbles get physical with tussles and wrestling, but there are no injuries.\\" In 2016, the show won the Cablefax Program Awards for Best Animated Series. The show is currently available on YouTube, where the show's official channel has 11 million subscribers as of May 2020.

Periwound area is traditionally limited to 4 cm outside the wound’s edge but can extend beyond this limit if outward damage to the skin is present. Periwound assessment is an important step of wound assessment before wound treatment is prescribed. Function and characteristics Healthy periwound is an immediate barrier surrounding the wound bed that can perform all the regular functions of skin – the body’s largest organ – such as absorption, excretion, protection, secretion, thermoregulation, pigment production, sensory perception and immunity. Healthy periwound maintains all the physical characteristics of skin: elasticity, surface integrity, color and texture. However, periwound can become compromised and negatively affect the healing progress of the wound. Periwound issues Periwound issues affect the integrity and healthy functionality of the skin surrounding the wound and may include maceration, excoriation, dry (scaly) skin, eczema, callus (hyperkeratosis), infection, inflammation. =Signs and symptoms= Patients suffering from periwound issues may experience burning, itching, tenderness, and pain. Visible and measurable signs include rash, erythema, discoloration, changes in skin texture and temperature. =Causes= The most common cause of periwound issues is excessive moisture present in the area surrounding the wound. Exudate from heavily draining wounds causes irritation of the periwound that may lead to maceration, excoriation, and otherwise compromise skin integrity. This type of damage is more common in chronic wounds due to exudate composition which differs from fluids produced in acute wounds or burns. Chronic wound exudate contains proteolytic enzymes and other components that degrade skin integrity and predispose it to inflammation. Moisture-associated skin damage can also be caused by bodily fluids or other contaminants that enter the periwound areas, for example, in patients suffering from urinary or fecal incontinence, or colostomy patients. Other causes include dryness of the skin due to ageing and skin or systemic disorders, allergic reactions to wound care products, damage that may result from poor application and removal technique of adhesive products used in wound treatment, as well as exposure to infection or extrinsic contaminants at the time of wound dressing changes. =Risk factors= Among risk factors that may contribute to degrading the periwound skin performance are: * Chronic wounds (excessive harmful exudate) * Old age (increased skin fragility, epidermal thinning, loss of elasticity) * Underlying disorders (congenital (epidermolysis bullosa), dermatological conditions (eczema), fungal or bacterial infections, lymphedema) * Environmental damage (UV radiation) * Inadequate wound care regimens =Treatment and prevention= Treatment and prevention of periwound issues are becoming increasingly important as research continues to confirm the role of periwound in wound healing. The shared objective of treatment and prevention is maintenance and/or restoration of the integrity and healthy functionality of skin surrounding the wound. Main treatment and prevention strategies include the following: * Holistic wound assessment that includes periwound assessment. * Elimination of factors causing moisture-associated skin damage. * Maintaining optimal moisture balance over the wound and periwound: effective exudate management in heavily draining wounds as well as adequate hydration of dry wounds. * Proper patient nutrition. * Treatment of underlying conditions. * Protection of periwound from damage, infection, and contaminants. Systemic treatment may include medication appropriate for patient’s condition. Local treatment may include wound care products that protect periwound and help maintain its healthy functionality, for example, moisture barriers (ointments, salves and films), topical corticosteroids, antiseptics and antifungal agents, as well as moisture balancing dressings, such as self-adaptive wound dressing.

She studied at Harare Polytechnic in Zimbabwe where she later joined the faculty. As a student, Madekurozwa was influenced by the disparity she noted between representations of men and women in painted portraits. This observation led her to engage with subjects that challenged traditional gender stereotypes. Madekurozwa has linked the frequency of docile women in Zimbabwean art to the interests of foreign buyers who often want and expect to buy stereotypical depictions of Africa, which local artists in turn feel pressured to produce. She explained in a 1998 interview with the Inter Press Service that: \\"If you don't sell, you don't live, you don't eat. A lot of the time you don't produce what you would like to. And that gives foreigners a lot of power over what Zimbabwean art is.\\" In 1997, Madekurozwa participated in a faculty exchange program with Virginia Commonwealth University.Bethea, Dorine. \\"ARTISTS SEEKING ADVANCES - 2 ZIMBABWEANS PARTICIPATE IN VCU EXCHANGE PROGRAM.\\" Richmond Times-Dispatch, 23 Nov. 1997, City, Area/State, p.

Two years later she held a residency at Gasworks Gallery in London where she created work that focused on the \\"relationship between men and women and between the private and the public.\\"  Work  Madekurozwa's work was described in The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts as \\"articulat[ing] the conflict between societal expectations, gender stereotyping, and personal needs.\\" Of her own work, Madekurozwa has said, \\"I use my art to re-create the world on my own terms; taboos become exposed and the hidden is given prominence. In my work, women are more than just powerless beasts of burden and the male body becomes objectified for the delight of the voyeur.\\" Joyce M. Youmans points to Heaven (1997) as an example of how Madkurozwa's counters the commodification of the female body, by turning the lens on male figures of authority.

Latex can be extracted from this plant for the manufacture of natural rubber. Other names for this vine are eta, the white rubber vine and the Congo rubber plant. Congo rubber was a commercial rubber exported from the Congo Free State starting in 1890, most notable for its forced harvesting under conditions of great human suffering, in the Congo Free State, detailed in the 1904 Casement Report.https://archive.org/stream/CasementReport/CasementReportSmall#page/n57/mode/2up/search/harvest From 1885 to 1908, millions died as a result of murder, deprivation, and disease, with population falling by millions in this period; some writers estimate this loss to be as high as 10 million people. Description Botanical illustration When growing in savannah, Landolphia owariensis is an erect bush or small tree, but when growing among trees, it can develop into a woody vine with a stem that grows to a metre wide and long. The bark is rough, dark brown or greyish-brown, and often covered with pale yellow lenticels; it exudes a milky juice when damaged. The leaves grow in opposite pairs and are oblong, elliptical or obovate, up to . The young leaves are reddish at first but the upper sides of the leaf blades later become dark green and glossy, with a pale midrib. The flowers are in terminal panicles. The peduncles and calyx lobes are clad in brown hairs, and the corolla tube and lobes are yellowish, pinkish or white. The flowers are followed by rounded, wrinkled fruit resembling oranges. These are juicy and slightly acid when ripe, with usually three seeds surrounded by soft, edible pulp. The main trunk soon divides into several stout stems which repeatedly branch as they clamber over their host trees. After the fruit have fallen, the stems elongate into tendrils which wist spirally and secure the vine to its host. Distribution and habitat Landolphia owariensis is native to the tropics of Africa, its range extending from Guinea in West Africa to Sudan and Tanzania in East Africa. When growing in open savannah it takes the form of a bush, but in forested areas it becomes a vine and can climb trees, reaching heights of or more. It has a rhizome which can survive bush fires, readily throwing up shoots which flower and fruit at a young age even before the twigs have become lignified. Uses The fruit are gathered for human consumption, and are either eaten fresh or fermented into an alcoholic beverage. The latex used to be gathered for the manufacture of rubber. The latex coagulates rapidly after extraction, and one traditional method of collection was to make an incision on the stem and allow the latex to trickle onto the gatherer's hand and arm where it rapidly coagulated. When this process had been repeated several times, the rubber \\"sleeve\\" was unrolled off the arm. The latex has been used to mix with the ground up seeds of Strophanthus to make arrow poison, and to glue the poison to the arrow-head. The latex is also used by itself as a birdlime to catch small birds and animals. Landolphia owariensis has been used extensively in traditional medicine, with the leaves and stems being used as an anti-microbial, and in the treatment of venereal disease and of colic. Other uses include as a vermifuge, a purgative, an analgesic and an anti- inflammatory. A decoction prepared from the leaves is used against malaria and as a purgative; the bark is used against worms and an extract of the roots against gonorrhea. The latex that oozes from wounds can be drunk, or used as an enema to treat intestinal worms. In modern times Landolphia owariensis is primarily used for its fruits, but occasionally for rubber band production; it was a major source for rubber from nations including Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria in the early 1900s. History Victim of the rubber industry in Congo. Hands were chopped off to account for bullets that had not been used to kill people. Punch, depicting King Leopold II as a rubber vine curled around the body of a Congolese man In 1885, Leopold II established the Congo Free State under the auspices of the International Association of the Congo, by securing the European community's agreement with the claim that he was involved in humanitarian and philanthropic work. To monopolize the resources of the entire Congo Free State, Leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that stripped control of resources from the native populations and required them to work. Collectively, these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber, harvested or found, to state officers or to the state's monopoly concession companies, thus nearly completing Leopold's monopoly of the Congo's ivory and rubber trade. The rubber came from wild vines in the jungle, unlike the rubber from Brazil (Hevea brasiliensis), which was tapped from trees. To extract the rubber, instead of tapping the vines, the Congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex. When the latex hardened, it would be scraped off the skin in a painful manner, as it took off the worker's hair with it. The Force Publique, the Free State's military, was used to enforce the rubber quotas. During the 1890s, the Force Publique's primary role was to enforce a system of corvée labour to promote the rubber trade. Armed with modern weapons and the chicotte—a bull whip made of hippopotamus hide—the Force Publique routinely took and tortured hostages, slaughtered families of rebels, and flogged and raped Congolese people. Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Recalcitrant villages were burned and Force Publique soldiers were sometimes required to provide a severed hand from their victims as proof that they had not misused their weapons. A Catholic priest quotes a man, Tswambe, speaking of a hated state official, Léon Fiévez, who ran a district along the river north of Stanley Pool: > All blacks saw this man as the devil of the Equator...From all the bodies > killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the > number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in > baskets...A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely > swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding > the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach > big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river...Rubber causes > these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken. > Soldiers made young men kill or rape their own mothers and sisters. =Historic production methods= According to a 1905 article (shortly after the peak of Congo production): > Red Kasai and Congo rubbers are obtained from the same species of vines, > namely, the Landolphia, Owariensis Pal. Beauv., L. Gentilii De Wild and L. > Droogmansiana De Wild.L. Gentilii De Wild. and L. droogmansiana De Wild. are > now considered taxonomic synonyms of Landolphia owariensis P.Beauv.

Ref: The difference > in color, which is the chief distinction, is probably due to the different > climatic conditions in the two districts, and different modes of collecting > and coagulating, and not to any inherent property of the latices. Landolphia > Klainei also gives a reddish rubber when grown under the same conditions as > the above mentioned species. The red colour of the rubber appears to be > accentuated more and more as the district in which the vine is cultivated is > farther from the zone known as the Great Equatorial Forest.

The chairman, a member of the CRA, expressed some concern about this discrepancy.): Female atrocity victim of Congo's rubber industry. > Makala is one of the great rubber centres of the Congo, and during my long > stay at that post, I had excellent opportunities of studying the method of > rubber-collection.

The natives usually go out in couples—build a little shanty > in the midst of the jungle and work in a circle round it. Climbing the > rubber-bearing tree or vine, they slash the bark with two or three V-shaped > cuts, one below the other, and then arrange a broad leaf underneath, so as > to form a trough. This is to conduct the sap, which oozes out, about the > consistency and colour of ideal milk, into a gourd, or preferably, a galley- > pot, procured at the station. The rubber from trees and vines is mixed > promiscuously, the natives preferring to tap the latter, as they say it > flows more freely. In any case, they put some vine rubber into that from the > trees, as it coagulates more rapidly. Returned to their hut, the gatherers > pour the sap into an earthenware pot containing water, place it on the fire > and stir it with a stick which they call bosanga. In about ten minutes the > rubber, owing to the acid in the bosanga, begins to collect round the stick, > and soon a mass is formed.

Woolwich Riverside is also the name of an electoral ward constituting a much larger area. Volume 44 of the Survey of London (about Woolwich) uses the term Central Riverside Area. is an area along the Thames in Woolwich, South East London. It is the oldest inhabited part of Woolwich, going back to an Anglo-Saxon riverside settlement. When the demographic centre of Woolwich shifted south in the 1800s, the area became a Victorian slum. Most of Old Woolwich was cleared in the 20th and early 21st centuries to make way for industrial, infrastructural and other large-scale developments. Although most of the earlier buildings have been demolishied, the area has retained some interesting architecture, including the Georgian parish church, the Edwardian foot tunnel rotunda and two cinemas of the 1930s.  Location  The area designated as Woolwich Central Riverside is situated along the south bank of the river Thames in Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. It is bounded to the north by the Thames and to the south by Woolwich Church Street, Woolwich High Street and Beresford Street (all part of the A206 road), although some historic alleys and yards on the south side of these streets are included in this survey. To the west it is bounded by Woolwich Dockyard, and to the east by the Royal Arsenal. Old Woolwich is located north of the present-day commercial heart of Woolwich, which is centred around Beresford Square and Powis Street.  History  = Early history: riverside settlement = Woolwich Central Riverside has been inhabited at least since the 1st century BCE. Remains of Iron Age, probably Celtic fortifications were found at the current Waterfront development site between Beresford Street and the Thames. This was reused as a castrum or castellum in the late-Roman period. According to the Survey of London, \\"this defensive earthwork encircled the landward sides of a riverside settlement, the only one of its kind so far located in the London area, that may have been a significant port, anterior to London\\".Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 2. The Medieval parish church (1698) The Anglo-Saxon name for Woolwich (uuluuich) indicates that this was a -wich town, a trading place for wool. In 2015, Oxford Archaeology discovered a Saxon burial site near the riverside with 76 skeletons from the late 7th or early 8th century. The absence of grave deposits indicates that this was an early Christian settlement.M. Little: '76 skeletons have been discovered from Saxon Woolwich', originally published by southlondonpress.co.uk, 16 October 2015. The first church, which stood to the north of the present parish church, was almost certainly pre-Norman and dedicated to Saint Lawrence. It was probably rebuilt in stone around 1100.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 2-3. From the 10th till the mid-12th century Woolwich was controlled by the abbots of St. Peter's Abbey in Ghent. Some of the Ghent lands passed to the royal manors of Dartford and Eltham. Not included were a riverside quay held by Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, and a wharf held by St Mary's Priory, Southwark. Woolwich Ferry was first mentioned in 1308 but may be older. Several Medieval pottery kilns have been discovered north of Beresford Street in 2007-08. The oldest and best- preserved kiln probably produced so-called 'London ware' in the 14th century.London ware was arguably the most important pottery industry in south- east England between the 12th and 14th centuries, traded as far afield as Ireland, Scotland and Norway. It is best known for its plain and highly decorated jugs. The six kilns discovered at the 'Teardrop' site (between Beresford Street and Warren Lane) \\"testify, perhaps, to an unbroken tradition of pottery production at Woolwich from at least the 14th century until the 17th century\\". , \\"Medieval London-type Ware Kilns Discovered at Woolwich\\". In: Medieval Pottery Research Group, newsletter 6, 1 August 2008, pp. 3-5 (PDF). Around Bell Water Gate some private shipbuilding or repair may have existed in the 15th century. Very little is known about the size and disposition of the settlement. One or two houses from the 15th or 16th century survived until the late 19th century, long enough to be recorded by local antiquarians.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 2-5, 50-51. = 16th-18th century: expansion = S. & N. Buck, 1739). To the left: the bell tower of the ropeyard. To the right: the old and new parish church The riverfront a century later (R. Rixon, 1841). The ropeyard and old church have gone; the watermen's stairs are still in use In 1512 a naval shipyard was established at Gun Yard, east of Bell Water Gate (now a car park next to the Waterfront Leisure Centre). Gun Yard or Gun Wharf may have been formed from two existing yards, Crane's Wharf and Daniel's Wharf, using about 80 meters of river frontage between Bell Water Gate and Globe Lane. In 1515 the Henry Grace à Dieu was built here, at the time probably the largest warship in Europe. Not long after this, in the 1540s, the naval yard moved to an area further west and became known as The King's Yard or Woolwich Dockyard. Gun Wharf continued to be used for naval storage. In 1573 the royal ropeyard was established, more or less where Beresford Street is situated now. The warehouse at Gun Yard may have been rebuilt in brick around the same time. A new crane and thatch-roofed workshop were added in 1586. Apart from naval storage, the wharf was used for bringing in raw materials for the ropeyard as well as shipping out finished rope. The north- west section of the yard was named Ropeyard Wharf. Hemp, tar and rope were carried or carted some 180 meters between this area and the ropeyard via Bell Water Gate and the High Street. At the intersection of these two streets stood the parish cage and stocks. Later this area was named Market Hill, after the market moved here around 1670 from its earlier location near the ropeyard.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 37-41, 49. The Warren and the octagonal tower of Tower Place (1775?) Further east stood Tower Place, a Tudor mansion with an octagonal tower and a warren around it. The house was built in the 1540s for Martin Bowes, a wealthy goldsmith and merchant, later a Lord Mayor of London. Bowes had bought riverside holdings in Woolwich and Plumstead in the 1530s, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. After his death, the estate came into the possession of George Barne, also a Lord Mayor of London. His great-grandchildren Richard and Francis Lovelace may have been born here in the early 17th century. In the mid-17th century weapons testing began at the Warren, near Tower Place. The warehouse at Gun Yard was rebuilt in 1663 as a large U-shaped building. After 1671 gun storage moved away from here to the area around Tower Place, which had been acquired by William Pritchard, an ordnance contractor from Eltham. In exchange for the 31-acre Warren or Tower Place estate, Pritchard acquired Gun Yard plus a large payment in cash. He continued using the Gun Yard for shipping and storage of military and non- military provisions, as well as adding a repair shop for gun carriages and a saltpetre refinery. Around the same time the north-west part of the yard was fenced off for the exclusive use of the ropeyard. West of Bell Water Gate, around present-day Glass Yard, there was some glass industry in the 17th century, while pottery production seems to have continued here at the same time.In 1974 two 17th-century pottery kilns were discovered at Woolwich Ferry approach, one of these a redware kiln, the other one an important early stoneware kiln. , 2008, pp. 3-5. The redware kiln which had been reburried, was cleaned in a temporary shed near Greenwich Heritage Centre in 2017.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 38-41, 129-130. Old Woolwich between the King's Yard and the Warren (John Rocque, 1746) By the end of the 17th century, the Warren, later the Royal Arsenal, had grown to rival the Tower of London as the country's main ordnance depot. The ropeyard was rebuilt in 1695-97 by the surveyor and naval engineer Edmund Dummer, adding a double ropewalk to the existing one. The yard was extended to 324 m, stretching all the way to Green's End. At its north end stood a brick warehouse with a clock tower. It employed as many as 400 men. This, and the shipbuilding at Woolwich Dockyard, attracted ever more workers to Woolwich, which due to the malarial marshland was not a popular posting. However, the town's population grew rapidly, to about 6,500 in 1720. The entire area between the Dockyard and the Warren was filled in with houses. The south part of Gun Yard (facing the High Street) was developed in the 1720s as a market surrounded by houses on three sides and with a central market office. The northern part of the plot remained in use as a riverside wharf throughout the 18th century, partly for stacking timber. The parish church of St Mary Magdalene was rebuilt in the 1730s through aid from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. The new church was bigger and stood slightly further back from the river. John Rocque's Map of London of 1746 shows very few buildings south of the main east-west street and the ropeyard. Five streets, all perpendicular to the High Street, are marked on the map: Hog Lane, Bell Water Gate, Taler Tree Gate, Ship Stairs and Warren Lane. Apart from that, the built-up area consisted of Church Hill, Parson's Hill, Woolwich High Street, a pocket of houses between the Ropeyard and the Warren, and a scattering of cottages at Green's End (now Beresford Square). On another map of 1748-49 the so-called watermen's stairs are marked, used for loading and offloading ships. They are all situated at the north ends of the aforementioned streets, some with poetic names: Green Dragon Stairs, Blue Anchor Stairs and Sheep (or Ship) Stairs.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 9-13, 37-41, 130-134. = 19th century: Victorian slum = GHC) Poverty map of central Woolwich, 1889. The areas in black designate the \\"lowest class, vicious, semi-criminals\\". Bright red is \\"middle class, well-to-do\\" In the late 18th century, the population of Woolwich approached 10,000 and new areas for housing were found south of the main street. A new town centre comprising Beresford Square, Powis Street and the Bathway Quarter was laid out around 1800. The ropeyard closed in 1832 and the site was acquired by the Greenwich wine merchant George Smith. Three years later the area was cleared and Beresford Street was laid out. By 1847 the street had been fully developed with two-storey-houses (some double-fronted, one room deep), two public houses (Beresford Arms and Duke of Sussex), a theatre (Theatre Royal, later Woolwich Empire) and a chapel (Wesleyan Association Chapel; later followed by Baptist Tabernacle, Salvation Army Chapel and St Saviour's Mission). At the eastern end of the street, facing Beresford Square, Holy Trinity Church was built in 1833-34. This large Anglican church had an imposing façade in Portland stone with a stump tower above a Greek Revival portico.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 79-81, 225-226. Woolwich High Street c.1900 In 1856 the overcrowded churchyard at St Mary Magdalene's was closed and a new parish cemetery, Woolwich cemetery, opened in Plumstead. In 1893-95 the old churchyard was transformed into a public park, St Mary's Gardens. The park formed an oasis between the densely populated streets south of Woolwich Church Street, and the Dockyard north of it. An attempt was made to move the market from Market Hill to Market Street in the Bathway Quarter but this proved to be unpopular. In 1888 the market was officially established at Beresford Square. Powis Street became a successful commercial street and replaced Woolwich High Street as the town's main shopping area. Horse-drawn trams arrived in Woolwich Church Street, High Street and Beresford Street in 1881. The Woolwich Free Ferry was established in 1889, replacing privately owned ferry services. Between Nile Street and Surgeon Street an entire block had to be cleared in order to build the ferry terminal, new river walls and approach roads. The area north of the High Street gradually turned into a Victorian slum. The most notorious part was the so-called Dusthole, between Beresford Street, Warren Lane and the river, named after the dust from neighbouring coal wharves. Many people that lived in this area were of Irish descent. Poverty and prostitution were prevalent here.General William Booth of the Salvation Army described the Dusthole in 1890: \\"The women living and following their dreadful business in this neighbourhood are so degraded that even abandoned men will refuse to accompany them home. Soldiers are forbidden to enter the place (...) A policeman never goes down this street alone at night.\\" The social reformer Charles Booth added in 1900: \\"Women with broken noses, swollen faces, bare dirty unkempt faces and heads, draggled skirts, frayed edges everywhere, coarse Irish faces, bare arms. No men about.\\" Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 55. The depravity of the area attracted numerous religious institutions and led in 1850 to the establishment of the Woolwich Baths and Lecture Hall on Nelson Street, one of London's earliest public baths. Later in the 19th century, more and more houses were replaced by industrial developments (coal wharves, a gas company and a power station).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 50-56. = 20th-21st century: redevelopment = Ropeyard Rails and Warren Lane light industrial estate (demolished in 2007) Scale model Waterfront development During the 20th century most remaining parts of Old Woolwich were demolished, initially to make room for military and industrial developments (expansion of the Royal Arsenal and Woolwich Power Station), later also for entertainment venues (Granada and Odeon cinemas). In the second half of the century road widening, new car parks, the relocation of the Woolwich Ferry terminal, as well as large-scale building projects such as the Autostacker (1961), Riverside House (1963) and the new leisure centre (1988) made further demands on land in the riverside area. A modest power station built in 1893 in Globe Lane was taken over by Woolwich Borough Council in 1903. As its capacity grew, the buildings at Woolwich Power Station were almost continuously renewed until it closed down in 1978. Around 1965 the ferry approach was moved further west where it was connected via a roundabout to a new dual carriageway (John Wilson Street). A marshalling yard was added west of the ferry approach. Woolwich High Street and Beresford Street were widened around the same time. A light industrial estate at Ropeyard Rails replaced what had once been the infamous Dusthole. In the mid-1980s, more buildings in Beresford Street were cleared in order to reroute the A206 north of the Royal Arsenal Gatehouse. All these projects involved large-scale demolition in the historic heart of Woolwich. Presented as 'slum clearance', it met with little resistance in a town that was used to being rebuilt continuously.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 57-59, 62-63, 83. With the successful regeneration of the former Royal Arsenal by Greenwich Council and Berkeley Homes, urban renewal has spread to the Central Riverside Area. More than a thousand homes are planned here, mainly luxury apartments in tower blocks near the river (Waterfront development), as well as south of the A206 (Callis Yard development). The first proposals for the Waterfront towers were presented by Berkeley Homes in 2004. It occupies the sites of the historic gun wharf, as well as - ironically - the Dusthole. Although slowed down by the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the plan gained new momentum in 2014 when it was decided that Woolwich would be connected to Crossrail. The Royal Arsenal Gardens have been partly built on, partly realigned as Maribor Park.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 18, 84. A 128-bedroom hotel facing Beresford Street and the first of around ten residential towers were completed in 2017.Waterfront, Royal Arsenal Riverside on berkeleygroup.co.uk, accessed 30-03-2017. In the 2012 Woolwich Town Centre Masterplan, Greenwich Council revealed plans for the Glass Yard site. The Waterfront Leisure Centre will be relocated and the site redeveloped for mixed use whereby the extension of Hare Street to the river front (in effect the reconstruction of historic Hog Lane / Nile Street) is an important element.Woolwich Town Centre Masterplan SPD (April 2012), pp. 24-25.  Heritage and architecture  Very little remains of Old Woolwich, even from the industrial and post-industrial phases of the 19th and 20th century. Among the buildings that have disappeared are Tower Place, the Ropeyard with its clock tower, Holy Trinity Church as well as several other churches and chapels, the Empire Theatre, at least ten pubs, the Woolwich Baths, Woolwich Power Station and the Autostacker. Of the buildings that remain none are older than the Georgian era, including the church of St Mary Magdalene. Most of the shops on Woolwich High Street have been rebuilt several times. Although severely altered, they hold some historical value. = Riverside area = Waterfront construction site, 2016 Some sections of the Thames river wall date from the early 19th century. Remnants of watermen's stairs can be seen at Bell Water Gate and behind the Waterfront Leisure Centre at the end of Nile Street (formerly Hog Lane). The Bell Water Gate river stairs were altered in 1824 and have remained largely unchanged since. The Hog Lane or Green Dragon Stairs were reconstructed in concrete in the 1970s but the old paved causeway can still be seen at low tide. The coaling jetty of 1930-31 is all that remains of Woolwich Power Station. The Woolwich Ferry terminal as it exists today largely dates from the 1960s. From the roundabout and the adjacent car park a four- lane concrete causeway curves towards the loading ramp. The most prominent element is a 21 m wide and 29 m tall (above low tide) lifting tower of white polycarbonate. The ferry administration and maintenance building, as well as the ambulance station, are low-rise utilitarian structures with a touch of Brutalism. Originally the roof of the workshop block was accessible to the public as a viewing platform. The south entrance building of the Woolwich Foot Tunnel was built at the north-west side of Nile Street in 1910-12. It is now hidden behind the Waterfront Leisure Centre. The round building of red brick with its leaded dome is the oldest surviving building in this area. The Waterfront Leisure Centre stands at the original sites of the Woolwich Ferry terminal and Woolwich Power Station. It was built in 1986-88 as a replacement for the Public Baths in Bathway. The original design consisted of two separate units on both sides of Nile Street. It included a large indoor swimming pool, sports facilities, a supermarket, a garden centre, a petrol station and flats surrounded by public spaces. These ambitious plans were scaled down after construction had started, which resulted in the current hybrid building of red and yellow brick and mirrored-glass façades with blue detailing. A riverside walk was laid out around the same time. It now forms part of the Thames Path. East of the leisure centre a large car park occupies the site of the former Woolwich Power Station coal yard. This and the land further east is earmarked for redevelopment. Closer to the Royal Arsenal the first Waterfront residential tower blocks have topped out at around 70 m.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 59-68.

Nothing of the original houses in this area survived. The church of St Mary Magdalen is a plain brick building with a spireless tower, built in 1732-39. St Mary's Gardens was laid out as a park in Romantic style on the grounds of the former churchyard. The park features a belvedere with views of the river. A brick wall along Woolwich Church Street forms the southern boundary of Woolwich Dockyard. The development of the Mast Quay Buildings in 2004-06, at the eastern extremity of the Dockyard, was amongst the earliest signs of urban renewal in Woolwich. A few older buildings remain south of the roundabout where the A205 meets the A206. At the eastern slope of Church Hill an unusual cluster is formed by two derelict buildings and a formidable Art Deco cinema. The former Odeon Cinema, now called Gateway House, is used by the New Wine Church. Its streamlined exterior looks as glamorous as it did in the 1930s. The Mitre public house was rebuilt in 1927-28 in the typical half-timbered Brewer's Tudor style of the period. It closed in 2008. Adjacent is a small house called Ferry Cottage that probably dates from the early 19th century. On the east side of the South Circular Road is Parson's Hill, a remainder of an old path climbing up between the old rectory on the High Street and the parish church on Church Hill. All that's left is an early 19th-century house and the Castle Tavern, an old public house that was rebuilt in 1937. The rest of Parson's Hill, including two chapels, was swept away in the 1960s construction of John Wilson Road.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 41-48, 74-78, 117.

Even the relatively new Waterfront Leisure Centre has been designated for demolition. On the south side, a chaotic picture is created by two clusters of small, mostly run-down shops, a garage complex and a cinema which is by far the largest building here. The former Granada Cinema of 1936-37 is used as a Pentecostal church. It has some of the most lavish cinema interiors in London. The adjacent shop fronts (Woolwich High Street nos. 131-132) are probably from the early 19th century, perhaps built after the road-widening around 1810. Furlongs Garage occupies the site of the Dog Yard brewery, established by John Hare in the 1730s. This ambitious brick-clad garage complex dates from 1938-39. It was said to be the largest motoring complex in south-east London at the time. It comprises a four-storey garage with a ramp, linked to a smaller building by a high-level bridge over Mortgramit Square. Originally it also featured showrooms on Powis Street. The largely 1950s High Street frontage includes a filling station, a carwash and shops. To its east is a group of three, originally four Georgian shop-houses (nos. 121-123), all with M-shaped gambrel roofs. The fourth house, next to Furlongs, was demolished in 1994, after which the shops were given new frontages. The Coopers' Arms, also Plaisted's Wine House (no. 120), is a pub established around 1740 by John Hare, whose brewery stood nearby. The current neo-Georgian building dates from 1929-30. The decorative lamp is probably older. Plaisted's is separated from the corner building on Hare Street by a narrow alley that leads to a part of Mortgramit Square previously known as Dog Yard. The large cornershop was built for Burton's in 1929 with neo-Egyptian detailing. It is now a restaurant with a nightclub above. The original shopfront, mostly on Hare Street, survives behind bright yellow shuttering.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 70-76, 222.

The south side of Woolwich High Street continues with a scattering of small shops, followed by the Callis Yard construction site, and the 1960s Riverside House offices. On the corner with Hare Street is a large shop of 1882 with a narrow façade on the High Street and a pedimented clock on the corner. The 18th- century house next door is much altered but its exposed brick flank on Ferry Place is original. Ferry Place, or Cock Yard until 1938, is a narrow cul-de- sac that in 1871 had 69 people living in it. Further east is Thakrar House, a five-bay building put up in the late 1850s for an outfitter. Adjacent, nos. 108-112 constitute five much-altered but essentially Georgian shop-houses. They were once located opposite Market Hill; their 18th-century occupants overlooked the market with its watch-house, pump, cage and stocks. Nos. 111-112 are probably the oldest surviving houses in Woolwich, from the early 18th century, perhaps also the smallest. Nos. 110-111 are from the late 18th and early 19th century and are one storey higher. No. 108 was rebuilt in the 1820s, of plain brick, three storeys high and three bays wide. Callis Yard was for more than a century a municipal depot.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 69-72. The site was largely cleared in the 2010s. A section of the old horse stables was saved and restored. In 2016 construction started of seven or eight apartment buildings, including an 18-storey residential tower. The latter will be very close to an existing 17-storey office tower, part of Riverside House, built in 1962-63. Most of Riverside House is on Beresford Street but the anomalous and much-disliked office block forms the pivot point between the two streets.John Betjeman described Riverside House in 1965 as \\"an absolutely square block built solely with the intention of making money and not to make Woolwich beautiful\\". Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 83.

In fact, very little remains from the 1960s when the area was redeveloped as a light industrial and office estate. On both sides of the street vacant lots alternate with 20th-century buildings that are destined for demolition or refurbishment. Plans by Berkeley Homes for the north side are furthest advanced. Part of this area is a park (Royal Arsenal Gardens), part of it a construction site. A Premier Inn hotel opened here, after much delay, in 2017.Whitbread fires up hotel at Berkeley's Royal Arsenal Riverside on berkeleygroup.co.uk, 18-03-2016. The tallest building (17 storeys) will be on the corner with Warren Lane, with even taller buildings behind, nearer to the river. A twelve-storey residential block above a health centre will replace the Woolwich Catholic Club, built in 1979-80.Woolwich Catholic Club on plusarchitecture.ie. On the south side of the street, there has been a proposal for an office-to-residential conversion of Royal Sovereign House. Built in 1980-81, this was part of a development incorporating a supermarket and a five-storey office block. The 1880s Union Street School, on the corner of Macbean Street (formerly Union Street), was demolished in 2011. No plans for redevelopment have been presented for this vacant lot, nor for the adjacent and desolate-looking market pound.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 79-84.

It is written and performed by sex workers and their friends.  Development  Siobhan Knox and Alex Etchart (from Experimental Experience Theater), the co-directors and facilitators behind Sex Workers’ Opera, created the show with the intention to challenge the common misrepresentation of sex workers as either glamorous or harrowed women in film and opera, such as in la Traviata, Madame Butterfly, The Threepenny Opera, Manon, and Lulu. In 2013, as part of a Royal Opera House new writing programme, Etchart first began working on the idea of an opera written and performed by sex workers. The project started with seven months of ground research in 2014, collecting stories from sex workers and consulting with local and global sex worker organisations, including UK organisations, e.g. the Sex Workers Open University, x:talk, English Collective of Prostitutes, and Project X from Singapore and Fundación Margen from Chile. The co-directors reached out to sex workers using escort websites, internet forums, community meetings, email lists to involve them in the production. In May 2014, a group of 20 people came together for three days of workshops, and two days after held their first show at the Courtyard Theatre in Hoxton, London. The initial performance was followed by development workshops at the Arcola Theatre, which resulted in a new show which was two hours long and featured a four-person mini-orchestra.  Synopsis  The show combines musical numbers and storytelling, and includes traditional arias, poetry, hip- hop, spoken word, folk and jazz. The show does not have an overarching plot. Two of the few recurring characters are an anti sex-work, feminist mother and her sex worker daughter, berated for her occupation. The production furthermore explains how current sex work legal frameworks criminalising the clients of sex workers in certain countries, such as Norway, Sweden, and France can stigmatise and expose sex workers to danger. It also reenacts brothel raids by the police in the UK when sex workers were targeted in the name of anti-trafficking actions, some of them exposed by the media, detained and deported from the country.  Cast  The Sex Workers’ Opera has a policy that the cast and creative team should be at minimum 50 per cent sex workers, whose personal experiences make up the main body of the show. This multimedia performance also includes more than 50 stories from sex workers across 17 countries, creating a multi-voiced, diverse and rich landscape of the industry; from street-workers in Chile dealing with global south inequality to WebCam models in the USA performing poetry.  Response  In 2016 Siobhan Knox, Rachel Burley, and Charlotte Rose, appeared on This Morning on ITV to promote the opera. In a 2016 review, Charlotte Beale of The Independent found the production too long, but called The Sex Workers Opera “one of the most important pieces of theatre you see this year”, and says it offers a rare and intimate insight about sex work from a position, the sex workers themselves, which is often ignored or stigmatised. Jade Jackman from Dazed calls The Sex Workers’ Opera “wickedly funny and tongue-in-cheek”  Financing  The 2016 production of Sex Workers' Opera was financed through crowdfunding on Kickstarter between March 20, 2016 and April 25, 2016 where 300 people raised over £11,000 for the show. Experimental Experience raised £1,000 more than they aimed for. The financing of the show through Kickstarter allowed the cast and mini-orchestra to rehearse for two weeks, pay for the cast and crew, press, and production costs.

He began by studying engraving at the École nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon. After his father's death in 1863, he took his new wife and baby to Paris, where he studied with Jean-Georges Vibert and copied the Old Masters at the Louvre. In 1865, after some financial hardships, he presented two paintings at the Salon and, the following year, achieved success when one of his works was purchased by Mathilde Bonaparte for 5,000 francs. He then decided to concentrate on costumed figures, mostly from the 18th century, and was awarded a contract for three canvases per month at an annual salary of 25,000 francs. Following the Siege of Paris, he embarked on a long period of travelling; visiting Belgium and Algeria. Upon his return, he sold the works he had created for 10,000 francs, settled into a mansion and began collecting antiquities from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. This eventually led to financial difficulties and his mansion was repossessed by his creditors. He was named a knight in the Legion of Honour in 1893Ferdinand Roybet @ the Base Léonore. and had many wealthy people among his clients; notably Cornelius Vanderbilt, who paid 100,000 francs for one of his works at the Palais de l'Industrie in 1893.

He was a son of Levan V Dadiani, Prince-regnant of Mingrelia, and member of the regency council for his nephew, Niko I Dadiani. As an officer in the Imperial Russian service, he took part in the Russo-Turkish, Crimean, and Caucasus wars, and retired with the rank of General of the Infantry. He was also a literature enthusiast and himself a poet of some talent, writing in the spirit of Georgian Romanticism under the pen name of Kolkhideli (კოლხიდელი, \\"Colchian\\").  Family  Grigol Dadiani was the second son of Levan V Dadiani, ruler of Mingrelia—then an autonomous principality within the Russian Empire—and his second wife, Marta Tsereteli. He was, thus, a younger brother of David Dadiani, the penultimate prince-regnant of Mingrelia, and uncle to Niko Dadiani, the last to hold that office. Dadiani married at St. Petersburg, in 1843, to Princess Terezia (1825 – 24 March 1871), daughter of Mamia V Gurieli, Prince of Guria by his wife Sophio Tsulukidze. She was educated at St. Petersburg and served at the Imperial court. She followed her husband to Georgia, where she became involved in many charities, earning the Small Cross of the Order of Saint Catherine from Alexander II of Russia during his visit to Kutaisi in 1861. She died at the age of 47 and was buried at the Martvili Monastery. The couple had no children.  Military career  Grigol Dadiani was enlisted in the Imperial Russian Page Corps in 1828 and took part in the war against the Ottoman Empire in 1829. He then served with his father until 1834, when he was commissioned as a poruchik of the Life Guards Grenadier Regiment in St. Petersburg. In 1844, Dadiani, promoted to colonel, was enlisted in the Life Guards Preobrazhensky Regiment, but he continued his service in the Caucasus. Made major-general in 1854, he commanded the Mingrelian and Gurian militias, composed of local irregulars, against the Ottoman army in 1855 and 1856, during the Crimean War. In 1857, he was officially made a member of the His Imperial Majesty's Retinue. Dadiani commanded the 1st Brigade of the Caucasian Grenadier Division from 1858 and 1859 and took part in the storm of Gunib and capture of Imam Shamil during the Caucasian War. Dadiani was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1860 and, further following the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), on the occasion of the semi-centennial of his military service, to the rank of adjutant general in 1880. His final promotion, just prior to his retirement, was the rank of general of the infantry in 1883.  Politics of Mingrelia  In 1853, after the death of his elder brother David, Grigol Dadiani became part of the regency council for his underage nephew, Niko. The council was presided by the dowager-princess Ekaterina and also included his younger brother, Konstantin Dadiani. Grigol Dadiani's relations with Princess Ekaterina were strained and he was accused by her sympathizers of political intrigues and stocking unrest among the Mingrelian peasants. A peasants revolt in 1857 seriously destabilized Mingrelia, leading to the Russian government to impose its direct administration and, finally, formally abolish princely rule in 1867.  Literary interests and philanthropy  Dadiani was a founding member of the leading Georgian education charity Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians in 1879. He was part of the commission studying the texts of the medieval Georgian epic The Knight in the Panther's Skin. He made donations to several schools and bequeathed his extensive library to the Society for the Spreading of Literacy. Dadiani composed his first poems while studying military in St. Petersburg. His poetry was mostly Romanticist and patriotic, influenced by that of Grigol Orbeliani. He mostly wrote under the pen name of Kolkhideli, \\"a Colchian\\". Grigol Dadiani died in Kutaisi in 1901. He was buried at the Dadiani necropolis at the Martvili Monastery.

It depicts a European town square in twilight, with a number of women, many of whom are nude or semi-nude, scattered around the scene. Three high, open doors stand upright along the walkway. Themes The central theme is the muse, the female figure as the force behind inspiration. The central woman is depicted as beautiful but inaccessible. According to the Paul Delvaux Foundation, \\"she not so much evokes sexuality as refers to a troubling aesthetic physicality\\". Delvaux was largely influenced by Italian painters, but the cold colour scale relates to his identity as a Northern European. The scenery relates to Brussels, the Wallonian countryside as well as Delvaux's interest in classical antiquity. By juxtaposing classical and modern elements, Delvaux tried to create a sense of timelessness. Although others frequently have called Delvaux a surrealist, he repeatedly stressed that he was not an adherent of Sigmund Freud's teachings, nor did he put any psychoanalytical references in his paintings. Provenance The painting belonged to the Paul Delvaux Foundation until 2016, when it was sold as part of a fundraising campaign. According to Martine Gautot, president of the foundation, \\"Delvaux himself foresaw that certain works from the permanent collection could be sold in order to allow the Foundation and the Museum to develop\\". The painting was sold through Sotheby's in New York on 14 November 2016 as part of the auction Impressionist & Modern Art Evening Sale. The buyer paid 2,652,500 US dollars.

He served more than six decades in his profession of active journalism. He was the founder and editor of the Jammu and Kashmir daily Kashmir Times. He was popularly called as the 'Grand Old Man' of English journalism in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Ved Bhasin was known for his \\"uncompromising\\" secular views and support for the underprivileged. Over his career, Bhasin was said to have remained an advocate of justice, peace, and human rights. Credited with institutionalising journalism in Jammu and Kashmir, he was highly respected in journalistic circles for his integrity and intellectual acumen.  Early life and activism  Bhasin was born on 1 May 1929 and had done his schooling in Jammu. He was a student of Prince of Wales College, Jammu. In his college days, he was more interested in politics than journalism. In 1945, his association with journalism started when he became the editor of his college magazine 'Tawi'. He did his post graduation in New Delhi. Ved Bhasin was quite interested in the political sphere of Jammu and Kashmir. He was the President of the Jammu & Kashmir Students Union from 1945 to 1949, the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Youth National Conference from 1950 to 1953, member of the National Conference General Council from 1949 to 1953. Afterwards he left active involvement in politics and turned his attention to social and cultural matters of Jammu and Kashmir.  Journalist career  Ved Bhasin had started his journalism career with Naya Samaj, an Urdu weekly from 1952-54. It was banned in 1954 under the Defence of India rules 1950, because of its opposition towards the then Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah's \\"undemocratic\\" deposition and arrest. Later, Ved Bhasin founded the Kashmir Times in 1955, which started as a weekly and in 1971, it was converted into a full-fledged daily. Bhasin had also worked with news gathering agency UNI as its Jammu and Kashmir bureau chief from 1963-1969. He was the editor of the Kashmir Times from 1964 to 2000. Bhasin was President of J&K; Association of Journalists, Jammu Editors Conference, and Press Club of Jammu twice and served on various Press bodies including Press Advisory Committees (as Convener) for a number of years. = 1947 Jammu massacres = {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; font-size: 83%; background:#white; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 30%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" \\"To recall those days of communal orgy my only objective is to point out that a communalist and killer has no religion. It was the humanity that was the victim of communal fanatics. Instead of blaming any one (community) for those dark days of partition, we should better learn appropriate lessons from history and not allow the communal fanatics of one or the other community to vitiate the atmosphere and disturb communal peace and harmony.\\" — Ved Bhasin, talking of the violence in 1947. } Ved Bhasin was a live witness to the 1947 Jammu massacres. At his age of 17, in his home town Jammu, he witnessed the massacres in November 1947. In some way, he tried his bit in preventing what was happening. For most of his journalistic career, Ved Bhasin did not talk about it fearing it may hurt the people whose perceptions were based on \\"national interest\\" or \\"propaganda.\\" But one day in September 2003, he told his story of those days in the Jammu University at an event. Later on, his testimonies became an authoritative reportage of that pogrom. = Views on Kashmir crisis = In 2006, during the sixth international peace conference in Washington, Bhasin said that no solution for the Kashmir problem can be found without a dialogue that involves the people of Jammu and Kashmir, along with India and Pakistan. He stated that the people of the state cannot be ignored, whom he has identified as the 'primary and basic party to the Kashmir dispute'. According to Bhasin, the UN's resolution for the crisis is no longer relevant, and the only way to achieve peace is to allow all sections of people in the state to participate in the dialogue and find a solution for the majority, through a process of elimination. He says that the solution may be independence, or semi- independence, or joint control, depending upon whatever is acceptable to the consensus, though it may not be possible to satisfy everyone. Ved Bhasin had been an opponent of the presence of security forces in the Kashmir region. He has said, \\"Our experience in the past is that wherever BSF was posted, the situation deteriorated.\\" According to him, \\"though the region has been handed over to the security forces on the ground that there is a serious law and order problem created by the militants, the lawlessness of the security forces is adding fuel to the fire rather than quelling it\\". Quoting his views from his selected works published by his daughter: > “Clearly the policy of suppression pursued in Jammu and Kashmir since 1990 > has not succeeded to eliminate militancy, much less to crush popular unrest > or bring back the people to the national mainstream. The bullet for bullet > policy with untold human rights violations has proved counter- > productive…Unless the root cause of militancy and the people’s > disenchantment with India is tackled no worthwhile and lasting solution is > possible. Primarily, it is a political problem which cannot be tackled with > armed strength by dealing with it as simply a law and order problem. A > political solution that could satisfy the urges and aspirations of the > people of Jammu and Kashmir living in all regions and areas and belonging to > all faiths and communities that could also be eventually acceptable to India > and Pakistan is called for …J&K; is not just a piece of land that it should > be divided between India and Pakistan. It is the people who constitute Jammu > and Kashmir…Any solution based on status-quo, geographically and politically > and constitutionally, cannot be considered rational and realistic and will > not be acceptable to the people who have risen in revolt.” Bhasin opined that an independent, democratic, secular, federal and demilitarized state with internal autonomy is the ideal solution to the Kashmir problem, if both India and Pakistan agree to it and jointly guarantee the state's security. He was criticized by many in Jammu for being pro-Kashmir valley, and was attacked several times.  Life  He was married to Vimal Bhasin, who died out of cancer in 1990. The couple had two daughters, Anuradha Bhasin and Anju Bhasin. Anuradha Bhasin also pursued a career as journalist. On 5 November 2015, Ved Bhasin passed away in Jammu at an age of 86. He was suffering from a degenerative brain disease for the past several months and was on life support system before his death. His death was widely condoled in the state by many people including the then Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, Governor Narinder Nath Vohra and all the other prominent political figures of Jammu and Kashmir.

Early life Bettina Warburg was born in Hamburg, Germany, to Paul Moritz Warburg and Nina Jenny (Loeb) Warburg. She was the younger sister of James Paul Warburg. The family immigrated to the United States in 1902, although they continued to travel between Germany and the United States quite often.Chernow, Ron. The Warburgs: The Twentieth Century Odyssey of a Remarkable Jewish Family. New York: Random House, 1993, pg. 69. Bettina and her father and brother were naturalized in 1911. Bettina attended the Brearley School in New York followed by Bryn Mawr College and the Cornell University Medical School. Work as a psychiatrist Warburg trained as a psychiatrist at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London, after which she worked at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital and at Harvard University’s pathology lab. In 1932, she started a private psychiatric practice at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, where she remained until her retirement in 1967. In addition to her private practice, Warburg taught at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center’s Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic from 1932 to 1940, and was a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry from 1965-1967. War-time relief work In 1938, Warburg and Lawrence S. Kubie, the newly elected president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, organized the New York Committee of the National Committee for the Resettlement of Foreign Physicians, a sub-committee of the National Coordinating Committee for Aid to Refugees and Emigrants Coming from Germany’s (NCC) Resettlement Division. Warburg also served as the co-chairman of the Emergency Committee on Relief and Immigration of the American Psychoanalytic Association from 1938-1948.American Psychoanalytic Association. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association. New York: International Universities Press, volume IV, 1948. These rescue committees provided passports, money, and jobs in the United States and Allied Europe for Jewish psychoanalysts affected by the rise of Nazism. Between 1938 and 1943, Warburg was instrumental in organizing and financing the emigration of 154 Jewish psychiatrists and psychoanalysts from Germany and Austria. Much of this was done using her own and her family's money.Chernow, Ron. The Warburgs: The Twentieth Century Odyssey of a Remarkable Jewish Family. New York: Random House, 1993, pg. 439. Later life Bettina Warburg married musician Samuel Bonarions Grimson, ex- husband of Malvina Hoffman in 1942, although she continued to use her maiden name in her work.

Background American engineer, Wendell Fertig who served for the Allied forces as a reserve lieutenant colonel in the Battle of Corregidor on May 1942. Before the Fall of Corregidor, he was flown out of the island by a PBY flying boat which crashed in Mindanao. He decided to turn to guerilla warfare and worked together with a Philippine Constabulary captain in the island. In an effort to consolidate guerilla forces in the island he claimed to be a brigadier general under General Douglas MacArthur. Having still not established contact with General Douglas MacArthur who was in-exile in Australia, Fertig declared martial law in Mindanao and assumed command of forces in the island. He proclaimed a \\"Free Philippine Government\\" and declared that the resistance against the Japanese occupiers in the Philippines continues. Fertig's forces were able to maintain partial control over parts of Mindanao repelling anti-Allied guerilla forces and providing electricity to towns in the island from 1942 to early 1943. They also attempted to contact MacArthur through an suspended old code. Their messages were received by American forces in San Francisco which were ignored by the Americans due to suspicions that the message are part of a deception effort by the Japanese. Fertig sent 3 men to Australia who managed to retrieve a new simple code which would enable them to establish contact with Allied forces in Australia. General MacArthur established contact with Fertig's forces in early 1943 and sought to put his forces under his command. Fertig's forces coordinated with MacArthur. However, in May 1943, the Japanese launched an offensive in Mindanao which saw large civilian casualties as the Japanese made Filipino internees do forced labor. Inexperience in guerrilla warfare by both the Japanese and Fertig's forces limited guerrilla casualties. Japanese atrocities led to the growth of guerrilla forces in Mindanao. Fertig relayed intelligence report to MacArthur. When American forces landed in Leyte and Luzon, Japanese- loyal forces in Mindanao retreated to small lodgements. They coordinated with American forces when they landed in Mindanao to pursue remaining Japanese forces in the Philippine islands. Status The status of the Free Philippines under Fertig as a sovereign state has been disputed. Jonathan Catubig through his study, They Lied Alone state that if such a state existed it was not \\"legally binding\\" and noted that actual territory controlled by the alleged government are limited to areas with established presence by Wendell Fertig's Tenth Military District. He argued that the term \\"Free Philippines\\" is a generic term which was sometimes used in propaganda broadcast and concludes that Fertig's Free Philippines is a mere product of the guerrilla leader's \\"ambition and illusion\\". He claims that the Philippine Commonwealth government in-exile or the Southwest Pacific area command never recognized Fertig's government.

Early life and education Hagerty grew up in Attleboro, Massachusetts. As a teenager, he worked on his family's farm, as well as at the local YMCA and as a paper boy for his local newspaper, The Sun Chronicle. While attending Attleboro High School, Hagerty played as the only boy on the all-girls field hockey team before graduating in 1987. Hagerty attended Syracuse University, receiving a degree in Consumer Studies in 1991, and earned his Master of Public Administration from Syracuse's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs in 1993. He moved to Evanston with his wife, Lisa Altenbernd, in 2001. Career Hagerty worked in the Office of Government Services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, consulting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, before founding his own emergency management firm, Hagerty Consulting, in 2001. After the September 11 attacks, Hagerty and his firm managed the federal government's $7.4 billion public assistance fund. Hagerty Consulting also assisted in rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina. Hagerty's involvement in the Evanston community included seats on the Boards of Directors of Youth & Opportunity United, a youth development agency, and of local financial institution First Bank & Trust. He also served as president of the Evanston Chamber of Commerce. In 2015, Hagerty chaired a city committee to explore options for the dilapidated Harley Clarke Mansion, a source of political controversy. Mayoral campaign Lawn signs for Hagerty (center) and other Evanston candidates in February 2017 After Mayor Elizabeth Tisdahl announced her decision not to run for a third term, Hagerty announced his candidacy for mayor on October 18, 2016, becoming the third candidate out of an eventual five. His status on the ballot was briefly threatened by an ethics objection from fellow candidate Jeff Smith, who cited a 1992 city referendum changing the ballot procedure for multiple candidates, but the Evanston Board of Ethics dismissed the complaint. Hagerty's campaign quickly emerged ahead in fundraising; by January 2017, it had raised over $100,000, about half of which came from Hagerty himself. By March, Hagerty's campaign had raised more than all four other candidates combined. Hagerty was endorsed by three preceding mayors of Evanston: Tisdahl, Lorraine Morton, and Jay Lytle. Hagerty received 44.4% in the February 28, 2017 mayoral primary, advancing him to a runoff election facing sixth ward Alderman Mark Tendam, who won 20.5%. Despite Hagerty's lead in the primary, the runoff election on April 4, 2017 was surprisingly close, with less than a one percent margin separating Hagerty and Tendam. Tendam conceded the race six days later. The final election results showed Hagerty winning by just 115 votes. Administration Hagerty was sworn into office on May 8, 2017. Members of the Evanston City Council's Rules Committee had raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest before Hagerty was sworn in, since First Bank and Trust, on whose Board of Directors Hagerty sat, was the city's financial institution, but Hagerty stepped down from the Board before taking office. Hagerty's immediate agenda as mayor upon assuming office included pursuing physical improvements to city facilities and working with the Cradle to Career education consortium. In June, following President Donald Trump's announcement of withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Hagerty reiterated the City's commitment to climate action, reaffirming his support of the Compact of Mayors and the Climate Mayors coalition. Following an October 2016 Cook County Board measure to gradually increase the county minimum wage to $13, many suburban municipalities passed measures overriding the wage hike just days before the first incremental increase to $10 on Saturday, July 1, 2017. Hagerty called an emergency meeting of the Evanston City Council on Friday, June 30 in order to give Evanston an opportunity to temporarily do the same. The announcement was met with criticism from local leaders, including City Clerk Devon Reid, who stated that a minimum wage increase was not a \\"bona fide emergency\\" and therefore did not qualify for an impromptu emergency meeting under the Illinois Open Meetings Act. Further, Hagerty was attacked for calling the minimum wage increase \\"a fiscal danger to Evanston's businesses and the City of Evanston's future tax revenues,\\" even though he supported such an increase during his campaign. At the emergency meeting, Hagerty and members of the Council announced that a vote on the override measure would not take place, expressing support for the wage increase. Two months later, the Illinois Attorney General's office determined that the meeting had indeed violated the Open Meetings Act, although no remedial action was taken.

Publication Untilovsk was first published in the Match, No.3, 1928 issue of Novy Mir magazine, although Act 1 had originally appeared in the August 1926 issue of Krasnaya Nov.Commentaries to Унтиловск. The Collected Works by L.Leonov. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura, Vol. 7, 1971 The play was included into volume 4 of the first edition of The Collected Works by L. Leonov in five volumes, which came out in Leningrad in 1930, and later into a collection called Plays (Пьесы), in 1935. In 1936 Leonov made an attempt to radically revise the play an re-wrote two acts, but other engagements prevented him, in his own words \\"from taking the play through myself for the second time.\\" It appeared in Volume 7 of the extended, 1971 version of the Collected Works published by Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. Synopsis Raisa Buslova, once sprightly and beautiful but now a defeated woman, returns to a dismal provincial hole, after unsuccessful attempt to escape from it, with her lover. It turns out that not only Buslov, her husband, but several more men here await for her full of romantic ambitions, much to the chagrin of their wives.Untilovsk. AfishaLive. Stage production From November 1924 till March 1925 Leonov was busy working upon a short novel called \\"Untilovsk\\", then dropped it. In October 1925 Konstantin Stanislavski approached him, asking to write a play for the Moscow Art Theatre. Leonov suggested his unfinished novel's plotline, and Stanislavski liked it. In December of this year its first version was completed. Stanislavski greatly enjoyed the play, and started working upon the production in the 1927/1928 winter season, with Vasily Sakhnovsky and Leonov himself. \\"Each time it felt like a whiff of fresh air, when the author himself started talking, explaining things about his characters... His explanations usually centered around some particular word, line or expression the deeper meaning of which might have otherwise escaped the cast and the director,\\" Sakhnovsky remembered.Театр и драматургия, 1934, № 3, с. 35 The play premiered on 17 February 1928 but ran for only 20 performances,Leonid Leonov. Biography at the MAT site due to lukewarm public response and some harsh press reviews.Vasily Sakhnovsky at the MAT site Anatoly Lunacharsky described it as a step backwards for the theatre.Benedetti, Jean. 1999. Stanislavski: His Life and Art. Revised edition. Original edition published in 1988. pp. 314-315 London: Methuen. Leonov later spoke of how greatly he valued his experience with Stanislavski and the cast. \\"The play was long and difficult, I had to make considerable cuts... With the Untilovsk production behind, I felt much more mature in many respects,\\" he remembered in 1934.«Театр и драматургия», 1934, № 3, с. 29. Analysis The contemporary Soviet critics interpreted the play as showcasing the conflict between the two social types: 'the aggressive philistine' (Chervakov) and the honest, 'working intelligentsia' type (Buslov).«Новый зритель», 1928, № 4, с. 14. Leonov himself held a more pessimistic view on his own creation. He described Untilovsk as \\"the all- consuming mire hosting all kinds of creatures, rare plants and fishes,\\" with its own laws and customs, \\"even its own poetry, the other side of zero.\\" Raisa (a once glamorous woman whose attention every single male character seems to be craving for) wasdescribed by the author as 'worn-out' and 'devoid of the music she once radiated'. And Buslov (whom many critics considered as being on the way to some kind of 'revival') was, according to Leonov doomed to 'sink to the bottom'. The modern theatre historian Inna Solovyova described the play as the one dealing with \\"...hopeless, thick misery of life amidst the snowy desert where political prisoners had to make their home… the drunken brewing of the unrealized dark powers of the soul and the all-consuming dark passions,\\" and akin to both Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters, as well as Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, some of \\"its psychological twists bringing to mind the Dostoyevsky novels.\\" References 1928 plays Russian plays ","title":"Untilovsk"},{"id":"53653013","text":"Neeuro Shaquille Jiménez Ortega (born 29 March 1996) is a Costa Rican footballer who currently plays for C.S.

DiAngelo (born September 8, 1956) is an American academic, lecturer, and author working in the fields of critical discourse analysis and whiteness studies. She formerly served as a tenured professor of multicultural education at Westfield State University and is currently an Affiliate Associate Professor of Education at the University of Washington. She is known for her work pertaining to \\"white fragility\\", an expression she coined in 2011.  Early life  DiAngelo was born Robin J. Taylor into a white working-class family in San Jose, California, the youngest of three daughters born to Robert Z. Taylor and Maryanne Jeanne DiAngelo. Her parents divorced when she was two and the family fell into poverty. When DiAngelo was ten years old her mother died of cancer. Afterwards she and her sisters went to live with their father. She has written that her \\"experience of poverty would have been different had [she] not been white”, reflecting that although she feels that she faced \\"class oppression\\", she also benefited from \\"racial privilege\\". Education and career DiAngelo earned a B.A. in Sociology and History from Seattle University in 1991 where she graduated summa cum laude and the class valedictorian. DiAngelo received her Ph.D. in multicultural education from the University of Washington in 2004, with a dissertation entitled \\"Whiteness in racial dialogue: a discourse analysis\\". Her Ph.D. committee was chaired by James A. Banks. In 2007, she joined the faculty of Westfield State University, where she was named an associate professor of multicultural education in 2014. She resigned from her position at Westfield in 2015. She now holds the position of Affiliate Associate Professor of Education at the University of Washington. She holds two Honorary Doctoral degrees from Starr King Seminary (2019) and Lewis & Clark College (2017). DiAngelo has worked for 20 years in providing diversity training for businesses. She argues that racism is embedded throughout America's political systems and culture. In a 2019 article for The New Yorker, the columnist Kelefa Sanneh characterized DiAngelo as \\"perhaps the country's most visible expert in anti-bias training, a practice that is also an industry, and from all appearances a prospering one\\". Work DiAngelo has published a number of academic articles on race, privilege, and education and written several books. Her first book, co-written with Ozlem Sensoy, Is Everyone Really Equal? An Introduction to Key Concepts in Critical Social Justice Education won both the American Educational Research Association's Critics' Choice Book Award (2012) and the Society of Professors of Education Book Award (2018). DiAngelo is known for her work regarding \\"white fragility\\", a term she coined in a 2011 peer-reviewed paper. She has defined the concept of white fragility as \\"a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves.\\" In the paper, she argues that, “White people in the U.S. and other white settler colonialist societies live in a racially insular social environment. This insulation builds our expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering our stamina for enduring racial stress. I term this lack of racial stamina White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which even a minimal challenge to the white position becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves including: argumentation, invalidation, silence, withdrawal and claims of being attacked and misunderstood. These moves function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and maintain control.” As of 2016, she regularly gives workshops on the topic. In June 2018, DiAngelo published the book White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism. The book became a New York Times bestseller, not leaving the list for over a year. In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, it reached no. 1 on the New York Times list. The July 26, 2020 edition of the list marked the book's 97th week in the Paperback Nonfiction category, where it was ranked number 1. The book received mixed critical reception, with positive reviews in sources including New Statesman and the Los Angeles Review of Books, and negative reviews in sources including The Federalist and The Atlantic.

Early life Richie Champion was born on December 16, 1992, in Orange County, California. Champion is the son of Greg, a hotel company executive, and Lori, a consultant who competed in show jumping while she was in college. The family moved between Texas, Arizona, Washington State, and Alaska when Champion was a child. When he was 10, Champion began taking lessons in Western riding. He showed much talent as a rider, prompting mounted shooting world champion Annie Bianco to invite him to train with her. Champion competed in mounted shooting before asking to train in roping. In junior high, Champion began bull riding. The Champion family moved to The Woodlands, Texas during his junior year in high school. The following summer, a coach asked Champion if he had ever considered bareback riding, a sport similar to riding bulls except the bucking animals were horses. In his first competition as a bareback rider, Champion was bucked from the horse. He had fallen in love with the sport, however, and continued to compete. At the end of his senior year in 2011, Champion won the Texas High School Rodeo Association bareback title. He earned a rodeo scholarship to Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas. He attended Tarleton for three years. Rodeo career After graduating from high school, Champion joined the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). He competed on the PRCA rodeo circuit, winning several small rodeos. In 2013, he traveled with world champion bareback rider Kaycee Feild, learning valuable tips on mental preparation. Champion had more success in the 2014 rodeo season, placing at major rodeos including Fort Worth Stock Show, San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, and National Western Stock Show. In March 2014, at age 21, Champion competed in the inaugural The American rodeo in Arlington, Texas. Organizers invited the top 10 ranked cowboys in each event and allowed others to earn a place in the finals by competing in qualifying events. Champion won the finals of the bareback riding competition by riding a horse named Assault to a score of 90. As the winner of the event, he received $100,000. As the only winner to have come through the qualifying rounds, he earned an additional $1 million. This was the largest rodeo prize ever awarded in a single day. Winning such a large prize at the young age of 21 gave him freedom. Champion reflected that as a rodeo cowboy, \\"you find yourself in a position trying to win money a lot of times and having to push yourself sore or hurt, trying to get on the next one to make money[. ...] To not do that and just to ride bucking horses and do what I love is amazing.” The American was not sanctioned by the PRCA. This meant Champion could not use his earnings to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo, which selects competitors based on their prize winnings for the year. Champion competed at more than 100 other rodeos during the 2014 season, earning a combined $90,000 at sanctioned rodeos, which qualified him for competition at the National Finals Rodeo. At the finals, he won round 5. He finished the rodeo season ranked 3rd in the world at bareback riding. Champion finished the 2015 rodeo season ranked 23rd in the world and did not earn a spot in the National Finals Rodeo. He underwent back surgery in November 2015 and returned to competition two months later. In 2016, Champion became a shareholder in the Elite Rodeo Athletes (ERA), a new for-profit rodeo organization. The ERA planned to host a circuit of 8 rodeos, all televised, each with the same roster of top talent. The PRCA promptly changed their bylaws. Cowboys with financial interest in any other rodeo association would be denied membership in the PRCA beginning with the 2016 season. ERA members like Champion would be disqualified from all PRCA rodeos, including the NFR. The ERA sued the PRCA, seeking a temporary injunction allowing the cowboys to compete at PRCA events. Federal district judge Barbara Lynn denied the preliminary injunction in February, during the multi-day Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo. Although Champion had been leading the bareback riding field, he was forced to withdraw from the competition and return prize money he had won in the initial rounds. After the ERA went out of business after its only year of competition, Champion returned to compete in the PRCA.

It was commissioned by the Queensland Government as a non-judicial inquiry specifically due to the political and public sentiments following the practices of Dr Jayant Patel at Bundaberg Hospital with a broader focus on the practices, systems and processes of Queensland Health. Background A doctor at Bundaberg Hospital, Dr Jayant Patel, originally accused of gross negligence, and the systems of Queensland Health in allowing such alleged negligence was the subject of considerable public and political attention. A number of inquiries were initiated by the Queensland Government. The Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie announced his government would \\"go further than holding a Commission of Inquiry into matters arising from the appointment of Dr Jayant Patel by also holding a major review of Queensland Health's administration, management and performance systems.\\" The Morris Inquiry or \\"Bundaberg Hospital Commission of Inquiry\\", was established, however was terminated after findings of bias by the Queensland Supreme Court, with terms of reference and interim investigations referred to the Forster Inquiry. Davies Commission was later established to complete the terms of reference of the Bundaberg Hospital Commission of Inquiry, as \\"Queensland Public Hospitals Commission of Inquiry\\". The Forster Inquiry was announced on 16 April 2005, and the report was issued on September 2005. Recommendations Recommendations included: * address the most dysfunctional aspect of the organisation’s culture through the appointment and development of leaders who can by example inspire staff and develop the attitudes, culture and beliefs desired * address immediate workforce shortages to the greatest practical extent * improve strategic and health service planning to ensure services are targeted towards the areas of greatest need * strengthen partnerships between the public, non-government health service sectors to gain the best possible value from combined community resources * ensure that the organisational arrangements that deliver health services are efficient and streamlined, and allocate as many resources as practical to frontline services, where clinicians work in teams and networks across Queensland to use scarce resources to best effect * make better use of existing capacity to meet additional needs and provide additional capacity for areas of greatest need * implement systems and procedures to ensure the recruitment and retention of a well qualified and experienced clinical workforce, to reduce adverse clinical events and to support clinicians in their efforts to continually improve clinical practices * implement a range of systemic improvements relating to the way clinicians are supported, the manner in which assets are planned and managed, the manner in which IT and communications services are conceived and managed, and the way in which the performance of the health service will be monitored and reported * improve avenues for members of the community and staff of the public health service to raise concerns about aspects of the service and have these concerns responsibly and appropriately addressed and resolved. Reception Implementation of the recommendations is unclear, however the impact to staff and patients post review has faced criticism. For example, the difficulty of employing overseas trained doctors may have exacerbated staff shortage issues. Many of the original charges against Dr Jayant Patel were dropped, and this may have had the effect of diluting public sentiment to the original issues that led to the inquiry.

Researchers/investigators have been exposed to many types of branches of psychology or schools of thought. Naturally they adopt a school or branch that fits with their paradigm of thinking. More specifically, allegiance bias is when this leads therapists, researchers, etc. believing that their school of thought or treatment is superior to others. Their superior belief to these certain schools of thought can bias their research in effective treatments trials or investigative situations leading to allegiance bias. Reason being is that they may have devoted their thinking to certain treatments they have seen work in their past experiences. This can lead to a fundamental errors to the results of their research they are conducting. Their “pledge” to stay within their own paradigm of thinking may affect their ability to find more effective treatments to help the patient or situation they are investigating.  History  “Therapeutic allegiance of the experimenter was first used by Luborsky Singer, and Luborsky\\" in a journal article published in 1975. The basis of their study looked for comparisons among some psychotherapy practices. They found that patients fared better when combined treatments of therapies were used versus only one treatment applied. They found the strongest allegiance are those therapists who are the authors of new implemented practices or supervise others in a practice. They will tend to use their treatment more often. = Psychotherapy = Some reasons why this is occurs in psychotherapy is that there are many new therapies being implemented and researched. Supported research explains that those who develop \\"specific psychotherapy treatments show more interest for the evidence-based practice of their own therapies compared to others.\\" = Forensic psychology = Most often forensic experts indulge in having formed a biased opinion of the assessment in favor of the party retaining their services as opposed to having it objective by means of the evidence available. Some studies have been conducted evaluating biases in legal cases. They observed that forensic psychologists may be hired by a particular party or attorney, because they have a preexisting attitude “in favor of capital punishment and would be more favorable to accept capital case referrals from particular adversarial parties.” That they may have a partial preexisting allegiance to certain legal cases that favor their opinions. These biases can disrupt justice in legal cases which can be dangerous to our society. The American Psychological Association knows the effects of biases and have prepared guidelines for these preexisting attitudes and biases to help forensic psychologists to be objective when choosing court cases. = Analyses = Another area that allegiance bias is found is when authors/researchers are critiquing each other’s work. Some studies make claims that a previous article confirmed bias and so on. It is important to analyze these authors ,who are making these claims, on how they are coming to their conclusion. These authors may be also demonstrating allegiance bias by testing previous articles to their own work and overexerting the conclusion they have found. These authors are ironically using allegiance bias to verify their work as being correct.  Critiques  Despite the fact that researchers find the outcomes of psychological evaluations to be influenced from allegiance from a specific school of thought, the role of allegiance in the research field should be evaluated cautiously. Several meta-analyses have shown contradictory results between experimenter’s allegiance (EA) and assessment effect sizes in favor of the preferred conclusions.These are meta-analysis that examines a combination of psychotherapy and non-psychotherapy treatments (e.g., medication) if it was directly compared with another type of psychotherapy or meta-analysis evaluating direct comparisons between different types of psychotherapy. Meta- analysis assessing non-verbal techniques, web-based treatments and non- specific or miscellaneous treatments (e.g., yoga, dietary advice, recreation, biofeedback, etc.) should also be excluded. = Sensitivity = The analysis on direct comparisons did not address the quality of studies and neither did it have any significant association between allegiant and non-allegiant studies; whereas significant differences were observed in cases where treatment integrity was not evaluated. In legal cases, evaluator attitudes and other attributes may systematically influence from whom evaluators are willing to accept a referral. Filtering and selection effects in adversarial settings have been assumed to exist, but with few empirical tests of the hypothesis to date. Current studies demonstrate that these experts have preexisting biases that may affect for whom they are willing to work in the adversarial system–thus, likely amplifying the effects of the system-induced biases when layered with preexisting expert biases. = Rating =  Remedies  = Objective methods = * Creating a list - this would be the simplest method for a professional to hypothesize all/any possibilities that would seem reasonable, at the inception of an evaluation process. * Surveillance = Disclosures =  Reporting policies  Systematic reviews and meta-analysis are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. = QUOROM = Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. = PRISMA = Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta- analysis of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, they have explained the meaning and rationale for each checklist item & have include an example of good reporting, while also where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature.

Itinerant Slavic minstrels were presenting puppet shows in western Russia by the thirteenth century, arriving in Moscow in the mid-sixteenth century. Although Russian traditions were increasingly influenced by puppeteers from western Europe in the eighteenth century, Petrushka continued to be one of the principal figures. In addition to glove puppets and marionettes, rod puppets and flat puppets were introduced for a time but disappeared in the late nineteenth century. Today's puppet theaters owe much of their popularity to Nina Simonovich-Efimova and her husband who received support from the Russian authorities shortly after the October Revolution to set up a puppet theater in Moscow. They introduced a number of innovative designs and presented a range of performances for both children and adults. Sergey Obraztsov, who performed classical folk tales with glove puppets and marionettes, established his own theater in 1938. Puppet performances became increasingly widespread during the Soviet era and have remained popular ever since. History The origin of Russian puppetry is far from clear. It is often attributed to Italy, because of similarities between Petrushka and Pulcinella. Other theorists believe that their puppet theaters might have migrated from Byzantium into the East Slavic regions known as Kievan Rus' or that the Mongols could have brought the approach from China. Puppet theater had been popular in the west by the twelfth century and evidence indicates that it had begun to flourish as early as the sixth century in the Byzantine Empire. Because of the nature of itinerant performers, many cultural traditions may well have been influenced by foreign interaction. Ancient Slavic customs to celebrate solstice cycles show that there was a tradition of using masks and manikins in ceremonies to mark the end of one season and the beginning of another. In one such ceremony for Kupala Night, male dolls, called Kupalo, and female dolls, called Marena, are made of straw. The female dolls are repeatedly kidnapped forcing the women to renew their supply, until in the back and forth tug-of-war, the dolls are torn asunder and scattered. Skomoroch performers Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, the word used for theater in Russia was pozorishche, which was a distinct term from igrishche, a dramatic performance including live actors. Kukla, the modern Russian term for puppet theater, was first used in 1699. Itinerant minsrels known as skomorokhs were the original puppeteers in Russia and by the thirteenth century had relocated from Kievan Rus' to Novgorod. By the mid- sixteenth century, they shifted their activity to Moscow when Ivan IV ordered them to be taken there with their performing bears. By the 1630s, puppets had become an integral part of the performances of the minstrels, including an innovative means of creating a stage with blankets tied at the waist and lifted over their heads with poles so that their hands were free to move their puppets. In 1648, the skomorokhi were barred from further performances by a law that sought to wipe out superstition in the interests of Russian morality. From then on, puppets and traditions were increasingly imported from Germany and Denmark. By the mid-eighteenth century, regular performances by French, German, and Italian puppetry companies were also common in Russia. Surviving playbills from the period show that by the 1730s, Petrushka had largely been replaced by Western heroes, though the twenty-three plays in which he was still featured show that he had certainly not been forgotten and had been largely unaffected by foreign influences. By the eighteenth century, rod puppets were regularly seen performing in booths. The tradition arose in Russia and in surrounding countries including Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine when Nativity performances were banned from being held in churches. As the portable mangers were set up in more secular settings, the performances themselves also became less religious. Nina Efimova: designing a cat puppet Ivan Finogenovich Zaitsev was one of the nineteenth-century Russian puppeteers who worked with flat puppets cut from metal. These appeared on the stage through slots cut into the table and performed scenes of the Turko-Russian wars or comedies. One of his contemporaries, Jocovlevich Siezova, made similar puppets of wood, but performances with such puppets died out in the late nineteenth century. A 1908 parody of The Blue Bird which had been produced at the Moscow Art Theater was performed with puppets by Stanislavsky at the cabaret \\"The Bat\\"; Andrei Belyi and Nikolai Evreinov both failed in their attempts to stage puppet theaters; and two women, and Liubov Shaporina, created dolls but were unable to achieve success with their marionette theater in the pre-revolutionary period. In 1916, when Nina Simonovich-Efimova performed for the Moscow Fellowship of Artists, there were few practicing the art. That same year, Yulia Slonimskaya Sazonova created a marionette performance called The Forces of Love and Magic with opulent costuming, orchestration and staging, which garnered note. Shaporina began sketching scenes and costumes for a puppet theater which she successfully launched in 1918 in Petrograd. Both Slonimskaia and Efimova worked not only to elevate the art of puppetry but wrote theatrical theories about puppets, their application, design and development. By 1918, Efimova and her husband, Ivan Efimov, a sculptor, had been asked to set up a children’s theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy, becoming the first professional puppetmasters in Russia, earning themselves the title of the Adam and Eve of Russian puppetry. Taking their hand puppet show on the road, the Efimovs sole means of support for six years was earned from their theater. Through the course of her career, Efimova, who was the driving force behind the puppets, patented innovative designs for shadow plays using silhouettes, rod puppets as well as life-sized manikins, in her attempts \\"to establish puppetry’s validity as a unique discipline\\". Slonimskaia's work focused mainly on marionettes, which she later took to France, Portugal and the United States. Sergey Obratsov By 1924, politically-motivated theaters had spring up in several locations, such as the Petrushka Theater, founded by in Saint Petersburg. That theater merged with the Petrograd Marionette Theatre and was later renamed the Leningrad Puppet Theatre. In 1929, the Children’s Theatre Book opened and in 1931, the Bolshoi Puppet Theatre opened in Leningrad. By the 1930s, state regulations required that all performances, i.e. circuses, variety shows, music performances and puppet theaters be controlled by GOMETs, the State Department created specifically for their regulation. One of the measures GOMETs put in place was that performances must be held in established theater venues and could no longer be itinerant street performances. Sergey Obraztsov gave his first solo performance as a puppeteer in 1923, but worked mainly as a stage actor until 1931, when he was approached by the managers of the Central Children’s Art Studio to form a puppet theater. Becoming the art director of the Central State Puppet Theatre, Obraztsov staged parody-plays with themes geared toward both adults and children. He performed with both glove puppets and marionettes, traveling in and around Moscow until 1938, when he established his own theater. After his theater was bombed during the war, he relocated to Novosibirsk until the war ended. Obraztsov characters evoked a realistic expression and performed both classic folk tales and sophisticated literary works. During the Soviet era, theaters spread throughout the USSR to provincial towns like Arkhangelsk, Ivanovo, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov, Rybinsk, Samara and Yaroslavl, as well as to other Soviet states. The Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic developed a strong marionette tradition and in the Khakassian Republic, a puppet theater in Abakan gained note. There was an effort made to veer toward making puppets more humanistic and away from their folk art roots, which led away from use of marionettes and focus almost exclusively on glove or rod puppets. In 1959, the Leningrad Institute for Music, Film, and Theater created a puppet department, formalizing state training for puppetmasters. During the policy reforms in the Gorbachev era, experimentation began with puppeteers appearing on-stage with their manikins and even with actors portraying puppet characters. Revaz Gabriadze was one of the most widely known puppeteers from the end of the Soviet era. Present The Nizhny Novgorod Puppet Theatre In 2000 the Museum of Architecture in Moscow held an exhibition of puppets made by prominent performers to show variations in design and artistry associated with manikins. Puppet theater without the constraint of realism, has returned to its earlier roots. Marionettes have seen a re-emergence and a range of performance approaches, once again including shadow plays, and traditional puppet movement, are employed. Theater has moved away from both a venue solely for children and often features texts written, rather than adapted from other works, specifically for puppet performances. Some of the most noted theaters include: The puppet Theater of Ekaterinburg is renowned for employing some of the best known puppet designers in Russia. The Khakassian Puppet Theater Fairy Tale in Abakan is noted for its wooden manikins which perform typically biblical themes. The Arkhangelsk Puppet Theater tends to focus on cultural tradition, while the Theater Potudan in Saint Petersburg and the Theater Ten' are known as innovative venues. When Theater Potudan opened, in 2002 its repertoire centered around the Andrei Platonov novella, \\"The River Potudan\\". It was expanded later that year to include an adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's story Nevsky Prospekt. The performances are for an adult audience and explore universal life themes. Theater Ten' recreates intricate shadow plays parodying performances at the Bolshoi Theater. It also hosts events where performers introduce children to theatrical performance, explaining the nuances of various genres.

Performance Art often features a live presentation initially documented by an artist, cultural institution, or host location. This genre of art can take place in a wide range of mediums, and is usually based on four core elements: Time, Space, the Performer's body, and the relationship between viewers and performer. These variables determine how it can be collected and conserved within museums or cultural institutions.  History of performance art Performance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in Asia and Latin America. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. Twentieth century performance art originated from early avant-garde genres such as Futurism, Dada and Surrealism. The choreographed movements combined elements of traditional theater performances and styles of political rallies. The origins of the post-war performance art movement can be credited to composer John Cage and dancer Merce Cunningham at North Carolina's Black Mountain College. Cage's teaching in New York shaped the work of artists such as George Brecht, Yoko Ono, and Allan Kaprow, who formed part of the impetus behind the Fluxus movement and the creation of \\"happenings,\\" which were then preceded by Abstract expressionism and Action painting. Since the 1960s the List of performance artists has continued to increase, and the styles of the genre are never confined. Artistic intent  In experiencing painting, film, literature, theatre, dance, music, and other arts, is it useful to consider the artist's intent, including evidence from previous work, external statements, and historical and personal contexts. Art and nature, non- aesthetic intent, the artist's testimony, historical context, situational approaches, intent for audiences, and textual intent are factors that take part in what or how the artist allows their work to be represented. The Artist's statement is another form in determining the conditions of their performance. These preferences include how the work can be documented, collected, and preserved. Ethical concerns Performance art is often undefined in its boundaries, so this may raise concern for where and how it is exhibited. Additional concerns are raised in participatory performances. There are several Codes of Ethics for professionals working in conservation and preservation-related fields. In the United States, the main conservation Code of Ethics is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. However, many of the professional organizations have their own codes, such as the Society of American Archivists Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics. Conserving performance Performance art contains a history of disregarding a standard definition or description, which presents a series of questions and discussions to qualify its conservation. Conserving and preserving Performance art was originally questioned if it was possible and for what reasons should it be collected. Projects such as the Variable Media Network and Collecting the Performative provided the conservation of performance art with some degree of legitimisation. Literature offers critical remarks about a wide variety of aspects related to the preservation of this artistic genre mostly concerning museum practices. With input from artists, art educators and historians, conservators, and curators, a wider perspective is being generated for cultural institutions to develop new techniques in conserving and restoring live, time based works through workshops like The International Symposium \\"Collecting and Conserving Performance Art\\", held in Wolfsburg, Germany. Among the main academic publications, it is possible to include two doctoral dissertations: Amélie Giguère's PhD on the museumisation of performance art, and Hélia Marçal's PhD on the conservation of performance art. Pip Laurenson's and Vivian van Saaze's text on collecting performance art;Pip Laurenson and Vivian van Saaze (2014). Collecting Performance-based Art: New Challenges and Shifting Perspectives. In O. Remes (Ed.), Performativity in the Gallery: Staging Interactive Encounters (pp. 27-41). Peter Lang. the Special Issue of Revista de História da Arte - Série W, Performing Documentation in the Conservation of Contemporary Art, which includes Vivian van Saaze's article about the absence of documentation of Tino Sehgal's performance works; some chapters in Authenticity in Transition: Changing Practices in Art Making and Conservation; some articles in the Studies in Conservation special issue dedicated to the IIC LA Congress on Modern Art - Where contemporary art and contemporary music preservation practices meet: The case of Salt Itinerary (by Andreia Nogueira, Rita Macedo and Isabel Pires) and This is so contemporary? Mediums of exchange and conservation (by Robert Lazarus Lane and Jessye Wdowin-McGregor); some contributions in the ICOM-CC 18th Triennial meeting; an article in the Journal of the Institute of Conservation, six papers published at the VDR-Journal \\"Beiträge zum Erhalt von Kunst- und Kulturgut\\" (Volume 2/2017 and 1/2018), among other, are also texts worth mentioning. A broad discussion of what context the live works could be preserved has also been presented by David Smith of Asia Art Archive and Athena Christa Holbrook from Museum of Modern Art,. These authors discuss the legitimacy of how a performance can be conserved and the resulting value of the work after by the artist, collection, and for the public. =Cultural institutions= Cultural institutions like Museum of Modern Art and Tate Modern have continued to develop conservation techniques on media-specific preservation needs, like securing equipment, updating exhibition-mode technology, and developing ways to re-create duration-based presentations. Their lists and policies establish a consistent method of collecting and preserving Performance Art by examining the license to \\"re-perform\\" the work, existing practices used to bring live works into a collection, and looking at past participants and producers. In her PhD dissertation, Amélie Giguère exposes the many ways performance art changes, once it is acquired by museums. Other texts, such as Alessandra Barbuto's (MAXXI) account of the role of the museum in the preservation of performance art (see Performing Documentation) or Irene Müller's perspective on performance art's conservation and the relationship with archives, are also related to performance art's museumisation. Glenn Wharton refers to the acquisition of VALIE EXPORT’s Abstract Film No. 1 by the Museum of Modern Art as an act of translation from performance “to a fixed installation work that could be acquired by the museum”. The book Histories of performance documentation (ed. by Gabriella Giannachi and Jonah Westerman), explores the relationship between performance art and the institution. Contributions from Laurenson (Tate) and Gabriella Giannachi (University of Exeter) are particularly relevant. While Laurenson stresses the idea of an artwork's socialization and its being interwoven with an artwork's trajectory (which she connects with “continuum theory”), Giannachi provides new frameworks for understanding the conservation of performance art: first by acknowledging re- enactment as a practice of preservation, then by recognizing the increasing importance of audience members as content co-producers, and finally by understanding the artwork as “a social network of activities”. =The artist= The artists/creators of the performance are the original source for the intentions for conserving the work. The artist's intent can determine how or to what degree the live work can be preserved. Popular performance artist Marina Abramović has spent much of her career recreating new versions of past performances by either replicating the physical actions or by selecting a reoccurring location, theme, or medium. She has also spent time as an educator in Performance Art so that her similar methods and styles are repeated. Marina has used several resources in copyrighting her work to ensure its authenticity and the work can be preserved in its current state. Performance scripts have also been used to preserve a live performance. With these written instructions or steps, the original live work can be re-performed or accurately represented keeping the artist's intentions true to the original work. Although curators and art critics have questioned if these scripts are sufficient materials for preserving and collecting the work; this method can be argued with similar conservation methods used in theater and performing arts.Hanna Hölling discusses these issues in relation to multimedia art in Paik's Virtual Archive: Time, Change, and Materiality in Media Art, Oakland: University of California Press, 2017. () Conservation and restoration treatment methods Performance art that includes video, film, slide, audio, or computer technologies often falls under the conservation and restoration of time-based media art because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. Collecting, preserving, and exhibiting these performances raises complex technical and ethical challenges to conservators. Reside from Performance art fall under two main categories for either physical objects, and digital objects or New media associated with the work. While performances can have either category or combination to document the performance, exhibit, and preserve the existence or transformation of the work; the digital component has become the dominant method of prolonging the existence of the performance. Some strategies of overcoming the challenges of collecting live work are addressed in Marta Rodriguez's analysis. = Mediums = Performance Art can take the form of several mediums with the possibility for combination such as but not limited to: * BioArt * Cyberformance * Digital art * Digital poetry * Electronic art * Evolutionary art * Generative art * Information art * Interactive art * Internet art * Kinetic art * Light art * Motion graphics * Net art * Photography * Sound art * Video art * Virtual art These mediums can be the result of documentation for the performance or be directly involved in the art itself. The mediums often determine how the work is collected, conserved, and restored. =Physical objects= Physical props, tools, clothing, etc. remaining or created as a result of the performance can be a common representation to document and preserve the Performance. Collections care guides and policies manage best practices for prolonging the life of the work. Preventive care and maintenance Many works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and exposure to visible light and ultraviolet radiation. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage- limiting levels. Other causes of deterioration include: *Pollution *Poor Storage *Poor Handling and Use Collections care is an essential element of museum policy. It is a \\"responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. Cultural institutions should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.\\" =Digital= Digital mediums can be used for documentation or be a result of a performance such as digital photography, video, and audio files. Conservation and restoration of new media art can establish best practices for individuals, artists, and cultural institutions to prolong the life of the work. Digital preservation Works of new media art such as film, tapes, web browsers, software operating systems eventually become obsolete, and New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to preserve artwork beyond the time of its contemporary production. The digital archiving of media (see the Rhizome ArtBase, and the Internet Archive), and the use of emulators to prolong the life of work that depend on obsolete software or operating systems. Preventive care and maintenance Instability and change are inherent to these artworks, since artist-selected equipment and technologies fail and become obsolete. Many time-based media artworks are ephemeral by nature; rather than being composed of a unique original, they exist only when they are installed, so every iteration can be considered a different representation of the artwork. To preserve the fragile identity of time-based media artworks, conservators must proactively manage the degree of change that may be introduced to each. Methods of preservation The Variable Media Questionnaire (VMS) has developed into a significant tool in relation to digital preservation. *Refreshing- The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format. *Restoration- The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original. *Networked storage- The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives. *Migration- To upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original. This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel. Acquisition and storage Physical media- equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term strategy, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or outdated. Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as Internet art, performance art and live electronic music. *What to consider when collecting Performance Art Causes of deterioration For the residue and documentation of performance art, new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and metadata standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the Open Archival Information System model. The practice of Digital preservation and Web archiving offers special challenges and opportunities. Where scientific data and legal records may be easily migrated from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions. Emulation and Reinterpretation are additional approaches for prolonging the life of digital objects and documentation. = Pest management = For physical objects and props relating to a performance piece, conservators must follow proper pest management standards. Integrated Pest Management policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Policies and checklists specific to museum integrated pest management, for example from the National Park Service and Smithsonian Institution, discuss best practices, to include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition and storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas.

He won four consecutive bareback riding world championships between 2011 & 2014. He is the first cowboy to win three consecutive bareback riding average titles. Early life Kaycee Feild was born on March 4, 1987 in Payson, Utah. He is the son of Lewis Feild, who was the world all-around rodeo champion three years in a row in the 1980s. As a child, Feild and his brother, Shadrach, often traveled with their father as he rode the rodeo circuit. At age 13, Feild began practicing riding bareback broncs. His goal was to become the best bareback rider in the world. Feild was a scrawny child, however. His father was afraid he would be hurt, and refused to allow him to practice or compete regularly until he turned 17. The limited opportunities to practice whetted Feild's appetite. He said that \\"starting at that age made me want to do it more and crave it more. It made me put my mind to it instead of getting out there and just doing it.\\" Feild attended Utah Valley State, where his father was the rodeo coach. Feild won the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association bareback title in 2008. Career Feild qualified for the professional National Finals Rodeo (NFR) for the first time in 2008, and then again in 2009 and 2010. Since 2009, Feild has volunteered with the Wrangler National Patriot Program and has traveled to the Middle East to visit American troops over the Memorial Day holiday. In his first five years with the program, Feild visited forward operating bases in more than 10 countries. He credits the visits with keeping him grounded and helping him to focus more on his goals. During the 2011 season, Feild earned $319,986, a record for members of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). That season marked his fourth appearance at the NFR as a bareback rider. He won six rounds of the bareback competition, setting a record for most round wins at the NFR. He won the PRCA bareback riding title, the world title, and the top gun award. At the 2012 National Finals Rodeo, Feild again won the bareback riding championship and the world title, beating Will Lowe. He ended the season with $276,850 in winnings. According to Feild, the second championship was more difficult to win the first. \\"I don't know why, but I found that to be true. To come here and stay on top the whole time in Vegas and stay strong was tough. Bareback riding is simple. It's just having the right mindset. In 2013, Feild and fellow rodeo competitor Wesley Silcox began working with Cowboy Outfitters USA to offer free rodeo camps to teenagers interested in improving their bull and bronc riding skills. Feild completed the 2013 season with $239,465, enough to make him the world champion bareback rider. He also won the aggregate title at the NFR, with a combined score of 823. This win made him the first cowboy to win three consecutive aggregate titles, and the first bareback rider to win three consecutive world titles since 1975. Feild again clinched the world title as a bareback rider in 2014, edging out Austin Foss. He was only the second man to win four consecutive world championships at the NFR, after Leo Camarillo, a team roper header who won from 1968-1971. Feild competed at the NFR again in 2015. He won or placed second in five of the first nine rounds. Going into the tenth and final round, Feild had a lead of $34,00 on each of his competitor but was second in the average standings, behind Steven Peebles. He drew Times Up for the last round. His score of 77 placed him outside the money-earning top six. Peebles won the bareback title and Feild came in second. In 2015, Feild joined 54 other elite rodeo competitors to launch the Elite Rodeo Athletes (ERA). Their goal was to create a professional rodeo circuit, similar to the Professional Bull Riders, to allow the top rodeo performers to compete at a limited number of events per year. Feild explained that he joined the ERA because of its larger payouts. On the PRCA circuit, Feild must compete in 70-90 rodeos per year to what he describes as \\"a living - but not a great living\\". As part of the ERA, he expects to earn more money than that competing in fewer than half the number of rodeos annually, potentially allowing him to stay healthier and extend his rodeo career. In response, the PRCA changed its bylaws, prohibiting their members from owning shares in the ERA. The ERA sued. In 2016, the PRCA won the lawsuit. Feild, along with other world champions such as Lowe and Trevor Brazile were denied PRCA membership, prohibiting them from competing at PRCA rodeos and rendering them ineligible for the National Finals Rodeo in 2016. On February 25, 2018, the annual RFD-TV's The American was held again in the AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Feild rode C5 Rodeo Company's Virgil, the current Bareback Horse of the Year. Feild and Orin Larsen tied in the first round of the short-go with a score of 88.25. In the second round, Feild posted the highest score of 90.75, Larsen posted 88.50, and Steven Dent posted 85.00. Feild won $100,000 for his bareback win and a share of the $1 million side-pot as a qualifier, equal to $433,333.33. Feild's ride of 90.75 points brought him the big prize. He shared the prize with Cort Scheer, who won saddle bronc riding and Matt Reeves, who won steer wrestling. The ERA went out of business after only one competitive season, and Feild returned to compete in the PRCA. Personal life Feild married his wife Stephanie on July 31, 2012. They have a daughter born April 2, 2013 and a son born November 2, 2015.

An elective genetic test analyzes selected sites in the human genome while an elective genomic test analyzes the entire human genome. Some elective genetic and genomic tests require a physician to order the test to ensure that individuals understand the risks and benefits of testing as well as the results. Other DNA-based tests, such as a genealogical DNA test do not require a physician's order. Elective testing is generally not paid for by health insurance companies. With the advent of personalized medicine, also called precision medicine, an increasing number of individuals are undertaking elective genetic and genomic testing. History Genetic testing for a variety of disorders has seen many advances starting with cytogenetics to evaluate human chromosomes for aneuploidy and other chromosome abnormalities. The development of molecular cytogenetics involving techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) followed, permitting the detection of more subtle changes in the karyotype. Techniques to determine the precise sequence of nucleotides in DNA by DNA sequencing, notably Sanger sequencing was developed in the 1970s. In the 1980s the DNA microarray appeared, permitting laboratories to find copy number variants associated with disease that are below the level of detection of cytogenetics but too large to be detected by DNA sequencing. In recent years the development of high-throughput or next-generation sequencing has dramatically lowered the cost of DNA sequencing permitting laboratories to evaluate all 20,000 genes of the human genome at once through exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. A catalogue of the many uses of these techniques can be found in the section: genetic testing. Most elective genetic and genomic testing employs either a DNA microarray or next-generation sequencing. Historically, all laboratory tests were initiated and ordered by a physician or mandated by a state. Increasingly, patients and families have become more involved in their own health care. One outcome has been the growing availability of elective genetic and genomic testing that are initiated by a patient but still ordered by a physician. Additionally, elective genetic and genomic testing that does not require a physician's order called, direct-to- consumer genetic testing has recently entered the testing landscape. Testing categories Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins; some are associated with human disease. There are many different clinical and non-clinical situations in which genetic testing is used. =Diagnostic testing= Diagnostic testing is used to identify or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition when a particular disorder is suspected based on signs and symptoms present in the patient. Catalogues of more than 50,000 tests available worldwide can be found at GeneTests and Genetic Testing Registry. =Predictive and pre-symptomatic testing= Predictive and pre-symptomatic testing is carried out in individuals who do not have evidence of the disease under investigation. This testing includes Mendelian conditions and polygenic diseases. =Carrier testing= Carrier testing is used to identify people who carry one copy of a gene change (also referred to as a variant or mutation) that, when present in two copies, causes a genetic disorder. Carrier testing is typically offered to individuals who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, have a family history of a specific genetic disorder and to people in ethnic backgrounds that have an increased risk of specific genetic conditions. =Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis= Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is used in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization. In-vitro fertilization is the process of combining an egg (oocyte) and sperm outside of the body with intent of fertilization. PGD is the testing of individual oocytes or embryos for a known genetic condition prior to transferring the embryo to the uterus. Used together, IVF and PGD allow for selection of embryos or oocytes presumably unaffected with the condition. PGD can be utilized by individuals or couples who are affected by a condition of genetic origin, or if both individuals are found to be carriers of a recessive genetic condition. =Prenatal testing= Prenatal testing is diagnostic testing of a fetus before birth to detect abnormalities in the chromosomes or genes. Samples for this testing are obtained through invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Prenatal testing is different from prenatal screening. =Newborn screening= Newborn screening screens infants a few days after birth to evaluate for evidence of treatable diseases. Most newborn screening uses tandem mass spectroscopy to detect biochemical abnormalities that suggest specific disorders. DNA-based newborn testing complements existing newborn screening methods and may replace it. =Pharmacogenomic testing= Pharmacogenomic tests (also called pharmacogenetics) provide information that can help predict how an individual will respond to a medication. Changes in certain genes affect drug pharmacodynamics (effects on drug receptors) and pharmacokinetics (drug uptake, distribution, and metabolism). Identifying these changes makes it possible to identify patients who are at increased risk for adverse effects from drugs or who are likely to be non-responders. Pharmacogenomic testing allows healthcare providers to tailor therapies by adjusting the dose or drug for an individual patient. =Identity testing= Identity testing is used to establish whether individuals are related to one another. It is commonly used to establish paternity but can be used to establish relatedness in adoption and immigration cases. It is also used in forensics. =Ancestry testing= Ancestry testing (also referred to as genetic genealogy) allows individuals to establish their country of origin and ethnic background and identify distant relatives and ancestors. =Trait testing= Some phenotypic traits in humans have a well established genetic basis, while others involve many genes or are a complex mix of genes and environment. Technologies There are many different types of genetic testing that exist. Each is designed to look at different types of genetic changes that can occur. At present, no single genetic test can detect all types of genetic changes. =DNA sequencing= DNA sequencing is a method of testing that looks for single letter changes (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the genetic code. It can also determine when a small number of letters are missing (deletions) or extra (duplications). Sequencing may be performed on a single gene, a group of genes (panel testing), most of the coding region or exons (whole exome sequencing), or most of the genome (whole genome sequencing). With time, this technology is expected to be able to detect any abnormality of the human genome. =Genotyping= Genotyping is testing that looks at specific variants in a particular area of the genetic code. This technology is limited only to those specific variants that the test is designed to detect. SNP genotyping is a specific form of genotyping. =Deletion/duplication testing= Deletion/duplication testing is a type of testing designed to detect larger areas of the genetic code that are missing or extra. This technology does not detect single letter variants or very small deletions or duplications. =Panel testing= Panel testing refers to testing for a specific subset of genes most often related to a particular condition. This usually involves sequencing and may also include deletion/duplication analysis. This is often referred to as multigene panel testing because testing simultaneously examines a number of different genes. For example, an individual may have panel testing for a group of genes known to be associated with a particular type of cancer such hereditary colon cancer or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. =Array or microarrays= Array or DNA microarrays look at copy number changes (missing or extra genetic material). This testing looks across a large portion of the genome for larger deletions or duplications (also referred to as copy number variation). This technology can not detect single letter changes or very small deletions or duplications. =Chromosome analysis/karyotype= Chromosome analysis, also known as karyotyping refers to testing that assesses whether the expected number of chromosomes are present, whether there is any rearrangement of the chromosomes, and also whether there are any large deletions or duplications. This technology can not detect single letter changes (single nucleotide variants) or small deletions or duplications. =Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPT) using cell-free fetal DNA = Non-invasive prenatal screening screens for specific chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome in a fetus using cell-free DNA. This screening can also provide information about fetal sex and rhesus (Rh) blood type. A blood sample is drawn from the pregnant mother. This sample contains DNA from the mother and fetus. The amount of fetal DNA is assessed to determine if there is extra fetal genetic material present that may indicate an increased risk that the fetus has Down Syndrome or other selected conditions. As this is a screening test, other diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling are needed to confirm a diagnosis. =Newborn screening= Newborn screening is a type of testing that assesses risk for certain genetic, endocrine, metabolic disorders, hearing loss and critical congenital heart defects. Each state determines the exact list of conditions that are screened. Early detection, diagnosis, and intervention can prevent death or disability and enable children to reach their full potential. The testing is performed from a few drops of blood collected in the newborn period, often by a heel stick. The exact method of testing may vary but often uses levels of specific analytes present in the blood of the baby. Because this is a screening test, additional testing is often necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Pros and cons People choose to have genetic testing for many reasons. Testing may be beneficial whether the test identifies a gene change or not. A negative result can eliminate the need for unnecessary checkups and screening tests in some cases. A positive result can direct a person toward available screening, management or treatment options. =Pros= , *Determine an individual's risk to develop a genetic condition. By identifying gene changes that may increase risk to develop a certain condition, a person can be screened earlier and more frequently for the disease and/or could make changes to health habits such as diet and exercise *Diagnose a genetic condition *Confirm an existing or suspected clinical diagnosis *Determine the severity of a disease by identifying the type of genetic mutation *Help doctors choose the most appropriate medication or treatment plan *Family planning *Identify gene changes that could be passed on to children *Screen embryos or newborn babies for certain genetic conditions. Such a genetic test can help people to make informed choices about their future, such as whether to have a baby, consider an egg or sperm donor, etc. =Cons= , *False security. A negative test result does not mean you do not have the condition or are not at risk. There may be many reasons a test is unable to identify a genetic change. *Expensive and may not be covered by insurance *May be seen by insurance companies. No protection to long-term care insurance, disability insurance or life insurance *Ethical issues. Because genetic testing informs a patient about their genetic information, which is shared with other family members, sometimes a genetic test result may have implications for blood relatives of the person who had testing. See ethical issues/considerations. Importance of family history A patient's family history also known as genealogy, can provide important insight into medical conditions within the family. Given that many conditions have a genetic component, gathering an accurate family history can provide important information about an individuals' personal risk for many diseases. Healthcare providers can use family history information to assess a patient's risk for disease, recommend testing or screening, suggest diet or other lifestyle habits that may help reduce risk, as well as assess risk of passing conditions on to children. When obtaining a family history, it is helpful to gather health information for the following family members: grandparents, parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and first cousins, and children. In the genetic counseling community this is often referred to as a three generation family history. Important information to gather about the individuals in the family include: *History of conditions including common conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer and known genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis or hemophilia or birth defects *Specific information about the conditions should include: age of onset, specific type of cancer, risk factors (smoking, exposures) *Cause and age of death *Ethnic background Some families decide to work together to develop a family history, however, some family members may feel uncomfortable disclosing personal medical information. A number of tools are available to gather family history information. Patients should ask their healthcare provider if their institution has a specific form they prefer to have filled out. The U.S. Surgeon General has created a computerized tool called My Family Health Portrait to help patients create a family medical history. Ethical issues =Informed consent= Prior to undergoing elective genetic testing, there are many factors that an individual should consider including the scope of testing and potential results in terms of changes to medical management, risk to family members, and impact on legal and financial matters. =Family implications= *Family sharing. The implications of genetic test results for other family members are important to consider in patients considering elective genetic testing. Unlike most other medical tests, genetic testing may reveal health information about the patient as well as his or her family members. This may include information which explains a current medical condition, predicts future disease risk, or impacts risks to the next generation. For this reason, it is advised that patients be counseled about potential familial implications prior to genetic testing and provided with support for discussing their results with family members. *Nonpaternity/Consanguinity. In some cases, genetic testing may reveal that an individual's mother or father is not actually a biological parent. In other instances, testing may reveal that an individual's parents are closely related to each other. Whether or not this information is reported may differ between testing laboratories. Due to the potential for psychological harm in unexpectedly receiving this type of result, it is important for individuals undergoing testing to be counseled on the possibility of a finding of nonpaternity or consanguinity. =Genetic discrimination= Many patients are concerned about the possibility of genetic discrimination, the idea that certain individuals or entities would use a patient's genetic information against him or her in order to make employment, insurance policies, or other activities and services difficult or impossible to obtain. In 2008, a new federal law known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) went into effect to help prevent such discrimination. GINA prohibits the use of genetic information to discriminate in health insurance and employment. GINA does not prevent all types of discrimination, however. For companies with fewer than 15 employees, these employment protections do not apply. GINA's protections do not apply to the US military or to federal government employees. Additionally, life, disability, and long-term care insurance policies are not included among GINA's protections. These may still continue to use genetic information to determine one's eligibility for coverage and/or policy premiums. Because of these important exceptions, an individual considering elective genetic testing should discuss the possibility of genetic discrimination with his or her physician or genetic counselor. Some individuals choose to have certain insurance policies in place before undergoing whole genome sequencing so as to prevent future discrimination. =Secondary findings= When undergoing elective genetic testing, patients may expect to receive a variety of different results. In addition to results that may explain a particular symptom or answer a specific question the patient may have had, the scope of elective testing may reveal additional information. These “secondary findings” may include information about increased risk for both treatable and untreatable genetic diseases, carrier status for recessive conditions, and pharmacogenetic information. Most laboratories permit patients and families to decide what types of secondary findings (if any), they would like to receive. It is critical that patients understand the scope of potential results from elective testing and have the opportunity to opt in or out of various results. =Limitations= When considering elective genetic testing, it is important to take into account the type and goals of testing. Providers and patients should be familiar with differing testing methodologies the potential results from each test. For many individuals, factors such as test cost, scope, and deliverables, in combination with their specific clinical questions, play into the decision to undergo elective testing. It is also important to recognize that potential results from elective genetic testing are constrained by the current limits of medical knowledge concerning the association between genetics and human disease. As knowledge of rare genetic factors that confer high risk, as well as common factors that confer lower risks, increases, we will have the ability to learn more about an individual's current and future health. How do I find a geneticist or genetic counselor? Due to their advanced training, genetic counselors have a unique set of skills. Their clinical and psychosocial skills are used to help patients understand their genetic risks, determine which tests are most appropriate for their needs, and explain what the possible test results could mean for both the patient and the family. Clinical geneticists often work in tandem with a genetic counselor and play an important role in providing genetic testing, interpreting test results, and explaining the results. Given the ever-increasing number of elective genetic and genomic tests offered and the wide variety of issues raised by these tests (see pros & cons above), discussion with a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor may be helpful. Directories of genetics professionals can be found through the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors. Future Elective genetic and genomic testing will continue to evolve as the cost of genetic testing technology falls and patients become increasingly involved in their own health care. The rapid drop in cost of whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing in the last five years has resulted in the initiation of several large scale sequencing studies that are systematically evaluating the benefits and limitations of elective genetic and genomic testing. Many of these studies have specifically focused on healthy individuals pursuing elective WES or WGS. Other driving forces in the adoption of this type of testing include continued social empowerment of patients regarding their own health care and increasing private and government funded sequencing projects focused on better understanding the biological, environment, and behavioral factors that drive common disease with the hope of developing more effective ways to treat and manage disease. The Million Veteran Program is one example of a government funded project aimed at collecting data from veterans using questionnaires, health record information, and blood samples for testing, including genetic testing. Aimed at recruiting 1 million or more Americans to participate in the research cohort, The Precision Medicine Initiative will have a large impact on public awareness of precision medicine and the importance of using genetic information to treat and manage disease as well as optimize health. While elective testing is typically not paid for by health insurance companies, this may change as clinical utility continues to be demonstrated. Future applications for elective genetic and genomic testing may include: *Expanded prenatal testing options such as prenatal whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing *Routine whole genome sequencing for all newborns *Increasing availability of direct to consumer testing options  See also  * Personalized medicine *Personal genomics *Whole genome sequencing *Whole exome sequencing * Genetic counseling * Genomic counseling * List of genetic disorders * Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  References   Further reading   External links  *Genetics Home Reference *Guide to Interpreting Genomic Reports: A Genomics Toolkit *dbSNP (a public-domain archive for a broad collection of simple genetic polymorphisms) *SNPedia (a wiki-based bioinformatics web site that serves as a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms and peer-reviewed scientific publications associated with the variants) Genetics ","title":"Elective genetic and genomic testing"},{"id":"53653357","text":"Kim Warnick (born April 7, 1959.

Originally from Juárez, México, she is 36 years old as of 2017. She is an alumna of the University of Texas, El Paso, the Stella Adler Studio, and the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. She started her career as an actress before deciding to focus on playwriting. Her plays explore themes of fantasy, mythology, and feminism, and her notable works include Ash Tree, The Ruin, and Sweep. She received the Kennedy Center's Theatre for Young Audiences Playwriting Award in 2010. Early life Escobar was born in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, México. Being raised in a city on the border of the United States and Mexico, with dual citizenship, Escobar has stated that the idea of \\"borders\\" did not hold much significance to her. She regularly traveled between the two countries without a second thought, mostly going to the United States side of the border with her mother for shopping. Despite growing up in a community in Mexico that Escobar describes as a \\"machismo community of cattle ranchers and mine owners\\", she says the respect for women and the power they held within her family dynamic was very strong. She has lived in many places throughout her life, including: Chihuahua City, Chihuahua, México; Zacatecas City, Zacatecas, México; San Diego, California; El Paso, Texas; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. She now lives in New York City. Education and career After graduating from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2006 with a degree in humanities and philosophy, Escobar began her career as a performer and studied acting at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York City. However, a teacher at the school inadvertently inspired Escobar's eventual career shift to playwriting by encouraging her to try writing rather than acting. Escobar went on to receive an MFA in dramatic writing at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, in 2011. She has been involved with the Latinx Theatre Commons throughout her career in multiple ways, from having a staged reading of her play Sweep at a festival in 2015 alongside the works of other Latinx playwrights, to serving as the managing editor for an online publication for the LTC titled Café Onda, to acting as the steering committee member for the LTC from 2013 to the present. Aside from acting, writing, and editing, Escobar has also worked as an educator and translator. She also does community-based youth outreach in the form of artistic workshops with grade school students. Most recently, in April 2017, she participated in a playwriting workshop with students from a school district in Marfa, Texas, a small community in West Texas not far from her birthplace in Ciudad Juárez, México. Works =Themes and inspiration= Escobar's works include themes of fantasy, surrealism, feminism, family relationships, and modern twists on traditional mythology, among others. She notes that her female family members served as inspiration for many of the strong female characters in her plays, especially because of the fantastical discussions she often engaged in with the women of her family. She cites ancient philosophers as well as writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Shel Silverstein, Lewis Caroll, Kurt Vonnegut, Christopher Moore, and Neil Gaiman as inspirational figures. =Notable works= =StoneHeart= StoneHeart is a deconstructed western that explores the parallel deterioration of a family and a society in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua in the 1980s. Forbidden love, mental illness and suicide come together in a visceral horror family drama where the Zermanis are forced to cope with the death of their legacy amidst the rise of a new generation of 'society's finest.' Listen in the 2019 Kilroy's List =Then they forgot about The Rest= Two sisters coping with a recent traumatic event sign up to receive information regarding a special trial for the soon-to-hit-market drug: Alleviate. Meanwhile, at an ad agency called The Rest, the advertisers are about to accept this new 'forgetting pill' brief. Paths intertwine between memory, the truth, and The Rest as a pending apocalypse threatens to end the human race. An apocalyptic frontera (border) funk piece with elements of noir, 'Then they forgot about The Rest' is a southwest femmetasia about the things worth forgetting, the physical impact of memory, and the company that we keep.\\" http://www.playbill.com/article/watch-how-the-sound-of-a-fridge-became-the- soundtrack-to-georgina-escobars-new-play-then-they-forgot-about-the-rest Ash Tree Ash Tree follows the story of three sisters in the aftermath of the loss of their mother. Escobar experienced the loss of her own mother before the idea for the play came to her in a dream. The plot has its basis in themes relating to fantasy and mythology. The play had its initial readings in Indiana in 2010, the ASSITEJ Festival of Denmark and Sweden in 2010, and the Kahootz Theatre in 2009. In 2011, it was workshopped by Fourth Wall Productions, a company that Escobar founded in 2003. Ash Tree premiered in New Mexico's Duke City Repertory Theatre in 2012 and was produced by Capital High School Theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2016. The Ruin The Ruin explores themes of magic, witchcraft, mystery and ancient legends. Like Ash Tree, Escobar claims she was inspired to write the story after the idea came to her in a dream. It was put on in 2011 by the Manhattan Repertory Theatre and in the Words Afire Theatre Festival in New Mexico. The Unbearable Likeness of Jo, Semity, & Jones The Unbearable Likeness of Jo, Semity, & Jones is a \\"A ridiculous investigation into memory, personal identity, and digiphrenia. Moments before her plane is about to crash, Jones deconstructs memory as a state of passage; from love, to Facebook, to her sexuality; all as related to one thing: present shock.\\" The play was read at Coffee and Whiskey Productions in Chicago, IL, in 2014, at The Flea Theater in New York City in 2015, and at The Movement Theatre Company in New York City in 2016. The play had a workshop production at Dixon Place in 2015. Sweep Sweep is described as a feminist play. The story follows two siblings who have the ability to travel through time. Much of the story has to do with biblical figures such as Adam and Eve, which Escobar attributes in part to her upbringing. She attended Catholic school and explored spirituality alongside her family members. Sweep is a femme spec-evo story that follows two sisters and hit women of the splintered worlds whose initial snafu with Adam and Eve catches up with them lifetimes later. Fighting for the final chance to reset humanity's imperfect patterns, the women of Sweep hunt their targets from biblical times to modern-day in order to accelerate humanity's evolution. Sweep had readings at the Brooklyn Generator in New York City in 2014 and at the Latinx Theatre Commons Carnaval of New Latina/o Work in Chicago in 2015. It was also workshopped at the Lincoln Center Theater's Director's Lab in 2016. The play was a finalist for the National Latino Playwriting Award. It was produced in 2017 at the Aurora Theater in Atlanta, Georgia. The casting of the two main characters for the play is flexible, with no preference given to any particular ethnicity or gender identity for the actors. The Aurora Theater production of the play cast two black women for the roles of the main characters, and Escobar expressed support for this casting decision. The Circuz The Circuz is a political satire and melodrama. Set in Cuidad Juarez at the height of genocide and murder, the narrative was \\"macabre farce that explores the discomfort of violence through exaggeration, faith through senses, and the cynicism of a land divided in two\\". =Selected list of works= * Penny Pinball Presents: The Beacons * Species:Human\\" * Monsters We Create (in collaboration with UTEP Playwrights)\\" * Screwgar\\" * Quixote: On the Conquest of Self (translation) * All Strings Considered * Albrijes * El Muerto Vagabundo * Sweep * The Unbearable Likeness of Jones * The Wayfoot Series * Firerock The Musical * Ash Tree * The Ruin Awards Escobar received the Kennedy Center's Theatre for Young Audiences Playwriting Award in 2010. Personal life Escobar has been open about her sexuality and identifies as a \\"gay Mexicana\\". Spanish is her first language, and she states that her \\"true self lives\\" in the writing of her native language. Besides writing, Escobar has expressed her love for the outdoors and for the visual arts, saying that she often paints. When it comes to her identity as a Latina playwright, Escobar pushes back against the idea that Latinx playwrights must have some specifically Latinx quality to their work, stating: \\"As an artist and writer, all of my work was, is and will always be Mexican because that is what I am... Personally, I am more interested in being an artist than in defining my art.\\" She rejects the fact that Latinx playwrights are pressured to include Spanglish or concrete depictions of their heritage and culture within their plays. Escobar also criticizes the lack of opportunities for Spanish-language theater in the U.S. Latinx theater world and refuses to condone writers who solely focus on and glorify Mexico's cartel violence.

History  The first station in Washington was opened on 16 April 1835 as an intermediate stop on the Stanhope & Tyne Railway passenger service between and . On 9 March 1840 the Durham Junction Railway introduced a passenger service along their line from which, beyond Washington, continued along the S&TR; and the Brandling Junction Railway to Oakwellgate in Gateshead via Brockley Whins. The station was not conveniently located, being 1 mile to the south east of Washington Village with the station building located between the tracks of S&TR; and DJR, immediately south of the junction between them. On 19 June 1844, southbound services along the DJR were diverted to and along the newly constructed Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway and on 1 October 1850, the York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway diverted Gateshead services along a new, more direct route to Pelaw, thus allowing the line to bypass Brockley Whins. When the YN&BR; diverted services onto the direct line to Pelaw, they began to use a new station in Washington, 600yd to north east of the original and only the market day services to Durham Turnpike continued to use the first station until they were withdrawn in December 1853. The second station was situated on Station Road, south of the railway bridge and level crossing on Usworth Station Road and Washington Road respectively and was closer to Washington Village than the first station had been. Adjacent to the station were brickworks a wire rope works and a large chemicals plant. North of the footbridge were two buildings: one was the rear of a goods shed and the other was lower with a hipped roof. The goods shed was reached by the sidings on the up platform. The goods handled at the station were bricks, iron, steel, composition and livestock. In March 1862, a passenger service along the former S&TR; route was reintroduced (this time from the second station) providing a service to Chester-le-Street and . However the opening of Chester-le-Street station on the Team Valley Line led to it being permanently withdrawn in January 1869. Inter-city services between London and continued to use the line through Washington until 15 January 1872 when services were diverted via and the Team Valley line after which point only local services used the Leamside line. The passenger bookings had declined to a mere 2,318 in 1951. Passenger services started to decline after summer 1957, and by 1963 Monday-Friday departures consisted of a single morning arrival at 8:56 and a single afternoon departure at 17:33 from and to . The Beeching Report recommended closing the station to passenger traffic, which occurred on 9 September 1963 (making it the first post-Beeching closure in the country).

Biography She was born Agnes Dunbar Moodie on a farm near Coburg, Ontario. Her parents were John Wedderburn Dunbar Moodie and Susanna Moodie. Around five years later, the family moved to Belleville. She learned how to paint flowers from her mother. Her mother, famously, published Roughing it in the Bush, a romantic history about the harshness of Canadian rural living during the 1830s. Roughing it was published in 1852, and has remained in demand and inspired writers such as Margaret Atwood to the present day. In 1868, Canadian Wild Flowers was published, viewed as one of the first serious botanical works published in Canada, which included text by Catharine Parr Traill. The book, very expensive for its time, was sold by subscription, largely through its author's own efforts; as an enterprising widow, she also worked as an illustrator to support her children and herself. Fitzgibbon was married twice: first around 1850 to Charles Thomas FitzGibbon, a barrister, who died in 1865 and then in 1870 to Brown Chamberlin, later the Queen's Printer. She had eight children with her first husband and one with her second. In 1863 she began her paintings of Canadian flora to illustrate a book by her aunt Catharine Parr Traill. After the death of her husband, she began work on a book of Canadian wild flowers, with her water-coloured illustrations and Traill's text. The book attracted 500 subscriptions, a significant number at the time. Illustration of Canadian Wildflowers by Agnes Chamberlin Canadian Wild Flowers first edition was published in 1868. The second and third subscribed editions were published in 1869 (Montreal: J. Lovell); and a fourth edition in 1895 (Toronto: W. Briggs). Her paintings of Canadian plants and flowers were also published in other books on Canadian flora, with 9 full page colour lithographs in Catherine Traill's Studies of Plant Life in Canada (Ottawa: A.S. Woodburn, 1885). In 1972, 11 of the watercolour paintings were reproduced in Eustella Langdon's Pioneer Gardens (Toronto: Holt Rinehart and Winston). She died in Toronto in 1913. Agnes Chamberlin's heirs presented her paintings and copies of Canadian Wild Flowers and Studies of Plant Life in Canada to the University of Toronto in 1934–5. They became part of the University's Botany Department, Then, in 1966, the collection of books and paintings were transferred to the Rare Books and Special Collections of the University of Toronto Library in 1966. These books and artwork are now available in the Chamberlin Collection of the University of Toronto and digitized to view online.

Following growing strains in the coalition between the KMT government in Wuhan and the CPC, and under pressure from the rival nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Wuhan leader Wang Jingwei ordered a purge of communists from his government in July 1927. Background During the Northern Expedition (1926–1928) to reunify a fragmented China, Kuomintang policy was one of \\"allying with Russia and tolerating the communists\\" () under the First United Front between the KMT and Communist Party of China. However, after the anti-communist faction of the KMT led by Chiang Kai-shek organized a massacre of communists and leftists in April 1927, the nationalist government in Wuhan, led by Wang Jingwei, denounced Chiang, who established his own government in Nanjing, marking the start of the Nanjing–Wuhan split. The Wuhan government initially maintained the alliance with the CPC but later, tension escalated between them. Warlords such as Feng Yuxiang, who commanded large military forces, also called for severing of ties with the Communist Party. Xia Douyin KMT leftist–CPC relations remained close after the \\"Shanghai massacre\\" purge of communists by Chiang Kai-shek on 12 April, and joint KMT–CPC conferences continued to be held frequently.《李宗仁回忆录》，333页 Workers and farmers' movements continued to grow, but some KMT generals and soldiers, especially those from landowning or merchant families, were disturbed by an increase in class warfare killings. Xu Kexiang, the KMT regimental commander of the 33rd regiment, 35th army launched an operation to disarm the communists on 21 May (), and before long, Xia Douyin, the commander of the 14th Independent Division, also led an anti-communist mutiny. Although the Wuhan government had ordered their suppression, under the protection of warlord He Jian and other officials, they succeeded in defecting to the Nanjing government, which led to Wuhan losing control of parts of Hubei and most of Hunan.《中苏关系史纲》 第二章 苏联援助下的国民革命 “五月指示”与国共分家 On 29 June, Wuhan garrison commander Li Pinxian and He Jian openly declared their support for the anti-communist cause, and dispersed the Hankou strikers and their militant forces. As disruption and discord continued at Wuhan, the Communist International (Comintern) issued a series of orders known as the \\"May Instructions\\" on 1 June, which Wang thought would destroy the KMT. Under increasing pressure, Wang decided to break with the communists and the Soviet Union.  Events of 15 July On 15 July, Wang Jingwei held a meeting within KMT, during which he formally publicised the content of the \\"May Instructions\\" and condemned CPC's decisions, though he maintained the position that non-violent methods should be used to remove the communists from Wuhan. This proposal met with approval from most members; the only one who protested and walked out was Soong Ching- ling's representative Eugene Chen. In the end, the meeting passed the \\"Policy of Uniting the Party\\", a statement that was directed against CPC's declaration, requesting that all the communists within the KMT and the army immediately declare their withdrawal from the CPC or face immediate suspension. Additionally, the Wuhan government sent envoys to Moscow to discuss how to bilaterally guarantee the freedom and safety of the communists who were about to withdraw. After Wang was made aware of the CPC declaration of 13 July, on the following day, in the name of the political committee presidium, he accused the communist party of having \\"ruined the revolution\\", and suspended all the communists from the Wuhan government.郭廷以《近代中國史綱》（下冊）第十五章第三節，香港中文大學出版社1996年版， , 562頁。 Chief Soviet advisor to the Wuhan government Mikhail Borodin left Wuhan secretly sometime between 13–16 July. Upon hearing of his having left, General He Jian opened fire on Borodin's former headquarters, and martial law was declared.

Course Laurel Run begins in the Muncy Hills in Madison Township, Columbia County. It flows east-northeast for several tenths of a mile, heading through a small valley as it enters Pine Township, where it receives two unnamed tributaries from the right. The stream then gradually turns north-northwest for several tenths of a mile before entering Franklin Township, Lycoming County, where it receives one unnamed tributary from the left and one from the right. It then turns north for several tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from the right. The stream then heads west through a larger valley alongside Pennsylvania Route 442, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left and two from the right before entering Moreland Township. In Moreland Township, Laurel Run receives two more unnamed tributaries from the right before turning south for a few tenths of a mile as Pennsylvania Route 442 turns away. It then turns northwest for several tenths of a mile, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left and two from the right before continuing to flow alongside Route 442.

The village is included in the eight hamlets and villages called The Rodings. High Roding is northwest from the county town of Chelmsford. History According to A Dictionary of British Place Names, Roding derives from \\"Rodinges\\" as is listed in the Domesday Book, with the later variation 'High Roinges' recorded in 1224. The 'High' refers to the family or followers of a man called 'Hroth', an Old English person name plus '-ingas'.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.392. High Roding itself is not listed in the Domesday survey.

In the 19th-century the parish was in the Dunmow Hundred, and in the Dunmow Union--poor relief provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834--and part of the Rural Deanery of Roding. The parish Church of All Saints was restored in 1855 at a cost of nearly £1,000. It is a Grade II* listed building. The church register dates to 1538. The 1882 parish living of a rectory, residence and of glebe, land used to support a parish priest, was in the gift of John Strange Jocelyn, 5th Earl of Roden who was also the Lord of the Manor and the principal landowner until 1897. By 1902 the living was in the gift of the 6th Earl of Roden, with the Countess of Roden as Lady of the Manor and principal landowner. In 1914 the living was in the gift of the Countess of Roden, who was still the Lady of the Manor but not a principal landowner. There was a Parochial school for boys and girls, built for 86 children in 1861, with an average attendance of 64. By 1914 the school was under the control of the Essex Education (Dunmow District) Sub- Committees.Kelly's Directory of Essex 1882 pp.245-247 / 1894 pp.285-288 / 1902 pp.339-341 / 1914 pp.477-480 Parish land in 1882 was of . Between 1892 and 1914 parish area remained static. Population in 1881 was 447; in 1891 was 446; in 1901 was 399; and in 1911 was 414. Crops grown at the time were chiefly wheat, barley and beans, on a heavy soil with a clay subsoil. Parish occupations in 1882 included six farmers, one of whom was a landowner, four farm bailiffs, three beer retailers, the licensee of The Black Lion public house, a miller, a carpenter, a plumber, a baker, a machinist, a blacksmith, three shopkeepers, one of whom was also a tailor and another a hawker, two shoemakers, a grocer & provision dealer, and a bricklayer. By 1894, the number of farm bailiffs had reduced by two, shopkeepers, shoemakers, beer retailers, and farmers reduced by one, although the miller (using wind and steam) was at the time retailing beer. The grocer & provision dealer was then running the Post Office. A carpenter, a bricklayer and the public house licensee still existed, although a plumber was not listed. There were now two blacksmiths, a hawker & carrier--a person who transported trading goods and produce for others, and occasionally people, from place to place, usually by horse and cart--a confectioner, and the proprietress of a ladies' school. In 1902 and 1914 there were no farm bailiffs, hawkers or carriers listed, although a fishmonger was listed in 1902. In 1914 the ladies' school remained. The post office, previously run by the grocer & provision dealer, was in 1902 under the control of the confectioner (who also offered accommodation for cyclists and traps for hire), and in 1914, a baker. Added in 1914 to the earlier lists of occupations were a general dealer, a thatcher, an insurance agent, a cattle dealer, and a police constable who ran the High Roding police station.

Carr fed her relentlessly for five years until she weighed 312 stone, and measured 11ft 4ins in length and over 7ft in height. She was so large that a special door twice as wide as the norm had to be built to get her in and out of the cowshed. This doorway can be seen on the estate to this day. She was purchased by John Watkinson of Halton East for £200 (£10,000 in 2013 prices). Being such a notable creature, she was taken on tour, and attracted much attention wherever she went. She was taken to Smithfield in London; the journey from Wakefield to the capital took 73 days from 19 November to 30 January 1812, during which time she was shown at numerous towns and cities en route.

Vetus Testamentum, vol. 43, no. 2, 1993, pp. 162–170. In Ezekiel 23 their disapproved sexual relations in Egypt occur when they are young, before they are married to God. In Ezekiel 16, a text with some similarities but important differences as well, the metaphorical woman belongs to God from puberty, with her sexual offenses occurring only later. The reference to promiscuity in Egypt could refer to earlier political alliances. Ohalah is accused of adultery with Assyrian soldiers, and of worshipping their gods (verses 5-7). This metaphorically refers to an earlier alliance between the Northern Kingdom of Samaria and Assyria. God punishes her relations with Assyria by giving her over to Assyrian control: they strip her naked, take her children, and kill her (9-10). This is a reference to the conquest of Israel by Assyria and the deportations of inhabitants which occurred in 722. Knowing about her sister's punishment but disregarding it, Oholibah (Jerusalem, the capital city of the Southern Kingdom) continues her \\"whoring\\" Ezekiel 23:11, New Revised Standard Version with the Assyrians, and then with Babylonians as well (11-17). God abandons her in disgust, but she continues her \\"whorings\\" with her lovers (18-21). As a result, God proclaims that he will send Babylonian soldiers to conquer Oholibah, to disfigure her, take her children, and burn her people (22-35). God then orders Ezekiel to announce this judgment to Oholibah (36), and accuses the Judahites of committing \\"adultery\\" by worshipping idols and practicing child sacrifice (37), polluting the temple and desecrating the Sabbath by simultaneously worshipping the god of Israel and idols (39). God compares this to prostitution (40-45) and calls for their punishment (46-49). =Verse 2= : \\"Son of man, there were two women, :: The daughters of one mother.\\" (NKJV) * \\"Son of man\\" (Hebrew: בן־אדם ben adam): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. =Verse 4= : Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister; :: They were Mine, ::: And they bore sons and daughters. : As for their names, :: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.

While the physical conditions of objects will change over time, imaging serves as a way to document and represent heritage in a moment in time of the life of the item. Different methods of imaging produce results that are applicable in various circumstances. Not every method is appropriate for every object, and not every object needs to be imaged by multiple methods. In addition to preservation and conservation related concerns, imaging can also serve to enhance research and study of cultural heritage.  Purpose  One reason for imaging objects is to make the items available for study and scholarship without incurring unnecessary harm to the object. In addition to providing images to scholars, images can also be added to online catalogs and databases to increase the size of the audience interacting with the objects and allow them to view the item with no added risk. Another reason is for documentary purposes, especially as it relates to conservation. According to the American Institute for Conservation, “Documentation is basic to the ethical practice of conservation.” Imaging prior to conservation allows conservators to record the current state of the object, which can then be compared to later images following conservation. This allows someone in the future to look back and see the ways in which an item was impacted by conservation. Images taken over different periods of time can also reveal changes in condition and can be used to minimize damage going forward. The American Institute for Conservation's Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation is a useful reference guide for the application of digital imaging to the field of conservation. It details guidelines for equipment, techniques, and practices that are in line with best practices for conservation. This covers everything from suggestions for types of cameras and memory cards to discussing processing details and how to apply metadata. An additional purpose is found in the way imaging enhances scholarship. Different types of imaging can reveal materials and techniques used in creating an object that are not immediately evident with the naked eye.  Methods  There are many methods that are employed in imaging. These may include different types of lighting as well as the use of radiography. Multiple energy levels and technologies have been used for cultural heritage imaging, including imaging mummy masks with multiple spectral bands of light, different x-ray technologies, optical coherence tomography, and terahertz imaging. Photographing objects under standard conditions is a typical practice to preserve the item in perpetuity, but not every object will need more specialized imaging. Those doing the imaging or requesting the imaging be done will look at each object on a case by case basis to determine the usefulness of specialized imaging. In some cases combinations of different types of imaging will be more effective than one type on its own. This can be seen in projects like the Getty's conservation of Guercino’s Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph and the Getty's APPEAR project, details of which can be found on a blog by the Penn Museum's Artifact Lab. = Photography = Photography under normal illumination will produce a record of the appearance of an object in standard conditions. Standard conditions typically mean uniform illumination with minimal glare. In conservation, these images will serve as a \\"before treatment\\" record. They can also serve as a catalog image for in-house use or an online collection. Following a standard image capture, subsequent images can be taken under various conditions to highlight areas that need treatment or closer monitoring.  Raking illumination  Further information:Raking light Raking light allows the viewer to see hammering scars that are not evident in standard lighting conditions. Raking illumination highlights texture on the surface of an object. This is achieved by using a single light source at a low angle relative to the object. Images taken under these conditions can reveal deviations in the surface of an object – gouges, scratches, paint loss, bulges, and more. With archaeological objects this may reveal how tools were made or how food was processed (e.g. cut marks on bones). In paintings it can show how the artist used the paint.  Specular illumination  Specular illumination documents the surface sheen of an object. With paintings, it is used to highlight areas of abnormality. While raking illumination will produce a record of these abnormalities with greater clarity, specular illumination is less dependent on the orientation of the light. There are two basic set ups for specular illumination – axial and oblique. An axial setup requires the camera and the light source to be on the same axis. The camera is parallel to the surface of the object, and the light source is next to the camera. An oblique setup requires the camera and the light source to be on opposite sides of the subject, but each are at the same angle relative to the object. Specular light can allow conservators to see tool marks on wooden objects, or indentations that seemed invisible.  Transmitted illumination  201x201px Transmitted illumination is used to highlight thickness and losses among other things. Transmitted illumination uses a light source that is behind the object being photographed. (For two dimensional objects this has a very similar function to a light table.) This “back lighting” provides a way to see things like cracks and holes as well as revealing the general structure of an item. With something like papyrus, it can help to reveal the condition of the individual fibers. It can also be useful with textiles or basketry items where a tight weave may make it difficult to see damage or clues about how the item was woven. = Infrared Photography = thumb Infrared photography has been used in conservation since the 1930s. In art the most well-known application is being able to see underdrawings of paintings or changes in composition. Picasso's the Blue Room is a famous example of this. It has also been used to enhance legibility of manuscripts and inscriptions, as seen with the Dead Sea Scrolls and the International Dunhuang Project. Carbon black ink tends to show up very well under infrared. = Ultraviolet Photography = Ultraviolet photography is frequently used for differentiation and characterization of materials. Ultraviolet radiation can cause materials to emit fluorescence that can be seen and photographed. The intensity and color of the fluorescence is influenced by the amount of material, the types of materials, and the amount of deterioration. UV radiation can also reveal things not visible to the naked eye. Codex Sinaiticus contains the oldest, complete copy of the New Testament. On the last page of the Gospel of John UV radiation shows that the final sentence was added later. While the implications for this are rooted in biblical scholarship, this shows that there is more to manuscripts than what is found at the surface level. In conservation this shows that with UV radiation even the “invisible” becomes part of the record for the object and must be documented and monitored. With paintings, UV can reveal where prior restorations have occurred. The varnish on top of a painting is usually more fluorescent than the pigments. If there is paint on top of a varnish, the conservator knows that there has been some restoration in the past. UV can also help to reveal materials used in a painting. = Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) = The original text of the 343x343px A Multispectral image is an image with capture points across the light spectrum. Different wavelengths of light are separated by filters or illuminated with narrow bands of light. These filters can also be combined with different colors of light as well as IR and UV to produce different results and fluorescence. MSI has been used in several major projects regarding ancient manuscripts. Not only is this useful for making these texts legible and available, but these images are useful for conservation. By recording things that are not easily seen, MSI helps conservators to be aware of what they couldn’t see and allows them to monitor these conditions. This can be seen in examples of paintings like the Mummy Portraits. The Penn Museum has shown through MSI that one of their portraits has an outline of the figure etched in the paint. This is something that was not visible under standard conditions, and something they didn't notice on other portraits. MSI also helps scholars to be able to read previously illegible texts. The Archimedes Palimpsest (further discussed below) is a famous example of this, but many other palimpsests have been rendered legible by this process. Multiple groups, institutions and companies work to image manuscripts using MSI and other methods to digitally preserve them, make them accessible to scholars, and improve legibility. = Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) = Optical Coherence Tomography can help reveal layers and 3D visualizations of text in various media, including papyrus and paper. It has been used with multispectral imaging to provide more information about text and ink on different layers of an object. This has been used in research into papyrus mummy mask cartonnage to image small areas of cartonnage in conjunction with narrowband multispectral imaging to reveal ink layers. = Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) = Reflectance Transformation Imaging uses special procedures to create a polynomial texture map of an object. These PTMs are created from a set of images using a stationary camera and a single source of light that can be held in different positions. The following is quoted from Cultural Heritage Imaging's website: \\"RTI images are created from information derived from multiple digital photographs of a subject shot from a stationary camera position. In each photograph, light is projected from a different known, or knowable, direction. This process produces a series of images of the same subject with varying highlights and shadows. Lighting information from the images is mathematically synthesized to generate a mathematical model of the surface, enabling a user to re-light the RTI image interactively and examine its surface on a screen. Each RTI resembles a single, two-dimensional (2D) photographic image. Unlike a typical photograph, reflectance information is derived from the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the image subject and encoded in the image per pixel, so that the synthesized RTI image “knows” how light will reflect off the subject. When the RTI is opened in RTI viewing software, each constituent pixel is able to reflect the software's interactive “virtual” light from any position selected by the user. This changing interplay of light and shadow in the image discloses fine details of the subject's 3D surface form. RTI was invented by Tom Malzbender and Dan Gelb, research scientists at Hewlett-Packard Labs. A landmark paper describing these first tools and methods, named Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM), was published in 2001.\\" RTI has several applications for cultural heritage. In many instances PTMs can improve the legibility of inscriptions, such as metal amulets whose inscriptions have been obscured by corrosion. PTMs have also been found to be useful in analyzing ceramics and paintings. Cracks and pitting that wasn't visible under standard conditions became visible using RTI. The Tate and the National Gallery investigated the use of PTMs and determined that they could be viable alternatives to raking light; especially since PTMs were found to be more easily replicated than raking light photographs. With manuscripts RTI can highlight the shape and structure of pages. While these pages are typically viewed as two dimensional items, RTI makes them three dimensional and shows that there is more than just a flat page. This is helpful for legibility (for scholars) and for condition (for conservators). Scholars can see the text more clearly and may even be able to see text that was erased. This is especially true in conditions where the ink \\"ate\\" letter-shaped holes into the page surface. Conservators can use the PTMs to determine the degree of damage to the surface, as cracks, buckling, and holes become much more pronounced. For examples of the types of results RTI can produce see the videos on Cultural Heritage Imaging's Website http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/ Radiographic image of an African Songye Power Figure that shows some of the internal structure of the item. (Indianapolis Museum of Art) = Radiography = Radiography is a non- destructive analysis of the internal structure of an object, that uses x-rays to create an image. For paintings this means that conservators can potentially see the inner structure of the painting and learn about the materials and techniques used by the original artist. Radiography can also be used on archaeological objects or sculptures to learn more about the internal structure of the items that would otherwise be invisible without destroying the object. This type of imaging produces a two-dimensional image of the inner workings of the item. X-ray technology has been used to read the damaged Herculaneum Papyri as opposed to trying to unroll the scroll to read its contents. As part of a conservation measure on the Ghent Altarpiece x-rays were created to better understand how the piece was painted and put together. Images from that project can be viewed on the Closer to Van Eyck website. On the Penn Museum's Artifact Lab blog, there are multiple entries discussing the applications of radiography on cultural heritage. CT scans create a three- dimensional image from many 2-D radiographic images. This produces cross sections of images and allows for the isolation of layers. Like the 2-D images, this allows for a look at the inner sections of objects without causing damage. CT scans have been used on mummies (more similar to traditional medical uses of CT scans) as well as other objects, like cuneiform tablets. CT scans have also been used on papyrus scrolls to digitally unroll them—allowing for them to be read, but not causing any harm. The Natural History Museum in London has used CT scans to take images of some of their specimens and create 3D models. This is a much less invasive technique than the traditional model of molding and casting. All of these applications have the goal of being as noninvasive as possible while still trying to gather as much information as possible. Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique used in radiology that does not use x-rays. It is mainly used in medical imaging to generate images of the organs of the body. It can also be applied to deceased individuals. For example, a female burial from Novosibirsk, Russia was found to have suffered from breast cancer. This type of imaging allows for a noninvasive analysis of past individuals to help scientists better understand past human ancestors.  Examples  There are hundreds and possibly thousands of examples of projects that use noninvasive imaging techniques. Highlighted here are several that are more commonly known. = Archimedes Palimpsest = Archimedes Palimpsest The Archimedes Palimpsest is a parchment manuscript that contains writings from two different time periods. In the 13th century monks erased and wrote over a 10th century copy of some works originally written by Archimedes. Through a combination of different imaging techniques (MSI, raking illumination and X-ray fluorescence) and various processing procedures the older layer became legible. = Syriac Galen Palimpsest = The Syriac Galen Palimpsest is a parchment manuscript with an early translation of the Greek medical philosopher Galen of Pergamon overwritten with psalms for days of the week. MSI and later x-ray fluorescence were used to reveal the undertext of Galen. = Egyptian mummies = With the use of imaging technologies, research can be conducted on mummies without having to unwrap them. A 2014 exhibition at the British Museum highlighted these imaging techniques in conjunction with the eight mummies that were imaged. The CT scans produced allow for a digital layer by layer look at the burials. Mummy masks have been studied with six different imaging technologies in a global project involving multiple institutions to demonstrate the feasibility of using non-destructive digital imaging technology to make texts visible in images of papyrus. = Cuneiform tablets and envelopes = CT scanners have been used to look at cuneiform tablets layer by layer in order to reproduce them with a 3D printer. This has been done at Cornell University and at TU Delft (“Scanning for Syria”) where scans were done of silicon molds rather than original tablets. In a presentation titled, “Using CT to Image and 3D print Cuneiform Tablets without Removing Them from Their Envelopes,” at the ASOR annual meeting in 2016 Dr. Andrew Shortland discussed how his team had figured out a way to isolate the inner tablet from the envelope and read what was on it without breaking the outer, envelope layer. = En-Gedi Scroll = Rendered unreadable after a fire in 600 CE, the En-Gedi Scroll is the earliest copy of a Pentateuchal book ever found in a Holy Ark. This scroll cannot be touched without inflicting further damage, making noninvasive imaging an ideal technique for revealing the text inside. Using micro-CT scanning, which creates a 3D rendering of the scroll where brightness corresponds to density, conservators were able to distinguish the dense metallic ink from the carbon-based scroll. Using virtual unwrapping techniques, computer scientists were able to convert the 3D position-density information provided by the scan into a 2D visualization of the ‘unwrapped’ scroll.

He played for Universidad de Chile, Unión Española, Coquimbo Unido and Deportes Aviación, winning titles with the first two, and also played for Mexican club Tecos. Internationally, he represented Chile at the 1975 Copa América. Life and career Las Heras, the son of Francisco Las Heras Marrodán who played football for Chile in the 1940s, attended the Instituto Alonso de Ercilla in Santiago and studied at the University of Chile. He began his football career in the youth system of the Primera División club associated with that university, Universidad de Chile, and made his first-team debut at the age of 17, contributing to their 1967 title. He appeared infrequently for the next couple of seasons as the team won another Primera title, in 1969, as well as two Torneo Metropolitanos, but became a regular from 1970 onwards. In 1973, Las Heras signed for Unión Española, with whom he won two Primera titles in three seasons as well as reaching the final of the 1975 Copa Libertadores. Facing the Argentine superstars of Independiente, Unión Española won the first leg 1–0 with a late goal, but lost the second leg 3–1the goal scored by Las Heras with a penaltyin a controversial match in which the Chilean players blamed weak refereeing for the defeat. In the days before the away goals rule, a play-off in a neutral country decided the result: Independiente beat Unión Española 2–0 to win their fourth consecutive Copa Libertadores. Las Heras was included in Chile's squad for the 1975 Copa América. He made his debut on 17 July, in the starting eleven for Chile's first group match, a 1–1 draw with Peru in Santiago, and started all three remaining group matches. Chile finished second in their group, but only the group winners progressed to the next stage of the competition. Those were his only appearances at senior international level. After his international commitments ended, Las Heras joined Tecos, newly promoted to the Mexican Primera División. He played in 26 matches, half in the starting eleven, half as substitute, as they qualified for the playoffs. He made the last of his 30 league appearances on matchday 10 of the following season, before returning to Union Española. He won his third Primera División title with the club in 1977. After two more years, he moved on to another Primera club, Coquimbo Unido, and then spent the 1981 season with Deportes Aviación of the Segunda División. After retiring from football, Las Heras worked in the pharmaceutical industry.

Origin Ebelle was founded in the middle of the 14th century AD when Prince Agbabhoko of Uta-gbunuo clan of Kwale migrated from his community to the area now known as Ebelle because of a political crisis in his place of origin. This happened during the reign of Oba Ogbeka of Benin Kingdom (during his reign, there was wide spread migration from Benin to escape wars, search for an adventure or a convenient place of abode). When Prince Agbabhoko came to Ebelle, he told the people of his royal pedigree. As a result, he was made king. When news of the prince reached the Oba of Benin, he was summoned. The Oba was impressed with the prince and placed him under royal protection. He was also given a royal sword of rulership over Ebelle thereby solidifying his reign as king.

It was taken by the Uí Briain (O'Briens), and during the Desmond Rebellions (1569) it fell to the Geraldines, until the Crown confiscated their lands in 1571. The castle was partly demolished by Walter Raleigh. By 1587 it was in the hands of the Hungerford; in 1591 it went to Sir William Courtenay, and in 1595 to a Captain Collum. It was restored by William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon in 1840. At the 1916 Easter Rising, 300 Irish Volunteers assembled at Glenquin Castle, but they did not take any military action. It was restored again in the 1980s and is under the care of the Office of Public Works. Castle The castle is a square, crenellated, six storey limestone tower house.

History  Bussiere Garden Jean-Augustin Bussière (1872-1958), the owner of Bussiere Garden, came to Beijing in 1913 and practiced medicine there for 41 years. His aim was to purchase medical equipment from France and introduce advanced medical experience to China. He built a watchtower in his own villa Bussiere Garden as a place for local people to rest. His patients were of varied professions and social classes. Bussière was a central figure in the French community in China and Bussiere Garden served as a social place for the French elite. The French poet Saint- John Perse, who later received the Nobel Prize in Literature, visited China accompanied by Bussiere. His long expressionist poem Anabase was written on the background of the desert and Mount Miaofeng. André d'Hormon, who had been proofreading the Chinese novel Dream of Red Mansions for more than ten years, was also a visitor of the mansion. Bussiere Garden was once one of the Communist Party of China (CCP)'s underground intelligence interface locations of Pingxi. Before the Japanese invasion, Bussière's British friends delivered two high-power telegraph transmitters to Yan'an through Bussiere Garden. The CCP's headquarter of guerrilla forces in Mount Miaofeng was located than 100 meters from Bussiere Garden.  Architecture  Northern wing, where Dr. Bussière resided Buildings at Bussiere Garden Bussiere Garden is a private garden with a combination of Chinese and Western elements. It comprises three parts: the barbican, the northern wing and the southern wing. Shade is provided by horse chestnut trees, Sophora japonica, ginkgo, elm, and other trees. * The barbican: located outside the garden, it is a western style castle made of stones with three floors and sits toward the east. The walls of the castle were built with granite. By the main entrance there is a stone plaque that was made in 1936, which is inscribed with the message \\"To Practice Medicine to Save People\\". On the back of plaque is the year made and the statement, \\"Mr. Bussiere, outstanding in medical science, is famous across the world and is ready to help others. He was devoted to social affairs, which was known in the Wenquan Town if not everywhere. The words in Ode to Wenquan: to practice medicine to save people’s lives. Though taken out of the context, it fits Mr. Bussiere very well.\\" This plaque was presented by Yao Tongyi and Li Shizeng (a couple)”. The barbican is used as a place for the treatment of local people. * The northern wing: located on the mountainside and surrounded by hills, it is a Chinese style two-floor building with five rooms and East Asian hip-and-gable roof. On the front, there are a pond, wisteria, a fountain, and a stone bridge that is used as a resting and meeting place. * The southern wing s the residence for Bussière’s daughter. Located on the hillside of south mountain and built with black brick, it faces east and has five rooms, three of which are exposed to the sun. There are also some outbuildings. The Doctor Bussiere Bridge is located east of Nan'anhe Village In addition, on the way from Wenquan to Bei’anhe, was a stone arch bridge that built in the spring of 1931 in the memory of Bussière. The words “Doctor Bussiere Bridge” were inscribed on the stone henge. During the highway expansion at the end of the 20th century, the stone henge was abandoned and lost. At the end of 2013, the local government reconstructed the stone henge on its original site. But the original small river was filled up as roadbed in the reconstruction. In 2001, Bussiere Garden was announced as a key cultural relics protection unit by the Haidian District Government. In 2011, it was also published as the Beijing municipal historical and cultural sites under government protection. In 2014, on the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France, the renovation of Bussiere Garden complex was completed.  Jean-Augustin Bussière  Bussière (1872-1958) was a doctor of the French legation in Beijing, which also serving as the trustee and president of the branch college of Aurora University. Bussiere married a Chinese woman named Wu Sidan and embraced the Chinese culture. He often wore robes and spent time learning Chinese, eating Chinese food and studying painting and calligraphy. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Bussière, was the president of a hospital in China and made his way to the battle front as a volunteer to treat the wounded Eighth Route Army soldiers and the local rural people. He also delivered medical supplies to the front. Once, starting from Peking city, he rode a bicycle loaded with medicinal materials for more than 30 kilometers to the area near Western Hills. Later, he also purchased cars for the transportation of medicinal materials and equipment from Japanese- occupied areas to the Shanxi-Chahar-Hopei border area occupied by the Eighth Route Army. Su Yi said: \\"Mr. Bussière is a true hero of the international anti-fascist movement and is a true friend of the Chinese people. His story shall be remembered by us and the generations to come.\\" In April, 2014, the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping gave a speech during his visit to France: \\"We will never forget that countless French friends have made an important contribution to our cause. Some of them, with the risk of their lives, opened up a 'The Hump', though which precious medicine was transported to the anti-Japanese base areas in China by people like Mr. Bussière……\\" In 1954, Bussière, who was 82 years old, returned to France. The following year, his wife gave birth to a son named Jean Louis Bussière. Just like his father, he is also a doctor and later become a Cardiologist and was called “Bussiere Junior” by the Chinese people. At the end of April 2014, Bussiere Junior had visited Beijing and attended the opening ceremony of the documentary series The history of Bussiere Garden, which was held in Bussiere Garden. On November 8, 2014, Bussiere Garden—A French doctor in Beijing exhibition and Bright Light—The Old Summer Palace cultural exhibition were held in Paris simultaneously, which were presented as a gift to the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France.Bussiere Garden—A French doctor in Beijing exhibition was launched by Beijing Media and Communications Department and the International Communication Office on the background of Bussiere Garden. It consists of three parts：Doctor, Neighbor and Friend and displays the 41 years’ life experience of Dr. Bussière in China. The exhibition lasted to November 16.

The discovery of this brown dwarf allowed the backyard worlds collaboration to estimate the amount of new brown dwarfs the project could discover. This was allowed due to the fact that the brown dwarf is one magnitude fainter than any brown dwarf previously discovered with proper motion surveys. The team estimated that the project would discover new L-dwarfs, T-dwarfs and Y-dwarfs. As of July 2019 the project did meet this estimate with spectroscopically confirmed T- and L-dwarfs (70 T-dwarfs and 61 L-dwarfs), but exceeded this estimate by brown dwarf candidates (1305).

The murder led to criticism of Sussex Police for its failure to take Shana Grice's complaints of stalking seriously. Relationship Shana had met Michael Lane in 2015 when they both worked at Brighton Fire Alarms. Lane was from Thornhill Rise, Portslade, near Brighton. They formed a relationship and Lane had become obsessed with her. He refused to accept the breakup and said to a friend \\"She’ll pay for what she’s done.\\" Stalking Michael Lane stalked her after she broke up with him and returned to her previous boyfriend, Ashley Cooke. Lane put a tracker device on her car which notified via his mobile phone every time the car moved. On 8 February 2016, Grice complained to police about being stalked by Lane after receiving unwanted flowers and damage to her car. On 24 March, Lane snatched her phone and grabbed her hair. He was arrested on suspicion of assault but later released and Grice was issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police for wasting their time by not disclosing she had been in a relationship with him. On 9 July, Lane used a stolen key to let himself into her home and watch her while she was apparently sleeping. She was actually awake, had heard his footsteps and hid under the duvet. She heard a man breathing in her room. Shortly afterwards, the man left, and when Grice looked out her window she saw Lane walking away. He was arrested for theft, given a police caution and told to stay away from Grice. The following day, she received around seven phone calls from a blocked number, including one with heavy breathing. She was told there were no further lines of inquiry and the case would be left on file. On 12 July, she reported to police that she was being followed by Lane. Police treated the case as \\"low risk\\", but that the investigating officer would be made aware. On 4 August, she saw Lane loitering outside her home. She confided in her friend Joann Pumphrey that she was afraid that police wouldn't believe her because of her previous fine for wasting police time. Although Joann was a witness to this, Shana didn't report the incident to the police. Murder On 25 August, Lane waited until Grice was alone at home, then let himself in, slit her throat and set fire to her bedroom. She was 19 years old at the time of her murder and her killer was 27 years old. Her body was found by Ian Cooke, her boyfriend's father, in her home at Chrisdory Road, Portslade, East Sussex. Michael Lane was arrested the same day at his then workplace in Burgess Hill. He initially lied to police about his movements that day, before admitting that he had gone to Shana Grice’s home. He claimed that he had found the front door open, then found Shana’s body in her bedroom. He claimed that he panicked, then left the scene without dialing 999, checking Shana’s vital signs or telling his family what he had found. He claimed that he only kept quiet about what he had seen because he was afraid of being accused of her murder. Trial The trial lasted two weeks in Lewes Crown Court. After being found guilty Lane was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 25 years. Aftermath Shana Grice's parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green, said their daughter would still be alive if Sussex Police had acted on her complaints. The judge, Justice Green, also criticised police. During sentencing he said \\"There was seemingly no appreciation on the part of those investigating that a young woman in a sexual relationship with a man could at one and the same time be vulnerable and at risk of serious harm. The police jumped to conclusions and Shana was stereotyped.\\" =Previous complaints= Sussex police also revealed that Michael Lane had been the subject of complaints from 13 other women. Most of the complaints related to the three years before Shana Grice's murder, except for one which allegedly occurred within the preceding 10 years. =Domestic homicide review= A domestic homicide review report concluded that Michael Lane had harassed 12 girls and young women between 2006 and 2016 and he had been arrested over claims he groomed a 14-year-old girl. He was not charged over the 2010 grooming allegation, which was marked on his arrest record, but it was not noted when Shana Grice reported him for harassment. The allegation dates to when he was a volunteer scout leader. After his arrest he resigned from the Scouts. He was told the allegation would be considered if he tried to rejoin the organisation, but when he did so in 2015 he was not recognised as a past member and he volunteered for several months. The failure to recognise him was put down to a \\"temporary glitch in the IT system\\". The report said that Lane had \\"used youth movements, which appealed to young women and girls, to allow him access to victims.\\" The report also mentioned an account of Lane being \\"very controlling\\" in another relationship, of him bombarding women with explicit messages, loitering outside their homes, pestering women to sleep with him for money, harassing two women he met in a pub and sexually assaulting another woman. In August 2019 it was announced that Sussex Police would no longer fine people reporting domestic abuse for wasting police time. =Consequences for Sussex Police= Sussex Police apologised to Shana's parents and referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which launched an inquiry. IPCC recommendations In late April 2017, Sussex Police accepted six recommendations from the IPCC to improve the way the force dealt with stalking. The recommendations concerned training, data systems and making use of relevant information. IPCC associate commissioner Tom Milsom said that Sussex Police had taken a positive response to the recommendations and he said that \\"Stalking and harassment are serious offences and in certain situations, such as those involving Shana, can have tragic consequences.\\" Detective Superintendent Jason Tingley of Sussex Police said that additional training was already being provided and \\"We have improved our understanding of what stalking and harassment is and what our response should be.\\" Report into stalking and harassment In April 2019 a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services concluded that stalking and harassment offences were not being properly investigated by Sussex Police. The report said that a training programme introduced after Shana Grice's murder to help staff understand and identify stalking \\"was never fully completed\\". Most investigating officers had received no training. Not enough victims were being referred to support services and there was concern over online stalking. Police forces nationally were not using powers under stalking laws to search suspects' homes, which made investigations less thorough. Injunctions were not being used, so victims were not being properly protected. The National Police Chiefs' Council was called on to make sure police forces around the UK make improvements and that a single definition of stalking be adopted by police forces and government departments. Disciplinary action In April 2019 it was announced that three police officers would face disciplinary action the following May. Two officers, one retired, faced gross misconduct proceedings, whilst another officer was accused of misconduct. PC Jon Barry Mills resigned from the police before a disciplinary hearing on 10 May 2019. One allegation against Mills is that he failed to \\"adequately investigate allegations of harassment and stalking\\" - this relates to 9 July 2016, when Shana Grice complained Lane had stolen her back door key, crept into her bedroom and watched her sleeping. Shana Grice made a further complaint on 12 July of Lane following her in his car, but PC Mills \\"failed to contact Ms Grice or update her regarding the reported incident\\". She was not called back and a few days later received a letter stating that the \\"case was closed\\". Friends said she was angry and could not believe the police had dropped the case and had not reported further instances of stalking as a result. It was the last time she contacted police before Lane murdered her in August. When questioned, PC Mills said he was alarmed by some of Lane's behaviour and admitted that his failure to properly question him was an oversight. PC Mills's first name was initially not released in an attempt by lawyers to conceal his identity. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which was formed in 2018 and took over some of the IPCC's functions, stated: \\"Resigning from the force does not preclude officers from facing misconduct hearings.\\" A force disciplinary panel ruled that PC Mills's failings amounted to gross misconduct and that had he not resigned he would have been dismissed from the police force. Former PC Trevor Godfrey was found by a disciplinary panel in July 2019 to have committed misconduct by not investigating Shana Grice's complaints of harassment, but that he had not committed gross misconduct. He had issued Grice with a warning for wasting police time and decided to take no further action against Michael Lane. Godfrey had since retired, but would not have been sacked if he had still been working. Shana Grice's parents said the misconduct charge was \\"a joke, and the hearing a sham\\".

History  The station was opened in August 1841 by the Durham Junction Railway. It was situated near the north of the level crossing on Station Avenue. Goods sidings were behind the down platform, while more sidings were behind the up platform, branching off to a mineral depot. Adjacent to the station was also a goods shed with a track running through as well as cattle pens and a loading dock to the south. The goods handled at the station were tar and livestock. The station was initially a stop on the passenger service between and Oakwellgate in Gateshead but on 19 June 1844, southbound services to were diverted to and along the newly constructed Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway. Further extensions to this route ultimately led to creation of the Leamside line. By 1951, passenger bookings had fallen sharply from 141,237 to 21,340. The Beeching Report dealt severely with the County Durham area of railways, leaving only one passenger service running at 5:01am. Passenger services were withdrawn on 4 May 1964 and goods traffic followed a month later on 1 June 1964.

It has a single, long, erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured to greenish-yellow flowers recognised by their long, drooping lateral sepals and petals with their ends having dark glandular tips and by the red-tipped labellum.  Description  Caladenia woolcockiorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy, dull green leaf, 60–150 mm long, 10–13 mm wide which has irregular reddish blotches. One or two cream-coloured to greenish-yellow flowers about 35 mm wide are borne on a stalk 200–350 mm tall. The sepals and petals have blackish, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, 30–40 mm long and 3–5 mm wide. The lateral sepals have similar dimensions to the dorsal sepal and turn downwards, nearly parallel to each other and have drooping tips. The petals are 25–30 mm long, about 2 mm wide and turn downwards with drooping tips. The labellum is 16–18 mm long, about 9 mm wide, cream-coloured with a prominent, rosy-red tip which projects forward before turning downwards. The sides of the labellum have dark red teeth up to about 2 mm long and there are four rows of dark red calli up to about 1 mm long along its mid- line. Flowering occurs from August to September.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia woolcockiorum was first described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Flinders Ranges and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (woolcockiorum) honours Collin and Dorothy Woolcock for their assistance to Jones.  Distribution and habitat  Woolcock's spider orchid only occurs in the Mount Remarkable National Park where it mostly grows under shrubs on rocky slopes and on ledges in forest.  Conservation  Caladenia woolcockiorum is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"endangered\\" under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act. There has been an estimated decline of more than 80% in the distribution of this orchid in the last 50 to 100 years and the population size in 2006 was estimated to be about 5,400 mature individuals. The most serious threat is weed invasion but grazing by rabbits and sheep, track maintenance and altered fire regimes also threaten the species.

Playing career Malloch left Dundee for Sheffield Wednesday in 1900 for a fee of £50. In April 1900 Malloch and fellow Dundee player, Low, had been playing together in England and joined Sheffield Wednesday on trial, with their prospective club, Brighton United in financial difficulties. Malloch officially joined Sheffield Wednesday in May. In September 1907 Sheffield Wednesday were given permission to give Malloch a benefit match. Whilst at Sheffield Wednesday he won the Football League in the 1902/03 and 1903/04 seasons and played for the club in the Football League in the 1906/07 season when the club won the FA Cup, though he did not play in the FA Cup for them at all that season. Following the benefit match at the end of the 1907/08 season Malloch found his time at Wednesday confined to the reserves and on New Year's Eve 1908 he transferred to local rivals Barnsley. His time at Barnsley began with a series of poor performances and by September he had moved on to South Kirkby. At South Kirkby Malloch once again found form and was instrumental in helping the club to the semi-final of the Sheffield Challenge Cup and the final of the Wharncliffe Charity Cup in the 1911/12 season. The final of the Wharncliffe Cup saw Malloch return to familiar territory at Owlerton Stadium, where South Kirkby met his old rivals Sheffield United.

It absorbs the traditions of several cuisines from other regions of China and of Western cooking, adapting them to suit the local taste according to the features of local ingredients. It is divided into several major types: French, Italian, Russian, British, and German, among which the Russian-type dishes, such as the Shanghai-style borscht (Chinese: 罗宋汤, Pinyin: luó sòng tāng), receive a great welcome as they are more affordable.上海饮食服务业志-饮食业的形成和发展 上海市地方志办公室. Today, the most famous dishes of Haipai cuisine are luó sòng tāng, fried pork chops (breaded cutlet), and Shanghai salad (a variety of Olivier salad). Apart from the above-mentioned common dishes, baked clams, baked crabs, and jin bi duo soup (\\"million dollar soup\\") are also popular among the Haipai dishes. For a hundred years since it opened to foreign traders, Shanghai has witnessed the increasing popularity of Haipai cuisine. However, since China began to implement its economic reforms in 1978, an increasing number of authentic Western restaurants set up in Shanghai. As a result, the number of Haipai restaurants gradually declined, and only a few are left by now. But luó sòng tāng and fried pork chops with Worcestershire sauce are still enjoyed and considered to be the flavor of \\"old Shanghai\\".  History  After Shanghai opened to outside, Western culture was gradually brought into Shanghai, and West restaurants began to set up in the city. According to documentary records, the first Western restaurant, Xiang Fan, was founded in Fuzhou Road. At that time, Western dishes were also known as \\"Fan dishes\\". Although Western food became fashionable, it was still hard for the Chinese people to adapt to some types of Western cooking, such as medium rare beefsteak. As a result, Shanghai Western cuisine absorbed the essence of different Western cooking traditions and gradually formed different styles of food: French, Italian, Russian, British, German style, etc. French-style cuisine focused on fresh materials and exquisite food; British-style cuisine focused on seasoning, and Italian-style cuisine focused on the original flavor, so each has its own characteristics. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union in 1917, a large wave of Russian white émigrés poured into China, and in particular in Shanghai. They were named luó sòng. The Shanghai Russians opened more than 40 Russian restaurants in the Xiafei Road (Avenue Joffre, now Middle Huaihai Road), in an area which at that time became known as \\"Little Russia\\". Their two dishes: borscht and buttered bread (butterbrot) gained a great popularity in Shanghai due to their low price. By the end of 1937, Shanghai had more than 200 Haipai restaurants, most of them were located in Xiafei Road and Fuzhou Road. The establishment of the rule of the Communist Party of China was a turning point in the development of Shanghai Western cuisine. A large number of Western-style restaurants closed down during this period, and only 18 restaurants remained in the Huangpu District after adopting the pattern of public-private Joint Management.黄浦区志-西菜、西咖业 上海市地方志办公室. Besides, due to a shortage of supplies at the time, \\"going to Western restaurants\\" was not a common thing for ordinary people. However, the Shanghai people, whether because of love for Western food or memories of the ancient time, still tried by every means to enjoy western food in this difficult era. One way was to use a variety of local ingredients instead of importing Western ingredients, such as using Chinese mitten crabs instead of sea crabs, self- roll soda crackers instead of bread powder, and so on. Western food was completely removed from China after the Cultural Revolution.卢湾区志-饮食业 上海市地方志办公室. Back then, the famous Western restaurant known as the Red House was renamed to the Red Flag Restaurant, and offered Chinese traditional dishes. Since the reform and opening up in China, the number of authentic Chinese restaurants in Shanghai has increased dramatically. On the contrary, the numbers of Western-style restaurants that offer Haipai dishes have been declined gradually, and a lot of Western restaurants shut off in the 1990s.  Traditional dishes  = Shanghai-style borscht = Shanghai-style borscht Being quite different from its Russian origin, the Chinese-style borscht (), originated in Harbin, close to the Russian border in northeast China, and has spread as far as Shanghai and Hong Kong. A Shanghai variety appeared when the Russian emigres settled down in the former French Concession in the early 20th century. The recipe was changed by removing beetroot and using tomato paste to color the soup as well as to add to its sweetness, because Shanghai's climate was bad for planting beets and the soup's original sour taste was alien for the local people. Later, cooks usually fried the tomato paste in oil to reduce its sour taste, then put white sugar in the soup to make it both sour and sweet. Alternatively, pre-sweetened ketchup can be used instead. Likewise, cream is replaced by flour to generate thickness without inducing sourness. Most recipes contain beef and its broth, potatoes, and leaf vegetables; Hongchang sausage and worcestershire sauce is sometimes added as well. As more and more people made borscht at home, its recipes changed to please the different tastes of its makers, occasionally taking on the influence of mirepoix or minestrone with the inclusion of carrots, celery, onions, and bay leaves. The soup is often accompanied by rice. = Shanghai-style fried pork chops = Fried pork chop The Shanghai-style fried pork chop is a local variety of breaded cutlet. It is particularly popular as street food. Like in tonkatsu, the meat is tenderized and flatten by beating with the back of a knife. The pork chop is coated with bread flour before being fried to avoid too much greasiness and to be crispy outside but tender inside. Back to the old days when supplies were badly needed in Shanghai, soda crackers were crushed to replace bread flour, which produced a different unique flavor. In Shanghai, the pork chop is served with the local là jiàngyóu sauce, a localized version of the British Worcestershire sauce. = Potato salad = Potato salad Usually known as Shanghai-style salad, the potato salad is a local variety of the Russian Olivier salad. It is made by mixing salad dressing and shredded boiled potatoes and diced sausages. It also goes with minced turnips and diced peas. Nowadays, most people make Shanghai-style salad using the ready-made salad dressing bought from the supermarkets, while originally the dressing was prepared by patiently mixing salad oil, egg yolks and mayonnaise for a long time. = Baked clams = The baked clams are famous among Shanghai-style western dishes. The dish was invented by the Maison Pourcel chef Yu Yongli from the French specialty escargots (snails au gratin). The invention was caused by the supply shortage of French snails since 1946. After times of trials, clams were chosen by Maison Pourcel to replace snails. To make baked clams, the clam is removed from its shell and washed clean, then it is placed back into the shell with salad oil, red wine, mashed garlic, minced celeries etc., and baked in the oven. The new dish was so loved by the customers that it was called a Chinese-born French cuisine by the French president Georges Pompidou when he tasted it during his visit in Shanghai.

Established in 1918 during the Russian Civil War, the district was disbanded after the end of the war in 1922. It was reestablished during the pre-World War II Soviet buildup in 1938. At the beginning of Operation Typhoon, the German attack on Moscow in October 1941, the district headquarters in the city of Orel was surprised by the German attack and hastily forced to flee the city. After most of the district's territory was occupied, it was disbanded. The district was reformed in 1943 after the area was recaptured and disbanded with the end of World War II in 1945.  First formation  Boundaries of the district in 1919, showing the addition of Tambov Governorate The Orel Military District was first formed along with other rear area military districts during the Russian Civil War on 31 March 1918, with headquarters at Orel. The district included Voronezh Governorate, Kursk Governorate, Orel Governorate, and Chernigov Governorate. On 8 June 1919, it was subordinated to the Southern Front. On 29 June, Tambov Governorate was added to the district. It was tasked with forming new units and formations for the Red Army and organizing the vsevobuch, a system of universal military training. In the summer and fall of 1919, the district's troops were involved in battles against White commander Konstantin Mamontov's raid into the Soviet rear. The district was transferred to the control of the Southwestern Front on 10 January 1920, and returned to the Southern Front a month later. Between January and July 1921, troops of the district participated in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion, an anti-Soviet peasant revolt. During the war, the district called up 300,000 men and formed four rifle divisions, a cavalry division, and other smaller units, while training 67,000 men under vsevobuch. After the end of the war, the district was disbanded on 9 March 1922, and its territory was ceded to the Moscow Military District and the Western Military District.  Second formation  On 28 July 1938, the district was reformed from the headquarters of the 10th Rifle Corps, as part of a pre-World War II buildup of the Soviet Armed Forces. It included Voronezh Oblast, Kursk Oblast, and Orel Oblast. Tambov Oblast was added to the district in October 1939. The district was tasked with maintaining the military and mobilization readiness of the troops, their rearmament with new equipment, and pre-conscription training of youths for military service. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the 20th Army was formed in the district under the command of district commander Fyodor Remezov. Lieutenant General Pavel Kurochkin replaced Remezov, and was himself replaced by Lieutenant General Alexander Tyurin in July. The district also mobilized those eligible for military service, formed new units and formations, sent march battalions to the front, and expanded the network of hospitals and other rear services. 17 rifle divisions, five brigades, and eight reserve brigades were formed in the district after 22 June. On 2 October, German troops began Operation Typhoon, an offensive which aimed to capture Moscow. German tank troops quickly broke through Soviet lines and advanced deep into the Soviet rear. The 4th Panzer Division reached Orel on 3 October, surprising the military district's headquarters, which hastily left the city. Tyurin, district chief of staff P.E. Glinsky, and district commissar N.E. Yefimov were held responsible for the abandonment of Orel, with Tyurin sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and Glinsky and Yefimov to five years. However, all three were later pardoned, demoted, and sent back to the front. The district headquarters was subsequently relocated to Yelets, Tambov, and Orenburg. With most of its territory under German occupation, the district was disbanded on 8 December and its remaining territory transferred to the Volga Military District. The headquarters of the Orel Military District was used to form the headquarters of the South Ural Military District in Orenburg on 26 November.  Third formation  The district was reformed on 21 August 1943, under the command of then-Major General Matvei Popov. It included troops in Kursk and Orel Oblasts, transferred from the Moscow Military District, and Voronezh Oblast, transferred from the Volga Military District. Despite its name, the district's third formation was headquartered in Voronezh. On 30 October, Tambov Oblast became part of the district after being transferred from the Volga Military District. In October, the district temporarily oversaw recently recaptured Gomel and Polesia Voblasts in eastern Belarus. From July 1944, the district included newly reestablished Bryansk Oblast. The district was tasked with restoring military commissariats in its territory, creating lines of communication with the front, forming march battalions for movement to the front, forming new units, and clearing mines from the territory of the district. Postwar, it became the Voronezh Military District on 9 July 1945.  Commanders  The district's first formation was commanded by the following officers: * A. Ya. Semashko (May 1918–January 1919) * A.D. Makarov (January 1919) * Pyotr Shcherbakov (January 1919–January 1920) * O.A. Skudre (January 1920–March 1921) * Alexander Alexandrov (March–July 1921) * O.A.

Another more common understanding of Bandenbekämpfung is anti-partisan warfare. The doctrine of \\"bandit-fighting\\" provided a rationale for targeting and murdering any number of groups, from armed guerrillas to the civilian population, as \\"bandits\\" or \\"members of gangs\\". As applied by the German Empire and later by Nazi Germany, it became instrumental in the genocidal mass murders implemented by the two regimes, including the Holocaust. Emergence =Concept and origins= According to historian and television documentary producer, Christopher Hale, there are indications that the term Bandenbekämpfung may go back as far as the Thirty Years' War. Under the German Empire established by Bismarck in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War—formed as a union of twenty-five German states under the Hohenzollern king of Prussia—Prussian militarism flourished; martial traditions that included the military doctrine of Antoine-Henri Jomini's 1837 treatise, Summary of the Art of War were put into effect. Some of the theories laid out by Jomini contained instructions for intense offensive operations and the necessity of securing one's \\"lines of operations\\". German military officers took this to mean as much attention should be given to logistical operations used to fight the war at the rear as those in the front, and certainly entailed security operations to protect the \\"lines of operations\\". Following Jomini's lead, Oberstleutnant Albrecht von Boguslawski published lectures entitled Der Kleine Krieg (\\"The Small War\\", a literal translation of guerrilla), which outlined in detail the tactical procedures related to partisan and anti-partisan warfare—likely deliberately written without clear distinctions between combatants and non-combatants. To what extent this contributed to the intensification of unrestrained warfare cannot be known, but Prussian officers like Alfred von Schlieffen encouraged their professional soldiers to embrace a dictum advocating that \\"for every problem, there was a military solution.\\" Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the Prussian General Staff, added hostage-taking as a means of deterrence to sabotage activities and the employment of collective measures against entire communities, which became the basis for German anti-partisan policies from 1870 and remained as such through 1945. Blégny in August 1914 during the Rape of Belgium in the First World War Prussian security operations during the Franco-Prussian War included the use of the Landwehr reservists, whose duties ranged from guarding railroad lines, to taking hostages, and carrying out reprisals to deter activities of the francs-tireurs. Bismarck wanted all francs-tireurs hanged or shot, and encouraged his military commanders to burn down villages that housed them. More formal structures like Chief of the Field Railway, a Military Railway Corps, District Commanders, Special Military Courts, intelligence units, and military police of varying duties and nomenclature were integrated into the Prussian system to bolster security operations all along the military's operational lines. Operationally, the first attempts to use tactics that would later develop into Bandenbekämpfung or be recognized as such were carried out in China in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion, after two German officers went missing, which was followed up with more than fifty operations by German troops, who set fire to a village and held prisoners. Shortly after these operations, the infantry was provided with a handbook for \\"operations against Chinese bandits\\" (Banden). The first full application of Bandenbekämpfung in practice, was the Herero and Namaqua genocide, a campaign of racial extermination and collective punishment that the German Empire undertook in German South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) against the Herero and Nama people. =World War I= During the First World War, the German Army ignored many of the commonly understood European conventions of war, when between August and October 1914 some 6,500 French and Belgian citizens were deliberately killed. Throughout the war, Germany's integrated intelligence, perimeter police, guard network, and border control measures all coalesced to define the German military's security operations. Along the Eastern Front sometime in August 1915, Field Marshal Falkenhayn established a general government over Congress Poland under General von Beseler, creating an infrastructure to support ongoing military operations, which included guards posts, patrols and a security network. Maintaining security meant dealing with Russian prisoners, many of whom tried to sabotage German plans and kill German soldiers, so harsh pacification measures and terror actions were carried out, including brutal reprisals against civilians, otherwise known as bandits. Before long, similar practices were being instituted throughout both the Eastern and Western areas of German occupation. Bandenbekämpfung in the Second World War German army policy for deterring partisan or \\"bandit\\" activities against its forces was to strike \\"such terror into the population that it loses all will to resist.\\" Even before the Nazi campaign in the east had begun, Hitler had already absolved his soldiers and police from any responsibility for brutality against civilians, expecting them to kill anyone that even \\"looked askance\\" at the German forces. Much of the partisan warfare became an exercise of anti-Semitism, as military commanders like General Bechtolsheim exclaimed that whenever an act of sabotage was committed and one killed the Jews from that village, then \\"one can be certain that one has destroyed the perpetrators, or at least those who stood behind them.\\" When the Wehrmacht entered Serbia in 1941, they carried out mass reprisals against partisans by executing Jews there. The commander responsible for combating partisan warfare in 1941, General Böhme, reiterated to the German forces, \\"that rivers of German blood\\" had been spilled in Serbia during the First World War and the Wehrmacht should consider any acts of violence there as \\"avenging these deaths.\\" Before invading the Soviet Union for Operation Barbarossa, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, and Chief of the SD Reinhard Heydrich, as well as SS General Heinrich Müller briefed the Einsatzgruppen leaders of their responsibility to secure the rear areas—using the euphemism \\"special treatment\\"—against potential enemies; this included partisans and anyone deemed a threat by the Nazi functionaries. Execution of suspected partisans by German soldiers, September 1941 German soldiers relax after destroying a village in Epirus, Greece (1942 or 1943) From September 1941 onwards through the course of World War II, the term Bandenbekämpfung supplanted Partisanenkämpfung (anti-partisan warfare) to become the guiding principle of Nazi Germany's security warfare and occupational policies; largely as a result of Himmler's insistence that for psychological reasons, bandit was somehow preferable. Himmler charged the 'Prinz Eugen' Division to expressly deal with \\"partisan revolts.\\" Units like the SS Galizien—who were likewise tasked to deal with partisans—included foreign recruits overseen by experienced German \\"bandit\\" fighters well-versed in the \\"mass murder of unarmed civilians.\\" Aside from the groups assigned to fight partisans, additional assistance in this task was provided by the Gestapo, the German Criminal Police, the SD, and the Waffen-SS. On 23 October 1942, Himmler named SS General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski the \\"Commissioner for Anti-Bandit Warfare.\\" Then Himmler transferred SS General Curt von Gottberg to Byelorussia to ensure that the Bandenbekämpfung operations were conducted on a permanent basis, a task which Gottberg carried out with fanatical ruthlessness, declaring the entire population bandits, Jews, Gypsies, spies, or bandit sympathizers. During Gottberg's first major operations, Operations Nürnberg and Hamburg, conducted between November thru December 1942, he reported 5,000 murdered Jews, another 5,000 bandits or suspects eliminated, and 30 villages burned down. Also in October 1942—just a couple months prior to Gottberg's exploits—Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring had ordered \\"anti-bandit warfare\\" in Army Group Rear Area Center, which was shortly followed by an OKH Directive on 11 November 1942 for \\"anti-bandit warfare in the East\\" that announced sentimental considerations as \\"irresponsible\\" and instructed the men to shoot or preferably hang bandits, including women. Misgivings from commanders within Army Group Rear that such operations were counterproductive and in poor taste since women and children were being murdered went ignored or resisted from Bach-Zelewski, who frequently \\"cited the special powers of the Reichsführer.\\" Over time, the Wehrmacht acculturated to the large scale anti-bandit operations, as the enemy was not simply populated by partisan groups, but instead they too came to see the entire population as criminal and complicit in any operation against German troops. In fact, many of the commanders were unbothered by the fact that these operations fell under the jurisdiction of the SS. Historians Ben Shepherd and Juliette Pattinson note: > As the war dragged on, the occupation’s mounting economic rapacity > engendered a vicious cycle of further resistance, further German brutality > in response, and the erosion of order and stability across occupied Europe. > Here, the issue of how occupation strategy shaped the partisan war connects > with...how the nature and course of the partisan war was affected by the > relationship between the occupied rear and the front line. Indeed, in > eastern Europe during World War II, most directly in the Soviet Union, > keeping occupied territory pacified was crucial to supplying not just the > German front line, but also the German domestic population. Waffen-SS soldiers watch a burning farmer's house during the Third Battle of Kharkov. German forces committed atrocities against civilians under the guise of Bandenbekämpfung. Historian Jeff Rutherford claims that \\"Whilst the Wehrmacht focused on the Red Army, SD and other SS formations would combat any resistance movements in the rear. In effect, the German Army willingly ensnared itself in the Nazi machinery of annihilation and extermination by working with the SS to systematically suppress partisan movements and other forms of perceived resistance.\\" To this end, Einsatzgruppen, Order Police, SS- Sonderkommandos and army forces—for the most part—worked cooperatively to combat partisans (\\"bandits\\"), not only acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the field, but also in plundering \\"bandit areas\\"; they laid these areas to waste, seized crops and livestock, enslaved the local population or murdered them. Anti-bandit operations were characterized by \\"special cruelty.\\" For instance, Soviet Jews were murdered outright under the pretext that they were partisans per Hitler's orders. Historian Timothy Snyder asserts that by the second half of 1942, \\"German anti-partisan operations were all but indistinguishable from the mass murder of the Jews.\\" Other historians have made similar observations. Omer Bartov argued that under the auspices of destroying their \\"so-called political and biological enemies,\\" often described as \\"bandits\\" or \\"partisans,\\" the Nazis made no effort \\"to distinguish between real guerrillas, political suspects, and Jews.\\" According to historian Erich Haberer, the Nazi's murderous policies toward the Jews provided the victims little choice; driven to \\"coalesce into small groups to survive in forested areas from where they emerged periodically to forage food in nearby fields and villages, the Germans created their own partisan problem, which, by its very nature, was perceived as banditry.\\" Typically these \\"heroic and futile acts of resistance\\" against the Nazi occupiers were often in vain considering the \\"insurmountable odds\\" of success, although the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto managed to resists for upwards of four months, which historian Patrick Henry notes, was \\"longer than some national armies\\" managed. Such activity \\"worked powerfully against the anti-Semitic stereotype...that Jews would not fight.\\" Correspondingly, there are estimates that 30,000 Jews joined partisan units in Belorussia and the western Ukraine alone, while other Jewish partisan groups joined fighters from Bulgaria, Greece, and Yugoslavia, where they assisted in derailing trains, destroying bridges, and carrying out sabotage acts that contributed to the deaths of thousands of German soldiers. Surging operations from better equipped partisans against Army Group Center during 1943 intensified to the degree that the 221st Security Division's did not just eliminate \\"bandits\\" but laid entire regions where they operated to waste. The scale of this effort must be taken into consideration, as historian Michael Burleigh reports that anti-partisan operations had a significant impact on German operations in the East; namely, since they caused \\"widespread economic disruption, tied down manpower which could have been deployed elsewhere, and by instilling fear and provoking extreme countermeasures, drove a wedge between occupiers and occupied.\\" Following the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, the Nazis intensified their anti-partisan operations in Poland, during which the German forces employed their version of anti-partisan tactics by shooting upwards of 120,000 civilians in Warsaw. Ideologically speaking, since partisans represented an immediate existential threat, in that, they were equated with Jews or people under their influence, the systematic murder of anyone associated with them was an expression of the regime's racial anti- Semitism and was viewed by members of the Wehrmacht as a \\"necessity of war.\\" Throughout the war in Europe, and especially during the German-Soviet War, 1941–45, these doctrines amalgamated with the Nazi regime's genocidal plans for the racial reshaping of the Eastern Europe to secure \\"living space\\" (Lebensraum) for Germany. In the first eleven months of the war against the Soviet Union, the German forces liquidated in excess of 80,000 \\"alleged\\" partisans. Implemented by units of the SS, Wehrmacht and Order Police, Bandenbekämpfung as applied by the Nazi regime and directed by the SS across occupied Europe led to mass crimes against humanity and was an instrumental part of the Holocaust. Führer Directive 46 PK 666). In July 1942, Himmler was appointed to lead the security initiatives in rear areas. One of his first actions in this role was the prohibition of the use of \\"partisan\\" to describe counter-insurgents. Bandits (Banden) was the term chosen to be used by German forces. Hitler insisted that Himmler was \\"solely responsible\\" for combating bandits except in districts under military administration; such districts were under the authority of the Wehrmacht. The organisational changes, putting experienced SS killers in charge, and language that criminalised resistance, whether real or imagined, presaged the transformation of security warfare into massacres. The radicalisation of \\"anti-bandit\\" warfare saw further impetus in the Führer Directive 46 of 18 August 1942, where security warfare's aim was defined as \\"complete extermination\\". The directive called on the security forces to act with \\"utter brutality\\", while providing immunity from prosecution for any acts committed during \\"bandit- fighting\\" operations. The directive designated the SS as the organisation responsible for rear-area warfare in areas under civilian administration. In areas under military jurisdiction (the Army Group Rear Areas), the Army High Command had the overall responsibility. The directive declared the entire population of \\"bandit\\" (i.e. partisan-controlled) territories as enemy combatants. In practice, this meant that the aims of security warfare was not pacification, but complete destruction and depopulation of \\"bandit\\" and \\"bandit-threatened\\" territories, turning them into \\"dead zones\\" (Tote Zonen).

B. Lippincott & Co. in 1950. Lippincott wrote 17 books about animals and nature. He wrote two books set in Florida, one of which was The Wahoo Bobcat. Plot The Wahoo bobcat is the biggest bobcat in the Florida water prairie wilderness. A nine-year-old boy and the bobcat establish a friendship that endures through seasons of drought, dangers such as wildfire, floods, panthers and more. But the biggest threat is the hunting of the cat by men and dogs in the Florida swamp. Reception In a 1950 book review, Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"An appealing, authentic and unusual story of life in the Florida water prairie wilderness... Very little has been done with the life and habits of the bobcat, and the author's picture of the sleek, tough creature together with glimpses of the strange, violent life of the wilderness, makes an exciting and vivid book.\\" The Quarterly Review of Biology wrote, \\"In telling his story of the bobcat's friendship with a backwoods boy, Joseph W. Lippincott gives an excellent portrayal of the swamp lands, their wildlife inhabitants, and the forces of nature which come into play to make the lives of the animals and the existence of man precarious and tenuous indeed.\\" Adaptation In 1963, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color broadcast a dramatized version.

The city was officially announced as host city during a meeting of the entity's executive board during the 2019 Winter Universiade which was held in Krasnoyarsk in Russia. Chengdu will be the third city in Mainland China to host an edition of the Summer Universiade, the first was Beijing in 2001 and the second was Shenzhen 10 years later. China also hosted the 2009 Winter Universiade in Harbin. =Previously interested cities= Bucharest, Romania In March 2015, days after the closing ceremonies of 2015 Winter Universiade FISU has been informed about the intention of Bucharest, capital of Romania to make a bid for the 2021 Summer Universiade. Should Bucharest won, this would have been the second Summer Universiade hosted by the city, with the first was in 1981. Cali, Colombia In July 2016, FISU has been informed about the intention of the city of Santiago de Cali, Colombia interested in hosting the 2021 Summer Universiade. Should Cali won, it would have become the second South American city to host the Summer Universiade (after Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1963), the first since 1979 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 1993 to be held in the Americas. Seoul, South Korea and Pyongyang, North Korea On 4 October 2018, it was announced by the mayor of Seoul that there were joint negotiations between the city, the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang and FISU, so that both cities could host the 2021 Summer Universiade, the proposal would be that the opening ceremony would be held in Seoul, while the closing would be in Pyongyang. Should the talks came to fruition, this would have been the third time in history that the Summer Universiade would be held in South Korea, the first time was in 2003 in Daegu and the second was in 2015 in Gwangju. The country also hosted the 1997 Winter Universiade, in Muju County and the Jeonju city. This would have been the first time in history that more than one country host a Summer Universiade, as well as first for North Korea. This had already happened at the 2015 Winter Universiade, when due to the extremely high risk of an environmental disaster, the Spanish city of Granada was unable to host the Nordic skiing and biathlon events and they have been transferred to FISU approved to move the Nordic Skiing and Biathlon events to Štrbské Pleso and Osrblie in Slovakia. Sports With the creation of the FISU University Football World Cup in 2019, the sport will no longer be part of the Summer World University Games program starting at the this year.

Born in Dundalk, Swift was educated at a Christian Brothers School. His father ran a co- operative bakery but this closed and the family endured poverty. In 1914, Swift began an apprenticeship at a bakery in Dublin, and spent much of his spare time attending meetings where Jim Larkin was speaking. He briefly joined the Irish Volunteers, but took time out following an accident, and decided not to rejoin due to Larkin's opposition to the organisation.Michael McInerney, \\"A lifetime in the service of labour\\", Irish Times, 31 July 1975 Swift became active in the Irish National Federal Union of Bakers, attempting to recruit his fellow workers. As a result, he was sacked from his job and, due to the lack of available work in Ireland, he was forced to move to England and work in a munitions factory. There, he led a strike, and as a result was court- marshalled and confined at Wandsworth Prison. He was offered the opportunity to leave if he joined the British Army but, when he refused, was given solitary confinement. He passed the time whistling arias by Verdi; a warder mistook these for Irish rebel songs and placed him on punishment rations of bread and water for a week. Swift agreed to join the Army as a non-combatant cook, but once he was informed that he would still be required to take part in weapons drills, he refused to take part, and was moved to the military prison in Aldershot. Finally, he accepted a role as a cook with the King's Own Royal Lancasters in March 1918. Before the end of the month, he had been wounded, and was hospitalised, only returning shortly before the Armistice. Swift was demobbed in 1919 and returned to Dublin, but was unable to find regular work, and so emigrated to Paris. He was back in Dublin in 1925, where he again became involved in union activism. He launched a union orchestra and choir, then a bakery school. The school was a great success, and was taken over by the Dublin Vocational Committee, although Swift remained its chair until his retirement. In 1936, Swift was appointed as national organiser of the union, by then known as the \\"Irish Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers Amalgamated Union\\", and in 1942, he was elected as its General Secretary. As general secretary, Swift oversaw the purchase and fitting out of a new headquarters for the union, on Harcourt Street. Swift was active on the Dublin Trades Council, succeeding Larkin as president in 1945, and becoming editor of Workers' Action, its newspaper. He served as president of the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1946, using his presidency to promote workers' education; this led to the founding of The People's College. He was also prominent in the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Association, working with Herman Leuenberger to maintain unofficial contacts with trade unionists across Europe during World War II, and to assist refugees, and he served as president of the international from 1964. Swift was a member of the Labour Party from 1927, always associated with its left-wing. He wrote the party's \\"Workers' Democracy\\" policy in the 1960s. In 1973, he surprised many by supporting Ireland joining the European Economic Community.John P. Swift, John Swift, an Irish dissident Alongside Nora Harkin, and Bobbie and Frank Edwards, Swift was a founding member of the Ireland-USSR Society. Swift retired from his trade union posts in 1967 and wrote a history of the Irish Bakers.

Historically, from time to time there has been a shortage of qualified medical practitioners in Australia, especially in rural Australia, and the Australian Government has at times encouraged immigration for such graduates to Australia. Australia has welcomed and continues to rely on a considerable number of doctors from overseas, with the largest numbers from the UK, India, Malaysia, China and New Zealand. The number of overseas born doctors in Australia has increased in recent years (though not all are overseas trained). In 2011, more than half of GPs (56%) and just under half of specialists (47%) were born overseas, up from 46% and 37% respectively in 2001. In comparison, less than a third (28%) of the total employed population of Australia in 2011 were born overseas. Licensing and registration International medical graduates who wish to be licensed in Australia must apply to the Australian Medical Council (AMC) to arrange an appropriate assessment pathway. The standard pathway involves an IMG sitting a series of assessments, including an AMC Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Exam and an AMC clinical exam. AMC MCQ Exam consists of 150 MCQs organized through computer adaptive scoring. For AMC clinical exam, a candidate is required to pass 10 out of 16 cases which has 2 pilot cases. Those OTDs who have passed the necessary exams and obtained AMC certification can then apply to an Australian specialty training positions. Australia is in the process of establishing a national registration process for all the doctors under Medical Board of Australia. In 2010 the Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia) launched an Inquiry process into registration and accreditation processes for international medical graduates which reported in 2012. Recommendations included measures around procedural fairness, transparency and efficiency in recognising OTDs especially for specialist training and qualification. Immigration policy Australia has a restricted Immigration Policy since the 1950s, where potential immigrants are assessed based on a number of characteristics, including education and profession. Immigration was restricted often to whites through the White Australia Policy, and with the end of the White Australia Policy after about 1966 to 1973 many of the modern first non-white immigrants (from India for example) were overseas trained doctors. While Medical Practitioners have often been encouraged to immigrate, there has been resistance in some quarters despite a continued rural shortage. The Australian Medical Association recognised the importance of OTDs, however highlighted the need to train doctors locally.https://ama.com.au/sites/default/files/documents/OTDPositionStatement2004.pdf In 2016 Skilled migration lists were updated to remove 41 medical fields of expertise, in an effort to restrict immigration of OTDs. However, as of 2017, 33 medical fields of expertise remain on the list,http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Work/Work/Skills-assessment-and-assessing- authorities/skilled-occupations-lists/SOL with 9 flagged for removal Controversy While some argue it is harder to qualify as an overseas trained doctor than as a locally trained doctor in Australia, despite the stringent processes, there is a perception that OTDs and non-white doctors in particular face discrimination. While base medical practice licensing is one hurdle, speciality recognition has proven considerably more difficult for some OTDs. In one case, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine was criticised for passing only 6.8% of non-white applicants whereas 88% of white caucasians passed. In 2017 the college initiated an inquiry chaired by Dr Helen Szoke A study showed that OTDs attracted 24% more complaints and 41% more adverse findings than non-OTDs in Australia, with the study acknowledging that complaints leading to adverse findings were not always an objective measure of deficient practices. A number of high-profile cases involving OTDs include: * Dr Jayant Patel was accused of gross negligence while practicing at Bundaberg Base Hospital, however many of the substantial charges were quashed by the High Court of Australia, though he pleaded guilty to lesser charges of fraud and was barred from practicing medicine. * Dr Mohamed Haneef in 2007 who was falsely arrested by the Australian Federal Police in connection with the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack, was released and compensated. However his flatmate Dr Mohammed Asif Ali was suspended and sacked after the raids on Dr Mohamed Haneef uncovered unrelated alleged resume discrepancies and the possession of rubber stamps in relation to Dr Mohammed Asif Ali. * Dr Qinglin Wang in 2016 successfully sued the Australian Capital Territory for discriminating against overseas trained doctors after failing to be accepted as an intern. * Shyam Acharya in 2017 who fled after being charged for allegedly stealing the identity of a foreign doctor, Dr Sarang Chitale since 2003, practicing in Manly, Gosford, Wyong, Hornsby hospitals. * Ugandan educated Oncologist and haematologist, Dr Kiran Phadke was cleared to practice oncology in 2017 after a year-long investigation, however was prevented from practicing haematology. Concern was that an internal investigation was released by NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner before the Doctor was able to respond, and \\"set a worrying precedent for doctors in the public health system\\" according to colleagues.

Mathews was Chair of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for 33 years (1919–1952).  Early life and education  Mathews was raised on a dairy farm near the unincorporated community of Auroraville, Wisconsin in Waushara County, Wisconsin.Ihde, p. 251. As a youth, he had little interest in farm life or in the cheese factory operated by his older brother. His parents sent Joseph to public school in nearby Berlin, a city that straddles the boundary between Waushara and Green Lake counties. He graduated from Omro High School (Omro, Winnebago County). Mathews studied briefly at Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, and then transferred to the University of Wisconsin. Mathews earned the B.S. in chemistry in 1903, writing a senior thesis on nitrosyl selenic acid, based on research under the supervision of Victor Lenher (1873–1927).  Career and research  After a short stint as an analytical chemist at the consulting firm of H. S. Mitchell in Milwaukee, Mathews returned to Madison as a graduate student of physical chemist Louis Albrecht Kahlenberg (1870–1941), Chair of the Department of Chemistry. Kahlenberg, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, had been a doctoral student in Leipzig of Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald (1853–1932), one of the founders of the field of physical chemistry. Mathews' research correlated electrical conductivity and chemical activity.\\"On the Relation Between Electrolytic Conduction, Specific Inductive Capacity and Chemical Activity of Certain Liquids: With a Bibliography of Dielectric Constants,\\" M.Sc. dissertation. He received the M.Sc. in 1905. Mathews then went to Harvard to study with Theodore William Richards (1868–1928). While Richards was on leave as an exchange professor at the University of Berlin, Mathews obtained a temporary instructorship in physical and industrial chemistry at Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland. Mathews returned to Harvard in 1907, completing his doctorate \\"A Study of Compressibility, and its Relation to Various Other Physical Properties of Certain Organic Compounds,\\" Ph.D. thesis, Harvard University, 1908. in 1908 with T. W. Richards. He then became an Instructor of Physical Chemistry. Kahlenberg gave lectures in the Physical Chemistry course, and Mathews taught the laboratory.The laboratory textbook was Frederick Hutton Getman, Laboratory Exercises in Physical Chemistry, (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1904). Mathews began to develop a physical chemistry laboratory course that was to become standard in chemistry curricula throughout the United States. Mathews tried new laboratory exercises whose directions he had mimeographed to supplement the Getman lab manual. Mathews later collaborated with Wisconsin colleagues Farrington Daniels (1889–1972) and John Warren Williams (1898–1988) to publish Experimental Physical Chemistry (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1929; 475 pages). That book, in seven editions and with added authorsBy the time the sixth edition was published in 1962, Professors Robert Arnold Alberty (June 21, 1921–January 18, 2014) and Charles Daniel Cornwell (born December 27, 1924; Professor Emeritus, University Wisconsin, 1995) had been added to the list of authors. from the Wisconsin chemistry faculty, was the market leader among physical chemistry laboratory textbooksGeorge Fleck (2016), Parallel Lives: Two Hoosier Chemists from Peru, p. 32. The Impress Group, Williamsburg, MA. . until the 1970s. McGraw-Hill published all editions. One of Mathew's first graduate students was Albert Fredrick Ottomar Germann (1886–1976). Germann’s M.Sc. thesis A. F. O. Germann, “The Use of a Dewar Flask in Measurements of Heats of Neutralization,” M.Sc. thesis, 1910; J. Howard Mathews and A. F. O. Germann, “The Use of a Dewar Flask in Measurements of Heats of Neutralization,” Journal of Physical Chemistry, vol. 15, no. 1 (1911), pp. 73–82. provided instructions for one of Mathews' new student experiments.Experiment 21, “Heat of Neutralization,” pp. 76–80, Experimental Physical Chemistry, 1st edition, 1929. Mathews was the third Chair of the Chemistry Department. He was preceded by analytical chemist William Willard Daniells (1840–1912) who served from 1880 to 1907, and by physical chemist Louis Albrecht Kahlenberg (1870–1941) who served from 1907 to 1919. Mathews was followed by physical chemist Farrington Daniels (1889–1972) who served from 1952 to 1959. Mathews had the central role Ihde, pp. 478–483. in making Wisconsin a center for physical chemical research on colloidal systems. He organized the first national symposium on colloid chemistry, held in June 1923 in Madison.J. Howard Mathews, ed., Colloid Symposium Monograph: Papers and Discussions Presented at the First National Symposium on Colloid Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, June, 1923 (Madison: Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, 1923). This book initiated the series Colloid Symposium Monographs (Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins Company, 1923-1936). Mathews was instrumental in bringing Theodor (\\"The,\\" pronounced \\"Tay\\") Svedberg (1884–1971) from Uppsala University to Madison as a Visiting Professor in 1923. With graduate student J. Burton Nichols, The Svedberg constructed an optical sedimentation centrifuge The Svedberg and J. Burton Nichols, \\"Determination of the Size and Distribution of Size of Particle by Centrifugal Methods,\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 45, no. 12 (1923), pp. 2910–2917. that was the precursor of the ultracentrifuge.The Svedberg and Herman Rinde, \\"The Ultra-centrifuge, a New Instrument for the Determination of Size and Distribution of Size of Particle in Amicroscopic Colloids,\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 46, no. 12 (1924), pp. 2677–2693. Svedberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1926.\\"All Nobel Prizes in Chemistry,\\" http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/, accessed April 9, 2017. Fruitful collaboration between Svedberg and Wisconsin chemists continued for decades. Charles C. Watson and John Warren Williams each spent a year in Uppsala. Watson became a doctoral student with Williams, and helped install an ultracentrifuge at duPont, the first in the United States. Watson then was in charge of installing an ultracentrifuge in Madison, the first in an American university. Williams formed a colloid chemistry research group in Madison, including doctoral students Robert Arnold Alberty and Louis Gosting. Mathews was a member of the Madison Fire and Police Commission.Ihde, p. 483. This interest stemmed from a crime scene investigation during which he was asked to verify a common source for metal fragments found at the scene. In 1938 he began teaching a new course, \\"Identification of the Criminal by Scientific Methods\\" (Sociology 165). After retirement, his active research was on the laboratory examination of small arms, and rifling characteristics in hand guns. This research resulted in a two-volume book with many illustrations.J. Howard Mathews, Firearms Identification (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1962). An expanded edition was published posthumously.J.

He was a senior chemistry major, three others were seniors, and five were juniors. The formal organizational meeting was on December 11, 1902. Mathews was the first President. From 1908 to 1914, Mathews was Grand Master Alchemist. When Mathews was teaching at Case School of Applied Science, he established a chapter there. Other chapters were organized at the University of Minnesota and at Indiana University. With enthusiastic support from Mathews, 47 chapters had been formed by 1918. In 2017, there were 49 active collegiate chapters.  Personal life  Mathews married Ella Gillfillan (B.A. 1907, University of Wisconsin) on June 26, 1909. They had two children: Marian and Jean.

The conservation and restoration of Judaica takes into account the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the written and oral Torah known as halacha in order to properly care for these materials. This work involves identifying these objects and therefore knowing how any of these objects are traditionally handled, stored, exhibited, and generally cared for based on their use and significance. Definition of culturally sensitive objects Traditional Judaism divides ritual objects into two main categories, those that carry holiness; and those that are essential to the performance of a particular ritual or commandment but that have no intrinsic quality that is defined as sacred or holy. Once they are no longer in ritual use and are in the possession of a museum, only some of the objects in the first category are traditionally treated differently from the way other collections are treated. For these pieces, repair or restoration done by a conservator is not common. It is common for almost all other objects, conservation, repair, or restoration to be carried out without restriction. The way the culturally sensitive objects below are handled and preventively conserved is all based on the laws and thoughts of the most strict sect of Judaism as is recommended. Below is a list of both types of objects with definitions and descriptions to aid in identifying and therefore knowing how any of these objects might be handled and cared for due to their uses and significance. Additionally, these descriptions will aid in understanding the care and handling methods listed below them. References are made to Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrachi Jews in this article. Ashkenazi Jews trace their ancestry to communities in central and eastern Europe while Sephardi Jews are those who came originally from the Iberian Peninsula. These Jews were expelled in 1492 during the Spanish Inquisition and settled in places like Greece, Turkey, the Netherlands, and what is known as Israel today. Mizrachi Jews are those who trace their ancestry to the Arab world and Iran, as well as those whose families never left Palestine. =Types of sacred and non-sacred objects= Tashmishey Kedushah is the first category of ritual objects and is defined as \\"objects which carry holiness\\" or \\"accessories of holiness.\\" The most common example of this is the Torah which is the Five Books of Moses. Torah scroll The common feature of the objects in this group is that they contain words, specifically the name of God, but by extension, any words \\"divinely written\\" or inspired, from which the quality of holiness is derived. Because the nontextual objects surrounding these scrolls all come into contact with them, they also acquire some of the same quality of holiness. The transmission is not indefinite. It extends a maximum of two layers from the text. Other objects in this category include: *Torah curtains - Curtains that are in front of the Torah ark and are often decorative in nature but can also be plain. * Mantle - A piece of fabric often used to cover a Torah scroll and often made of velvet or another soft material with some type of embroidery. This is used most often by Ashkenazi communities. * Torah binder - A strip of soft fabric, similar to the mantle, that keeps the Torah scroll closed. In Italy and in the Sephardi communities, the binder is known as a \\"fascia\\"; it is made of a costly material or of linen embroidered in silk thread. * Rimonim - Silver and gold ornaments that are placed on the wooden rollers or in Hebrew, \\"atzei chaim\\" (trees of life). Many times these are adorned with little bells and are very intricate. * Breastplate - A metal shield placed in front of the mantle of the Torah scroll in Ashkenazi communities. This custom did not develop in Sephardi communities because their Torah scrolls were kept in a case (tik) which did not lend itself to such additional decoration. Symbolic of, and sometimes similar to, the breastplate prescribed for the high priest, the object is often called \\"ḥoshen mishpat,\\" the Hebrew word for breastplate. * Yad - The pointer used by the Torah reader to keep one's place is known as a \\"yad,\\" in Hebrew, or \\"hand\\" in English, in Ashkenazi communities and as the \\"moreh\\" or \\"pointer/teacher\\" or \\"Kulmus\\" or \\"quill\\" in Sephardi and Eastern communities. The pointer was originally a narrow rod, tapered at the pointing end, usually with a hole at the other end through which a ring or chain could be passed to hang the pointer on the Torah scroll. Now it looks like a hand with one finger pointing out. This is used so that no hands touch the actual scroll and transfer oils or dirt. Pointers are made for the most part of silver or silver-plated brass, but in a few European communities, they used to be made of wood. In such cases, the pointers were carved in the local folk-art style. * Wood Torah case - Used by Sephardic Jews instead of a fabric mantle allowing the Torah to sit upright when not in use and without the use of a chair or holder as mentioned above. ShinMezuzahJosephSherman * Chair or holder on which the Torah is placed when it is removed from the ark and not being read. * Tefillin - Known in English as “phylacteries,” are worn by men in the Orthodox and Conservative movement during morning prayer and on weekdays. This includes a leather case, the biblical texts written on parchment that is inside, the leather straps used to fasten them to the head and arm during prayer (see image of soldier below), and any bag specifically made to hold them and used for that purpose on a regular basis. *Mezuzah - A metal, ceramic, or glass casing in which the handwritten text on parchment or \\"klaf\\" in Hebrew, is held. This object is fastened to the doorpost of a house and, traditionally, to interior doorways as well and marks the home of a Jewish family. Bibles, prayer books, volumes of the Talmud, law codes, and commentaries, in a variety of languages, are now also included in this list. In some communities, any document of any kind written in Hebrew letters is also included. This can sometimes also include anything written in Yiddish which uses the same alphabet. Tashmishey Mitzvah Tashminey Mitzvah is a category that includes most other ritual objects essential to Jewish life. Objects include: *Wine or kiddush cups used on Sabbath and holidays *Hanukkah menorah *Seder plate *Shofar *Tallit with knotted fringes, called tzitzit. *Lulav or a palm branch in English, tied together with willow and myrtle and etrog (citron) to be used on the Jewish harvest holiday of Sukkot, *Etrog containers - That keep the etrog safe from the \\"pitam\\" or \\"pitom\\" breaking off making the fruit less valuable and possibly not kosher. *Sabbath candlesticks - Used weekly during Shabbat *Spice box and candle holder used for the Havdalah service that marks the end of the Jewish Sabbath, called Shabbat. *Challah and matzah covers - Used to cover bread for Shabbat and the holiday of Passover which tells the story of the exodus from Egypt. *Chuppah - or wedding canopy in English Preventive conservation  Once holy/sacred objects (tashmishey kedusha) leave the Jewish community and enter the care of a museum, it is common practice that this group of objects is divided into two sections. The first section contains the three written texts including the Torah scroll, tefillin, and klaf for the mezuza. (These all are, or contain, biblical texts that were handwritten on parchment, in a particular script, according to rigid rules, by men who are specially trained as scribes (sofrim)). The second section includes all other material, including printed or handwritten documents, Torah mantles, ark curtains, tefillin bags, Torah ornaments, and mezuza cases (see other section below). In terms of preventive conservation and conservation itself, Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls traditionally are left as they are. According to halacha, once they are no longer in use, there is no reason for them to be kosher—in proper condition to be used—and therefore no reason why missing or abraded letters are restored or minor repairs made to the parchment unless the museum wishes to do as they see it necessary for the safety of the object. The repair of other books and documents has often been done with the respect that would characterize any professional conservation treatment. In Judaism, the study of traditional texts is considered to be the equivalent of prayer. To restore any text, whether of aesthetic or historical value or not, to a state in which it can be studied is considered an act of merit whatever the religious or cultural affiliation of the person doing the work. This includes when it will just be on view in an exhibition. =Torah, Klaf= If, for the safety of a Torah scroll, it is determined that repairs must be done to the rollers on which the scroll is mounted, traditionally, these repairs are done by a scribe, who will then remounts the parchment onto the roller in the traditional manner. It has been proven that a Torah scroll that has a tear in the parchment does best when it is kept rolled to another part of the scroll. According to tradition, if two pages are separated the two parts of the scroll are most often wrapped and stored separately. If it is considered both possible (considering the condition of the parchment) and essential to rejoin the separated leaves. When Torah scrolls, prayer books, or volumes of the Talmud are in the possession of a Jewish institution, it is a common practice to only photograph (or making photocopies) of open scrolls or pages only for serious study or publication. Once the books and other documents are in an archive, or museum, the rules of the institution apply. These rules are usually based on condition and value, but restrictions on casual copying do exist in all cases. =Tefillin - phylacteries= IDF field commander, Asael Lubotzky, during Second Lebanon War, prays with tefillin It is against halacha to open tefillin unless it is necessary. According to Jewish tradition, the removal and examination of the klaf within the tefillin only occurs when the tefillin are being repaired. The style of the writing can give clues to the registrar or conservator to the time and place in which they were written. Many institutions exhibit tefillin in damaged condition if there is a special reason such as its association with a famous person, or in an exhibit of Holocaust-related material. =Other materials= Objects in this group are commonly treated by any qualified conservator who will treat Jewish ritual material as anthropological material rather than as art, keeping conservation treatment to a minimum, and avoiding extensive restoration. Any ethical treatment is seen as permitted. It is noted that Conservators in private practice, who may not have the option of minimal treatment, may take on greater responsibility as a result of the above. Original fabric or trimming removed from an ark curtain have traditionally given to the owner for proper disposal. If the owner is unwilling to do this is it common for the responsibility to fall on the conservator to make other arrangements. =Holocaust related objects= Alterations of any kind to an object that survived the Holocaust, unless absolutely necessary to ensure its physical survival, are not made out of respect for the victims. Conservators and collections staff traditionally attempt to do the least amount of conservation on an object from the Holocaust as the damaged state is part of what is seen as telling of the history of the object. Any intervention can be seen as causing a loss of historic and perhaps even esthetic information, and the greater the intervention the greater the damage. At Holocaust museums and other museums carrying objects from concentration camps including fragile items like prisoners’ artwork and thousands of documents, shoes, and suitcases, teeth, hair, glasses, luggage, and more, preservation is viewed as an ethical and practical issue. Conservators and registrars alike wrestle with questions about the proper role of restoration. It has been noted that people coming to see these objects don't want to see a replica of how something might have once looked, but they are looking for what it looks like because of what it, and what its owner, went through. The concentration camps themselves are also considered artifacts to be to preserved as close to how they originally looked while still conserving them. This includes the barracks and other buildings that are exposed to natural conditions like atmosphere, rain, cold, etc. When Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945, it covered 40 square kilometers, with three camps, sub camps, and an additional area that was supervised by SS administration. While some were hesitant to leave the camp as it was because of difficult memories, it was upon the request of former prisoners that the local government keep the former concentration camp intact as a memorial and the Polish government began initiatives to preserve the site, giving the Ministry of Culture and Art the authority to preserve parts of it. Alternatively, the conservation of audio or visual records (photographs, films, voice records) is different. The audio or visual recordings of past historical events that are caught as images or sound are not the original as there is no physical original. Because they are the only remaining representation of the events of the Holocaust, such as the Nazi book burnings in the Opernplatz in Berlin, this media is commonly conserved as much as possible. Overarching ethical concerns Because of certain rules, restrictions, and traditions within the Jewish religion, certain ethical concerns are commonly top-of-mind when caring for sacred Judaica. =Kohen restriction= Many restrictions were designed to maintain what is referred to as ritual purity for Jews who are of the \\"Priest\\" holy order in the Temple of Jerusalem. Today, most Jews will know if they come from that Kohen line, and one might be able to tell from the last name of Cohen, Kohn, Kahn, etc. Many of the laws and practices are still maintained in traditional Judaism. One law that might affect the conservation of objects is that Kohanim are forbidden to be in contact with dead bodies, or be under the same roof as a corpse or any part of one, except in the case of the death of a close relative. This could prevent a conservator or registrar (doing preventive conservation) from caring for objects that are of the human remains nature, but only if it bothers the professional because of his or her background. =Menstruation and women touching objects= It is the practice in some ultra-orthodox sects of Judaism that women who are menstruating do not touch any sacred texts for purity reasons. This is only a custom and is not written into Jewish law. Because of this, female conservators are able to work with the texts but remain cognizant of this custom. =Placement of sacred texts and objects on the floor= Materials containing: (a) God's name, (b) Three consecutive words of a biblical verse, when written on one line with the intent to quote the verse, or (c) Other written or printed Torah ideas or laws are considered to be holy and, according to Jewish law, are not placed on the floor for any reason. Schoolwork, homework and test papers may be included in this category if they contain any of the above. All these materials are considered holy objects whether they are in Hebrew or another language, in Braille, or on microfilm. =Stacking of sacred texts= Additionally, any materials with God's name are not, according to halacha, stacked one on top of the other in any type of museum storage. Many consider this to be disrespectful to the holy objects. Exhibition and storage While there are few restrictions on the exhibition of Jewish ritual objects and generally none on the examination of this material for purposes of study by anyone of any religion or culture, it is important to mention the exceptions below. It has been proven that Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls do best if exhibited in an unrolled fashion unless they are deemed no longer fit for ritual use. These objects are generally stored covered with plain cloth or tissue paper in a dark drawer or cabinet and are separated from their holders if a conservator or registrar feels it is unwise to leave them in the same place. A reason for this is if the mantle is deemed unfit to stay on the Torah scroll. It is common practice for a Tefillin that needs to be separated from its bag to be kept in a plain cloth bag for storage. Small Torah scrolls are commonly stored lying down while large ones are kept upright on a rack specifically made to hold their weight. Mezuzah scrolls are traditionally kept in their cases or wrapped in tissue. =Handling and long-term care= Generally, when taken out for any reason, such as to be examined by a researcher, tashmishey kedusha is treated with respect as any object that is still being used in rituals. The surface on which the objects are placed is covered with a clean cloth or appropriate non- acidic paper, and the objects are covered when not being examined. Any scrolls being examined are re-rolled up when not in use. It has been proven that if the parchment is in good enough condition, it's best for the preservation of Torah scrolls and other rolled documents to be completely rolled front to back (or vice versa) and back to the center, once every year or two. This is most commonly done by two people who are experienced in this procedure and under the supervision of a conservator. Conservation and restoration In many Jewish institutions, if it is decided that an object has reached the point of needing conservation, a museum registrar will connect a conservator with an expert in the type of object or in the Judaica field. This pairing of Rabbi with a conservator, a religious expert with conservator, or a professor with conservator, is known to creates a more trustworthy situation where the Museum does not have to worry that all Jewish rules are followed. If the conservator has any questions on process, or on what to do and not do, he or she can refer to the assigned expert. Instead of contacting a conservator if there are issues with a Torah, specifically involving the writing on the parchment, a registrar or curator will traditionally connect with a Sofer Stam, or a scribe in English. This expert is trained in transcribing the Torah, tefillin, and mezuzahs, and other religious writings. According to Jewish law, or halacha, they are the only people allowed to touch these texts. Scribes also assemble the Torah scrolls, sewing the sheets of parchment together and mounting them on the rollers, and make the cases for tefillin. De-accessioning When it comes to the deaccessioning process of museum objects that a conservator or other museum professional deems beyond repair, these said objects can be disposed of through destruction. They will be destroyed by the curator or his/her designee. When it comes to disposal of Judaica, there are different rules depending on whether the object is deemed still holy or longer holy and whether they are fit for ritual use, or not fit for ritual use. =Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Kedushah)= If collections professionals have artifacts that are holy Jewish objects containing the name of God (tashmishey kedusha) that have been determined to be beyond conservation and the museum no longer wants them in the collection and would otherwise dispose of them, this is, according to halacha, not allowed. Jewish law instructs how these types of objects are to be \\"put away\\" (O.H. 154.3; Mishneh Torah, II 10.3). Traditionally, Ashkenazi Jews fulfill this requirement of \\"putting away\\" a holy object through burial, either in a specific part of a Jewish cemetery or, in some places, next to or along with a man of exceptional piety and learning. Many Sephardic/Mizrachi Jewish communities put these objects instead into a special room in the synagogue, called a geniza (from the root meaning “conceal,” “hide,” or “preserve”). Because this group of objects includes books that are both handwritten and printed, documents, and traditional items, the storage rooms can get quite full. The most famous geniza is in the Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. It held more than 200,000 pages, some dating to the founding of the synagogue in 882. =Non Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Mitzvah)= For the most part, objects that fall under tashmishey mitzvah are discarded when they are no longer fit for ritual use. This is because they have no intrinsic quality of holiness. even though they have value when it comes to Western aesthetics of beauty. One exception to this law is the tallit. The Shulchan Arukh, a medieval law code (first published 1565) and still considered authoritative by traditional Jews, states that tzitzit, the strings that hang from a tallit, are just as holy as the tallit itself and is treated as such.

Mikami was born in Shizuoka, Japan, in 1961, and she stepped into the art scene in the mid-1980s with large-scale art that studied information society and the human body. After moving to the United States in 1991, she studied computer science at the New York Institute of Technology, which lead her art to focus on the interaction between electronics and the human perception. She became a professor in the Department of Information Design at Tama University in 2000. Mikami died from cancer on January 2, 2015. Gravicells Unveiled in 2004, a collaboration between Mikami and the architect Sota Ichikawa resulted in Gravicells, an interactive installation originally housed at the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media (YCAM). The piece serves as a means for encountering the existence of gravity in a manner one could not experience in his or her daily life, and how the world, our bodies, and our perception are all influenced by gravity in complex and almost delicate ways. When the space is encountered by multiple participants, the visual interactions of the projection between them helps the users achieve a sense of each other. This artwork thus functions as almost an external human sensory function, encouraging awareness of ourselves and others in ways not previously approached. In the center of the installation space rests a six-by-six-meter paneled floor; these panels are laced with sensors that can detect your weight, tilt, and velocity. This information is continuously collected and analyzed, and is then translated into deformations in the lines projected on the floor near the visitor. GPS data of the location in which the installation is housed also affects the projected environment and the lines will change according to shifts in the location's gravity. Desire of Codes One of Mikami's most notable works, Desire of Codes, was commissioned by and created at YCAM. Exploring the individual's existence in public and in private, Desire of Codes emphasizes the increasingly less blurred line between the individual as defined by information and the individual as flesh and blood. Housed in a space normally devoted to theatrical performances, this interactive piece consists of three parts: # 90 Wriggling Wall Units: Ninety tentacle-like devices that rotate towards the passerby are placed across a large wall. These devices each have their own camera and microphone, and the data they record is sent to the work's database, and this information is eventually used in part 3. # 6 Multiperspective Search Arms: Six 'search arms' with cameras and projectors hang from the ceiling and follow the movement of the visitors. These arms also record information about the visitors and upload this to the database.

Side view of Tropaeolum majus, a plant with a nectar spur arising from the hypanthium of the flower. A nectar spur is a hollow extension of a part of a flower. The spur may arise from various parts of the flower: the sepals, petals, or hypanthium, and often contain tissues that secrete nectar (nectaries). Nectar spurs are present in many clades across the angiosperms, and are often cited as an example of convergent evolution.  Taxonomic significance  The long tongue of a sphinx moth is depicted as reaching into the equally long-spurred orchid. Spur length can be an important diagnostic character for taxonomy, useful in species identification. For example, Yadon's piperia cannot be easily distinguished from other Piperia (Orchidaceae) save for the unusually short length of its spur.Morgan & Ackerman, Lindleyana 5:205–211 (1990)  Ecology and evolution  The presence of nectar spurs in a clade of plants is associated with evolutionary processes such as coevolution (two-sided evolution) and pollinator shifts (one-sided evolution). Like variations in floral tube length, variation in nectar spur length has been associated with variation in the lengths of organs on the primary pollinators of the plants, whether being the tongues of moths, the proboscis of flies, or the beaks of hummingbirds. This variation in floral shape can restrict access of pollinators to nectar, limiting the range of potential pollinators. In a famous historical story, Darwin predicted that the Angraecum sesquipedale, an orchid with an extremely long spur, must be pollinated by a pollinator with an equally long tongue. The pollinator, the sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta, was found and described 40 years after Darwin made his prediction. Nectar spurs have been cited as prime examples of “key innovations” that may promote diversification, and play a part in the adaptive radiation of clades. Columbines (Aquilegia) have been studied in depth for the link between their floral nectar spurs and their rapid evolutionary radiations. However, there has also been some refutation to this idea recently, suggesting that the adaptive radiation of Aquilegia may have been due more to climate and habit than to the varying lengths of the nectar spurs.  Underlying development and genetics  In terms of development, the varying lengths of nectar spurs has been found to be based solely on the anisotropic elongation of cells. However, it still remains to be understood which genes underlie the elongation of cells to form a spur. Are the same genes being co-opted over and over again across the angiosperms to form spurs, or are there several developmental pathways to make a spur? The genetic basis underlying the development of nectar spurs has been explored in several clades of plant families, such as Linaria and Aquilegia. Studies in model plant Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis identified that type I KNOX SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) genes play a role in the development of spur-like structures. These type I KNOX STM genes also play important roles in the development of the growing tip of the plant, the shoot apical meristem, by controlling cell division and prolonging indeterminate growth. Subsequent gene expression studies confirmed that orthologues of the type I KNOX genes are expressed in the petals of Linaria, a genus of plants with a spur arising from the ventral petal. However, the type I KNOX homologues were not were not differentially expressed during spur development on the petals of Aquilegia, while certain TCP genes instead were suggested to play a role. These results suggest that nectar spurs may represent a case of convergent evolution on the genetic level, where the nectar spur has developed through different developmental pathways.  List of plants with nectar spurs  The following is an incomplete list of plant clades with nectar spurs. * Orchids: Satyrium, Disa, Angraecum, Aerangis, Neofinetia, Piperia * On petals: Aquilegia, Lentibulariaceae, Viola, Fumarioideae * On sepals: Delphinium, Impatiens * From hypanthium: Tropaeolum  References  Plant morphology ","title":"Nectar spur"},{"id":"53654639","text":"Grant McCasland (born October 14, 1976) is an American college basketball coach, currently head coach for North Texas of Conference USA.

He previously served as president of Major League Soccer club San Jose Earthquakes and founded the Golden Baseball League.  Early life and education  Kaval was born on October 28, 1975, to Jim and Paula Kaval. Jim, a member of the Peace Corps and real estate entrepreneur, and Paula, a realtor and school teacher, raised Kaval in Cleveland, Ohio. Kaval attended Stanford University and received a Bachelor of Arts in international relations in 1998.  Career  = Early career and the Golden Baseball League = Following Stanford graduation, on June 20, 1998, Kaval and a former classmate began their trip to visit all 30 Major League Baseball ballparks in 38 days. The trip ultimately led to the publication of The Summer that Saved Baseball which chronicled their journey. Kaval founded the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL) in 2003. Memorable GBL alumni include Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco, Daniel Nava, Jose Lima, and Mark Prior. Kaval has also spent time in the Office of the President of the United States in Washington, D.C., where he worked on the National Security budget as part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). = San Jose Earthquakes = Kaval previously served as the president of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. He oversaw the business and soccer sides of the franchise and represented the club on the Major League Soccer Board of Governors. He continues to serve as a Board Member of the San Jose Earthquakes. During his time with the Earthquakes, the team won the 2012 Supporters’ Shield, which is awarded to the MLS team with the best regular season record. His success with the team culminated in the opening of Avaya Stadium (now Earthquakes Stadium) - the Quakes’ $100M privately financed soccer stadium - on March 22, 2015. Kaval developed the innovative $20M naming rights partnership with Avaya, which helped create the first cloud-enabled stadium. Since opening its gates, Avaya Stadium has held numerous events including the 2016 MLS All-Star Game and World Cup Qualifiers. The 18,000-seat venue also houses the largest outdoor bar in North America. = Oakland Athletics = On November 17, 2016, David Kaval was named the seventh president in Oakland Athletics history. As one of the most dynamic leaders currently in sports, Kaval has led a complete transformation of the organization. He has repositioned the internal and external perception of the Club and has driven a number of innovative initiatives to propel the business forward. As President of the Athletics, one of Kaval's first moves was to aggressively increase the amount of marketing the Athletics were doing, particularly in San Francisco. Kaval also announced office hours due to his beliefs in community involvement in sports. He also is committed to upgrades to their home stadium, the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum., including the addition of a number of club and premium seating areas, renovating Shibe Park Tavern, and introducing three new fan areas: Championship Plaza, The Treehouse and the A's Stomping Ground. Kaval is also leading the Club's efforts to build a new ballpark in Oakland, highlighted by the launch of their Rooted In Oakland campaign. On November 28, 2018, the Athletics announced the team's desire to build its privately financed 34,000-seat ballpark at the Howard Terminal site at the Port of Oakland. The Athletics also have plans to redevelop the Coliseum site.  Ballpark at Howard Terminal  Kaval is leading the Club's efforts to open a new ballpark in Oakland. On Nov. 28, 2018, the organization announced its desire to build its privately financed, 34,000-capacity waterfront ballpark at the Howard Terminal site at the Port of Oakland. The ballpark design is led by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), Copenhagen, New York, and London based groups of architects and designers. BIG's architecture emerges from a careful analysis of how contemporary life constantly evolves and changes and creates architecture by mixing conventional ingredients such as living, leisure, working, parking, and shopping. The ballpark is designed to be the most intimate in Major League Baseball, and it will feature an elevated park that wraps and frames the bowl, and it will anchor a new, vibrant waterfront district in Jack London Square that features a mix of housing, including affordable housing, offices, restaurants, retail, parks, and public gathering spaces. The A's and the Port of Oakland Board of Commissioners entered into an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement in April 2018. On May 13, 2019, the board commissioners voted 7–0 to approve and authorize the Executive Director to execute the initial term sheet. Kaval has worked collaboratively with State officials to develop and pass legislation related to the waterfront ballpark project. Since 2018, Kaval has worked closely with legislators to craft and support AB 734 (2018), which provides expedited judicial review in exchange for the highest environmental standards of any ballpark project; AB 1191 (2019), to simplify the regulatory approval process for the ballpark, as well as housing, retail, and mixed-use development at the waterfront site; and SB 293 (2019), which helps the City of Oakland finance infrastructure and transportation projects for a new ballpark.  Community Engagement  Kaval has made it a priority to engage the community to ensure the ballpark project is bigger than baseball. The A's have hosted hundreds of community meetings and workshops since 2018, giving residents a voice to share their perspectives and insights on how the ballpark can benefit and provide opportunities in Oakland. In addition to community engagement meetings, Kaval has implemented a number of initiatives to connect with fans and community stakeholders, including hosting weekly office hours, participating in town hall meetings, posting blog and Facebook Live updates, and communicating via Twitter and Instagram at @DaveKaval. He is also leading the A's plans to redevelop the current Coliseum site. Preliminary plans include a large park surrounded by substantial new housing, including affordable housing, a skills center, community gathering spaces, office and retail space, and restaurants. The A's and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors entered into an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement in April 2018. On April 23, 2019, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 to approve the term sheet for the possible purchase by the A's of the County's 50% interest in the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Complex for $85 million.  Coliseum Experience Improvements  In his three seasons as president, Kaval has enhanced the fan experience by making upgrades to the Oakland Coliseum, introduced a forward thinking season ticket program called “A’s Access,” hosted MLB's first completely free game, and the largest game in Oakland Coliseum history when 56,310 fans attended the game versus the San Francisco Giants on July 21, 2018. In addition to delivering the best baseball experience for the Club's fans, Kaval is committed to increasing the organization's community impact. In 2018, the Club donated more than $2.6M back to the community, distributed more than 100,000 game tickets free of charge to fans, and engaged more than 35,000 students in education initiatives, and provided 10,000 youth baseball and softball players opportunities to play the game.  Personal life  Kaval is married to Maria Fredricsson, whom he met his first day at Stanford. Kaval is a resident of Menlo Park, California, where the couple have raised their two daughters. He serves on a number of boards, including the Bay Area Council and Rocketship Education, in addition to the National Governing Board of the Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA) and the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO). He is also a lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) where he teaches sports management.

Smith, Susan C. Mills, Margaret Hamilton, Mary E. Smith, and Lovisa Tyson. Margaret Hamilton (1840–1922) was a Union nurse during the American Civil War. Early life Hamilton was born October 19, 1840 in Rochester, New York. She was the only child of Cornelius and Mary (née Sheehan) Mahoney. Cornelius was the son of Dennis Mahoney and his wife, MargaretHowe et al. 1904, p301-303 Hamilton was quite close to both of her parents until her mother's death in 1857. She was educated at the public schools and St. Joseph's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. At the seminary, she joined Sisters of Charity, even though her father did not approve. Religious life In 1860, Hamilton entered an orphan asylum in Albany, New York, aspiring to be a sister. She experienced a three-month probation period, after which she was sent to the Mother House in Emmitsburg, Maryland for instruction. After six months, Hamilton was given the habit of the Order, and sent her to an orphanage in Albany to teach.  Civil War service  In spring of 1862, Hamilton and three other religious sisters received an order from the Mother House to go to the Satterlee United States Military Hospital in West Philadelphia. Hamilton arrived for service in early May; the hospital at the time was newly established and poorly supplied. Only a few days after she began her service, Hamilton witnessed the consequences of so few resources as hundreds of soldiers arrived from the various battles around the Chickahominy River. Due to the lack of personnel and resources, Hamilton was constantly overworked until her own health began to fail; the battle of Gettysburg specifically placed a strain on the hospital capacities. Among her other services at the hospital, Hamilton volunteered to nurse in the isolated smallpox ward. One instance specifically stands out in Hamilton's service. The hospital received many people injured at the battle of the Wilderness, and this included a young woman soldier. Disguised as a man, the soldier's sex was only discovered upon admittance to the hospital for treatment. It was said she followed a lover into battle, and exhibited incredible bravery; she had even reached the rank of lieutenant.  After the war  Hamilton left the service due to her own poor health in November 1864. Upon leaving the service, Hamilton also left the Sisters of Charity. She married a soldier of the 19th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Charles Roberts Hamilton, in November 1864, and the two had eight children together. Charles Roberts Hamilton was the youngest of thirteen children born to Daniel and Esther (Roberts) Hamilton of Belfast, Maine and later Swanville, Maine. Charles died April 9, 1900. Hamilton ultimately left the Catholic Church and became a Baptist. She was elected chaplain of the H. M. Warren Relief Corps of Wakefield, Massachusetts for several years. In 1897 she was chosen secretary of the Massachusetts Army Nurse Association upon its formation.Woman's Relief Corps, p68 She was president of the National Army Nurse Association, elected at the 1902 national meeting.

K2a is a primary subclade of haplogroup K2 (M526), which in turn is a primary descendant of haplogroup K (M9). Its sole primary descendant is haplogroup K-M2313 (M2313, Z4858 S11799).Genetic Homeland, 2018, DNA Marker Index Chromosome Y M2313 (6 March 2018). As of 2020, K-M2313 is known to have two primary subclades: Haplogroup NO (M214/Page39/PAGES00039), which has numerous members and the extremely rare K-Y28299. Basal, undivergent K2a* (K-M2308*) has been found only in the remains of two Upper Paleolithic individuals, known as \\"Ust'-Ishim man and \\"Oase-1\\", who lived in Siberia and the Banat region of south-central Europe, respectively, about 37–45 ky BP. No examples of K-M2313* or NO* (NO-M214*) have been identified in living males or remains. However, subclades of NO-M214 include a majority of living males in East Asia, Northern Eurasia and South East Asia. K-Y28299 has been found in three living individuals from India. Another two other living males, who have been documented as belonging to K-M2313(xM214), have not been tested for Y28299 (and therefore may belong to K-Y28299 ). These K-M2313(xM214) individuals have ethnic ties to South Asia and South East Asia respectively: a Telugu from India and an ethnic Malay from Singapore.  Discoveries since 2016  Before 2016, many authorities considered that the SNP M2308 was always found in conjunction with SNPs such as M2313 and M214. However, researchers such as G. David Poznik discovered examples of Y-DNA that had some, but not all, of the SNPs peculiar to NO (M214), but also lacked SNPs identifying other primary subclades of K2 (M526). Poznik et al. 2016 therefore identified K2a (M2308), K-M2313 and NO (M214) as \\"parent\\", \\"child\\" and \\"grandchild\\" clades respectively. (While Poznik used the name \\"K2a1\\" for K-M2313, this has not been widely adopted – possibly because K2a1 has sometimes been used as an alternate name for other, less closely related haplogroups.) Poznik et al. also found that K-Y28301 – which has living members in India – is descended from K-M2313. The above findings by Poznik et al. were reiterated by the work of Moreno-Mayar et al. in 2018.Moreno-Mayar JV, Vinner L, de Barros Damgaard P, de la Fuente C, Chan J, Spence JP, Allentoft ME, Vimala T, Racimo F, Pinotti T, Rasmussen S, Margaryan A, Iraeta Orbegozo M, Mylopotamitaki D, Wooller M, Bataille C, Becerra-Valdivia L, Chivall D, Comeskey D, Devièse T, Grayson DK, George L, Harry H, Alexandersen V, Primeau C, Erlandson J, Rodrigues-Carvalho C, Reis S, Bastos MQR, Cybulski J, Vullo C, Morello F, Vilar M, Wells S, Gregersen K, Hansen KL, Lynnerup N, Mirazón Lahr M, Kjær K, Strauss A, Alfonso-Durruty M, Salas A, Schroeder H, Higham T, Malhi RS, Rasic JT, Souza L, Santos FR, Malaspinas AS, Sikora M, Nielsen R, Song YS, Meltzer DJ, Willerslev E., \\"Early human dispersals within the Americas\\", Science, 2018 vol. 362, no. 6419 (December 7). As of 2018, authorities like the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) and YFull (Y-Chromosome Sequence Interpretation Service) have not integrated the discoveries of Poznik et al., and differ from each other in nomenclature. * ISOGG has continued to use the names \\"K2a\\" and \\"NO\\" in reference to an undifferentiated clade combining K2a (M2308) and K-M2313 (i.e. Poznik's K2a and \\"K2a1\\"),ISOGG, Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2018 (17 January 2018). while referring to NO-M214 as \\"NO1\\". * YFull does not distinguish between K-M2308 (K2a) and K-M2313, referring to both as \\"K-M2335\\".YFull YTree v5.08, 2017, \\"K-M2335\\" (9 December 2017) There is evidence of at least two additional primary branches within K-M2308 (Poznik: K2a) and/or K-M2313 (Poznik: K2a1). * YFull alone lists a clade, known only as K-Y28299, branching from an undifferentiated K-M2308/K-M2313 (YFull name: K-M2335). In addition, a newer, more divergent subclade named K-Y28301 is a primary branch of K-Y28299, according to YFull. Furthermore, according to both Poznik and Moreno-Mayar, K-Y28301 is also descended from K-M2313, suggesting the following lineage: K-M2313 > K-Y28299 > K-Y28301. Three living individuals in India have been found to carry K-Y28299* or K-Y28301. (As of 2018, ISOGG had not incorporated K-Y28299 or K-Y28301.) * ISOGG alone lists a haplogroup known only as \\"NO1~\\" identified by the SNP CTS707/M2306, as a sibling of NO-M214. (Under the taxonomic conventions used by ISOGG, a tilde [~] indicates a distinct haplogroup, the position of which in the phylogeny is as yet unclear.) NO1~ is likely a primary branch of either K-M2313 or NO-M214, because, as of 2018, YFull regards CTS707/M2306 as synonymous with M214/PAGE39/PAGES00039, and yet NO1~ is also not (according to ISOGG) ancestral to either Haplogroup N (M231) or Haplogroup O (M175).

Accurate information about Nettles is sparse but he is best remembered for his recording session in 1935 which was conducted during an era when the output of blues music drastically declined. Nettles was active around a train station in Rockport, Mississippi, a small town 20 miles southeast of Crystal Springs, when he was discovered by talent scout H.C. Speir. Although local residents could not recall Nettles when queried in the 1960s, he surely hailed from a community close to Rockport, according to blues historian Gayle Dean Wardlow, and appealed to listeners by tap dancing barefoot as he played. In October 1935, Nettles participated at a recording session located in the second floor of a building near Speir's Farish Street Music Store. Robert Wilkins and Will Shade also performed during the same studio session, all supervised Speir, Art Satherly, and W. R. Calloway. Nettles recorded as \\"The Mississippi Moaner\\", an alias most likely bestowed upon him by Satherly. Four songs resulted from the session but only two, \\"Mississippi Moan\\" and \\"It's Cold in China Blues\\", were distributed on Vocalion Records; Blind Lemon Jefferson's influence on the songs were highly apparent to writer Paul Oliver. \\"Unfortunately\\", wrote Wardlow, Nettles never recorded again but his \\"forceful brand of dance music\\" was a highlight of an era that saw blues recordings significantly decline.

History During British period, it was one of the most important seats of the Vala Kathis of the Jetpur house and was one of their earliest settlements. Originally a Sarvaiya holding, a pal or blackmail payment from it was acquired by the Selarka Kathis of Mendarda. The great seat of the present Jetpur Kathi house was then at Devlia about ten miles north-west of Chital and about five miles east of Vasavad. Najo Vala of Devlia pursued some Selarkas of Chital who had driven off his cattle, and was slain in the pursuit near the village of Sultanpur now under Gondal. The sons of Najo namely Viro and Jaito continued the feud and finally the Selarkas relinquished to them the pal over Chital, and a reconciliation was effected. The Selarkas then retired to Mendarda and the Devlia Valas removed their capital to Chital of which place they speedily became sole masters reducing the Sarvaiyas to a subordinate position. There were even now Sarvaiya Mulgrasias in Chital. Viro and Jaito founded the two principal branches of the Jetpur house now known as Viraui and Jaitani which will be treated of under Jetpur. Jaito had a son Bhoko whose son Jaito was very famous. The following duho (couplet) is said concerning him: Chital became a prosperous town under the rule of the Kathis who in 1803 made, together with the Kundla Kathis, the first overtures to the British Government. The Kathis of Chital became so powerful that the Nawab of Junagadh ceded to them Jetpur, Mendarda, and Bilkha. The reason for these cessions was probably as follows. By their establishment at Mendarda they restrained the Selarkas and Harsurka Kathis who were frequently troublesome. At Bilkha they controlled the Khants, Maiyds, and other tribes, while at Jetpur they defended the line of the Bhadar from any foreign foe. Chital was taken by Thakor Vakhatsingbji of Bhavnagar State in his warfare with the Kathis in A.D. 1793, but was restored to them. The Vanias who left Chital on this occasion did not return to it. They are still called Chitalia Vanias. Demographics The population of Chital according to the census of 1872 was 3908 and according to that of 1881 3959 souls.

Developed from an Italian design, the ship was capable of a wide range of roles, with depth charges to defeat submarines, torpedo tubes to attack ships and anti-aircraft guns for aerial defence, as well as mine laying capability. After serving during World War II, the ship was updated with greater anti-submarine capability and reclassified a frigate in 1953. Decommissioned on 1 July 1970, Mode subsequently operated in a training role until being scrapped in 1978. Design and development Mode was the first ordered of a class of four Swedish destroyers based on the design the Spica class designed in Italy. Small and ideal for coastal operation, the design was a cheaper alternative to traditional designs to meet the requirements of the rapidly expanding Swedish Navy. The vessel was named after the son of Thor. Displacememt was standard and full load. Overall length was , beam and draught . A crew of 100 officers and ratings was carried. Machinery consisted of two Penhoët A oil-fired boilers, which supplied steam to two de Laval geared steam turbines, each driving its own propeller. The turbines were rated at to give a design speed of . of fuel was carried to give a range of at . The main armament consisted of three K/50 M42 guns produced by Bofors. These were placed in separate mounts, one on the fore deck, one on the aft deck and one on the aft superstructure. Air defence consisted two K/60 M36 and two K/66 M40 individually mounted anti-aircraft autocannons, also provided by Bofors. Three torpedo tubes for torpedoes were triple mounted aft of the superstructure and two depth charge throwers were mounted further towards the stern. 42 mines could also be carried for minelaying. Construction and service Mode was laid down by Götaverken in Gothenburg in September 1941. The vessel was launched on 11 April 1942, delivered to the Navy on 8 October the same year and commissioned on 12 November, serving with the Coastal Fleet through World War II. The ship was allocated the pennant number 29. In 1947 Mode accompanied and on a trip to France and Britain. The fleet visited Le Havre, Lyme Bay, Torquay, Glasgow and Oban. Mode in 1959 after conversion =Modernisation= Mode was modernised in 1953 and re-rated as a frigate. One of the main guns was removed, along with the triple torpedo tubes. Instead a single Squid depth charge launcher was fitted to improve anti-submarine capabilities and the guns were upgraded to provide greater anti-aircraft protection. After the conversion, Mode retained minelaying capability.

In 1953, the vessel was upgraded with enhanced anti-submarine armament, being re-rated a frigate. After twenty-five years service, the ship was decommissioned on 6 December 1968 and sold for scrap the following year. Design Munin was a Swedish destroyer based on the Spica class designed in Italy. Small and ideal for coastal operation, the design was a cheaper alternative to traditional designs to meet the requirements of the rapidly expanding Swedish Navy. The class was named after things related to Thor beginning with the letter M, Munin being one of his ravens. Displacement was standard and full load. Overall length was , beam and draught . A crew of 100 officers and ratings was carried. Machinery consisted of two Penhoët A oil-fired boilers, which supplied steam to two de Laval geared steam turbines, each driving its own propeller. The turbines were rated at to give a design speed of . of fuel was carried to give a range of at . The main armament consisted of three K/50 M42 guns produced by Bofors. These were placed in separate mounts, one on the fore deck, one on the aft deck and one on the aft superstructure. Air defence consisted two K/60 M36 and two K/66 M40 individually mounted anti-aircraft autocannons, also provided by Bofors. Three torpedo tubes for torpedoes were triple mounted aft of the superstructure and two depth charge throwers were mounted further towards the stern. 42 mines could also be carried for minelaying. Service Munin was laid down by Öresundsvarvet in Landskrona in September 1941, the only member of the class to be constructed at the yard. Launched on 27 May 1942, the vessel was commissioned on 3 January the following year and delivered to the Navy five days later, serving with the Coastal Fleet through World War II. The ship was allocated the pennant number 31. After the War, Munin took part in two goodwill tours to other European nations. In 1946, the vessel accompanied the cruiser and destroyer on a tour of Bergen and Fannefjord in Norway, Dublin in Ireland and Antwerp in Belgium. The following year, the ship accompanied the cruiser and lead ship of the class on a trip to France and the United Kingdom. The fleet visited Le Havre, Lyme Bay, Torquay, Glasgow and Oban. Munin after conversion Modernisation Munin was modernised in 1953 and re- rated as a frigate. One of the main guns was removed, along with the triple torpedo tubes. Instead a single Squid depth charge launcher was fitted to improve anti-submarine capabilities and the guns were upgraded to provide greater anti-aircraft protection. After the conversion, Munin retained minelaying capability. The upgraded ship was allocated the pennant number 75.

He commanded a 70-gun ship of the line during the War of the Spanish Succession and being set upon by a superior French force, showed great courage in ensuring that his ship did not fall into enemy hands. Early life Mordaunt was born in about 1682, the youngest son of Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough and his first wife Carey Fraser, daughter of Sir Alexander Fraser, 1st Baronet, of Dores, Inverness. By 1691 he had a role in the Queen’s household which he held to 1694. In 1695, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy.MORDAUNT, Hon. Henry (c.1682-1710), Published in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1690-1715, ed. D. Hayton, E. Cruickshanks, S. Handley, 2002] Career Mordaunt was promoted to commander in April 1703. Through the influence of Lord Wharton, he was elected as Whig member for Malmesbury at the 1705 English general election. He was not active in Parliament, due to his frequent absences at sea but was able to support the Court with regard to the 'place clause' in the regency bill on 18 February1706. In 1706 he was promoted to captain and was given command of , a 70-gun third-rate ship of the line. At the time Britain was at war with France. He was commanding a small squadron of frigates to convoy his father from Spain to Genoa when off the coast of Italy on 19 March 1707 Resolution encountered six French vessels, each ranging between 58 and 80 guns. There followed an extended engagement, during which Resolution was badly damaged by French cannon fire. Mordaunt ordered the crew to run the ship aground rather than risk her capture by the French; this was achieved and she was subsequently set on fire to prevent her being refloated. The French maintained a continual gunfire on the burning wreck, and Mordaunt was struck in the thigh by a cannonball as he left the vessel. His father reached his destination and returned to England, and was able to obtain a pass for his son to travel home through France. Mordaunt survived the wound but was left unable to walk, and was forced to retire from the Navy. Mordaunt returned to England in late 1707 and settled in the town of Bath. He was returned again as MP for Malmesbury at the 1708 British general election. He had to attend a court martial in November 1709 for the loss of his ship, but was acquitted of any charges and declared to have shown great courage. He intended to go to sea again but contracted smallpox. Death and legacy Mordaunt died unmarried of smallpox at Bath on 24 February 1710 and was buried in the family vault at Turvey, Bedfordshire.

The platform's primary focus is on the teaching of samatha meditation but is also involved in other activities and events related to mindfulness and peace- building. Although the platform has a secular orientation, it does draw on principles of Buddhism. Buddhist monks from Thailand are often invited to lead meditation and mindfulness activities. The idea the platform is built on is that sustainable world peace can only be established by first achieving mindfulness, or \\"inner peace\\", at the individual level; after which peace can be achieved at the community level and greater. This is expressed through Peace Revolution's slogan Peace In, Peace Out (PIPO). Peace Revolution offers a number of offline and online activities and programs to facilitate this goal.  History  Peace Revolution was established in 2008 by the World Peace Initiative Foundation, a non-profit organization which operates mainly from Thailand. The initial idea for the creation of the website was that with current developments in modern education, the focus on mental well-being had become less important. With a growing availability of Internet connections throughout the world, meditation could be easily introduced in this way. The platform is known for introducing meditation as a secular hobby for people in regions where meditation is not widely known. The World Peace Initiative and Peace Revolution have partnerships with several organizations internationally, including the European Commission. the platform had 87,521 participants, from 235 countries and territories and had organized 104 events worldwide. Peace Revolution's operations are maintained by a worldwide network connected through their website.  Activities  Presentation being given during the European Peace Summit 2016 = Online meditation program = Peace Revolution runs a forty-two-day online self-development program based on its \\"Peace In, Peace Out\\" philosophy, which focuses on meditation, daily self-discipline to deepen meditation experiences, and other activities for self-reflection. Subject matter discussed include incorporating meditation into one's daily life, the relation between body and mind, the training of habits, karma, a culture of peace and conflict resolution. Meditation, referred to as Inner Peace Time on the platform, makes up the central theme of Peace Revolution's activities. The meditation technique used on the platform is Dhammakaya meditation. Several online meditation resources are available on the Peace Revolution website, including a written walk-through on meditation and guided meditations in various languages. Optional offline components of the program include special assignments which the participants complete in their own surroundings, called Special Ops. Such activities include inviting others to meditate, and collaborative art or community service projects with the theme of inner peace. = Other activities = Participants meditating at a Peace Revolution Peace on Demand event in IranPeace Revolution offers numerous fellowships hosted around the world. Peace Revolution Fellowships typically range from three to fourteen days and include a meditation retreat. The platform is also active in various Peace Summits across the world, often in partnership with local organizations. Summits typically last four days and feature numerous guest speakers from the World Peace Initiative Foundation, as well as speakers from different like-minded organizations from the region. The topics typically discussed in the peace summits include peace-building, specific issues related to the region, and the benefits of meditation in these peace-building processes. leftIn addition to these summits, Peace Revolution also sponsors events for participants who wish to organize their own meditation events and workshops in their local areas, providing meditation instructors and assisting participants in organizing their events. Instructors provided include Buddhist monks and certified meditation instructors of different backgrounds. Such events are referred to as Peace on Demand events (also called a event). Peace Revolution's first Peace on Demand event was held in Egypt in 2010 during the International Day of Peace. In the following years, numerous local events have been organized worldwide, with events being held in forty-six different countries Peace Revolution sponsored events have been held in various settings, such as for companies to provide training for its employees, and in universities, schools and prisons.  Notable events  Some events that Peace Revolution has sponsored or helped coordinate are meditation workshops in refugee camps for African children and a broadcast on Albanian national television. Other examples are a vigil in Muea-Buea, Cameroon, to commemorate victims after a bombing of the Boko Haram in 2015, and guided meditation that took place during a film festival emphasizing human rights in Barcelona. Peace Revolution volunteers have also organized peace walks to promote their message. From 2018 onward, a yearly meditation week was organized in Argentina, in which guided meditations were organized in public spaces, educational institutions, hospitals, companies and prisons. This was done in cooperation with the New Future Society, based in the USA and Argentina. Branded as the \\"#MEME Marathon de la Calma\\" ('Marathon of Calm'), the event is organized in cooperation with government officials from the province and municipalities.  Structure  Although Peace Revolution and its programs are run by full-time employees based at its headquarters, the organization relies heavily on a large network of volunteers worldwide to organize its programs and events. Online members are referred to as \\"Peace Rebels\\", which according to the website, is because every revolution is made up of rebels and the participants make up the Peace Revolution. Participants are connected through the website's online networking platform, the Rebel Hub, where Peace Rebels can communicate and plan mindfulness-based projects and ideas, and an online forum where they can discuss their meditation experiences. Questions about meditation are answered online by \\"Peace Coaches\\". Active members who meet certain requirements can undergo training to become certified meditation instructors, known as \\"Peace Architects\\".

It stars John Abraham, Mouni Roy, Jackie Shroff and Sikandar Kher. Initially, Sushant Singh Rajput was to star in the film as the protagonist but opted out of it due to his prior commitments. The narrative centers around a banker who is recruited as a spy for an undercover operation in Pakistan, where he faces both physical and emotional challenges. The film was theatrically released on 5 April 2019. Plot In November 1971 at ISI detention cell, Karachi, a man is being given a 3rd degree torture. The movie then goes 9 months back. In 1971, Shrikant Rai, the Chief of the RAW recruits Rehamatullah Ali a.k.a. Romeo, a banker, after he manages to foil a bank robbery staged by the RAW agents to test his skills for espionage in Pakistan. After training in combat and covert communication techniques, he departs to Pakistan. In Pakistan, he becomes Akbar Malik and in his operations is helped by Joker and Mudassar, Pakistani locals helping RAW. Planned circumstances bring him closer to the target Isaq Afridi (Anil George), whose trust in him strengthens when Akbar not only assures him of his hatred towards India but also saves him from an attack conducted by the henchmen of Nawab Afridi. Akbar informs RAW about a planned attack on Badlipur that would claim innocent lives, both in India and East Pakistan. However, relations between Afridi and Akbar also intensify, due to which he refuses to betray him when Nawab approaches him with an offer to work for him. However, while leaving the rendezvous, Nawab forgets an envelope and asks Akbar to deliver it to the described room number. He is surprised to find his girlfriend Shraddha Sharma there and exclaims \\"You?\\" in disbelief. She gestures him to keep quiet and opens up a telephone receiver to show a spy transmitter inside it, proving that her room was bugged. She reveals that she too was working for the RAW and was sent there because Akbar wanted someone close to be sent for him. In the meanwhile, Colonel Khan's suspicion grows on Akbar, whom he arrests, interrogates and tortures when he isn't able to extract any information. He is forced to free due to Akbar being Afridi's right hand. However, Akbar's cover soon gets blown, resulting in a chase between him and the colonel. Akbar manages to escape and arrives at home to find Mudassar telling him to escape. Akbar explains that there's no way to escape, due to which Mudassar agrees and goes to prepare tea for him. While waiting, Akbar suspects someone's presence. Hearing a gun clock, he takes out the gun given to him by Mudassar for emergencies, and shoots the person, only to realise it was no one else but Mudassar. Weeping but also remembering the latter's words warning him not to get entangled in relations, he escapes from the scene and the next day, disguised as an army captain, contacts Shrikant for help. The latter declines, telling him that he's not acting like an Indian any more. In the meanwhile, Shraddha and some other RAW agents are arrested while Joker commits suicide. Akbar then meets the army officer who interrogated him and his senior, revealing the truth. He decides to conduct the attacks on Badlipur himself as a form of revenge on the RAW. Accompanied by colonel Khan to avoid any sort of double-crossing, Akbar shocks him by bombing the entire village in a series of explosions, thus confirming his loyalty to Pakistan. As a result, the Indo-Pakistani War breaks out. Akbar, now a Pakistani officer called Walter Khan, meets Shrikant and Awasthi in Nepal after 10 years. He departs after exchanging a few words and congratulating Awasthi for his impending promotion, leaving the latter surprised. Shrikant then reveals that Walter's still working undercover for India and how the latter's siding with Pakistan was all part of the plan. The bombing didn't cause any deaths as the villagers, warned about bad weather conditions, were moved out 24 hours before it took place. Shrikant also reveals Walter's loyalty towards work was the only reason he couldn't turn up even at his mother's funeral. The film ends with a shot of Walter saluting the Indian flag with tears in his eyes. Cast *John Abraham as Rehamatullah Ali a.k.a.

It is a former princely state. Demographics In 1872, the population had reached 1900 souls, but that number decreased to 1701 in 1881, owing to the ravages of the famine of 1878–79. Geography and etymology The Kalubhar River, which rises in a kund or reservoir near Babra, used to formerly flow about two miles within Vala frontier. But it changed its course in late 19th century, and started flowing close to Chogath. The village derives its name from four small hills nearly adjoining it, called the Khodiar, Modlio, Bhutio and Dangardi. Places of interest There is a shrine of Khodiyarmata on the Khodiar hill, the image in which is said to have been installed by the Gohil chieftains of Umrala. Two hills, called respectively the Thapnath and the Isavo, lie to the eastward of Chogath. On the Thapnath hill is a temple of the Thapnath Mahadev, which enjoyed an endowment made by Thakor Sarangji of Umrala. The celebrated sage, Dhundhali Mai, whose curse is said to have caused the destruction of Vala, the ancient Valabhipur, resided in a hut on the Isalvo hill. Chogath is a flourishing village, and bears wheat crops of excellent quality which is raised by irrigation. The village is no doubt an ancient one, and was very near Vallabhipur, and though no architectural remains are now existent, large bricks, such as those found at Valabhi, are constantly dug up. There is an old paliya or memorial stone here, the inscription on which is illegible, but the date, Samvat 1516 (1460 AD), is plain enough. Economy Excellent building stone is quarried from the hills lying to the north of the village.

For a time she was the mistress of Napoleon III, but had several other lovers. In 1870 she returned to Belgium where she was a prima donna at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie until her retirement from the stage in 1884. Her last years in Brussels found her almost destitute. In a fit of despair she committed suicide at the age of 76. Life and career Hamaekers was born in Louvain, Belgium, one of the ten daughters of Guillaume and Anne-Catherine (née Vanderwalen) Hamaekers. Her father was an inn-keeper and a veteran of the Battle of Austerlitz. She initially studied singing in Louvain with Mme. Mathieu-Marin and then at the Brussels Conservatory, making her first concert appearance in 1855. On the encouragement of Eugène Scribe, she went to Paris accompanied by one of her sisters for further study with Gilbert Duprez and later François Delsarte. While still studying she came to the attention of the Duke of Morny who provided her with a handsome carriage and a sable cloak amongst other gifts. The duke, who was the half-brother of Napoleon III, used his influence to get her hired by the Paris Opéra where she made her debut on 12 September 1856 as Mathilde in Rossini's Guillaume Tell. Through Morny she was also engaged as a singer for the chapel of the Tuileries Palace and was a soloist at the baptismal mass of Napoleon III's son Louis- Napoléon.Hale, Philip (1908). \\"Entr'acte, Views of Opera Land\\".

Hamaekers as Bénoni in La reine de Saba She was described in contemporary accounts as not being a great singer but having a pretty and agile coloratura voice with clear and brilliant high notes and a facility with trills equal to that of Adelina Patti. She was also known for having a very attractive stage presence and made a specialty of appearing in a variety of en travesti roles which allowed her to show off her legs. Amongst those were Urbain, the Queen's page in Les Huguenots and the young student Bénoni which she sang in the world premiere of Gounod's La reine de Saba. During the course of her 15 years at the Opéra she appeared in a variety of other operas, including Robert le diable, La Juive, Le Prophète, Le comte Ory, and Les Vêpres siciliennes.Harry, Gérard (25 October 1912). \\"La fin d'une étoile\\". Le Figaro, p. 3 She was the intimate of the composers Rossini, Meyerbeer and especially Auber, whose pet name for her was \\"Didine\\". She attracted a string of lovers who provided her with considerable wealth, the most prominent of which was Napoleon III who gave her an emerald and diamond necklace. At the height of her career, she had a house in Paris, a chateau at Fontainebleau, and spent her summers renting the country-seat of the president of the Jockey-Club de Paris or the Marquis du Hallez's chateau. However, much of her fortune was dissipated by one of her last Parisian lovers who was addicted to gambling. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 she left France, gave concert tours and was then engaged as a highly paid prima donna at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie. Amongst her roles there was Venus in the theatre's first performance of Wagner's Tannhäuser. Later years Hamaekers retired from the stage in 1884, but kept up a lively correspondence with the literary critic and historian Frédéric Loliée, sharing her reminiscences of Parisian social and musical life during the Second French Empire. She gave singing lessons for a while but became increasingly destitute in her old age. In October 1912, at the age of 76 and in a fit of despair, she threw herself from the window of her apartment in Brussels. She did not immediately die from her injuries and was taken to the St. Jean Hospital, where she was placed in the care of a psychiatrist. On 24 October she smashed a drinking glass that had been left in her hospital room and used it to slit her own throat. She died at 3 o'clock that afternoon.

It was also referred to as or . Description Kunohe Castle was a hirayama- style castle built on a river terrace overlooking a junction between the Mabechi River, Shiratori River and a small branch of the Shiratori River, which formed part of its natural defences to the north, west and east. The site covers an area of 340,000 square meters, making it one of the largest castle ruins in the Tōhoku region. As with similar contemporary castles (such as Ne Castle), the fortifications at Kunohe consisted of a number of dry moats, creating a number of enclosures, each with its own earthen ramparts: the main bailey, second bailey, and there smaller baileys (Matsunomaru, Ishizawadate, and Wakasadate). The entrance to the south was protected by a wide dry moat, and the area of the enclosures was over 500 square meters. History The date of the castle’s foundation is unknown. The Nanbu clan was originally a branch of the Takeda clan from Kai Province and was awarded estates in the far northern Tōhoku region during the Kamakura period, but actively began controlling the area after the start of the Muromachi period. The Kunohe clan was a branch of the main Nanbu clan, and extensively rebuilt pre-existing fortifications around 1492-1501 AD. Following a succession dispute in 1590, Kunohe Masazane rose in rebellion against the Nanbu Nobunao, chieftain of the main Nanbu clan, who had the backing of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In the Kunohe Rebellion of 1591, the greatly outnumbered defenders of the castle surrendered to an army led by Gamō Ujisato; however, the peace terms were a ruse, and after surrendering the defenders were all massacred in the second bailey of the castle. The castle was initially rebuilt by Gamō Ujizane; however, Nanbu Naonobu chose to make Sannohe Castle his seat in 1597 and by 1636 the castle was allowed to fall into ruins. On June 7, 1935 the ruins were proclaimed a National Historic Site by the Japanese government. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

The demonstrations occurred in response to a constitutional amendment that would permit President Horacio Cartes to run for re-election, a move described by the opposition as \\"a coup\\". One protester was killed in Paraguay's capital, Asunción, after being hit by a shotgun blast by police. Several protesters, politicians and journalists, as well as police, were reported injured, including one lower-house deputy who had to undergo surgery after being injured by rubber bullets. On 17 April, President Cartes announced that he was resigning from any possible candidacy for a second presidential term. On 26 April, the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay rejected the proposed constitutional amendment for presidential re- election. Background The 1992 Constitution limits the President of Paraguay to a single five-year term in office with no possibility of re- election, even if it is nonsuccessive. The proposed amendment would have allowed those previously elected as president to run again for re-election. A previous vote on the measure was rejected in August 2016. The norms of the Congress established that the subject could not be treated again until after a year. However, in the last week of March, the ruling legislators managed to amend the regulations and bring the initiative to the Senate for approval. The proposed constitutional amendment would have allowed presidents and vice presidents to run for a second term, either continuously or alternately. This amendment would have allowed then-president Horacio Cartes and former president Fernando Lugo to run for a second five-year term. In order for the amendment to be ratified, it needed to pass in the lower house, on paper a likely outcome in a chamber where the Colorado Party controlled 44 of 80 seats. This would then be followed by a national referendum. Senate President Roberto Acevedo of the opposition Authentic Radical Liberal Party filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, arguing that the vote violated Senate rules. The ban on any sort of re-election for the president dates to the aftermath of the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, which extended between 1954 and 1989. The Stroessner administration, of the Colorado Party, was one of the longest and most repressive in Latin American history. His rule left more than 400 missing, more than 18,000 tortured and more than 20,000 exiles, according to data published in 2008 by the Paraguayan Truth and Justice Commission. However, following Stroessner's fall and exile, the Colorado Party continued to win elections and completed over six consecutive decades in power, until in 2008, center-left Fernando Lugo, of the Guasu Front, won the elections. Lugo was dismissed after an impeachment in 2012, and in 2013, the Colorado Party returned to the government with Cartes. On 28 March, a discussion in the Congress ended with shouts in the corridors of the Legislative Palace of Asunción between left-wing senators and conservatives of the Colorado Party that were divided into two factions: government officials, who support the re- election of Cartes, and dissidents, who reject it. The Congress by then had been completely surrounded by policemen: truck-based water cannons and hundreds of anti-riot troops prevented the passage of the people. Hundreds of Paraguayans, including dissident deputies, senators and Paraguayan political leaders, demonstrated until the early hours of the morning of 29 March 2017 in downtown Asunción against the approval of the presidential re-election project. A closed-session Senate vote on the amendment was scheduled for 31 March 2017. This also coincided with a meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Asunción, which brought thousands of foreign business people and government officials to the Paraguayan capital. The measure by senators for the governing Colorado Party, which needed 23 members' support to pass in the 45-member assembly, passed with 25 votes. Protests After the Senate vote, protests broke out in Asunción against the legislation. Desirée Masi, leader of the opposition Progressive Democratic Party stated, \\"A coup has been carried out. We will resist and we invite the people to resist with us.\\" During the protests, the windows were broken and Congress was set on fire by protesters. Fencing surrounding the compound was also removed. Police used water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the demonstrators. Twenty-five-year-old Rodrigo Quintana, leader of Liberal Youth, the young wing of the main opposition Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA) in the district of La Colmena, Paraguarí Department, died after being seriously wounded with a shotgun blast on the torso by a police officer after police stormed the PLRA headquarters. The President of the Liberal Party Efraín Alegre confirmed the death. The moment of the police irruption to the party's headquarters was captured in a closed-circuit video.  As in Asunción, in the early hours of 1 April 2017, Ciudad del Este was the scene of police repression against anti-amendment protesters who congregated at the head of the Friendship Bridge. At least 12 people were detained. About 1:00 a.m., mounted police and special operations agents began the clearance of the border crossing, firing at protesters. The shootings lasted for about an hour, leaving many wounded with rubber bullets. The citizens rushed to the shopping centers, trying to take refuge from the shots, and some were taken from those places to be apprehended. Among the injured was a photographer of a local newspaper. In the early hours of 1 April 2017, members of the mounted group of the National Police of Paraguay attacked the headquarters of the ABC Color newspaper with both rubber and live ammunition. The main door of the newspaper's headquarters was destroyed by a rubber bullet shot and the glass shards wounded two employees. Reactions =International= Governments * : With harangues in Guarani, Paraguayans living in Buenos Aires demonstrated in front of the Paraguayan embassy in Argentina on the afternoon of 1 April 2017. The main reason for the mobilization was indignation at the death of Quintana, and they requested the resignation of the President of Paraguay. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which he \\"regrets the acts of violence\\" and hopes that \\"President Cartes will allow for its full clarification and the determination of the corresponding responsibilities.\\" * : President Evo Morales denounced the inaction of the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, in the political crisis unleashed in Paraguay. \\"Paraguayan Congress convulses its people. Mr. Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS, now, will there be Democratic Charter for Paraguay?\\" wrote Morales in his Twitter account. * : The United States embassy condemned the acts of violence and the Congress of Paraguay's fire started by citizens, and called on the Government and all parties involved to work together in a transparent way to solve the problems that triggered the disturbances. * : Paraguayans residing in Spain congregated at the Paraguayan Consulate in Barcelona, raising voices against the \\"outrage\\" in the Senate and the events that occurred on the night of 31 March. Several Paraguayan citizens staged a demonstration on 2 April 2017 in front of the Paraguayan Consulate in Madrid, Spain, against the amendment. They demanded justice for the death of Quintana. * : On 2 April 2017, Pope Francis asked to avoid \\"all violence\\" and advocated seeking \\"political solutions\\" in Venezuela and Paraguay, whose political situations he alluded to after the Angelus prayer. * : Two political parties of Uruguay, the Broad Front and the National Party, pronounced on the events occurred in the Congress of Paraguay expressing their concern for the Paraguayan political situation, expressed condolences for the death of Quintana and requested that political differences be resolved through dialogue. The Uruguayan Government expressed \\"great concern\\" at the violence in Paraguay during protests. Supranational bodies * : The General Secretary of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, called Paraguay's political forces to broker peace and urged the government to investigate the death of Quintana. The Secretary General criticized the actions of people who broke into Congress as the \\"bloody reaction of the police forces that resulted in the death of an activist and youth leader of the opposition.\\" *Inter-American Development Bank: The Annual Meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) kicked off formally in Paraguay with an agenda focused on economic integration and climate change, the same day the protest began. \\"I want to join the call for peace and dialogue,\\" said IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno at a press conference at the headquarters of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee, where the meeting took place. The IDB promised to provide its support, solidarity and support to Paraguay. The president of the entity clarified that they will remain a vital partner of Paraguay as they did six decades ago and will continue to do so for much longer, \\"betting on the enormous potential of the country.\\" =Domestic= Former President of Paraguay Federico Franco blamed Cartes for the political crisis in the country. Franco, who took office in 2012 after the removal of Lugo following Lugo's impeachment and was himself succeeded by Cartes, said that the president \\"has to withdraw this amendment immediately\\" to lower the tension in the country and aspire to continue in his position. Franco also held Cartes responsible for the death of Quintana. The Governor of the Presidente Hayes Department Antonio Saldívar condemned and lamented \\"the terrible act of the security organisms\\" that killed Quintana. He also urged the authorities to seek solutions in accordance with the law. The Intendant of Asunción, Mario Ferreiro, requested that the constitutional amendment be withdrawn from the congress. The Bishop of Caacupé, Monsignor Claudio Giménez, blamed the three powers of the Paraguayan state of political crisis, expressing his concern about the situation of the country as a result of the political crisis and regretted that \\"the lust for power and incoherence could overcome.\\" In the Sunday mass in the Catholic church of the city of Acahay, the pastor Elamidio Sandoval questioned the last events registered in the country because of the \\"ambition\\" of re-electionists. Sandoval asked those responsible \\"to change course and stop generating robberies and deaths and to act with patriotism.\\" The Paraguayan Evangelical community issued a statement condemning the violent acts that took place. They also rejected conduct that violates the national Constitution. Conversely, President Cartes released a statement on Twitter, in response to the protests: \\"Democracy is not conquered or defended with violence and you can be sure this government will continue to put its best effort into maintaining order in the republic. We must not allow a few barbarians to destroy the peace, tranquility and general wellbeing of the Paraguayan people.\\" He accused the media and a \\"political group\\" of the excesses that occurred in the vicinities and within the Congress of Paraguay. Colorado Party President Pedro Alliana called the party's Executive Committee to a meeting for an \\"analysis of events that occurred on 31 March in the National Congress.\\" The objective was to address what happened in Asunción after the confrontation between demonstrators and police officers, in addition to the subsequent death of Quintana. Much like President Cartes, the Colorado Party blamed opposition politicians and the media for the protests in the Congress, the subsequent acts of violence, and the death of Quintana. Alliana read a statement that mentions that they mourn the death of a young Paraguayan, and demand the clarification of the facts and punishment of those responsible. The statement also expresses its support for Horacio Cartes and his government. After reading the statement, Aliana said that the Colorado Party would continue with its plan to approve the constitutional amendment. Colorado Party Senator and former president of the Colorado Party Lilian Samaniego also stated that the Colorado Party would continue with its plan to approve the constitutional amendment. Paraguayan Foreign Minister Eladio Loizaga said that \\"democracy is firmer than ever\\" despite the attack on Congress in Asunción and defended the legality of the constitutional amendment and indicated that it was a violent group that does not understand that it is democracy that caused the events that caused the fire of the congress. These statements were made in Buenos Aires at a Mercosur meeting. Former President of Paraguay and Senator Fernando Lugo issued a statement via YouTube where he criticized the events in Congress, appealed for peace and made a nod to the referendum. In the video he did not touch the subject of the homicide of Quintana. Aftermath Paraguay's Interior Ministry took upon the investigation of Quintana's death. Gustavo Florentín, Deputy Chief of the anti-riot force of the National Police of Paraguay, confessed to accidentally shooting Quintana. In his defense, he claimed that the shotgun was accidentally fired in a struggle. Paraguay's Interior Minister Tadeo Rojas stated that \\"[his] position is available to the President of the Republic.\\" On 1 April, President Cartes dismissed Interior Minister Rojas and Commander of the National Police Críspulo Sotelo after the death of Quintana.  Lorenzo Lezcano was confirmed as the new Interior Minister, while Police Chief Luis Carlos Rojas was appointed as the new Commander of the National Police. The Authentic Radical Liberal Party announced the filing of an impeachment petition against President Cartes after the incidents in the mobilization as a result of the approval of the constitutional amendment, blaming him and the senators who approved the proposed constitutional amendment of the events that took place at the Congress of Paraguay. The impeachment request will be presented by the Liberal legislators in the Chamber of Deputies. The lower house vote on the constitutional amendment set for 1 April was postponed due to the violence on the protests. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies ruled to suspend activities due to danger of collapse of the Congress building. The Paraguayan congress did not work again until 5 April 2017. A total of 211 people were arrested after the protests against the constitutional amendment of presidential re-election, of which 90 were released after giving a statement before a competent authority. A large crowd reunited at the funeral of Quintana on 2 April 2017. After the wake in the party headquarters, the coffin was transferred to his hometown, La Colmena, where he was buried. In a press conference, the Liberal authorities announced that they would not rest until justice is done.  In social networking services, it was launched a campaign called \\"#NO\\", which rejects the constitutional amendment and re- election. Users criticize the acting of the political class and what they considered violations of existing laws as well as constitutional principles. President Cartes called in a televised message to a dialogue table between the presidents of the political parties \\"with parliamentary representation\\" of the two Chambers of Congress, as well as representatives of the Executive and the High Hierarchy of the Paraguayan Catholic Church to discuss the situation and seek a solution to the political crisis.  The Paraguayan opposition, led by the PLRA, said that the conditions for a dialogue with the ruling party are not provided, unless specific points are fulfilled. On 3 April 2017, hundreds of protesters demonstrated in the Plaza de Armas near the Paraguayan Congress, demanding the withdrawal of the constitutional amendment proposed by the Colorado Party, while also denouncing the violence that occurred on 31 March. They also collected signatures for a petition calling for the annulment of the constitutional amendment request. Students gathered in the Plaza de las Américas of Asunción to march to Mburuvicha Róga, the official residence of the President of Paraguay. The objective was truncated by police as the place is of restricted access. On 5 April, a student assembly took place in Itacurubí del Rosario, San Pedro Department, where, despite heavy rain, they expressed their rejection of the proposed constitutional amendment promoted by Cartes' supporters. On 7 April, secondary students from various institutions in another city of San Pedro, San Estanislao, also concentrated in Mariscal López Park to repudiate the constitutional amendment. A group of citizens placed a plaque in one of the pillars of a new \\"super viaduct\\" located between the avenues Madame Lynch and Aviadores del Chaco in Asunción to \\"name\\" it in honor of Quintana. The \\"super viaduct\\" was inaugurated on 31 March, at the same time that the protests in front of the Congress took place. Hundreds of Paraguayan citizens took to the streets of several cities in the interior of the country simultaneously to raise their voice of protest against the constitutional amendment that plans to implement the presidential reelection. Members of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA) demonstrated peacefully by closing roads en route to Yasy Cañy, Canindeyú Department. Paraguayan singer Andrea Valobra decided not to act in front of President Cartes as part of the Assembly of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) that is being held in Asunción. Through a statement on social media, the singer said she could not ignore what happened in the country. The Club Olimpia association football team of Paraguay showed a banner before a Paraguayan Primera División match game against Club Sol de América that said \\"QEPD Rodrigo Quitana\\" (\\"R.I.P. Rodrigo Quintana\\") and asked for peace in Paraguay. The authorities of the Paraguayan Football Association later announced that they planned to sanction the club for violating the rules of competition, which aroused criticism from the Paraguayan public. Paraguayan citizens also engaged in escraches, a type of manifestation in which a group of activists goes to the address or workplace of someone to whom they want to denounce or rebuke, by going to the residences of Paraguayan senators and deputies to criticize their performance in the Paraguayan Congress regarding the implementation of the presidential re-election project. Many legislators have been surprised in parks and shopping malls where people have spontaneously shown up to express their disgust and discontent for the support to the constitutional amendment. Incidents such as these included the escrache of a senator when making a walk in a park,   * and an escrache in front of Lugo's residence in Lambaré. On 17 April 2017, President Cartes announced through a note sent to the metropolitan archbishop of the Archdiocese of Asunción, Monsignor Edmundo Valenzuela, that he would not run for a second term even if the amendment passed.  Senate President Acevedo argued that the only way to believe the declarations of President Cartes was for the pro-government deputies to archive the draft bill. Despite President Cartes' statements, on 19 April, 44 deputies from the lower house of the Congress of Paraguay voted in favor of continuing to give legal course to the constitutional amendment of presidential reelection, which was reported to have aroused complaints among Paraguayan citizens in social networks.

Life  = Early life = Richard John Barton was born on 27 December 1879 at Trentham (The Barton Estate) in the Upper Hutt Valley. His family owned generous landholdings in the Hutt Valley and the Wairarapa due to his grandfather Richard Barton being a pioneer settler in New Zealand. His father John Barton inherited the properties of Trentham, Whiterock and other farming stations in the Wellington region. The Barton family were early farmers in the region as well as Wairarapa during the late 19th century. = Education = With prosperous estates, Barton was educated at the Wanganui Collegiate School, a colonial boarding school established by Sir George Grey. Barton was educated here during the tenure of Walter Empson, an Oxford Alumni who became Headmaster. = Marriage = In 1906 he married Georgina Hector, the daughter of Sir James Hector, at St Augustine's Church, Petone. After the wedding a reception was held at Sir James Hector's home, Ratanui. They went on to have five sons and one daughter.

He extended the farms up towards the Upper plains, known as \\"Tapia\\". Some time between 1904 and 1906 Barton offered to sell the Wellington Golf Club 48.5 hectares of their Heretaunga/Trentham farm which is now the Royal Wellington Golf Club. = Associations and clubs = Barton was associated with many of Wairarapa's foundation business societies including: * President of the Masterton A. and P.

The book was titled \\"Earliest New Zealand\\" and described Butler's pioneer missionary work in the Bay of Islands from 1819 to 1824 prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The compilation took over 15 years, including research from the Early Missionary records of the Hocken Library in Otago, and the Turnbull Library in Wellington. The book was dedicated to his father John Barton for \\"careful custody of old family papers\\". During this time it was also noted that he gifted the following items to the Hocken Library in Otago: * A letter from the Rev. Samuel Marsden to the Rev.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to four white flowers with green backs. There are two populations which are isolated from each other and may prove, with further research to be separate species.  Description  Caladenia xantholeuca is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy, bright green leaf, 150–240 mm long and 5–7 mm wide. Up to four white flowers with green backs and 17–24 mm long and 20-30 wide are borne on a stalk 150–250 mm tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, 12–16 mm long and 3–4 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 17–21 mm long, 5–6 mm wide and held at an angle below horizontal. The petals are 16–18 mm long, about 4 mm wide and spread horizontally. The labellum is 6–7 mm long, 6–8 mm wide and white with a yellow tip which has a few blunt teeth and curves downward. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and surround the column and there are two rows of yellow calli up to about 1.5 mm long along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from September to October.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia xantholeuca was first described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected in Telowie Gorge and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (xantholeuca) is derived from the Ancient Greek words xanthos meaning \\"yellow\\" and leukos meaning \\"white\\" referring to the white flower with yellow parts of the labellum.  Distribution and habitat  There are three known populations of Flinders fingers, two in the Mount Remarkable National Park and one in the Telowie Gorge Conservation Park, each with about 80 plants, but the orchid has rarely been seen since 1982 because of extended droughts and lack of fire. A photograph taken in 2011 was confirmed as a sighting. There are slight differences between the orchids in Telowie Gorge and those on Mount Remarkable and it may be that in the future they are recognised as separate species. Conservation Caladenia xantholeuca is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"endangered\\" under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act.
