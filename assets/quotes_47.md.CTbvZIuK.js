After not being selected in the 2016 NFL Draft, the Saints signed Lewis on a recommendation from Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, who was a friend of Lewis' high school coach. Early years Lewis attended and played high school football at William T. Dwyer High School. College career Lewis played college football for the Northern Illinois Huskies. Professional career =New Orleans Saints= Lewis signed with the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent on May 2, 2016. After impressing during training camp and the preseason as both a receiver and returner, Lewis made the Saints 53-man roster. He played in 12 games with one start, recording seven catches for 76 yards along with 312 total return yards. He recorded his first touchdown on December 7, 2017 against the Atlanta Falcons. In the 2017 season, he had 10 receptions for 116 yards and one receiving touchdown. On September 19, 2018, Lewis was placed on injured reserve after suffering a knee injury on a punt return in Week 2 against the Cleveland Browns. He was activated off injured reserve on November 21, 2018, and scored his second career touchdown, also against the Atlanta Falcons. On January 20, 2019, in the final minutes of the NFC Championship game against the Los Angeles Rams, Lewis was involved in a controversial moment with Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman. Robey-Coleman made a helmet-to-helmet hit on Lewis which would have been called for pass interference or a personal foul, but neither came about. It would have set the Saints up with a short field goal opportunity and a chance to run out the clock. However, the referees missed the call. The Saints would go on to lose the game in overtime, 23–26, after Drew Brees threw an interception. Later on, the league admitted that they blew the call and Coleman confessed to committing the penalty either way. =Detroit Lions= On March 19, 2019, Lewis signed with the Detroit Lions. He was released during final roster cuts on August 30, 2019.

It was released in Japan by Toho on September 10, 2016.  Plot  Kōsei Arima is a piano prodigy who has won many awards due to his precision, timing, and ability to switch between tempos easily, earning him the moniker \\"human metronome\\". He achieved so much because he was meticulously taught by his terminally ill mother, Saki, who was abusive and demanding. When, as a seven-year-old, she slapped him after a victory that she deemed unwarranted, he declared his refusal to play the piano ever again and wished that she died. Indeed, Saki died the following day; this caused Kōsei to experience a mental breakdown during a recital, making him unable to hear sounds from the piano. Since then, Kōsei quit playing piano in public. Ten years later, in April, Kōsei is invited by his childhood friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryōta Watari to go on a double date with them and Kaori Miyazono, whom Tsubaki says is attracted to Watari. Kaori, as it turns out, is a bubbly children-loving violinist. She plays the violin in an unorthodox manner, refusing to follow the cues and instead creating her own flow that nevertheless impresses the audience. One of her competitions requires a pianist to accompany her, so Kaori forces Kōsei to come out retirement and assist her. During the competition, Kōsei experiences a breakdown again, but Kaori encourages him to restart the recital, despite the fact that it will disqualify her. He succeeds and while Kaori is disqualified, the organizers invited her to play at a gala concert. For the gala, Kaori picks Love's Sorrow, a piece that Saki used to play as a lullaby for her son. Kōsei is initially hesitant, but his mother's pianist friend, Hiroko Seto, tells him that it would be a good chance to prove to his mother what a pianist he has become. During the concert, Kaori is unexpectedly hospitalized, so Kōsei plays the piece as a piano solo. Kaori is later discharged and, as a punishment for not visiting her in the hospital, forces Kōsei to be Watari's \\"substitute\\" for a date the two had planned. The two visit the school that night, where Kaori reveals that she had lied about the date, as she is still hospitalized but does not want her illness to make her helpless. When she faints, Kōsei takes her to the hospital but otherwise is unable to say anything else. Watari correctly deduces that Kōsei is in love with Kaori and encourages him to meet and confess to her. Meanwhile, Tsubaki anguishedly declares her own love for Kōsei and reveals that she agreed to introduce Kaori because she hoped that would make Kōsei turn to her. Afterwards, Kōsei confesses to Kaori as the two share a meal on the hospital rooftop. He also tells her that he will join a piano competition for the first time in ten years. Hearing that he wishes to play music with her again, Kaori decides to undergo a risky surgery scheduled on the day of Kōsei's contest. During the competition, Kōsei is aided by an apparition of Kaori playing violin alongside him. In spring of the following year, Kōsei opens a letter written by Kaori, who did not survive the surgery. He learns that Kaori had been admiring him since they were young children and had decided to study violin so she could someday play music with him. When she learned that her illness was terminal, she transformed her image and personality drastically so as to avoid having regrets. She also requests him to apologize to Tsubaki and Watari in her place. She told him that she had loved him all this time and not Watari, which was her lie in April.

In 1905 the Second Chemical Institute (II. Chemische Institut) was renamed the \\"Physikalisch-Chemisches Institut\\" (the Institute of Physical Chemistry). He held this Privatdozent-level position until his age-related retirement in 1930. From 1928 to 1931 he was the board chair of the German Chemical Society. In 1890 Marckwald married Margarete Salomon (1871–1908). Their marriage produced two sons, Friedrich (1892–1917), who died in World War I as a naval aviator, and Johann (1902–1986). In 1936 Willy Marckwald, with his son Johann and his daughter-in-law Prisca, became immigrants in Brazil. Scientific work From the starting point of his Promotierung dissertation and Habilitation, Marckwald developed a wide interest in all the fields of chemistry of his era. In heterocyclic chemistry, building upon the research done on Gabriel synthesis, he developed a method for synthesis of aziridines from β-halogen-amines. This ring closure method, known as the Gabriel- Marckwald reaction, allows the preparation of heterocyclic amines that are n-membered, where n=3,4,5,6, or 7.S. Gabriel: Ueber Vinylamin.

As part of the wilderness system. it helps to preserve a variety of natural life forms and contributes to a diversity of plant and animal gene pools. Over half of the ecosystems in the United States exist within designated wilderness. The ridge of Peters Mountain offers excellent vantage points overlooking the hills of West Virginia, and the area includes interesting bogs and mountain outcrops. The deep forests are occupied by the northern saw whet owl and many species of warblers. The mountain is home of the rare Peters Mountain Mallow. The area is part of the Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster. Location and access The area is located on Peters Mountain in the Jefferson National Forest, about 10 miles north of Pearisburg, Virginia. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail travels about 1.5 miles through the middle of the area. The section of the Appalachian Trail passing through the wilderness can be reached by following the Appalachian Trail south from the trail head at Stony Creek or going north from the trail head at the New River. Pine Swamp Shelter on Appalachian Trail Besides the Appalachian Trail, there are several other trails in the area. These include the Allegheny Trail extending along the ridge of Peters Mountain, and the Ground Hog Trail, a 2-mile blue-blazed trail that begins at Painters Run Road (Rt. 657) off of Route 219 in West Virginia. Trail information is available on National Geographic-Trails Illustrated Map #787 (Blacksburg-New River Valley). Natural History Wild Geranium in Peters Mountain Wilderness Vegetation in the wilderness is primarily upland oak with yellow poplar, red oak, and hickory with at least three tracts of old growth forest. There are numerous sandstone outcroppings along the crest of the mountain and a number of high mountain bogs on Pine Swamp Ridge.Wilderness.net - Peters Mountain Wilderness, accessdate: September 4, 2016 Peters Mountain Mallow, one of the rarest plants in the United States, is unique to the mountain. It is protected in a 398-acre preserve purchased by the Nature Conservancy of Virginia that is located just outside of the wilderness area. Peters Mountain mallow was discovered in 1927 by botanists who found 50 specimens. The plant was placed on the endangered species list in 1986 when a survey crew found only four specimens. In order to sprout, dormant seeds require fire to crack open and let water in. Cores from nearby trees showed that no fires had burned in the area for two decades. After a small blaze was lit in 1992 a few mallows sprouted. and later 500 seedlings were found. FisherIn 1849 John James Audubon and John Bachman found a fisher on Peters Mountain, just south of Peterstown, West Virginia. The fisher is a secretive, dark-colored mammal that once ranged as far south as the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. The fisher is no longer found in this area, but it has been introduced in parts of West Virginia and could return to the wild habitat provided by the Peters Mountain Wilderness. Stony Creek contains the colorful candy darter, an imperiled fish found in only a few tributaries of the New River. A bog at the head of Pine Branch Swamp near the crest of Peters Mountain contains cinnamon fern, sphagnum moss and sundew. Loggers last cut the area in the 1920s and 1930s leaving a 10-acre stand of old-growth hemlocks. Topography Pine Swamp Branch in Peters Mountain Wilderness Peters Mountain straddles the Virginia - West Virginia state line. It is a long, rugged ridge extending from the New River on the South, through Monroe County, West Virginia and into Alleghany County, Virginia. The elevation ranges from about 2000 feet near the southern boundary on Big Stony Creek to 3956 feet on the ridge near Pine Swamp Ridge. The northern boundary of the wilderness is the ridge of Peters Mountain. Pine Swamp Ridge defines the central region of Peters Mountain and marks the watershed between Pine Swamp Branch and Dismal Branch. Foster Knob is a mid-slope outlier with good views down Stony Creek. The ridge crest is capped with weather resistant sandstone with many rock outcrops.Virginia Wilderness Committee: , accessdate: August 29, 2016 Dismal Creek and Pine Swamp Branch are two small creeks in the area that drain into Stony Creek.

M. Kosemen under the pen name Nemo Ramjet. All Tomorrows explores a hypothetical future path of human evolution set from the near future to a billion years from the present, with several future human species evolving through natural means and through genetic engineering, conducted by both humans themselves and by a mysterious and superior alien species called the Qu.  Summary  Beginning in the near future, All Tomorrows chronicles the imagined entire future history of humanity over the course of the next several hundred million years. Over the course of the book, humanity experiences several triumphs and failures and diverges into several different distinct forms through evolution and genetic engineering. Following the colonization of Mars, a quick but catastrophic civil war between Earth and Mars and a large-scale colonization initiative carried out by genetically-engineered humans through the galaxy, All Tomorrows introduces a malevolent and superior alien race known as the \\"Qu\\", whose religion motivate them to remake the universe through genetic engineering. Following a brief war in which humanity is quickly defeated by the Qu, the aliens bioengineer the surviving humans as punishment, creating several different strange forms, many of them unintelligent, which are left to evolve on their own as the Qu leave the galaxy. Bioengineered forms of human created by the Qu range from worm-like humans and semi-sentient reptile-like forms to insect-eaters and strange modular and cell-based species. The book then proceeds to chronicle the evolution of these new 'ersatz humans', following them as they either go extinct or regain sentience as wildly different forms. Eventually, one race replaces their bodies with mechanical forms known as the Gravital, and colonize the rest of the galaxy while annihilating most life within. The final chapters of the book detail humanity's rebound as a posthuman species, and their first contact with another galaxy's life.

He wrote for the popular weekly Tamil publication Ananda Vikatan. He was a prolific writer in English and Tamil. Apart from articles on music, he has written poetry, lyrics and even a number of stories in Tamil, that were published in Ananda Vikatan.V V Sadagopan Adharam Neethan Endru Film Actor \\"He was a star, handsome and charismatic. He was a graduate and an acclaimed Carnatic musician. When I learnt that the producers of the new film were planning to have him as the hero, I knew that I stood no chance of being considered for the role,\\" wrote MGR about V.V. Sadagopan, and the words of the former actor-turned-Chief Minister speak volumes for his talent and personality. His good looks and music talents soon drew him to films. He acted as the main actor in the Tamil film Nava Yuvan (Modern Youth) that had an alternate title Geethasaram (Essence of Gita). (It was customary for Tamil films at that time to have two names as titles).V.V.Sadagopan The film was shot in London. It is the first ever Tamil film to be shot in a foreign country and V. V. Sadagopan became the first to have acted in such a film. This film bestowed on V. V. Sadagopan the distinction of being the first University graduate to have acted in Tamil films. The coronation ceremony of King George VI was also shown along with this film.1937 – நவ யுவன் His second film Adhirstam (Luck) was released in 1939.

He was a member of the audition panel of All India Radio (AIR) and also of the experts committee of the Madras Music Academy. He travelled all over India and abroad for his lecture-cum-music concerts. He represented Indian Music in the Centenary celebrations of the Moscow Conservatoire 1966. Music Teacher Teaching music to children was a subject close to his heart and he launched the Tyaga Bharathi, a movement to carry out his mission. The term Tyagabharathi was coined by him to epitomise the ideals of Saint Tyagaraja and Subramania Bharati. \\"An ardent devotee of Tyagaraja’s music and admirer of Subramania Bharati’s ideas, he combined both to teach values to children. We used to visit schools and would sing and dance with children. They are not nursery rhymes, but penned and tuned to Carnatic music with the objective of moulding children,\\" said Devika Raman, daughter of Sadagopan. When Soundaram Ramachandaran, a Minister in Jawaharlal Nehru’s Cabinet, launched the Gandhigram Rural Institute (GRI), she appointed Sadagopan as the Director of Music Studies. \\"When Nehru visited the institution in 1959, he got a chance to watch the Kuravanji dance-drama of Sadagopan.

He mentored disciples who went on to achieve great feats. His research was carried forward by his disciples. Srirama Bharathi is one of his disciples with whom he brought out a book called ‘Spirals and Circles’ that explains the concept of carnatic music and thought processes associated with it. Srirama Bharathi continued the works of the guru. A trust called Sri Sadagopan Thirunarayanaswami Divya Prabhanda Patasala started in the singer’s name. Srirama Bharathi and his wife Sowbhagyalakshmi propagated Thyaga Bharathi songs through the trust and went on to compose tunes for Nalayira Divya Prabhandam. After the demise of her husband, Sowbhagyalakshmi continues the practice along with family and close associates.

Early life and education Muguku was born in 1932 in Kanyariri Village, Kikuyu Division, Kiambu County to his father Njoroge and mother Mama Wambui. The entrepreneurial nature of his father was a key inspiration to his later life. Muguku sat for the Kenya African Preliminary Examination at Kabete Intermediate School. It was the second time he was doing the exam and his relatively high score led to allegations of cheating and the nullification of his results by the colonial administrators. He was ordered to join carpentry classes at Thika Technical School from 1950 to 1953. Work Muguku started off as a carpentry teacher at Kapenguria Intermediate School before he was transferred to Kabianga Teachers College (now Kabianga High School). In 1957, at age 24 and against the wishes of his parents, he quit teaching to concentrate on the poultry business he had started a year earlier with just two hens, a cock and KShs 2,000. He also resented the fact that he was required to pursue additional training if he wanted to get a job promotion but this was not forthcoming when he did obtain additional training. He initially reared the chicken with his father's help. Muguku's wife would quit her teaching job at Kagaa Primary School Githunguri in 1963 to help him run the business. Business =Muguku Poultry Farm= In 1965, Muguku bought the 22-acre Star Ltd farm from a white veterinary doctor for Kshs 100,000. He renamed the farm Muguku Poultry Farm and started a hatchery with a 9,000-egg incubator. His growing business saw him at one time supply eggs to Governor-General Malcolm MacDonald and the country's first Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta. Today, the farm can hatch 500,000 chicks a day and also hosts dairy cows as well as an orchard. =Stock market= Muguku was an active investor in various counters at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. However, it was for his stake in Equity Bank that he was best known. He acquired a 6.08% stake before the bank was listed and was for years the bank's largest individual shareholder. By 2014, the Muguku family had reduced its stake in the bank to 0.9% valued at KShs 1.6 billion (equivalent to US$17 million at the time). =Real Estate= Muguku owned a building on Mfangano Street in downtown Nairobi and was a major property owner in Kikuyu town. In 2014, through Crossroads Limited, the Muguku family embarked on the construction of phase 1 of the Karen Waterfront mall at an estimated cost of Kshs 2.6 billion (equivalent to US$28 million at the time). The family also owns Crossroads Mall in the same area. =Schools= Muguku was the proprietor of two primary schools (Kidfarmaco and Kikuyu Township) and one high school (Tumaini School formerly known as Greenacres School). Philanthropy Muguku built the Anglican Church in Kikuyu including the pastor's residence. He helped rehabilitate street children in Kikuyu town. Personal life Muguku was married to Leah Wanjiku and they had seven children.

It is a good sample of the Spanish Renaissance art. The town hall is located in the Plaza de España square.  History  The building was built between the years 1557 and 1563 in the formerly called Plaza Mayor or del Mercado, to fulfill the function of Loncha, oxen place and granary since the city already had a Council Houses in Plaza de la Magdalena, in the Cinto's neighbourhood. The building, leaning against the rear in the stones of the Walls, was originally free, but now is located between shared walls. In mid-17th century this building became used as Town Hall. Following the characteristics of all Lonchas, based in turn on the Aragonese private architecture, Tarazona had on the top floor with a \\"lookout\\" or gallery arches, with the function of false structure whose serves to protect the building, and topped in a blown wooden eaves. From this viewpoint the municipal corporation watched the bullfights that were held on the occasion of the festivities or particular of each guild, as well as religious events, such as the passage of Corpus Christi procession through the square. This function viewpoint of the Market was missing from the late eighteenth century due to the construction of the bullring situated next to the church of the Virgin River, patron of the city. We can say, almost certainly, the fish market had originally Tarazona four floors, although only three have reached our days. From this lookout the city council watched the bullfights that were held on the occasion of the patron feasts or particulars of each guild, as well as religious events, such as the procession of Corpus Christi through the square. This function of the Loncha's lookout was missing from late-18th century due to the construction of the bullring situated next to the iglesia de la Virgen del Río. It can say, almost certainly, the Tarazonan Loncha had originally four floors, although only three have reached our days. Description The facade has three floors. In the exterior the building has a sculptural decoration that makes it unique and original and which was made in two moments. =Built in 1563= Part of the original building. The facade is divided by a long frieze carved in plaster, dated in the years of its construction, which represents the departure of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (Charles I of Spain) after his coronation in Bologna, as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Clement VII on February 24 of 1530, event narrated by chronicler Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. In the frieze can distinguish, from left to right, the preparations for the feast, the guns accompanying the cortege, the squires carrying the banners, the royal entourage, the nobility, the Emperor and the pope under a canopy, and the passage of the entourage under a triumphal arch. Of the same time are the three coat of arms on leather trimmed. The central belongs to the Emperor Charles V, the left is that of Aragon, and that of Tarazona is the right one. All this decoration represents an iconographic program of imperial exaltation would find its justification in the death of the emperor coincided with the start of construction of the building. However, the other reliefs on the facade of the main floor look different in terms of program and dating. First, it distinguish two allegorical figures representing Justice and Wisdom located one on each side of the main door, and the three Heraclean characters that refer to the founding of Tarazona. This iconographic program aims to reflect the virtues of good governance of the city, ie, justice and wisdom, which prudence and good advice were implicit, and the story of the founding of the town with the issues of Heracles, Cacus and a third character for some is Samson and other Pierres or even Tubal-cain. In this sense, it should not forget that the figure of Heracles was closely related to the Emperor Charles as he liked to be represented by the iconography of the twelve labors the mythological demi- god had to perform, transforming them into allegories of the ideology of power.\\"Ayuntamiento de Tarazona\\", Fundación Tarazona Monumental's website (Foundation responsible for care the architectural heritage of Tarazona =Addition in 1973= A radical restoration of the Town Hall was conducted between 1968 and 1973 under the direction of architect Fernando Chueca Goitia. Chueca created (but only from the pillars of the arches upwards) in the upper of third floor, a gallery of arches indiscriminately imitating the nearby Abbey of Santa María de Veruela's upper of the cloister, also wrong because included the shields of the Veruelan abbots Hernando de Aragón and Lope Marco in the decoration of the affected floor.

Initially, all of the league's Mexico City-based teams, including the Raptors and Mexicas, used the venue until relocating to other sports facilities in the Mexico City area. In the 2018 season, the Raptors were the first Mexico City-based squad to move out when they made the Estadio José Ortega Martínez in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, their home, while the Mexicas announced that they would move to the Estadio Wilfrido Massieu in 2019. =Non-sports= One of the stages of the annual Vive Latino festival, which is primarily held in the Sports City's Foro Sol, is set up on the field at the stadium. In late 2018, the stadium was used by Mexico City's government as a shelter for migrants traveling in the late 2018 migrant caravan from Central America. In preparation for the arrival of migrants, the field was covered, kitchen facilities prepared and tanks with a capacity of 10,000 liters of drinking water were put in place. The shelter will have a capacity of 6,500 when all preparations are complete.

During the last few years of Tahmasp I's life, when a protracted competition for the throne was evident, as well as much jockeying for position by the rival factions, a number of Qizilbash chiefs decided, in 1574, to openly support Suleiman Mirza as heir apparent. When his half-brother Ismail Mirza Safavi (who succeeded as Ismail II) was eventually enthroned on 22 August 1576, the latter ordered for the systematic murder or blinding of any prince of royal blood who could become the center of a conspiracy against him.

They were popular in the region, touring throughout the Northeast, and enjoyed a regional hit, with the single \\"Take a Taxi\\" b/w \\"Warning\\", that received airplay in other markets around the country. \\"Warning\\" has become especially valued amongst garage rock enthusiasts and was included on the Back from the Grave compilation series. History The Humans formed in the summer of 1964 in Albion, New York, twenty miles north of Batavia and not far from Rochester. All six of their members had been in the high school marching band when they decided to start a rock band. Their membership consisted of Dick Doolan on vocals, Danny Long on vocals and harmonica, Bill Kuhns on lead guitar, Gar Trusselle on keyboards, Marty Busch on bass, and Jack Dumrese on drums. They picked the name \\"Humans\\" as a humorous comment on the trend of bands being named after insects and animals in the fashion of British Invasion groups such as the Beatles and the Animals. The group's manager was Al Cecere out Rochester, who had them signed with Premier Talent Associates (PTA) in New York City. The group's agent with Premier was Rich Nader who later went on to promote rock festivals across the country. The Humans gained regional popularity, touring throughout the northeast and opening for several big-name acts, such as the Hollies and opened on several occasions for Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. They played a two-week engagement in Miami with the Standells and in 1966 performed at the Rheingold Festival in Central Park in Manhattan. The group became close friends with another New York band, the Heard (not to be confused with other groups of the same name), who were also managed by Al Cecere. They alternated with Caesar and His Romans from Buffalo at Oak Orchard Lanes, a popular bowling alley and nightspot in Albion. Well-known acts such as The Rivieras and the Shadows of Knight played at Oak Orchard Lanes. Their manager Cecere owned a label, Audition Records. In 1966 they went to Riposo Studios in Syracuse to record a single for Audition, \\"Take a Taxi\\" b/w \\"Warning\\", which was released in June 1966. Though \\"Warning\\" was on the B-side, it would later become their best-known song amongst garage rock enthusiasts. The A-side \\"Take a Taxi\\" was a folk rock-influenced number. Lead guitarist Bill Kuhns (listed as William R. Kuhns, Jr. on the label) composed both songs. Both songs became regional hits, enjoying airplay in the Northeast, and well as in other markets around the country. According to keyboardist Gar Trusselle, Billboard reported that the Humans' record reached the top twenty in Michigan and Texas. Both \\"Take a Taxi\\" and \\"Warning\\" became staples of their live sets. The group, whose hair was considered long for 1966, ran into frequent harassment. They band rented an abandoned movie theater in Albion and created their own venue there, naming it \\"Happiness Is...\\" In September 1966 vocalist and harmonica player Danny Long died in an automobile accident, which was the first in a series of events that eventually led to the group's demise. The draft board began to target several members of the group for conscription into the Vietnam War. The Humans played their last show at Happiness Is... in November 1966 and by the year's end had disbanded. The Humans' work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts with the release of \\"Warning\\" on the Back from the Grave, Volume 2 CD and Back from the Grave, Volume 5 LP compilations released on Tim Warren's Crypt Records. According to the list of the 1000 greatest garage rock records of all time voted on by a panel of garage rock writers and experts in Mike Markesich's Teebeat Mayhem, \\"Warning\\" is ranked at #128 (out of the more than 16,000 records included in the book).

He is best known as the author of a memoir of his wartime experiences, A Narrative of a Light Company Soldier's Service, published in his hometown of Bradford on Avon in England in 1840. This work is notable as one of the only accounts of the conflict penned by a common British soldier. Early life and military service Born in Woolley, a suburb of Bradford on Avon to a family of weavers in 1789, Byfield enlisted in the Wiltshire Militia in 1807, aged eighteen. Two years later, he volunteered into the 41st Regiment and was sent to join the regiment in North America, serving in Lower Canada and at Fort George in modern-day Niagara-on-the-Lake prior to the outbreak of war. As a private in the 41st, Byfield saw heavy action during the Anglo-American War of 1812. In the conflict's western theatre, he served at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Frenchtown, where he was wounded in the shoulder, as well as at the Siege of Fort Meigs and the Battle of Fort Stephenson. Byfield narrowly escaped capture after British defeat at the Battle of the Thames and later rejoined elements of his regiment in the Niagara Peninsula. Byfield participated in the Capture of Fort Niagara and the Battle of Lundy's Lane, but his left arm was shattered by a musket ball at the Battle of Conjocta Creek, an unsuccessful British raid on 3 August 1814 preceding the Siege of Fort Erie. Byfield's forearm was subsequently amputated and he was invalided back to England, where he was awarded a pension from the Royal Hospital Chelsea in 1815. Later life Byfield returned to Bradford on Avon and married but was prevented from working at his trade because he required use of both hands to operate a loom. However, according to his memoirs, a design for an 'instrument' came to him one night in a dream; this contraption enabled him to work at a loom with just one arm, allowing him to provide for his family. Byfield published a memoir of his wartime experiences in 1840. Although some sources speculate that he died c.1850, more recent research suggests that Byfield actually died on 17 January 1874 in Bradford, aged 84. He also served as keeper of the Lord Edward Somerset Monument at Hawkesbury Upton in Gloucestershire from its completion in 1845 until he was dismissed from the post in 1853. Significance Shadrack Byfield's Narrative provides a rare common soldier's perspective of the War of 1812, and as such his account, considered to be a critical source for studying the conflict, has frequently been republished or anthologised. Byfield has often been portrayed as the archetypical 1812-era British soldier by modern historians. John Gellner, who edited Byfield's memoirs in 1963, asserted that his story \\"could have been told by any one of those humble, patient, iron-hard British regulars who more than made up in discipline, training and bravery for their lack of numbers.\\" Byfield's account has frequently been referenced in secondary histories of the war, notably in Pierre Berton's popular histories The Invasion of Canada and Flames Across the Border. Shadrack Byfield's story has commonly been featured in museum exhibits (for instance, at Old Fort Erie) and in documentaries on the War of 1812, including Canada: A People's History (2000) and PBS's The War of 1812 (2011). Byfield is also the protagonist in a 1985 children's novel, Redcoat, by Canadian author Gregory Sass, which presents a heavily fictionalised account of his military experiences.

Portal of the Manx National Heritage. (accessed May 31, 2016) the wind and seas were too heavy for the ship and she began to drift backwards. At noon she was sighted off The Stack at Scarlett, which she narrowly missed. And drifting backwards she crossed the Castletown bay. The Castletown lifeboat was launched but by the time she was on the coast just beyond Hango Hill it was too shallow for the lifeboat. The steam boat ran aground and the crew were taken off by the Castletown rocket brigade. Attempts to refloat her were unsuccessful and on 21 February they used greased poles to roll her lower down the beach. She was taken into Castletown harbour for minor repairs before two tugboats took her back to the UK on 22 February. The event proved to be of interest to the people of Castletown and to the lads of the King William's College, near the beach where the ship ran aground, who came to look at her.

The Canal eras in various parts of the world have varied in the world timeline, in the main, by civilizations (Egypt, Ancient Babylon), dynastic Empires of India, China, and Southeast Asia, and of European mercantilism. Canals are culturally dependent, and culture creating, part of industry, and industry creating and until the coming into an era when steam locomotives generated refined speeds and sufficient power, the canal was by far the fastest way to travel long distances quickly, for commercial canals generally had boatmen shifts that kept the barges moving behind mule teams 24 hours a day. Like many North American canals of the 1820s-1840s, the canal operating companies partnered with or founded short feeder railroads as were necessary appendages to connect to their sources or markets. Two good examples of this were funded by private enterprise: # The Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company used vertically integrated mining raw materials, transporting them, manufacturing with them, and merchandising by building coal mines, the instrumental Lehigh Canal, and feeding their own iron goods manufacturing industries and assuaging the American Republic's first energy crisis by increasing coal production from 1820 onwards using the nation's second constructed railway, the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad. # The second coal road and canal system was inspired by LC&N;'s success. The Delaware and Hudson Canal and Delaware and Hudson Gravity Railroad. The LC&N; operation was aimed at supplying the country's premier city, Philadelphia with much needed fuel. The D&H; companies were founded purposefully to supply the explosively growing city of New York's energy needs. Together, they and the Schuylkill Canal-Reading Railroad would supply and transport the majority of Anthracite needed by northern industries in the early North American Industrial Revolution. Unlike Europe, America did not have canals for several hundred years before industrialization. In North America, everything was developed simultaneously. Early railroads in North America made many canals economically feasible, and canal's needs added to the demands by industries that pushed the early railroads into pressurized research and development and rapid steady improvements. Canal Age in Asia European Canal Age North American Canal Age Technology Archaeologists and Industrial Historians date the American Canal Age from 1790 to 1855 based on momentum and new construction activity, since many of the older canals, however limited later by locks that restricted boat sizes below the most economic capacities and well-behind later-developing technological capabilities, nonetheless continued on in service well into the twentieth century. In truth, the first legislation supporting canals in North America took place in the Province of Pennsylvania in 1762 with an effort to improve navigation on the Schuylkill River through Philadelphia, the largest city in North America and the surveying of a canal along the Schuylkill tributary Tulpehocken Creek which would eventually be built in 1828 as the Union Canal part of the omnibus Pennsylvania legislative package, the Main Line of Public Works, providing the only water route connecting the Susquehanna with the Delaware above the Potomac & Chesapeake Bay. Next up there were numerous schemes and bills placed before the Pennsylvania assembly in the 1790-1816 time frame to improve navigation on the Susquehanna, Schuylkill and Lehigh Rivers, the first being the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company in 1791. They consumed private capital and public monies, but were little successful. Concurrently, the predecessor of the Erie Canal was begun in New York State and in New England, Connecticut and Massachusetts were looking at a few waterways needing better navigability. Not much happened. The Lehigh Canal came about when the last of these licenses, awarded in 1816, expired in early 1818 with virtually nothing to show for the funds spent. This expiration allowed the state to give rights-of-way to the Lehigh Navigation Company in March 1818, founded by two disgruntled formerly enthusiastic backers of the Schuylkill Canal which was chartered in 1812 but like the earlier Lehigh River projects, languished lazily, only raising a small amount of new funds annually, and getting only a little amount of work done accordingly. Josiah White and partner Erskine Hazard needing fuel for their wire mill and nail factory at the falls of the Schuylkill fought this plodding method of incremental improvement for years. By 1855, canals were no longer the civil engineering work of first resort, for it was nearly always better--cheaper to build a railroad above ground than it was to dig a watertight ditch 6–8 feet (2–3 m) deep and provide it with water and make annual repairs for ice and freshet damages--even though the cost per ton mile on a canal was often cheaper in an operational sense, canals couldn't be built along hills and dales, nor backed into odd corners, as could a railroad siding. Background Erie Canal map c. 1840 From the first days of the expansion of the British colonies from the coast of North America into the heartland of the continent, a recurring problem was that of transportation between the coastal ports and the interior. This was not unique to the Americas, and the problem still exists in those parts of the world where muscle power provides a primary means of transportation within a region. An equally ancient solution was implemented in many cultures -- things in the water weighed far less and took less effort to move since friction became negligible. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the Appalachian Mountains, inland, running over long as a barrier range with just five places where mule trains or wagon roads could be routed,The five east-west crossings of the Appalachians are South to North: Plains of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi (around the bottom), the Cumberland Gap pass connecting North Carolina/Southern Virginia with Kentucky/Tennessee, the Cumberland Narrows pass connecting Cumberland Western Maryland/Northern Virginia with West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania via Brownsville, Pennsylvania and the Monongahela River or the Youghiogheny River valley (both of the Ohio & Mississippi river system), the gaps of the Allegheny connecting the Susquehanna River Valley in central Pennsylvania with the Allegheny River valley (and again the Ohio Country), and lastly, the Mohawk River water gap and valley tributary of the Hudson River, creating what later advertising would call the level water route westwards. presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2.5 weeks to travel overland from New York to Cleveland, Ohio []; 4 weeks to Detroit []. The principal exportable product of the Ohio Valley was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into whiskey for easier transport and higher sales, and later the Whiskey Rebellion. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly.Joel Achenbach, \\"America's River; From Washington and Jefferson to the Army Corps of Engineers, everyone had grandiose plans to tame the Potomac. Fortunately for us, they all failed\\". The Washington Post, May 5, 2002; p. W.12. In time, projects were devised in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and relatively deep into the coastal states. =Proposals= The alt=Relief map of New York State. alt=Black-and-white photo of aqueduct over curve in canal ;Early proposals The successes of the Canal du Midi in France (1681), Bridgewater Canal in Britain (fully completed 1769), and Eiderkanal (superseded by today's Kiel Canal) in Denmark (later Germany) (1784) spurred on what was called in Britain \\"canal mania\\". The idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was already in the air by 1724: New York provincial official Cadwallader Colden made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York. Two men, Gouverneur Morris and Elkanah Watson, were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies in 1792 (which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario),Calhoun, Daniel Hovey. The American civil engineer: Origins and conflict. Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960. but the company proved that private financing was insufficient. ;Potomac/Patowmack precedent George Washington led a partly enduring effort to turn the Potomac River into a navigable link to the west, sinking substantial energy and capital into the Patowmack Canal from 1785 until his death fourteen years later. By 1788 Washington's Potomac Company was successful in constructing five locks which took boats past the Potomac Great Falls. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal superseded the Potomac Canal in 1823. Christopher Colles (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784 proposing a canal from Lake Ontario. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented. ;Scheme Jesse Hawley finally got the canal built. He had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the Western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the Eastern seaboard. However, he went bankrupt trying to ship grain to the coast. While in Canandaigua debtors' prison, Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the -long Mohawk River valley with support from Joseph Ellicott (agent for the Holland Land Company in Batavia). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner. =Engineering requirements= The Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a glacial meltwater channel just north of the Catskill range of the Appalachian Mountains, separating them from the geologically distinct Adirondacks to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of Alabama, allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lakes Ontario and Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent's interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard. The problem was that the land rises about from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to , so even with the heftiest cuttings and viaducts, fifty locks would be required along the canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President Thomas Jefferson called it \\"a little short of madness\\" and rejected it; however, Hawley interested New York Governor DeWitt Clinton in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \\"Clinton's folly\\" and \\"Clinton's ditch.\\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7 million for construction. The original canal was long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut wide and deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a towpath. Its construction, through limestone and mountains, proved a daunting task. The canal was built using some of the most advanced engineering technology from Holland. In 1823 construction reached the Niagara Escarpment, necessitating the building of five locks along a corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \\"slip scraper\\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York's buildings. All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of aqueducts to redirect water; one aqueduct was long to span of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force. alt=Elevation drawing of the canal's length. =Operation= Lockport, New York in 1839 Canal boats up to in draft were pulled by horses and mules on the towpath. This canal has one towpath generally on the north side. When canal boats met, the boat with the right of way remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \\"hoggee\\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unravelled from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom while his boat decelerated on with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the other boat's towline with their horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat's team would continue on its way. Pulled by teams of horses canal boats still moved slowly but methodically shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the nonstop smooth method of transportation cut nearly in half the travel time between Albany and Buffalo moving day and night. Venturing West men and women boarded packets to visit relatives or solely for a relaxing excursion. Emigrants took passage on freight boats camping on deck or on top of crates. Packet boats serving passengers exclusively reached speeds of up to five miles an hour and ran at much more frequent intervals than cramped, bumpy stages. Packet boats measuring up to seventy-eight feet in length and fourteen and a half feet across made ingenious use of space in order to accommodate up to forty passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime. The best examples furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with current newspapers and books served as sitting rooms during the days. At mealtimes crews transformed the cabin into dining rooms. Drawing a curtain across the width of the room divided the cabin into ladies' and gentlemen's sleeping quarters in the evening hours. Pull down tiered beds folded from the walls and additional cots could be hung from hooks in the ceiling. Some captains hired musicians and held dances. The canal had brought civilization into the wilderness. =The Lehigh and Erie Canals= Two early 19th century canals had inordinately large impacts on the demographic and industrial development of the United States. The daring Erie Canal, begun in 1815 after a decade of debate and contemplation was a bid to join the port of New York City to the promise of the Great Lakes, just then undergoing rapid settlement as the 1779 Sullivan Expedition had brushed aside the Iroquois and opened the Northwest Territory to settlement. The Lehigh Canal Perhaps in part inspired by the news of the Erie's technological achievements, the privately funded Lehigh Canal was an achievement brought about by the energy needs of two visionary industrialists, the politically connected Erskine Hazard and his older partner Josiah White, who together built the Lehigh Canal and the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, founding towns, mines, and building economically productive mining and transportation infrastructure from a wilderness in Eastern Pennsylvania south and west of the Poconos in the Anthracite creating folded ridges of the Ridge and Valley Appalachians. Not a true canal, the 'Lehigh navigation', was the type of canal built along the line of a river valley (within its drainage basin) and parallel to the fall of the watercourse. The Lehigh Canal for a time was two separate civil engineering projects constructed 20 years apart that stretched over two parts of the Lehigh River and totaling along the Lehigh River in eastern Pennsylvania.

Background Ministerialists were a group of members of parliament who supported a government in office but were not bound by tight party discipline. Ministerialists represented loose pre-party groupings who held seats in state parliaments up to 1914. Such members ran for office as independents or under a variety of political labels but saw themselves as linked to other candidates by their support for a particular premier or government. The Labor side of politics was controlled by the Political Labor Council. In 1904 Prendergast became the first leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party. The election saw the emergence of the Commonwealth Liberal Party in Victoria. In 1907, John Murray emerged as the leader of a country faction of Bent's Commonwealth Liberal Party, which opposed Bent's free-spending policies. During 1908, Bent's government began to disintegrate as a result of conflict between country and city interests. After the 1908 election, on 8 January 1909, Murray successfully moved a motion of no-confidence in Bent's government and succeeded him as Premier.

The park contains ecologically restored desert and arid land vegetation. The park was created in 2006 to try and restore the natural ecology of a large, rocky area adjoining and below the fort. It was opened to the public in February 2011. The area in and around the park contains distinctive volcanic rock and sandstone formations. The park includes a Visitors Centre with Interpretation Gallery, a native plant nursery, small shop and cafe. There are four trails (yellow, green, red, and blue trails), about 880 m to 1115 m long, that visitors can take and trained guides and naturalists are also available. Jodhpur Welded Tuff national geological monument Jodhpur Welded Tuff here has been declared the National Geological Monuments of India by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), for their protection, maintenance, promotion and enhancement of geotourism.National Geological Monument, from Geological Survey of India websitenational geo-heritage of India, INTACH The volcanic rocks at Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park were formed somewhere between 745 and 680 million years ago. The volcanic formations are chiefly rhyolite, with welded tuff, and breccia found in some areas. There is a gully passing through the park (an old aqueduct or canal to carry rainwater from a wider catchment in the north to Padamsar lake at the base of the fort), where breccia is visible today. Also seen are rocks with large to intermediate crystal sizes and from fine textured tuff to large-grained (porphyritic) rhyolite.  Plant and animal life  The park has around 250 species of native plants, including a large number of arid region lithophytes. Some of the common plants include trees such as Rohido (Tecomella undulata), Kumatiyo (Acacia senegal), Hingoto (Balanites roxburghii), Peeloo (Salvadora persica), Kharo Jaal (Salvadora oleoides), Sargooro (Moringa concanensis), Goondi (Cordia sinensis), and Bordi (Ziziphus nummularia). Among shrubs, the leafless spurge or Thhor (Euphorbia caducifolia) is one of the common succulents. Other shrubs include Bui (Aerva javanica), Aakado (Calotropis procera), Kair (Capparis decidua), Ghatbor (Fleuggia leucopyrus), Kheer Kheemp (Sarcostemma acidum), Kheemp (Leptadenia pyrotechnica), and Googal (Commiphora wightii).

The Visitors Centre is housed in Singhoria Pol, a 17th-century gateway into Jodpur city, which had fallen into ruins and disrepair. The gateway was restored and the Visitors Centre, completed in February 2011, has an Interpretation Gallery about the desert, plants, and history, integrated into the passages and rooms over and around the gate. The historic city wall that had crumbled in places was also restored, which assisted in protecting the area from grazing livestock during ecological restoration. Ecological restoration was carried out to remove invasive alien plants and bring back the original desert and arid land vegetation of the region. The park area was earlier overrun by Prosopis juliflora (local name baavlia), an invasive, thorny shrub introduced from Central America almost a century ago. The Prosopis juliflora was carefully removed from the volcanic rocks with the help of local Khandwaliya people, expert in rock chiseling. The park now has around 250 species of native plants. A small 'xeriscape' or 'Xeri garden' at the Visitor's Centre has been created to display a range of xeric and rocky microhabitats, each with several characteristic native plant species. The restoration or rewilding project has been spearheaded by Pradip Krishen, a filmmaker who renounced filmmaking due to corruption in the Industry. Mr. Krishen turned to gardening and environmental conservation, serving in this way to rejuvenate the deteriorating Indian landscape and its people. Ecologically restored desert vegetation with Euphorbia caducifolia and other native plants (right of wall), and unrestored area invaded by alien Prosopis julifora shrubs (on left of wall).  Native Plants Nursery  The park has a native plants nursery where native rock-loving and arid region plants are propagated from seeds and cuttings. The nursery is located near the 'piao' or public drinking water station on the way down from the fort. The seedlings raised here are planted out for ecological restoration of the park area each year around the monsoon. Over 80 native plant species have been raised and planted out in the park.

She was elected twice as a senator and in both cases lost her seat as a result of right-wing military coups; she was elected in 1951 and lost her seat in 1955, then was elected again in 1973 and lost her seat again in 1976.  Personal life  She was born in the Floresta neighborhood of Buenos Aires on 12 March 1910. In 1949 she married pianist and orchestral director Francisco Rotundo. She died in Buenos Aires on 21 February 1990 at the age of 79.  Singing career  In 1931 Larrauri began her career as a tango singer on LR3 Radio Nacional (later called Radio Belgrano). In 1936 she made her first record for Odeón. Other radio stations on which she appeared included LS3 Radio Mayo, LS5 Radio Rivadavia, Radio Prieto and Radio Argentina. With Peronism's rise to power in the 40s she postponed her singing career, but she was still featured in 1952 as the singer in \\"Evita Capitana\\" – a feminine hymn to Peronsim – by Rodolfo Sciamarella, and in 1972 she recorded an album titled Canto para mi pueblo. She wrote the tango \\"La piba de mano a mano\\" (one of the tracks on this album) together with Tití Rossi. Apart from her recordings and a few short tours in Argentina and neighboring countries, the bulk of her singing career was on radio. Political life Larrauri joined a group of women that, led by Eva Perón, pushed the passing of the law giving women the right to vote, approved in 1947. Larrauri joined the National Committee of Eva Perón's Women's Peronist Party (Partido Peronista Femenino, or PPF) as the representative of Entre Ríos Province. Other members were Águeda Barro, Dora Gaeta, María Rosa Calviño, Amparo Pérez, and Delia Parodi. In 1951 Larrauri was elected by the provincial legislature of Entre Ríos Province as one of its National Senators, joining a group of the first women to be elected to the Senate. That same year Larrauri sang \\"Evita Capitana\\", which became the anthem of the Women's Peronist Party. In 1952 she became the president of the Commission for the Eva Perón Monument. She was deposed along with all the other elected representatives by a right-wing military coup (the Revolución Libertadora) on 16 September 1955, and was imprisoned by the resulting military dictatorship of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu. During the ban of Peronism (1955–1972) Larrauri became a major leader in the women's branch of the movement known as the \\"Peronist Resistance\\". When the ban on the Justicialist Party (Partido Justicialista) was lifted in 1972, she was a member of its Consejo Superior, representing the women's branch of the Peronist movement, which, at its core, took a position in opposition to Jorge Daniel Paladino. In 1972 she was part of the delegation which accompanied Juan Perón on his return to Argentina. In 1973 she was re-elected as a national senator, and on 24 March 1976 was again deposed along with the other elected representatives when a right-wing military dictatorship under Jorge Rafael Videla overthrew Isabel Martínez de Perón in a coup d'état.

Her father passed away when she was still a young child and Njambi was raised by one parent for most of her childhood. Work On completing her university studies in 1975, Njambi joined Nation Newspapers as a features writer. She would later move to East Africa Industries (now Unilever Kenya) where she worked for 5 years and established the communications department. Njambi was also tasked with producing a corporate magazine. This is where she first thought of starting her own magazine. She registered her company in 1981 and Consumer Digest magazine was born in 1984. More inspiration would come in 1985 during the United Nations Third World Conference on Women held in Nairobi where she was the assistant editor for the conference's official publication. Parents Africa Njambi established Parents in 1986 and issued the launch edition in July of the same year. There were 25,000 copies and it was a sell-out. In order to ensure she balanced her work and family, she folded Consumer Digest and focused on Parents magazine. She initially produced the magazine every 2 months. It centered on family, relationships and would become the first Kenyan mainstream magazine to discuss sexual topics quite elaborately. The magazine has been on Kenyan newsstands since. The cover features regular Kenyan couples and their children with about 20 couples requesting to be put on the cover each month.

It lies close to the entrance to the Bay of Santander near the city of Santander, Cantabria along the north coast of Spain. The island is approximately 2 hectares (0.02km²) and lies about .75 km (.5 mi) from the entrance to the harbor. History Mouro Island from the northeast, with Santander in the background and the small Corbera Islet in the foreground The original name of the island, found in 16th-century documents, was Mogro Island. In the 18th century, a transcription error by cartographer Vicente Tofiño de San Miguel changed the name to Mouro Island. In July 1812, during the Peninsular War, Spanish ally Great Britain captured the island from Napoleon's forces, allowing the Spanish ships to make landfall at Sardinero. The only structure on the island is a 19th-century lighthouse, which is now automated. Until 1921, it was occupied by two lighthouse keepers, who were often isolated by storms. In 1865, one of the keepers was swept out to sea during a storm and drowned. In 1895, one of the keepers died suddenly, but due to the storm, his body was not able to be evacuated for some time. Another death was recorded when the son of a lighthouse keeper slipped when he was about to step onto the rocky island and died. In February 2014, a spectacular photograph of a wave crashing over the lighthouse appeared in newspapers around the world, including on the cover of the International New York Times. Plants and wildlife Waves crashing into Mouro Island Mouro Island has a high biodiversity of fish and plant life in its waters, with more than 39 species of fish found nearby. It was declared a marine reserve in 1986, with a perimeter extending to 300 meters surrounding the island. Plants found on the island include heath (Erica vagans), gorse (ulex), broom (genisteae) and the eagle fern (Pteridium aquilinum). Carpobrotus edulis is also found on the island, thought to be brought there by a lighthouse keeper. Mouro Island is an important habitat for seabirds, particularly European storm petrels and herring gulls. In 2014, Spain's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment declared Mouro Island to be a Special Protection Area (SPA) to ensure the conservation of the birds that inhabit this area. It was estimated that fewer than 150 of the storm petrel lived in the area. It is illegal to bring cats, rats and other mammals onto the island. A smaller islet to the northwest, Islote la Corbera, is also part of the protected area. World Oceans Day An annual swim and scuba diving event is held around Mouro Island to mark World Oceans Day each June. It features an island \\"hugging\\" event, in which surfers and kayakers completely encircle the island. The event is held to raise awareness of the importance of conserving the seas and oceans.

Operational history *1 April 1944: VB-200 was established at NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, as a combat replacement unit providing instruction on multiengine patrol aircraft. The personnel and equipment for the new squadron were drawn from the HEDRON Multiengine Replacement Unit, FAW-2. The squadron's primary duties included training replacement crews, ferrying aircraft and stand-by offshore patrol for Anti- submarine warfare and rescue work. Sections of the squadron operated on Johnston and Midway Atolls for rescue duties. Training squadrons like VB-200 trained fresh crews arriving from the U.S. in their final phases of combat training before being sent into the combat zone. VB-200 trained crews in land- based aircraft such as the PB4Y-1 Liberator, PB4Y-2 Privateer and PV-1 Ventura. *October 1944: The training squadrons at NAS Kaneohe initially worked with intact squadrons destined for combat deployments. In October 1944 the policy was changed to keep squadrons in the operational areas while sending in new crews to replace combat losses and crews due for rotation based on time- in-theater points. *May 1945: VPB-200 conducted experiments for the Bureau of Aeronautics in picking up mail with hooks from surface vessels towing kites and balloons. Several successful trials were conducted but the method did not become a standard operating procedure throughout the fleet. *24 Oct 1945: VPB-200 was disestablished at NAS Kaneohe, Hawaii.

It was formed in Bengal Presidency, British India, in 1928 by Latika Ghosh upon the instigation of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent Indian nationalist leader. Believing that improvement of the status of women and achievement of self-governance for India were inseparable aims, the MRS was an empowerment institution body that placed much emphasis on education as a means to achieve its goal. The name translates as the Women's Political Association.  Background  Latika Bose (née Ghosh), a niece of Aurobindo Ghose, had impressed Subhas Chandra Bose with her marshalling of a women's protest against the Simon Commission, following which the latter asked her to organise the MRS in 1928. Latika, who was a teacher educated at the University of Oxford and a supporter of Gandhi's satyagraha, recruited and led around 300 women from colleges and academic departments as part of the protest by the Bengal Volunteers at the 1928 session of the Indian National Congress. She baulked at Subhas's command that all involved in this event should wear military uniform, deciding instead that the women would wear red-bordered dark green saris and white blouses. This and other decisions, such as ensuring that the women did not stay in the protesters' camp overnight, together with a threat to withdraw their aid in matters such as selling tickets and supplying tea, ensured that she overcame the opposition of Sarat Bose, who had been concerned that the presence of women might offend conservative supporters of Congress.  Formation and aims  Latika Bose agreed to form the MRS only after some thought because she knew that this would involve her having a high-profile connection to the Indian National Congress and thus would pit her against the British Raj authorities and prevent her from being accepted for employment by the Raj Educational Service. Despite the opinion of Subhas, Latika selected his mother, Prabhabati Bose, to be the first president and Latika's sister-in-law, Bivabati, became the first vice-president. Subhas had wanted Basanti Devi to be president but Latika considered her to be too distant for most Bengali women because of the extent to which Devi had been westernised, and she also appreciated that having the mother of the most prominent Bengali nationalist as an office- holder would appeal to potential supporters. Latika Bose herself took the role of secretary. The MRS, which was founded in Chittagong, Bengal Presidency, saw their aim of improvements in the status of women and the achievement of swaraj (self-governance) as being mutually dependent. Education of women was a key to this and the MRS involved ten existing local educational groups from the outset. According to historian Geraldine Forbes, MRS leaders \\"argued the nation could never be free unless women's lives improved and improving women's lives depended on freedom from foreign domination\\". Latika Bose appealed for women to see the similarities of the women's struggle in the battles waged between the devas and asuras of Hindu mythology, and in the self-sacrifices of Rajput queens who had surrendered their male relatives to battle before preparing to die themselves in acts of jauhar (self-immolation). Recruits came initially from the families of existing INC members because without their approval the women would not have been allowed to participate. The members were taught about independence and also received instruction in literacy, first aid, motherhood, and self-defence.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Two (VP-202) on 15 September 1942, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Two (VPB-202) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 20 June 1945. Operational history *15 September 1942–January 1943: VP-202 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, as a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3 Mariner under the operational control of PatWing-5. The squadron remained at Norfolk in training and in November began receiving the newer PBM-3C with radar. Familiarization training, radar bombing, gunnery and navigation training continued through the end of January 1943. *8 February–November 1943: VP-202 relocated to NAS Key West, Florida, under the operational control of FAW-12. The aircraft were modified at this time to the \\"S\\" or \\"stripped\\" configuration. Armor plate, gun turrets and all excess gear was removed to lighten the aircraft and make room for more fuel storage to enable the aircraft to patrol further in the Anti- submarine warfare (ASW) role. A three-aircraft detachment was maintained at Grand Cayman, British West Indies, from 28 February through 18 November 1943. The squadron's principal duties were patrol and convoy coverage. *1–28 December 1943: VP-202 transferred to NAS Norfolk, under FAW-5, for refitting with new PBM-3Ds. The shakedown and familiarization training continued through the 27th. On 28 December the squadron began ferrying its new aircraft to NAS San Diego, California, as a stopover en route to NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. *7–22 January 1944: VP-202 deployed in elements of three aircraft to NAS Kaneohe Bay. On 15 January the squadron began departing in elements to Tarawa, under the operational control of FAW-2. The squadron was the first combat squadron of Mariner seaplanes to operate in the Pacific theater. While on Tarawa the squadron patrolled the Japanese-held Marshall and Caroline islands. On 31 January Japanese airfields in the Taroa Island group were bombed and strafed in a night raid. *1 February 1944: VP-202 relocated to Majuro, in the Gilbert-Ellice Island area. From this base the squadron flew missions against Ponape. These raids were the first ever made against the Japanese installations on Ponape. *6 February 1944: The squadron was sent to Kwajalein Atoll, still under combat by opposing American and Japanese ground forces. One aircraft crashed during an attempted night landing, killing five of the crew. *24 February–June 1944: VP-202 relocated to Eniwetok on the heels of the invasion forces. The condition of the squadron's aircraft by this date was so poor that it was forced to return to Hawaii for much needed repairs. The squadron was relieved on 1 March for return to NAS Kaneohe Bay, with the last aircraft arriving on 15 March. Through mid-June VP-202 remained at NAS Kaneohe Bay with a detachment of three aircraft at Kwajalein. The squadron underwent maintenance and overhaul, with two sector searches assigned daily from NAS Kaneohe Bay. *15 June 1944: VP-202 deployed to NAB Ebeye, Kwajalein Atoll, with the last aircraft arriving on 25 June. The squadron remained under the operational control of FAW-2, CTG 49.3. Primary duties of the squadron were daily mail flights from Kwajalein to Saipan and Eniwetok. The Japanese shore batteries on Saipan at this time were still active. The squadron pilots would land from shore and watch the splashes of shells as the enemy gunners opened fire on them. *17 July–September 1944: The squadron relocated from Kwajalein to Saipan, with tender support provided by and . A detachment of three crews and aircraft operated off with VP-16. This detachment was moved to on 19 August to operate with VP-18. Constant patrols were flown over the islands of Guam, Rota, Pagan and the Bonin Islands, within of Tokyo. The wear and tear on the aircraft and particularly the engines began to show. The entire squadron stood down on 1 through 11 September for maintenance and overhaul. *12–19 September 1944: Squadron tenders USS Chandeleur and USS Pocomoke departed Saipan for Kossel Passage, Palau. The squadron followed and arrived on the 17th, coming under the operational control of FAW1. VP-202 was back in operation by the 19th, flying daylight patrols. *27 September 1944: VP-202 relocated to Ulithi, with tender services provided by . Duties at this location consisted of antishipping patrols and daylight searches. *18 October 1944: VPB-202 was relieved at Ulithi for return to Hawaii. Upon arrival on 30 October, squadron personnel enjoyed the rest facilities at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel while awaiting transportation back to the U.S. A CVE was loaded with squadron personnel and arrived at San Diego, California, on 21 November 1944. All personnel were given orders to new squadrons and home leave. *1 January–Jun 1945: VPB-202 reformed at NAS San Diego, under the operational control of FAW-14. It remained at San Diego in training until disestablished on 20 June 1945.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Three (VP-203) on 1 October 1942, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Three (VPB-203) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 30 June 1945. Operational history *1 October 1942: VP-203 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, as a medium seaplane patrol squadron flying the PBM-3C Mariner. While in training the squadron came under the operational control of PatWing-5. The squadron complement was 15 aircraft, three of which were spares. *10 December 1942–February 1943: A six- aircraft detachment of the squadron flew to NS San Juan, Puerto Rico, for a period of shakedown and Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training, coming under the operational control of FAW-11. The remainder of the squadron joined the detachment at intervals over the next two weeks. The squadron’s first operational loss occurred on 31 December 1942 when Lieutenant (jg) E. M. Vogel crashed on takeoff in San Juan Bay, killing three of the crew. When aviation gasoline supplies ran short at San Juan, six aircraft were sent to Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for training on 31 January 1943. In February the squadron was transferred back to NAS Norfolk. All of the aircraft arrived at Norfolk by 1 March, ready for return to operational status. *1 March–June 1943: VP-203 commenced regular operational duties under the operational control of FAW-5, escorting convoys and conducting ASW patrols. The first attack on a U-boat took place on 10 June 1943, but with negative results due to a defective bomb-release mechanism. *17 June 1943: The squadron’s PBM-3Cs underwent conversion to the “S” or “stripped” model. Turrets, armor plate and other extraneous gear were removed to make room for extra fuel and to lighten the aircraft to enable a greater range on patrols. *18 July 1943: Lieutenant Commander Morris D. Burns relieved Lieutenant Commander James R. Reedy as the squadron’s commanding officer. Commander Reedy and approximately half of the squadron pilots and plane crews detached to form a new PB4Y-1 Liberator squadron, VB-110. Four crews from VP-209 and five from VP-211 were transferred to VP-203 to bring it back up to full strength *1–25 September 1943: Attacks were made on U-boats on 1 and 4 September. Both obtained negative results. On 25 September, the squadron moved to a new home port at NAS Floyd Bennett Field, New York, placing the squadron under the operational control of FAW-9. Its principal duties remained the same as before, ASW and convoy escort. *4 October 1943: VP-203 received orders to deploy to NAF Aratu, Bahia, Brazil, to relieve VP-74. The squadron was then placed under the operational control of FAW-16. The squadron’s aircraft continued to arrive at Aratu through 23 November, a detachment of five aircraft was formed and sent to NAF Natal, Brazil, for advanced base operations. This group conducted sweeps out to from shore. *5 January 1944: While on patrol Lieutenant S. V. Brown sighted a suspicious-looking merchant vessel. Subsequent investigation proved that the ship was actually the German blockade runner MV Burgenland. and were dispatched to the scene and sank the ship after a running gun battle. *16 January 1944: VP-203 relocated its administrative headquarters to NAF Galeão, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with one detachment. One squadron detachment remained at NAF Natal and another at NAF Aratu, Brazil. The Aratu detachment rejoined the squadron at Galeão on 23 January. *4 Apr 1944: A U-boat was spotted on the surface at night using the wing-mounted Leigh light. The aircraft made a strafing run, forcing the submarine to crash dive, but with negative results. *21 April 1944: Lieutenant (jg) W. N. Britton and his crew spotted 20 British sailors adrift in a small life raft, survivors of a torpedoed merchantman. Ironically, none of the 20 sailors in the raft had been harmed during their ordeal until Britton’s crew dropped supplies of food and water directly on the raft, knocking one man unconscious. The victims were safely picked up a short time later. *16 May 1944: The Natal detachment relocated to Aratu, then on to Florianoplis, Brazil, for advanced base operations. Tender support was provided by . These operations were discontinued on 30 July, and they rejoined the Aratu detachment. On 14 August the remainder of the squadron, including the headquarters group, joined the detachment at Aratu. One detachment remained at Galeão until 5 November. *20 July 1944: The squadron’s second operational loss occurred when Lieutenant Livio DeBonis and his crew failed to return from a routine patrol. A merchant ship later confirmed that an aircraft crashed, with no survivors, at coordinates matching DeBonis’ patrol sector. *4 October 1944: Four VPB-203 crews were detached from the squadron and ordered to duty at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. The losses were not replaced, decreasing the squadron aircraft complement from 15 to a total of 9. *21 November 1944: One of the squadron aircraft was lost en route from Natal to Aratu during an intense tropical thunderstorm. Aircraft wreckage, an oil slick and empty life rafts were found at sea, but no survivors. *5 January 1945: A detachment of aircraft was sent to NAF Aratu, with tender services provided by and later USS Matagorda. A second detachment was formed on the 21st at Bahia based on and a third detachment was sent to Natal, Brazil. *29 May 1945: VPB-203 was relieved for return to NAS San Juan, where all of the squadron aircraft were turned over to HEDRON-11. Squadron personnel were transported aboard to New Orleans, Louisiana, then by train to NAS Norfolk, where the squadron was disestablished on 30 June 1945.

His figures show an affinity to the geometry of Cezanne and Matisse, but later works introduce elements of abstraction. Biography Morlotti was born in Lecco in Lombardy. His early life was difficult and impoverished. He studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence from 1936 to 1937. He would mainly paint landscapes. He then traveled to Paris for a year, and returned in 1939 to Milan, where he briefly studied at the Brera Academy. After the war, he returned to Paris in 1947 and participated in the Fronte Nuovo delle Arti. He lived mostly in Milan, occasionally travelling to Liguria.

Operational history *15 November 1942: VP-206 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, under the operational control of FAW-5 as a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3C Mariner. On 21 January 1943 the squadron was transferred to NAS Charleston, South Carolina, for advanced training in bombing, gunnery, navigation and Anti- submarine warfare (ASW). The squadron then operated with its full complement of PBM-3C aircraft equipped with the ASV Mark II radar. *1 April 1943: VP-206 was transferred to NAS Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, under the operational control of FAW-3. The squadron aircraft were loaded with as much of the squadron gear and personnel as possible. The remainder of the equipment, supplies and personnel were shipped aboard , arriving on 8 April. Duties consisted of antishipping patrols, convoy coverage sweeps and shipping barrier patrols. On 1 June detachments were established at Salinas, Ecuador and Seymour Islands, Galapagos. *July–August 1943: The Galapagos detachment was relieved, and a detachment was sent to NAF Portland Bight, Jamaica, British West Indies. *7 September 1943: A detachment was sent to Corinto, Nicaragua. The rest of the squadron joined the detachment at Corinto on 5 February 1944. *24 April 1944: VP-206 was relieved at Corinto, for return to NAS Key West, Florida, coming under the operational control of FAW-5. Upon arrival, the squadron began an intensive ASW refresher course. The squadron’s PBM-3C aircraft were retrofitted to the S or stripped, designation—removing armor plate, gun turrets and all extraneous gear to lighten the Mariners and increase range and speed. *7 May 1944: The squadron received orders to transfer to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, under the operational control of FAW-9. VP-206 commenced convoy coverage and patrol sweeps over the Atlantic convoy approaches to the northeastern U.S. Five PBY-5 Catalinas were added to the squadron’s complement of aircraft during its stay at Quonset Point. *15 January 1945: VPB-206 was transferred to NAAS Elizabeth City, North Carolina, under the operational control of FAW-5. The Catalina aircraft were turned in before the transfer went into effect. *22 May 1945: After 30 months of operation without the loss of single aircraft, a severe hurricane struck North Carolina before any of the squadron aircraft could be flown out. Every one of the squadron's 12 aircraft at NAAS Elizabeth City were damaged, all but one severely, putting the squadron temporarily out of commission. *4 June 1945: VPB-206 was disestablished at NAAS Elizabeth City.

Somerset Maugham Lady Frederick is a comedy by the British writer W. Somerset Maugham, written early in his career. The play was first seen in London in 1907, and was very successful, running for 422 performances. The title role was played by Ethel Irving. In New York it was first performed in 1908, with Lady Frederick played by Ethel Barrymore, who reprised her role in the play's film adaptation, The Divorcee. In the play, Lady Frederick is an Irish widow, seriously in debt; she must deal with suitors who have various motives for proposing marriage, and with the man with whom she once had an affair. History Maugham's first play, A Man of Honour, was produced by the Stage Society in 1902, after being refused by several managers, and had some success. He was unable to get his next play Loaves and Fishes produced. Lady Frederick was written in 1903. Maugham wrote about its origins: > I reflected upon the qualities which the managers demanded in a play: > evidently a comedy, for the public wished to laugh; with as much drama as it > would carry, for the public liked a thrill; with a little sentiment, for the > public liked to feel good; and a happy ending. I realised that I should have > more chance to get a play accepted if I wrote a star part for an actress... > I asked myself what sort of part would be most likely to tempt a leading > lady.... The answer was obvious: the adventuress with a heart of gold; > titled, for the sex is peculiarly susceptible to the glamour of romance; the > charming spendthrift and the wanton of impeccable virtue; the clever manager > who twists all and sundry round her little finger and the kindly and > applauded wit....The Collected Plays of W. Somerset Maugham, volume 1. > Heinemann, 1961. Preface, pages vii–xi. The play was refused by many managers. Maugham wrote: \\"... it had in the third act a scene in which the heroine had to appear dishevelled, with no make-up on, and have her hair done while she arranged her face before the audience. No actress would look at it....\\" Otho Stuart, at the Royal Court Theatre in London, had had an unexpected failure; needing a play during the time required to get another play ready, he accepted Lady Frederick. It was first produced there on 26 October 1907, with Ethel Irving as Lady Frederick. It transferred to the Garrick Theatre, the Criterion Theatre, the New Theatre and the Haymarket Theatre; it ran for 422 performances. In New York the play was first seen on 9 November 1908 at the Hudson Theatre; it featured Ethel Barrymore as Lady Frederick and Bruce McRae as Paradine Fouldes. It ran for 96 performances.Lady Frederick at the Internet Broadway Database Critical reception A reviewer in The Daily Chronicle wrote: > Lady Frederick is just a conventional, tricky comedy, not quite clever > enough at its own game....

Graham Brown * Captain Montgomerie – Arthur Holmes-Gore * Admiral Carlisle – E. W. Garden * Rose (his daughter) – Beatrice Terry Summary =Act I= Ethel Barrymore in 1908, when she was playing Lady Frederick in the original New York production. The scene is a drawing-room of the Hotel de Paris Monte-Carlo. Lady Mereston wants her brother Paradine Fouldes to stop her son Charles's affair with Lady Frederick: she is 15 years his senior, and in debt. Lady Frederick tells the Admiral that her brother Gerald wants to marry his daughter Rose. The Admiral, knowing that Gerald is a gambler, disapproves. Paradine Fouldes once had an affair with Lady Frederick. He has a long conversation with her about her possibly marrying Charles; saying \\"I'm going to play this game with my cards on the table,\\" she replies \\"You're never so dangerous as when you pretend to be frank.\\" Eventually Lady Frederick, saying \\"you've not seen my cards yet,\\" produces love-letters from Charles's late father to a singer at the Folies Bergère. She invites Paradine to burn them, but he declines, saying \\"It's not fair to take an advantage over me like that. You'd bind my hands with fetters.\\" Captain Montgomerie asks Lady Frederick to marry him; Gerald later tells her that it was because he is in debt to Montgomerie. =Act II= The same scene as Act I. Lady Frederick has found that her creditor has sold the debt, and does not know who now has it; this increases her anxiety. Fouldes suggests getting out of debt by selling him the love-letters (produced in Act I). Lady Frederick's dressmaker, to whom she owes money, comes in. Lady Frederick tells her she regards her as one of her best friends; flattered, the dressmaker refuses to accept the cheque she starts to write. Montgomerie talks to Lady Frederick: it emerges that he has bought her debts. He says he wants to get into fashionable society; if she marries him, he will burn the bills and Gerald's IOU. Charles tells Lady Mereston and Fouldes that he knows of Fouldes' affair with Lady Frederick – he thinks she did not really love him. When Lady Mereston produces a letter written by Lady Frederick which seems to show that she was someone's mistress. Charles believes her explanation of the letter, that there was no affair. Lady Frederick burns the love-letters (produced in Act I), so she never has the temptation to use them. She says she wants nothing to do with Charles. But Charles asks her to marry him. =Act III= The scene is Lady Frederick's dressing room. Charles arrives to hear Lady Frederick's answer, and is shown to her dressing room. She has her hair done by her maid, and makes up her face: this is her answer, she says, to his proposal; if she married him, she would have to continue trying to appear youthful. The Admiral has given Gerald a cheque for the money owed to Montgomerie; his gambling debts settled, Gerald can marry Rose. The Admiral asks Lady Frederick to marry him. When Montgomerie comes in for the money she owes him, she prevaricates, saying she has already sent it. Eventually Fouldes gives Montgomerie a cheque to settle the debt. Finally, Fouldes talks to Lady Frederick. He is glad she burnt the letters, which, he says, she did in spite of being provoked by his sister Lady Mereston; he says they should get married, and she consents. Epigrams Maugham wrote that an American manager \\"asked me to write in some more epigrams. He said it wanted gingering up. I went away, and in two hours wrote as well as I could twenty-four.\\" Among the epigrams in the play: * Lady Mereston: \\"It's one of the injustices of fate that clothes only hang on a woman really well when she's lost every shred of reputation.\\" * Fouldes: \\"Common report is an ass whose long ears only catch its own braying.\\" * Lady Frederick: \\"When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war.\\" * Fouldes: \\"There's no one so transparent as the person who thinks he's devilish deep.\\" * Fouldes: \\"The lover who's diffident is in a much worse way than the lover who protests.\\" References 1907 plays British plays adapted into films Plays by W.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Seven (VP-207) on 1 December 1942, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Seven (VPB-207) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 26 June 1945. Operational history *1 December 1942: VP-207 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, as a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3C Mariner under the operational control of FAW-5. Training and aircraft familiarization was conducted through mid-January 1943. *22 January–February 1943: VP-207 was transferred to NS San Juan, Puerto Rico, under the operational control of FAW-11. After three weeks the squadron was transferred to NAAF Salinas. A detachment was sent to NAAF Galapagos, Seymour Island, Ecuador, arriving on 11 February 1943. The squadron flew patrol between Salinas, the Galapagos Islands and Corinto, Nicaragua. During the first month at Salinas, three crews and aircraft were on detached duty to NAS Jamaica, British West Indies, to assist in Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) “hot spot” searches. *13 May 1943: Lieutenant (jg) William Beyer and crew made a forced landing at sea two miles from NS San Juan. The aircraft sank, but no crewmen were injured. *15 March 1944: Crew P-42 with PPC Lieutenant Richard Boehme spotted a U-boat on the surface at 23:19 and began circling for a favorable position preparatory to a bombing run. Anti-aircraft fire from the submarine damaged the aircraft before an attack could be made and wounded Ensign Douglas K. Kelsey. The aircraft returned safely to base.

Development of brilanestrant was discontinued by Roche in April 2017. It reached phase II clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer prior to the discontinuation of its development. Mechanism of action Similarly to tamoxifen, a SERM, brilanestrant shows some capacity to activate the ER in certain contexts and possesses weak estrogenic activity in the rat uterus, and unlike fulvestrant, which is currently the only SERD to have been marketed, brilanestrant is not a steroid and is orally bioavailable and does not need to be administered by intramuscular injection. Brilanestrant has been found to be active in tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant in vitro models of human breast cancer. Side effects observed in clinical studies of brilanestrant thus far have included diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue of mostly mild-to-moderate severity.

Formed in 2013, it cooperates with the Turkish Armed Forces in the Turkish occupation of northern Syria. History Yasser Abu al-Sheikh, commander of the Hamza Brigade until his death in April 2016 =2013= The Hamza Division was originally formed as the Hamza Brigade of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the southern countryside of the Hasakah Governorate in northeast Syria in 2013. =2016= On 23 April 2016, five FSA groups based in the town of Mare' in the northern Aleppo Governorate countryside, the Hamza Brigade, the Dhi Qar Brigade, the Northern Thunder Brigade, the Mare Resistance Brigade, and the Special Operations Brigade merged into the Hamza Division, citing \\"interests of unity\\" and proclaiming its intention to fight the \\"crime and terror\\" of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Syrian government. Under the command of Syrian Army defector Lt. Sayf Balud (\\"Sayf Abu Bakr\\"), the factions receive military support from CJTF-OIR, the international coalition against ISIL. In June 2016, the Northern Thunder Brigade received BGM-71 TOW missiles from CJTF-OIR. Also that month, a Syrian Turkmen group called the \\"Samarkand Brigade\\", named after the city in Uzbekistan, joined the Hamza Division. During Operation Euphrates Shield in late August, the Hamza Division became one of the first FSA groups to enter Jarabulus from Karkamış. Sayf Balud was among those who followed behind Turkish Land Forces tanks and troops and entered Jarabulus in the morning of the first day of the operation, reaching the city center by afternoon. He later gave a speech to residents in Jarabulus. On 18 October 2016, the Northern Thunder Brigade, part of the Hamza Division, issued an ultimatum to the YPG and the Army of Revolutionaries, warning them to leave Tell Rifaat within 48 hours after which they would attack the town. The threat was not carried out. =2017= On 24 September 2017, the Hamza Division announced the opening of a military academy in the city of al-Bab. According to Abdullah Halawa, the military commander of the group, 2,200 fighters were to undergo two months of training in the academy, with the goal of forming a \\"Syrian National Army\\" in northern Syria. =2018= In January 2018, the group participated in Operation Olive Branch, the Turkish Armed Forces' invasion of the Afrin Region, against the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces. In February, the Kurdish Falcons Brigade (aka Red Berets) was formed as part of the Hamza Division. Led by Hasan Abdullah Kulli, it claimed to consist of 400 Kurds and 200 Arabs. The TAF and TFSA captured Afrin on 18 March 2018, after SDF fighters withdrew from the city. On 25 March, Hamza Division fighters killed a commander of Ahrar al-Sharqiya in Afrin in a dispute over territory and spoils of war, resulting in clashes between the two groups.https://investigativejournal.org/empathy-for-the-enemy- a-former-free-syrian-army-soldier-returns-to-afrin/ In response, Ahrar al- Sharqiya arrested around 200 Hamza Division fighters. A ceasefire agreement between the two groups was signed on the same day under Turkish supervision. In June 2018, the Hamza Division assassinated an Ahrar al-Sham commander in al-Bab. =2019= According to a unidentified activist in Afrin, the Hamza Division was among the Turkish-backed insurgent groups which volunteered to send fighters to Libya as part of a Turkish-led operation to aid the Tripoli- based Government of National Accord in December 2019. =2020= In May 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported several deaths of Syrian fighters in Libya, including Hamza members. On 28 May, protestors in Afrin demanded the withdrawal of the Hamza Division from Afrin after several reported and alleged abuses carried out by the group including holding female prisoners naked. During the protests, members of Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al- Islam exiled from East Ghouta clashed with the Hamza Division at their headqaurters, and eventually were able to take over the group's headqaurters and arrested several Hamza Division members; during the confrontation, 3 Hamza Division members were killed in clashes with Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar al- Sham.https://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=167177 References Anti- government factions of the Syrian Civil War Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Free Syrian Army Military units and formations established in 2013 Syrian National Army ","title":"Hamza Division (Aleppo)"},{"id":"51508766","text":"Mercy is a 2016 American thriller film written and directed by Chris Sparling.

The Austrian fleet, based on the eastern bank of the lake, was larger, more modern and better-armed than their Italian counterpart, and successfully maintained control of the waters, hindering the movement of Italian troops.  Background  Aerial view of the Austrian fortress of Peschiera del Garda At the outset of the war, the border between Austria and Italy ran down the middle of the lake. The Brescia region to the west lay within Italy while Verona and the lands east of the lake were Austrian. Austria controlled Riva del Garda at the northern tip of the lake, as well as the important fortress of Peschiera del Garda on the west bank of the River Mincio at its southern end. Peschiera was part of the so-called 'Quadrilateral' of strong core Austrian defences,Venetia redeemed; Franco- Italian relations, 1864-1866, John W. Bush Syracuse University Press, 1967, p.3 leaving the exposed eastern shore of Lake Garda an area of potential weakness, vulnerable to Italian infiltration. This might have involved a strike from the north end of the Lake up the valley of the Chiese river to threaten Trento and cut off the supply lines of the Austrian forces in the Veneto.Review of the Austro-Italian War, 1866, Captain Walter James Wyatt, Edward Stanford, London 1867 p.13 It might also have involved a landing of forces behind Peschiera to threaten Verona. On the Italian side, the buildup of Austrian naval strength caused concerns about a possible Austrian attack across the lake towards Brescia. The Opposing Forces The Austrian paddle steamer Hess During the years before 1866 war Austria had built up a powerful flotilla of steam-powered screw gunboats on Lake Garda. The Garda flotilla had seen some action during the 1859 war against France, when the Austrian gunboat Benaco was sunk off Salò by a Piedmontese battery on 20 June 1859. Afterwards the Emperor Franz Josef, on the suggestion of his brother, Navy Commander Archduke Ferdinand Max, moved It from army to navy control. With its headquarters in Torri del Benaco on the east bank of the lake, supported by the fortified bases at Peschiera and Riva del Garda, it Included 22 boats: 6 modern screw-driven gunboats - Wildfang, Raufbold, Wespe, Uskoke, Scharfschütze and Speiteufel, 2 large armed paddlesteamers (Hess and Franz Joseph), a dozen launches, a pair of armed barges at Peschiera for use as floating batteries, a half-dozen unarmed sailboats for scouting purposes and the 3rd Marine Infantry Company stationed at Peschiera, giving a total armament of 62 cannons and 10 mortars. In May this flotilla was placed under the command of Corvetten-Capitän Moriz Manfroni von Manfort, a well-known gunnery expert. He first placed his flag on board the Hess, with its larger and more comfortable accommodation, but shifted his command to the more effective Speiteufel on 10 June as war appeared imminent. alt=Augusto Elia.jpg The Italian Garda squadron had its headquarters on the west bank of the lake in Salò. It consisted of two Italian-built wooden steam gunboats, the Solferino and San Martino, a third steam gunboat, the Torrione, donated by Napoleon III in 1859 (the Frassineto, Castenedolo and Pozzolengo, also donated by Napoleon, were out of service at the start of the conflict), and the paddle steamer Verbania, later renamed the Benaco. It also included a company of light infantry, the \\"Cacciatori di Garda\\", and once war broke out more ground forces were attached, including the 1st Battalion of the 10th Volunteer Regiment from Garibaldi's corps and a detachment of seven heavy guns. The Italians gathered as many sailboats and other small craft as they could and concentrated them at their base at Salò at the southwestern corner of the lake for possible use in amphibious assaults across the lake. The flotilla was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Augusto Elia.Bezzecca 1866: la Campagna Garibaldina fra l'Adda e il Garda, Ugo Zaniboni Ferino, Museo Trentino del Risorgimento e della Lotta per la Libertà, 1987 p.183  Operations  Gargnano being bombarded by the Austrian navy, 1866 At the start of hostilities of 25 June, the Austrians immediately sailed out to threaten Salo and prevent any movement of Italian troops. On June 30, the Austrian ships bombarded the railway station at Desenzano, a supply and communications point for the Italian Volunteer Corps of Giuseppe Garibaldi, but caused only minor damage. More substantial action took place on July 2, at 5 am, when four Austrian gunboats, including the Hess and Franz Joseph, bombarded the centre of Gargnano, Guerra Italo-Prussiana contro l'Austria nel 1866, Giovanni Cecchini, Giovanni Cecchini, Venice 1871 p.767 where there was a strong concentration of Garibaldi's forces. The bombardment caused extensive damage to homes, one dead and eight wounded among the defending volunteers of the 2nd Regiment. The Austrian flotilla was eventually compelled to withdraw under fire from an Italian battery commanded by Captain Achille Afan de Rivera. Other skirmishes took place on the lake every few days. On 6 July, Italian volunteers forces, equipped with nine long-range guns borrowed from a coastal battery at Maderno, ambushed the Austrian gunboat Wildfang at Gargagno. The gunboat was hit twice, for no losses for Garibaldi's army. At the same time, the Italian flotilla sailed out from Salo to chase the armoured gunboat Wespe, on patrol off Maderno. The Austrian vessel managed to disangage after receiving support from Speiteufel and Scharfschütze. Italian sources claim that the Wespe was forced to seek shelter at Malcesine. The next significant combat occurred on July 19 when the Italian paddle steamer Benaco head out from Salo for Gargnano towing the sailboat Poeta, both ships carrying reinforcement troops and loaded with supplies for the volunteers in the mountains of Valvestino and Tremosine. The Benaco was suddenly attacked by two Austrian gunboats, the Wildfang and Schwarzschütze, which forced it in to shore near Gargnano, where most of the crew, troops and supplies were landed during the night. The next morning Austrian whalerboats were able to capture the abandoned Benaco, still with a small gun and some rifle ammunition in her holds, and tow it away as a prize to Peschiera. One of the whalerboats capsized under Italian fire, but was eventually recovered by the Austrian flotilla. Three Austrian sailors were wounded, while heavy shelling on Gargnano killed two Italian volunteers. The Poeta managed to sail away, only to sink shortly after off San Carlo. A second convoy from Salo, consisting in another sailboat escorted by the Italian flotilla, was forced back two days later by the Austrian gunboats Speiteufel, Uskoke and Wespe. The Benaco was handed back to the Italian government at the end of the hostilities. The final action of the war took place at the north end of the lake. After skirmishes on the lake on 24 July, Manfroni learned that the Austrian army had abandoned Riva del Garda, which was one of his key supply points. To prevent the town falling to Garibaldi, he steamed north and occupied the fortifications in the town with his marines, and on 25 July his forces were able to hold off Garibaldi's volunteers until nightfall. At 10 p.m. the Hess arrived with a telegram confirming that a cease-fire had been declared between Austria and Italy.  Conclusion  The Austrian fleet succeeded in dominating the lake until the end of the war, preventing any movement of Italian forces onto the eastern shore. It also hindered the movement of Italian supplies along the west coast and slowed down any effective attack into the Chiesa valley. The Austrian flotilla did not long outlive the war. The armistice of 25 July was followed by the Treaty of Vienna in which Austria ceded Venetia to Italy. After this all of Lake Garda fell within Italian territory except for the northern tip around Riva del Garda, which remained part of Austria. Austria therefore sold its Garda fleet to Italy for one million florins.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed September 2, 2016 southwestward-flowing stream originating on Snow Valley Peak in the Carson Range of the Sierra Nevada. Most of the stream is in Carson City, Nevada, United States. It is a tributary stream of Lake Tahoe culminating at Glenbrook in Douglas County on Tahoe's Nevada shore. History North Canyon Creek's lower portion is designated as Slaughterhouse Creek on USGS maps, the latter name referring to a place where cattle were butchered. The aggressive logging activities of the Comstock Era (1860–1900) had major impacts on North Canyon Creek. In 1870, a flume was constructed within North Canyon to transport fallen logs and supply water to Spooner Lake where lumber could be transported east to Spooner Summit where they could be sent down the Clear Creek Flume to the Carson City lumberyards. Originally a shingle and mill site, much of the Spooner Lake and Glenbrook area became controlled by the Carson Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company (CTLFC), a monopoly lumber business during the Comstock Era owning nearly one-fifth of the basin lands. Large stands of timber along the east shore of Lake Tahoe were cut during the mid-1870s and most of the clear cutting was completed by the 1880s, with the Glenbrook Railroad transported logs from the lower elevations to Spooner Summit. Watershed and course The mountains around Spooner Summit in the Carson Range of the Sierra Nevada were clear-cut to provide lumber for Comstock Era Carson and Virginia Cities.

The upper reaches receive flows from a Comstock era man-made diversion from upper Secret Harbor Creek into North Canyon Creek. The diversion increased the watershed catchment area from to . Just north of the intersection of Highway 50 and Highway 28, North Canyon Creek enters Spooner Meadow where it receives outflows from Spooner Lake, a man-made reservoir formed by a dam built in the 1860s. The Spooner Lake watershed is approximately but peak flows from the lake are limited by Spooner Dam. Since the 1930s Spooner Lake has been used to store water for irrigation and recreational fishing. At Spooner Meadow, North Canyon Creek turns west and then northwest along Highway 28 before turning to the southwest and flowing down Slaughterhouse Canyon to Glenbrook and Lake Tahoe. The stream flows throw the Toiyabe National Forest and Lake Tahoe – Nevada State Park. Habitat and wildlife Historical beaver dams in Spooner Meadow indicate past use by this semi-aquatic mammal and would likely have acted to increase the watered area of the meadow. In the early 20th century, rancher Charles Fulstone hired a caretaker to control the beaver population, and construct fences and irrigation ditches in the meadow. This information is consistent with recent physical evidence that beaver were historically present in the Sierra Nevada, as well as historical observer records from the northern to southern ends of this mountain range. Mammals currently inhabiting North Canyon Creek include the American marten (Martes americana), northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii), Allen's chipmunk (Tamias senex), alpine chipmunk (Tamias alpinus), golden- mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis), gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus), and multiple bat species, snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), mountain cottontail (Sylvilagus nuttallii), bobcat (Lynx rufus), puma (Puma concolor), black bear (Ursus americanus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), coyote (Canis latrans), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and Trowbridge's shrew (Sorex trowbridgii). Non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only fish known to occupy North Canyon Creek in recent times. Brook trout prey on native Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi) and compete with them for food. Spooner Lake is stocked with multiple trout species but the native Lahontan tui chub (Gila bicolor) has come to dominate the lake. Trails and recreation Marlette Lake Trail in North Canyon begins at Spooner Lake and climbs due north through aspen groves for about elevation to a ridge overlooking North Canyon, and finally down into Marlette Lake.

The policy's official goal was \\"raising the people’s material and cultural standard of living on the basis of a fast developmental pace of socialist production, of higher efficiency, of scientific-technological progress and the growth of the productivity of labour\\". Or in the official formulation - to achieve \\"unity of economic and social policy\\". Between 1971 and 1982 the GDP of the GDR grew at average 5% annually, however the pursued policy only increased state's debts and by 1982 GDR was nearly insolvent. This change of policy was greatly influenced by the 1970 Polish protests which lead to greater emphasis on consumer goods and welfare policies in the whole of Eastern Bloc. In reaction to Walter Ulbricht’s many policy changes, Erich Honecker imposed a more traditionalist Weimar-era communist ideology which influenced his economic policies as well. Instead of Ulbricht’s technocrats who dreamt about overtaking capitalist West, he promoted ideologues who ended experiments and pursued more short-term goals of increased welfare. Wages, pensions and welfare programs were increased thus providing population with more money to spend on consumer goods. The following few years were some of the most prosperous in the history of the GDR. Emphasis on the welfare programs for women was one of the ways to further increased participation of women in the workforce. In 1970 82% of working age women were employed, in 1980 this rose to 87% and in 1989 to 91%. As the working-age population was already almost fully employed, to increase productivity the \\"Scientific Organisation of Labour\\" policy was introduced in 1973. Three-shift system and elements of Taylorism were introduced to maximize the work intensity.Between State Capitalism and Globalisation Much capital and energy was spent on building new housing districts and restoration of the neglected pre-war housing stock in order to provide all families with decent housing. While the prefabricated housing districts lacked individuality, they provided the basic living needs at a very low cost, as the state was subsidizing much of the rent and utilities costs. Much of Honecker's policies reflected the ideals of his communist youth. Cheap housing, utilities and basic food stuffs to him meant more than cars and modern consumer goods that GDR population increasingly desired, especially when it compared its living standards with those of Western Germany. The official GDR statistics claimed that in 1970 for every 100 households there were 15 cars, 53 washing machines, 56 refrigerators and 69 TVs. In 1981 this had risen to 37 cars, 82 washing machines, 99 refrigerators and 90 TVs. Debt crisis As the GDR was unable to rapidly increase its welfare and to increase its exports simultaneously, a growing budget deficit created problems by 1972. Despite SED propaganda, there were no increases in the socialistic productivity. By the mid-70s, instead of instituting any new reforms, Honecker decided to fund his policies by increased borrowing from the West, and especially from the Western Germany. By 1985 GDR's debt to Western countries had grown to 25.1 billion Valutamarks. The debt servicing rate for the foreign currency debt reached 168%. Hoping to increase its export income, in 1977 GDR returned to the ideas of Ulbricht, and began to develop semiconductor and microprocessor industry which, despite large investments, failed to achieve the desired results and GDR export income continued to decrease. GDR was unable to increase its exports to West as it lacked exportable products of sufficient quality, at the same time it relied on the cheap basic material supplies from the Soviet Union, which demanded payment in GDR produced goods, which were of higher quality than those produced in the USSR.

They were built as ordnance depots and functioned as such through to the second half of the twentieth century. Origins After 1667 gunpowder began to be stored in Upnor Castle on the north/west bank of the River Medway. During the Napoleonic Wars a gunpowder magazine was built alongside the castle at Lower Upnor designed to store a further 10,000 barrels of gunpowder, followed in 1857 by another, larger magazine which could hold up to 23,000 barrels. Over the next fifty years a series of buildings were built along the riverside designed for filling and storing explosive shells, naval mines and torpedoes - all for use in Her Majesty's Ships and in the extensive fortifications surrounding Chatham and Sheerness Naval Dockyards.Saunders, p. 15 =Chattenden= Narrow-gauge locomotive in front of Chattenden barracks When it was realised that there was no room for further expansion of the storage facilities at Upnor, a nearby site inland at Chattenden was purchased, and in 1875 five magazines were built on a hillside (the contours of which helped provide a natural traverse for security and protection). Between them, the magazines were designed to hold 40,000 barrels of gunpowder (with space for more in times of war). Chattenden Barracks (completed 1872) was also built, a little to the south, to accommodate the eight officers and 120 men detailed to guard the site. The magazine compound and barracks were linked to Upnor by a narrow-gauge railway. =Lodge Hill= In 1891 the decision was taken to apportion Britain's ordnance depots (which were all at that time overseen by the War Office) either to the Navy or to the Army. Under the new arrangements Upnor was given to the Navy and Chattenden to the Army. Without Chattenden the Navy lacked sufficient storage space; this led to the development of the adjacent Lodge Hill site, opened in 1899, to provided space for a further dozen small magazines for storing cordite, dry guncotton and other highly explosive materials. Each magazine was surrounded by an earth mound (traverse) and all the individual buildings were linked by sidings connected to the aforementioned narrow-gauge railway line which also had an interchange at the eastern end of the new depot with a new standard-gauge railway (known as the Chattenden Naval Tramway) from here to Sharnal Street station on the South Eastern Railway (the first time a Naval Ordnance Depot had been connected to the main line railway network). For safety the structures were set apart from one another, and the intervening space was planted with dense woodland. Lodge Hill was initially known as Chattenden Royal Naval Ordnance Depot; but in 1903 the Navy took over the older Chattenden magazines as well, whereupon Upnor, Chattenden and Lodge Hill were each named Royal Naval Ordnance Depots. Later history Central Terrace: built as Police Quarters for those guarding the depot at Chattenden, later used for Explosive Ordnance Search & Disposal training. As early as 1912 it was realised that the Lodge Hill and Chattenden Magazines were vulnerable to air attack. A surviving First World War anti- aircraft emplacement on Chattenden Ridge is of historic importance: it may have been the first anti-aircraft emplacement in the world, and was almost certainly the first in Britain. Nevertheless, Chattenden and Lodge Hill continued to be used for ammunition storage through both World Wars, until 1961. Thereafter, the site was used as extensive barracks and training facilities for the Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME). The Joint Service Bomb Disposal School moved here from Broadbridge Heath in 1966. Entrance to Lodge Hill Camp Firing Range The 1870s magazines at Chattenden remain in situ (though vulnerable to subsidence - a problem first identified soon after their completion); they were latterly used for general storage. Several magazines and other structures also survive at Lodge Hill. The 1872 Barracks quadrangle, with its central clock tower, was vacated in 1961 and demolished;Brian Matthews, The History Of Strood Rural District, 1971, Strood Rural District Council (the clock itself was moved to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard and not long afterwards was installed in the pediment of No. 11 Storehouse alongside HMS Victory). The following year a new barracks for RSME was built on the site; this remained in use until the 1990s and was itself demolished in 2005. The Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal School was housed in a separate complex (Lodge Hill Camp) along with the National Search Centre (a joint Ministry of Defence / Home Office facility providing training in Explosive Ordnance Disposal and search training for the police and other civilian agencies). The surrounding landscape provided training areas for these institutions; a pair of Victorian terraces, which once housed the on- site police force, were used for explosives search training and other structures were built expressly for this purpose. Bridge-building and other engineering training also took place on the site, and there was a specialist diver training facility in Lodge Hill Camp. Present day Former Police Office by the outer gate of the magazine compound at Chattenden. Chattenden and Lodge Hill Training Areas continued to be used into the 21st century, preparing personnel for active service in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2007 the Ministry of Defence designated the Military Land as a brownfield area for redevelopment for residential and light industrial use. The RSME continues to operate a training facility in nearby Upper Upnor, and the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal School has relocated to a new facility, which opened in 2013, on the former St George's Barracks site in Bicester. A plan had been worked up for 5000 houses on the site in a £1bn scheme. The Lodge Hill camp however is home to 85 singing male nightingales, which is over 1% of the entire UK population which stands at 6000. Natural England have declared this an SSSI. Nightingales migrate several thousand miles to West Africa and then return to the same tree, making biodiversity offsetting inappropriate for the species.

The Foreign policy of the Russian Empire covers Russian foreign relations down to 1917. All the main decisions in the Russian Empire were made by the tsar (tsarist autocracy), so there was a uniformity of policy and a forcefulness during the long regimes of powerful leaders such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. However, there were numerous weak tsars—such as children with a regent in control—as well as numerous plots and assassinations. With weak tsars or rapid turnover there was unpredictability and even chaos. Russia played a small role in the Napoleonic Wars until 1812, when Napoleon's huge army was destroyed in the French invasion of Russia. Russia played a major role in defeating Napoleon and in setting conservative terms for the restoration of aristocratic Europe during the period of 1815 to 1848. There were several wars with the Ottoman Empire, and in 1856 Russia lost the Crimean War to a coalition of Great Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. More small wars followed in the late 19th century. For three centuries, from the days of Ivan the Terrible (ruled 1547 to 1584), Russia expanded in all directions at 18,000 square miles per year, becoming by far the largest power. (China had more people but far less military or economic or diplomatic power.) The expansion brought in many minorities who had their own religions and languages. The political system was an autocracy ruled by the tsar; in its later days it was challenged by various revolutionary groups who were rendered ineffective by a tough police state that sent many thousands to exile in remote Siberia. Expansion had largely ended by the 1850s, but there was some movement south toward Afghanistan and India, which greatly annoyed Britain, which controlled India. Russia's main historic enemy was the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Russia's access to the Mediterranean Sea. The tsar's solution was to sponsor Slavic insurgents in the Balkans against the Ottomans. Serbia supported insurgents against Austria, and Russia stood behind Serbia, which was Greek Orthodox in religion and Slavic in culture. Russia's main ally was France, which needed its size and power to counter the increasingly powerful German Empire. Russia entered the World War in 1914 against Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire to defend the Kingdom of Serbia, and to gain access to the Mediterranean Sea at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Financial help came from its allies Britain and France. The Russian military failed, as did the political and economic system. Russians lost faith in the failed tsar. The result was two revolutions in 1917 that destroyed the Russian Empire, and led to independence for the Baltic states, Poland and (briefly) Ukraine and a host of smaller nation-states such as Georgia. After sharp fighting in the Russian Civil War with international involvement, a new regime of Communism under Lenin took over and established the Soviet Union (USSR). For the next period see Foreign relations of the Soviet Union. Strategy Geographical expansion by warfare and treaty was the central strategy of Russian foreign policy from the small Muscovite state of the 16th century to World War I in 1914. The goals were territory, warm water ports, and protection of Orthodox Christianity. The main weapon was the very large and increasingly well-trained Imperial Russian Army, although the domestic economy was hard-pressed to provide adequate support. Although there were occasional defeats and setbacks, the record was generally successful down to the 1900s. =West: Poland and the Baltic= Swedish Empire To the northwest, Russia engaged in a century long struggle against Sweden for control of the Baltic Sea. The Empire succeeded by the 1720s, obtaining not just access to the sea but ownership of Finland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. To the west, there were a series of wars with Poland and Lithuania, followed by negotiated settlements with Prussia and Austria that gave Russia control of most of Ukraine, and a large slice of Poland. Napoleon unsuccessfully challenged the Russians directly with his 1812 invasion of Russia. Russia seized more territory and became a great power, with a strong voice in the affairs of Europe from 1814 to the 1840s. =South: Ottomans and the Caucasus= Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent To the south, the conflict with the Ottoman Empire lasted for centuries. Russia sliced away territories previously held by the Ottomans, such as the Crimea, and became a political the powerful protector of Orthodox Christians in the Balkans, and also Christians in Transcaucasia. The greatest defeat in the history of Russian expansion came in the Crimean War (1854–1856), as the British and French defended the integrity of the Ottoman Empire from clients. However, the tsars largely recovered their losses by 1870. =Central Asia= To the southeast, Russia seized power in large swaths of territory in Central Asia inhabited by Muslims of Turkic ethnicity. Although some Russian settlers were sent into Kazakhstan, generally leading local elites were left in power as long as it was clear that Russia controlled foreign and military policies. The mainstream of expansion finally reached Afghanistan in the middle of the 19th century, leading to The Great Game with repeated wars against the Afghan tribes, and increasingly involved threats and counterthreats with the British, who were determined to protect their large holdings on the Indian subcontinent. =Far East: China and Japan= Mitchell Map of Russia in Far East 1853 Finally, there was expansion to the Far East, as Russian settlers moved into the mining and agricultural districts of Siberia, taking control of local tribes and building towns, mines, prison camps along the Trans-Siberian Railway. The total Siberian population was only a half-million in 1800, but reached 9 million in 1914, of whom 1 million were criminals and political exiles.Martin Gilbert, Atlas of Russian history (1993) p 62–63. To build up a presence on the Pacific Ocean, Russia seized some 400,000 square miles of almost uninhabited territory from Qing dynasty China in 1858–1860. It sent in settlers and prisoners, so that its holdings from Vladivostok north along the Sea of Japan reached 310,000 in 1897.Gilbert, Atlas of Russian History (1993) p 60. Russia established an economic role east into the Sinkiang and Manchuria regions of China peacefully, using the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), loans to the Chinese government, networks of merchants, and by building the Chinese Eastern Railway, a branch of the Trans-Siberian railroad, through Manchuria to the ocean.Gilbert, Atlas of Russian history (1993) pp 65–66.Immanuel C.Y. Hsu, The Rise of Modern China (1995) pp 317–325.Charles Jelavich and Barbara Jelavich, Russia and the East, 1876–1880 (1959). Meanwhile, in the late 19th century, the Empire of Japan was expanding into Manchuria and especially Korea. It proposed a deal whereby the Russians would have the predominant role in Manchuria, and Japan in Korea. The tsar, contemptuous of the Japanese, bluntly refused. In the Russo-Japanese War, Japan attacked, pushing back the Russian army on the ground, and sinking the main Russian battle fleet. Japan took control of Korea and of the southern half of the Chinese Eastern Railway.Gilbert, Atlas of Russian history (1993) pp 66–67.Brian Catchpole, A Map History of Russia (1983) pp 26–31. Russian expansion jumped to North America, with small fur-trade operations in Alaska, coupled with missionaries to the natives. By 1861 the project lost money, threatened to antagonize the Americans, and could not be defended from Britain. In the Alaska Purchase of 1867 it was sold to the United States for $7.2 million.James R. Gibson, \\"Why the Russians Sold Alaska.\\" Wilson Quarterly 3.3 (1979): 179-188 online.Thomas A. Bailey, \\"Why the United States Purchased Alaska.\\" Pacific Historical Review 3.1 (1934): 39-49. online Before 1793 The tsar so shaped foreign policy that a transition could mean an overnight radical turnabout. The most famous example came when in 1762, during the Seven Years' War, Empress Elizabeth had almost destroyed Frederick the Great of the Kingdom of Prussia. Then she suddenly died. The new tsar Peter III was a friend of Frederick, who unexpectedly survived. He called it the \\"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.\\"David Fraser, Frederick the Great. King of Prussia (2000), p. 459. =Relations with Sweden= During the Middle Ages several wars were fought between the Swedes and Russians and 11 wars have been fought between Russia and Sweden since the 15th century. In these wars superior Russian forces often outnumbered the Swedish, which however often stood their ground in battles such as those of Narva (1700) and Svensksund (1790) due to Sweden's capable military organisation.D.G. Kirby, Northern Europe in the Early Modern Period: The Baltic World 1492–1772 (1990). The central theme of the 1600–1725 era was the struggle between Sweden and Russia for control of the Baltic, as well as territories around it. Russia was ultimately the winner, and Sweden lost its status as a major power.Jill Lisk, The struggle for supremacy in the Baltic, 1600–1725 (1968).Robert I. Frost, The Northern Wars: War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe, 1558–1721 (2000) In 1610 the Swedish army marched into Moscow under the command of Jakob De la Gardie. From 1623 to 1709, Swedish policy, particularly under Gustavus Adolphus (1611–1632) and Charles XII (1697–1718), encouraged and militarily supported Ukrainian opposition to Muscovite Russian hegemony. Gustavus Adolphus fought the Ingrian War against Russia. It ended in 1617 with the Treaty of Stolbovo, which excluded Russia from the Baltic Sea. Sweden's most dramatic defeat on the battleground came in 1709 at the battle of Poltava, in an attempt to second the Ukrainian rebellion leader Mazepa.Gary Dean Peterson, Warrior Kings of Sweden: The Rise of an Empire in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (McFarland, 2007). =Peter the Great= Peter the Great (1672–1725) took control of Russia in 1695. He greatly expanded the size of Russia while gaining access to ports on the Baltic, Black, and Caspian seas. His Russian commanders were generals Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov and Boris Sheremetev.Lindsey Hughes, Russia in the Age of Peter the Great (1998) pp 21-62. Before Peter, Russia was largely isolated from European affairs in terms not just of military but of economic and cultural relationships. The mysterious far-off Eastern land was held in low regard. Peter saw the urgent need for access to the Baltic Sea, and formed coalitions to challenge Swedish dominance there. His success transformed Russia's role and made it a player in European affairs.Derek McKay, and Hamish M. Scott, The Rise of the Great Powers 1648–1815 (1983) pp 80–81. In 1695 Peter attacked the Turkish forces that controlled the River Don. He failed because he lacked a navy or competent engineers to conduct a siege, and had no unity of command in his forces. He quickly remedied the defects and captured Azov in 1696. In 1697 he went to Western Europe to study the latest methods of warfare. On his return in 1698 he commenced reforming the country, turning the Russian tsardom into a modernized empire by copying models from Western Europe with the goal of creating a strong, professional army and navy, as well as a strong economic base. At first he relied on hired officers, especially Germans. He soon built a network of military schools in Russia to produce fresh leadership. His favorite enterprise was building a modern fleet of the sort Russia had never known.M.S. Anderson, \\"Russia under Peter the Great and the changed relations of East and West.\\" in J.S. Bromley, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History: VI: 1688–1715 (1970) pp 716–740. In 1700 Peter launched the Great Northern War with a triple alliance of Denmark–Norway, Saxony and Poland–Lithuania. They struck a threefold attack on the Swedish protectorate of Swedish Holstein- Gottorp and the provinces of Livonia and Ingria. Charles won multiple victories despite being outnumbered. He defeated a much larger Russian army in 1700 at the Battle of Narva. In 1706 Swedish forces under general Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld defeated the combined army of Saxony and Russia at the Battle of Fraustadt. Russia was now the sole remaining hostile power.R.M. Hatton, Charles XII of Sweden (1968). Charles' subsequent march on Moscow met with initial success as victory followed victory, the most significant of which was the Battle of Holowczyn where the smaller Swedish army routed a Russian army twice its size. The campaign ended with disaster, though, when the Swedish army suffered heavy losses to a Russian force more than twice its size at Poltava, followed by the Surrender at Perevolochna. Charles spent years in futile attempts to restore Swedish power; Russia was now dominant in the Baltic.F.G. Bengtsson, The Life of Charles XII, King of Sweden, 1697–1718 (1960). =Relations with Britain, 1553–1792= Old English Court in Moscow – headquarters of the Muscovy Company and residence of English ambassadors in the 17th century The Kingdom of England and Tsardom of Russia established relations in 1553 when English navigator Richard Chancellor arrived in Arkhangelsk, when Ivan the Terrible ruled Russia. In 1555 the Muscovy Company was established. The Muscovy Company held a monopoly over trade between England and Russia until 1698. From the 1720s Peter invited British engineers to Saint Petersburg, leading to the establishment of a small but commercially influential Anglo-Russian expatriate merchant community from 1730 to 1921. During the series of general European wars of the 18th century, the two empires found themselves as sometime allies and sometime enemies. The two states fought on the same side during War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). They were on opposite sides during Seven Years' War (1756–1763), although they did not at any time engage in the field. Ochakov issue Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger was alarmed at Russian expansion in Crimea in the 1780s at the expense of his Ottoman ally.John Holland Rose, William Pitt and National Revival (1911) pp 589–607. He tried to get Parliamentary support for reversing it. In peace talks with the Ottomans, Russia refused to return the key Ochakov fortress. Pitt wanted to threaten military retaliation. However Russia's ambassador Semyon Vorontsov organized Pitt's enemies and launched a public opinion campaign. Pitt won the vote so narrowly that he gave up and Vorontsov secured a renewal of the commercial treaty between Britain and Russia. Napoleonic era: 1793–1815 In foreign policy, tsar Alexander I changed Russia's position relative to France four times between 1804 and 1812 among neutrality, opposition, and alliance. In 1805 he joined Britain in the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon. After the massive defeat of the Russian and Austrian armies by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Russian official propaganda blamed the Austrians and stressed the moral superiority of tsar Alexander I. He switched sides and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) and joined Napoleon's Continental System of economic boycotts against Britain. He and Napoleon could never agree, especially about Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810. The tsar's greatest triumph came in 1812 as Napoleon's invasion of Russia proved a total disaster for the French. The initiative swung toward the Allies. Russian armies joined the others in pushing the French all the way back, seizing Paris, and forcing Napoleon to abdicate in 1814.Dominic Lieven, Russia Against Napoleon: The True Story of the Campaigns of War and Peace (2010). Congress of Vienna, 1814 As part of the winning coalition against Napoleon Russia gained some spoils in Finland and Poland at the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815. The tsar attended and was deeply involved in the diplomatic wrangling over the fates of Poland, Saxony and the Kingdom of Naples. He helped establish alliances that defeated Napoleon's attempt to regain power in 1815 and helped foster a spirit of cooperation among the conservative leaders of Britain, France, Austria, and Prussia.David King, Vienna, 1814: How the Conquerors of Napoleon Made Love, War, and Peace at the Congress of Vienna (2009).Harold Nicolson, The Congress of Vienna: a Study in Allied Unity, 1812–1822 (2000). The major territorial gain was control of Poland, which Napoleon had made an independent state. The tsar became king of Poland and (at first) allowed it considerable autonomy.Frank W. Thackeray, Antecedents of Revolution: Alexander I and the Polish kingdom, 1815–1825 (1980) =Britain= The outbreak of the French Revolution and its attendant wars temporarily united constitutionalist Britain and autocratic Russia in an ideological alliance against French republicanism. Britain and Russia attempted to halt the French but the failure of their joint invasion of the Netherlands in 1799 precipitated a change in attitudes. The two countries were at war, with some very limited naval combat during the Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812). In 1812 Britain and Russia became allies against Napoleon in the Napoleonic Wars.Dominic Lieven, Russia against Napoleon: The Battle for Europe, 1807 to 1814 (Penguin UK), 2009. 1815–1917 After 1815, Russia strongly promoted conservatism and political reaction in Western Europe.David Schimmelpenninck Van Der Oye, \\"Russian foreign policy, 1815-1917\\" in D. C. B. Lieven, ed. The Cambridge History of Russia vol 2 (2006) pp 554-574 . It had all the land it wanted, so a high priority was to protect the frontiers. In practice the main issue was Poland, which had been partitioned among Russia, Germany, and Austria. A strong sense of Polish nationalism as well tensions on language and religion (Roman Catholics versus Eastern Orthodox) cause dissatisfaction in the Polish population. The Poles opened major revolts in 1830–31, and 1863–64, and were crushed by the Russian army. Empire responded with a program of Russification. To the south and southwest, the increasing vulnerability of the Ottoman Empire led Russia to support Orthodox Christian revolts against the Ottomans in the Balkans and Greece. A major long-term goal was control of the Straits, which would allow full access to the Mediterranean. Britain, and also France, took the Ottoman side, leading to the Crimean war, 1853-56 which left Russia seriously weakened. Russia had much less difficulty in expanding to the south, including the conquest of Turkestan. However, Britain became alarmed when Russia threatened Afghanistan, with the implicit threat to India, and decades of diplomatic maneuvering finally ended with an Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907. Expansion into The vast stretches of Siberia was slow and expensive, but finally became possible with the building of the trans-Siberian Railway, 1890 to 1904. This opened up East Asia, and Russian interests focused on Mongolia, Manchuria, and Korea. China was too weak to resist, and Was pulled increasingly into the Russian sphere. Japan strongly opposed Russian expansion, and defeated Russia in a war in 1904–1905. Japan took over Korea, and Manchuria remained a contested area. Meanwhile, France, looking for allies against Germany after 1871, formed a military alliance in 1894, with large-scale loans to Russia, sales of arms, and warships, as well as diplomatic support. Once Afghanistan was informally partitioned in 1907, Britain, France and Russia came increasingly close together in opposition to Germany and Austria. They formed a loose Triple Entente that played a central role in the First World War. That war broke out when the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with strong German support, tried to suppress Serbian nationalism, and Russia supported Serbia. Everyone began to mobilize, and Berlin decided to act before the others were ready to fight, first invading Belgium and France in the west, and then Russia in the east.Barbara Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974 (1974) pp 34-279. =Nicholas I, 1825–1855= After 1815 Russia formed the Holy Alliance to suppress revolutionary movements in Europe that it saw as immoral threats to legitimate Christian monarchs.Frederick B. Artz, Reaction and Revolution: 1814–1832 (1934) Russia under Tsar Nicholas I helped Austria's Klemens von Metternich in suppressing national and liberal movements. The most important intervention came when the Russian army played a decisive role in crushing the revolution in Hungary in 1849.Eugene Horváth, \\"Russia and the Hungarian Revolution (1848-9).\\" Slavonic and East European Review 12.36 (1934): 628-645. onlineIan W. Roberts, Nicholas I and the Russian intervention in Hungary (1991). Nicholas I, who ruled 1825–1855, was among the most reactionary of all Russian leaders.W. Bruce Lincoln, Nicholas I: Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias (1989) His aggressive foreign policy involved many expensive wars that had a disastrous effect on the empire's finances. He was successful against Russia's neighbouring southern rivals as he seized the last territories in the Caucasus held by Persia (comprising modern day Armenia and Azerbaijan) by successfully ending the Russo-Persian War (1826–28). By now, Russia had gained what is now Dagestan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia from Persia, and had therefore at last gained the clear upper hand in the Caucasus, both geo-politically as well as territorially. He ended the Russo- Turkish War (1828–29) successfully as well. Later on, however, he led Russia into the Crimean War (1853–56) with disastrous results. Historians emphasize that his micromanagement of the armies hindered his generals, as did his misguided strategy. William Fuller notes that historians have frequently concluded that \\"the reign of Nicholas I was a catastrophic failure in both domestic and foreign policy.\\"William C. Fuller, Jr., Strategy and Power in Russia 1600-1914 (1998) p 243 At his death in 1855, the Russian Empire reached its geographical zenith, spanning over 20 million square kilometers ( million square miles), but in desperate need of reform. =Crimean War 1852–1856= The immediate cause of the Crimean War involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. France promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. The war was fought largely on the Crimean peninsula, and involved very large numbers of casualties, especially from disease. British-French naval superiority proved decisive and the war ended when the allies destroyed Sebastopol. Russia was forced to make concessions, but it eventually regained them and continued to threaten the Ottoman Empire.Andrew C. Rath, The Crimean War in Imperial Context, 1854–1856 (2015).Peter Young, \\"Historiography of the Origins of the Crimean War\\", International History: Diplomatic and Military History since the Middle Ages (2012) online For much of Nicholas's reign, Russia was seen as a major military power, with considerable strength. At last the Crimean war at the end of his reign demonstrated to the world what no one had previously realized: Russia was militarily weak, technologically backward, and administratively incompetent. Despite his grand ambitions toward the south and Turkey, Russia had not built its railroad network in that direction, and communications were bad. The bureaucracy was riddled with graft, corruption and inefficiency and was unprepared for war. The Navy was weak and technologically backward; the Army, although very large, was good only for parades, suffered from colonels who pocketed their men's pay, poor morale, and was even more out of touch with the latest technology as developed by Britain and France. By war's end, the Russian leadership was determined to reform the Army and the society. As Fuller notes, \\"Russia had been beaten on the Crimean peninsula, and the military feared that it would inevitably be beaten again unless steps were taken to surmount its military weakness.\\" The Treaty of Paris (1856) was a peace treaty that took advantage of Russia's weakness by weakening it further in humiliating fashion. It gave West European powers the nominal duty of protecting Christians living in the Ottoman Empire, removing that role from Russia, which had been designated as such a protector in the 1774 Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji. The harshest clauses demanded the full demilitarisation of the Black Sea—most of Russia's most important naval facilities could no longer be used to threaten or to defend. Russia became almost powerless in both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.Flemming Splidsboel-Hansen, \\"Past and Future Meet: Aleksandr Gorchakov and Russian Foreign Policy\\" Europe-Asia Studies 54#3 (May, 2002), pp. 377-396 at pp 379-80. =Foreign affairs after the Crimean War= Prince Gorchakov, foreign minister 1856-1882 Tsar Nicholas I died during the war and was succeeded by Tsar Alexander II. He gave Prince Gorchakov full control of foreign policy. The new policy was to keep a low profile in Europe while rebuilding the military and reforming the domestic economy. Gorchakov pursued cautious and well-calculated policies. A high priority was regaining naval access to the Black Sea. The policy concentrated on good relations with France, Prussia, and the United States. Russian statesmen achieved the goal by 1870 despite opposition from Britain and Austria-Hungary.Hugh Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire, 1801–1917 (1967) pp 430–438. Caucasian East. Map drawn in 1856 by J. Grassl (includes Tiflis and his entourage). The borders of the Russian imperial territories of Khiva and Bukhara in the time period of 1902–1903. Russia turned its expansionist plans to the south and east. Russian troops first moved to gain control of the Caucasus region, where the revolts of Muslim tribesmen—Chechens, Circassians, and Dagestanis—had continued despite numerous Russian campaigns in the nineteenth century. Once the forces of Aleksandr Baryatinsky had captured the legendary Chechen rebel leader Shamil in 1859, the army resumed the expansion into Central Asia that had begun under Nicholas I. The capture of Tashkent was a significant victory over the Kokand Khanate, part of which was annexed in 1866. By 1867 Russian forces had captured enough territory to form the Guberniya (Governorate General) of Turkestan, the capital of which was Tashkent. The Bukhara Khanate then lost the crucial Samarkand area to Russian forces in 1868. To avoid alarming Britain, which had strong interests in protecting nearby India, Russia left the Bukhoran territories directly bordering Afghanistan and Persia nominally independent. The Central Asian khanates retained a degree of autonomy until 1917.Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire, 1801–1917 (1967) pp 438–445. Russia followed the United States, Britain, and France in establishing relations with Japan, and, together with Britain and France, Russia obtained concessions from China consequent to the Second Opium War (1856–1860). Under the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and the Treaty of Beijing in 1860, China ceded to Russia extensive trading rights and regions adjacent to the Amur and Ussuri rivers and allowed Russia to begin building a port and naval base at Vladivostok.T. C. Lin, \\"The Amur Frontier Question between China and Russia, 1850–1860.\\" Pacific Historical Review 3#1 (1934): 1–27. in JSTOR As part of the foreign policy goals in Europe, Russia initially gave guarded support to France's anti-Austrian diplomacy. A weak Franco- Russian entente soured, however, when France backed a Polish uprising against Russian rule in 1863. Russia then aligned itself more closely with Prussia by approving the unification of Germany in exchange for a revision of the Treaty of Paris and the remilitarization of the Black Sea. These diplomatic achievements came at a London conference in 1871, following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. After 1871 Germany, united under Prussian leadership, was the strongest continental power in Europe. In 1873 Germany formed the loosely knit League of the Three Emperors with Russia and Austria-Hungary to prevent them from forming an alliance with France. Nevertheless, Austro- Hungarian and Russian ambitions clashed in the Balkans, where rivalries among Slavic nationalities and anti-Ottoman sentiments seethed.Hugh Seton-Watson, The Russian Empire, 1801–1917 (1967) pp 445–460. In the 1870s, Russian nationalist opinion became a serious domestic factor in its support for liberating Balkan Christians from Ottoman rule and making Bulgaria and Serbia quasi-protectorates of Russia. From 1875 to 1877, the Balkan crisis escalated with the rebellion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and insurrection in Bulgaria, which the Ottoman Turks suppressed with such great cruelty that Serbia, but none of the West European powers, declared war. In early 1877, Russia came to the rescue of beleaguered Serbia when it went to war with the Ottoman Empire of 1877–1878. Within one year, Russian troops were nearing Constantinople, and the Ottomans surrendered. Russia's nationalist diplomats and generals persuaded Alexander II to force the Ottomans to sign the Treaty of San Stefano in March 1878, creating an enlarged, independent Bulgaria that stretched into the southwestern Balkans. Another significant result of the 1877–78 Russo- Turkish War in Russia's favour was the acquisition from the Ottomans of the provinces of Batum, Ardahan, and Kars in the South Caucasus, which were transformed into the militarily administered regions of Batum Oblast and Kars Oblast. To replace Muslim refugees who had fled across the new frontier into Ottoman territory the Russian authorities settled large numbers of Christians from an ethnically diverse range of communities in Kars Oblast, particularly the Georgians, Caucasus Greeks, and Armenians, all of whom hoped to achieve their own regional ambitions on the back of the Russian Empire.Barbara Jelavich, \\"Great Britain and the Russian Acquisition of Batum, 1878–1886.\\" Slavonic and East European Review 48.110 (1970): 44–66. When Britain threatened to declare war over the terms of the Treaty of San Stefano, an exhausted Russia backed down. At the Congress of Berlin in July 1878, Russia agreed to the creation of a smaller Bulgaria. Russian nationalists were furious with Austria-Hungary and Germany for failing to back Russia, but the tsar accepted a revived and strengthened League of the Three Emperors as well as Austro-Hungarian hegemony in the western Balkans.Barbara Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974 (1974) pp 157–188. Russian diplomatic and military interests subsequently re-focussed on Central Asia, where Russia had quelled a series of uprisings in the 1870s, and Russia incorporated hitherto independent emirates into the empire. Britain renewed its concerns in 1881 when Russian troops occupied Turkmen lands on the Persian and Afghan borders, but Germany lent diplomatic support to Russian advances, and an Anglo-Russian war was averted. Meanwhile, Russia's sponsorship of Bulgarian independence brought negative results as the Bulgarians, angry at Russia's continuing interference in domestic affairs, sought the support of Austria-Hungary. In the dispute that arose between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Germany took a firm position toward Russia while mollifying the tsar with a bilateral defensive alliance, the Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 between Germany and Russia.Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974 (1974) pp 201–212. Within a year, Russo-German acrimony led to Otto von Bismarck's forbidding further loans to Russia, and France replaced Germany as Russia's financier. When Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck in 1890, the loose Russo-Prussian entente collapsed after having lasted for more than twenty-five years. Three years later, Russia allied itself with France by entering into a joint military convention, which matched the dual alliance formed in 1879 by Germany and Austria- Hungary.Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974 (1974) pp 212–221. =Relations with Britain= Russophobia From 1820 to 1907, a new element emerged: Russophobia. British elite sentiment turned increasingly hostile towards Russia, with a high degree of anxiety for the safety of India, With the fear that Russia would push south through Afghanistan. In addition, there was a growing concern that Russia would destabilize Eastern Europe by its attacks on the faltering Ottoman Empire.Roman Golicz, \\"The Russians shall not have Constantinople: English Attitudes to Russia, 1870–1878\\", History Today (November 2003) 53#9 pp 39-45. This fear made the Eastern Question a matter of high priority. Russia was especially interested in getting a warm water port that would enable its navy. Getting access out of the Black Sea into the Mediterranean was a goal, which meant access through the Straits controlled by the Ottomans.John Howes Gleason, The Genesis of Russophobia in Great Britain: A Study of the Interaction of Policy and Opinion (1950) online Russia intervened on behalf of Orthodox Greeks in the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829); the London peace treaty favoured Greece but heightened Russophobia in Britain and France. In 1851 the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations held in London's Crystal Palace, including over 100,000 exhibits from forty nations. It was the world's first international exposition. Russia took the opportunity to dispel growing Russophobia by refuting stereotypes of Russia as a backward, militaristic repressive tyranny. Its sumptuous exhibits of luxury products and large 'objets d'art' with little in the way of advanced technology, however, did little to change its reputation. Britain considered its navy too weak to worry about, but saw its large army as a major threat.Anthony Swift, \\"Russia and the Great Exhibition of 1851: Representations, perceptions, and a missed opportunity.\\" Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas (2007): 242–263, in English. The Russian pressures on the Ottoman Empire continued, leaving Britain and France to ally with the Ottomans and push back against Russia in the Crimean War (1853–1856). Russophobia was an element in generating popular British and French support for the far-off war.Andrew D. Lambert, The Crimean War: British Grand Strategy Against Russia, 1853–56 (2011). Elite opinion in Britain, especially among Liberals, supported Poles against harsh Russian rule, after 1830. The British government watched nervously as Russia suppressed revolts in the 1860s but refused to intervene.L. R. Lewitter, \\"The Polish Cause as seen in Great Britain, 1830–1863.\\" Oxford Slavonic Papers (1995): 35–61. In 1874, tension lessened as Queen Victoria's second son married the only daughter of tsar Alexander II, followed by a cordial state visit by the tsar. The superficial goodwill lasted no more than three years, when structural forces again pushed the two nations to the verge of war. The Great Game and Asian affairs Russia depicted as a bear and Britain as a lion eying an edible Afghanistan in the Great Game. Rivalry between Britain and Russia grew steadily over Central Asia in the Great Game of the late 19th century. Russia desired warm-water ports on the Indian Ocean while Britain wanted to prevent Russian troops from gaining a potential invasion route to India.David Fromkin, \\"The Great Game in Asia,\\" Foreign Affairs (1980) 58#4 pp. 936–951 in JSTOR In 1885 Russia annexed part of Afghanistan in the Panjdeh incident, which caused a war scare. However Russia's foreign minister Nikolay Girs and its ambassador to London Baron de Staal set up an agreement in 1887 which established a buffer zone in Central Asia. Russian diplomacy thereby won grudging British acceptance of its expansionism.Raymond Mohl, \\"Confrontation in Central Asia\\" History Today 19 (1969) 176–183 Persia was also an arena of tension, and was divided into spheres of influence without warfare.Firuz Kazemzadeh, Russia and Britain in Persia, 1864–1914: A Study in Imperialism (Yale UP, 1968). Russia followed the lead of the major powers in sending an occupation force to protect international subjects in China during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).Alena N. Eskridge-Kosmach, \\"Russia in the Boxer Rebellion.\\" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 21#1 (2008): 38–52. =Peaceful policies = Nikolay Girs, foreign minister 1882-95 Diplomat Nikolay Girs, scion of a rich and powerful family of Scandinavian descent, served as Foreign Minister, 1882–1895, during the reign of Alexander III. He was one of the architects of the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1891, which was later expanded into the Triple Entente with the addition of Great Britain. That alliance brought France out of diplomatic isolation, and moved Russia from the German orbit to a coalition with France, that was strongly supported by French financial assistance to Russia's economic modernization. Tsar Alexander took credit for peaceful policies but according to Margaret Maxwell, historians have underrated his success in a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements, treaties and conventions. These agreements defined Russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations. He supported numerous international commissions and made many goodwill missions, during which he repeatedly stressed Russia's peaceful intentions. His most dramatic success came in 1885, settling long-standing tensions with Great Britain, which was fearful that Russian expansion to the South would be a threat to India.Raymond A. Mohl, \\"Confrontation in Central Asia, 1885,\\" History Today (1969) 119#3 pp 176-183. Girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of Tsar Alexander III, convincing him that the very survival of the czarist system depended on avoiding major wars. With a deep insight into the tsar's moods and views, Girs typically shaped the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists, ministers, and even the czarina, as well as his own ambassadors. Under Giers and Alexander, Russia fought no major wars.Margaret Maxwell, \\"A Re-examination of the Rôle of N.K. Giers as Russian Foreign Minister under Alexander III.\\" European Studies Review 1.4 (1971): 351-376. =War with Japan over Korea, 1904–05= The Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) was fought over rival ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. Most international observers expected Russia to win easily over upstart Japan—and were astonished when Japan sank the main Russian fleet and won the war, marking the first great Asian victory over a modern European power. Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for its growing navy,Nicholas Papastratigakis, Russian Imperialism and Naval Power: Military Strategy and the Build-Up to the Russo-Japanese War (I. B. Tauris, 2011). and to expand maritime trade. Vladivostok was operational only during the summer, whereas Port Arthur, a naval base in Liaodong Province leased to Russia by China, was operational all year. Since the end of the First Sino- Japanese War in 1895, negotiations between Russia and Japan went nowhere. Japan was worried by Russia's long march east through Siberia and central Asia, and offered to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea as being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Tokyo placed a much higher value on Korea than did St Petersburg, but Russia demanded Korea north of the 39th parallel to become a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Japan. While the Russian decision makers were confused, Japan worked to isolate them diplomatically, especially by signing the Anglo- Japanese Alliance in 1902, (even though it did not require Britain to enter a war.) After negotiations collapsed in 1904, the Japanese Navy opened hostilities by attacking the Russian Eastern Fleet at Port Arthur in a surprise attack. Russia suffered numerous defeats but Tsar Nicholas II was convinced that Russia would eventually win so he refused to settle. The decisive battle came in May 1905 at the Battle of Tsushima, when the main Russian battle fleet, after sailing around the world, finally arrived off Korea and was sunk in a matter of hours.Richard M. Connaughton, The War of the Rising Sun and Tumbling Bear: A Military History of the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–05 (1991). Peace came with the Treaty of Portsmouth, mediated by American President Theodore Roosevelt. It was highly advantageous to Japan and transformed the balance of power in East Asia.John Albert White, The Diplomacy of the Russo-Japanese War (Princeton UP, 1964). Britain remained strictly neutral, as allowed by its treaty with Japan.B. J. C. McKercher, \\"Diplomatic Equipoise: The Lansdowne Foreign Office the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, and the Global Balance of Power.\\" Canadian Journal of History 24#3 (1989): 299–340. online However, there was a brief war scare in October 1905 when the Russian battle fleet headed to fight Japan mistakenly engaged a number of British fishing vessels in the North Sea. The misunderstanding was quickly resolved.Keith Neilson, Britain and the last tsar: British policy and Russia, 1894–1917 (Oxford UP, 1995) p 243.Keith Neilson, \\"'A dangerous game of American Poker': The Russo‐Japanese war and British policy.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 12#1 (1989): 63–87. online Not only was Russia humiliated by its defeat at the hands of an oriental power, but there was massive unrest at home, typified by the Revolution of 1905. The response in international affairs came with two treaties in 1907 with Japan and Great Britain. The arrangement with Japan allowed southern Manchuria to be reserved as the sphere of Japanese interest, and Korea was completely under Japanese control – it was formally annexed in 1910. In exchange, Russia gained control of northern Manchuria. The city of Harbin became a major railroad and administrative center. Russian settlers were moved in, trade was build up, and mining properties were developed. The treaty with Japan also gave Russia a free hand in Outer Mongolia, although it nominally remained under Chinese ownership. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 ended the long-standing rivalry in central Asia, and then enabled the two countries to outflank the Germans, who were threatening to connect Berlin in Baghdad by new railroad that would probably align the Turkish Empire with Great Britain. It ended the dispute over Persia, with Britain promising to stay out of the northern half, while Russia recognized southern Persia as part of the British sphere of influence. Russia also promised to stay out of Tibet and Afghanistan. In exchange London extended loans and some political support.Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow (1974), pp 247-49, 254-56.Ewen W. Edwards, \\"The Far Eastern Agreements of 1907.\\" Journal of Modern History 26.4 (1954): 340-355. Online Approach of the First World War European diplomatic alignments shortly before the war. Note: Germany and the Ottoman Empire only formed an alliance shortly following the outbreak of the war. =Allies, 1907–1917= Diplomacy became delicate in the early 20th century.Dominic C.B. Lieven, Russia and the origins of the First World War (Macmillan, 1983). Russia was troubled by the Entente Cordiale between Great Britain and France signed in 1904. Russia and France already had a mutual defense agreement that said France was obliged to threaten England with an attack if Britain declared war on Russia, while Russia was to concentrate more than 300,000 troops on the Afghan border for an incursion into India in the event that England attacked France. The solution was to bring Russia into the British-French alliance. The Anglo-Russian Entente and the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 made both countries part of the Triple Entente.Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974 (1974) pp 249–255. Russia and Japan developed friendly relations after their war ended. Developing an informal military alliance became possible because Britain, Which had a military alliance with Japan, became increasingly alienated from Germany, and increasingly close to Russia. Britain and Russia resolve their outstanding difficulties by 1907. In addition Japan and Russia Had a strong interest in developing railroads in Manchuria and China. As a result, it was easy for Japan to join Russia, France, and Britain as an ally in the First World War in 1914. Japan made significant gains in the war, seizing many of the German colonies in the Pacific and in China, while at the same time Trying to reduce China itself to puppet status.Neilson, Britain and the Last Tsar: British Policy and Russia, 1894–1917 (1995).Sergey Tolstoguzov, \\"Russian–Japanese relations after the Russo-Japanese war in the context of world politics\\" Japan Forum (2016) 28#3 pp 282-298. A relatively new factor influencing Russian policy was the growth of Pan-Slavic spirit that identified Russia's duty to all Slavic speaking peoples, especially those who are Orthodox in religion. The growth of this impulse shifted attention away from the Ottoman Empire, and toward the threat posed to the Slavic people by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Serbia identified itself as the champion of the Pan-Slavic ideal; Austria vowed to destroy Serbia for that reason in 1914.Katrin Boeckh, \\"The Rebirth of Pan-Slavism in the Russian Empire, 1912–13.\\" in Katrin Boeckh and Sabine Rutar, eds. The Balkan Wars from Contemporary Perception to Historic Memory (2016) pp. 105-137. Historians continue to debate how much responsibility Russia shared for the war because of its automatic support for Serbia when it was under attack by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the July Crisis.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2014) pp 185-90, 293-300, 438-442, 480-487, 506-514, 561.Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig, Decisions for War, 1914-1917 (2004), pp 92-111. In a minority view, Sean McMeekin argues in The Russian Origins of the First World War (2011) that Russians had the greatest guilt, and their goal was imperial expansion in the Middle East.

It is not clear with whom he trained. He received commissions from the leading Antwerp publisher Hieronymus Cock. He made engravings after the paintings of famous Flemish painters of the previous generation as well as contemporary artists such as Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Frans Floris and Lambert Lombard. He also worked after the original designs made by contemporary artists such as Pieter Bruegel and Hans Bol for the publishing projects of Hieronymus Cock. An example is the project of four prints representing the four seasons, originally started by Bruegel as a project for Hieronymus Cock. Bruegel had revived the medieval tradition of depicting the four seasons with his monumental series of the months painted in 1565. When Bruegel died in 1569, he had only completed the designs for Spring and Summer. Hieronymus Cock then commissioned Bol to make designs for Autumn and Winter. The set of four prints were engraved by Pieter van der Heyden and published by Cock in 1570.Albert Elen, Hans Bol at Museum Boijmans van Beuningen Avarice, after Pieter Bruegel the Elder Pieter van der Heyden was from 1556 onwards one of the primary engravers of the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Although van der Heyden was not an inventive engraver and his figures are considered to be stiff and angular, Bruegel seems to have preferred working with the artist because of his highly skilled technique and his fidelity to the design he was copying. It is possible that because of his awareness of these limitations of van der Heyden, Bruegel started to adapt his designs so that they did not require skill in translating washing and free-flowing marks but could be followed line for line. Van der Heyden made 26 engravings after designs by Bruegel, the most of any other printmaker.Nadine Orenstein, Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Drawings and Prints, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.),, 45-46 and 137 Pieter van der Heyden marked his prints often with PME, the initials of his Latinized name, Peter Mercinus. He was last mentioned in March 1572.

Specialising in both the discus throw and shot put, Saifi is a double Paralympic gold medal winner and three time World Champion. Personal history Saifi was born in Mila, Algeria in 1988. Born able-bodied, she had her left leg amputated following after being hit by a car in 1998. Her father, realizing she needed something to work on in her spare time, encouraged her to take up an athletics career. She joined the Mila handisport club where she was able to train. Athletic career Thanks to her father's assistance and encouragement, Saifi made her international debut for Algeria at the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships in Assen. She entered both the shot put and discus throw, finishing fifth in both. Saifi made her first appearance at a Summer Paralympics in the 2008 Games in Beijing. She entered both the shot put and discus throw, finishing tenth and fourth respectively. Saifi's first major international success came at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, where she entered both the discus throw and the shot put. Although finishing ninth in the shot, she threw a distance of 40.99 metres to win the gold medal, an improvement of over six metres on her Beijing best. The following year she appeared at the 2012 Paralympics in London, winning gold in the discus and making her the joint World and Paralympic champion. At the 2013 IPC World Championships in Lyon Saifi not only retained her discus title, but also won a bronze in the shot put, her first medal in the event at world level. The discus event was a close affair with Saifi requiring a world record throw of 42.05 metres to record a higher points tally over Ireland's Orla Barry. Two years later in Doha, Saifi claimed her third consecutive World discus title in her class. In preparation for the Paralympics, she was trained by Hocine Saadoun for three hours a day, every day, except for weekends. Saifi cemented her position as one of the greatest Paralympic competitors at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. Despite throwing well below her best (her winning throw being 33.33 metres) she was still able to take the gold medal, making her unbeaten at world and Paralympic level since 2011. She also took silver in her less favoured shot put, her first at a Paralympics.

Zeilendörfer tend to occur as a result of the terrain and often lie on the edge of broad valleys. The individual house plots are arranged along a village street and have strips of farmland adjacent to the dwelling. It is a type of linear village. The farmsteads of these rural settlement types are strictly linear, because they run alongside a track or a small or larger watercourse. They can be viewed as one half of an Angerdorf or small Straßendorf that has been bisected longitudinally. The Zeilendorf differs from the Reihendorf or Hufendörfer mainly because of its regularity and the close proximity of adjacent dwellings as well as its generally small size. Whether front gardens are laid in front of the row of houses in a Zeilendorf, depends on regional tradition. Many narrow Zeilendörfer could develop into an Angerdorf through further building (e. g. Jetzles near Vitis) or into a larger Reihendorf (e. g. Kirchschlag near Linz). If the single line of settlement at the heart of the settlement was extended on the other side of the river or stream, the strips of land belonging to the farms would face one another on either side of the village street. If the elongated arable fields behind a single- or two-row village had a width of less than about 10 metres (which often used to happen as a result of inheritance division), they are known in the Upper German language area as Streifenparzellen (\\"strip plots\\") or Riemenparzellen (\\"belt plots\\"). Through combining plots and land amelioration more economically viable plots of land could be formed. Relatively elongated Zeilendörfer often develop along rivers, whose frequently flooding required the construction of the village street immediately on the edge of the river terrace, where agriculture was in any case restricted to one side. Such an example is Spillern on the Danube (see 2nd external link), where the single row of houses was not expanded into two rows until recent decades when it became a Straßendorf. A saying from earlier times is that in Spillern \\"the geese are only fried on one side.\\" Through the construction of the railway embankment in 1841, the side facing the river was made flood-proof and the former back doors (Hintauswege) now face the country road built soon after the construction of the railway, whilst on the river side, a branch of the Danube silted up.

The name Marks (historically Markes) is believed to have been derived from the de Merk family who build the original manor in the 14th Century. The manor house was demolished in 1808. History The Manor lay partly in the parish of Dagenham and partly in the Liberty of Havering with notable burials and marriages being carried out in the parish church in Romford, located in the market place. The origins of the manor can be traced back to the De Merk family, with Simon de Merk recorded in 1330 and Robert de Merk in 1352, although the first record of a house on this site is in 1386. While originally constructed by the De Merk family, by 1488 the manor was owned by the Heton Family and was still in the same family in 1556 when the manor was described as having 3 messuages, 300 acres land, 80 acres meadow, 200 acres pasture, 60 acres wood located variously in the parishes of Havering, Hornchurch, Dagenham and Barking. The owners, Thomas and Elizabeth Hales, sold the manor in 1557 to James Bacon and in 1584 it was claimed by Lady Anne Bacon and granted by her to her son Francis Bacon. However a survey made for him soon after this describes the building as a great house in decay and there does not seem to be any evidence that Francis Bacon ever resided at Marks, so that by 1589 George Hervey had been installed as tenant, going on to purchase the manor outright in 1596 for £1500. On his death in 1605 Sir George Hervey bequeathed 'the Manor of marks in Hornchurch in the Liberty of Havering-atte-Bower held freehold' to his son Sir Gawyn Hervie, Knight who lived there until his death in 1627. An illustration titled 'Marks House' showing a moated Elizabethan house probably dates from around this time, and a map dated 1618 shows Marks house as being just within the Liberty of Havering with a windmill nearby to the East. Gawen Hervey left the manor to his nephew Carew Hervey Mildmay, and as he was a Parliamentary commander in the Civil War Marks was attacked in June 1648 by Royalists on their way to Chelmsford, although the house appears to have remained in the family as a document of 1652 is signed by Carew Mildmay of Marks.. In 1666 the manor consisted of the main manor house with outbuildings, a yard, gardens and an orchard. An extensive collection of archives of the estate is held by the National Archives.

The usage of swords in courts-martial was an established tradition within the British armed forces. The accused was marched into their court-martial by an escort armed with a sword. Commissioned officers would be obliged to put their swords on the court table as a symbol of their rank and reputation being put on hold. At the conclusion of the hearing, the tip of the sword was turned towards them if they had been found guilty. The practice was abolished in 2004 following a claim that it was demeaning under the Human Rights Act 1998.  Practice  Traditionally in British courts-martial, all court officials would wear swords as well as all officers, whether they were a witness or were acting for the defence or prosecution. All accused, regardless of rank, would be marched into the courtroom by an armed escort. Officers' escorts would carry a drawn sword. If the accused was not an officer, the escort would carry a drawn cutlass. The accused officer would then have to lay his sword lengthwise on the court table as a symbol of putting his officer's commission and reputation on hold and on the line. When the verdict was decided, the judge would move the sword. If the tip of the sword pointed towards the accused, it meant they had been found guilty. If the sword was either unmoved or the hilt of the sword was pointing towards the accused then he had been found not guilty.  Abolition in the UK  In 2000, two weeks after the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force, a court martial was challenged that all swords should be removed from court as it was claimed to be \\"degrading\\". The Judge Advocate at the trial agreed for all present to remove their swords but did so under common law practice, describing them as an \\"unnecessary encumbrance\\". The European Court of Human Rights case of Grieves v United Kingdom, which concerned the independence of members of courts martial, referred to the use of swords but this was not part of the issues for determination by the court. In 2004 Her Majesty's Government declared that it would no longer require the accused to be marched in with an armed escort nor would any members present wear sheathed swords. This came after Grieves' solicitor had written to the Secretary of State for Defence comparing the procedure to a \\"Gilbert and Sullivan opera\\" and threatened to go back to the European Court for a ruling on swords for being intimidating. The Royal Australian Navy retains the practice of the sword on the table at courts-martial, as does the Indian Army.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Ten (VP-210) on 15 January 1943, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Ten (VPB-210) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 10 July 1945. Operational history *15 January 1943: VP-210 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, as a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3C Mariner under the operational control of FAW-5. Ground training for the squadron continued through April, with aircraft familiarization training given with crews alternating at NAAS Banana River, Florida. Ground and flight training was completed in August, and the squadron was transferred to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 9 August for advanced Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training. Training was completed with shakedown at NAAS Harvey Point, North Carolina, from 25 August through 10 September 1943. *11 August 1943: The first section of six VP-210 aircraft was transferred to NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Duties consisted of convoy coverage, antisubmarine sweeps and rescue missions. The squadron’s first casualties occurred on the 18th, when Lieutenant (jg) Joseph P. Willetts and his crew crashed while training with a friendly submarine south of Montauk Point, Long Island. All hands were lost. *12 October 1943: Lieutenant (jg) Daniel T. Felix Jr., and the crew of P-9 made a radar contact at night with a surface target during coverage of the Guantanamo-Trinidad convoy. The U-boat submerged after flares were dropped, but reappeared a second time. Lieutenant Felix and his crew were opposed by intense anti-aircraft fire from the submarine, which submerged again before a bombing attack could be made. *October–December 1943: A three-aircraft detachment of USAAF 23d Antisubmarine Squadron (Heavy) was attached to VP-210 for ASW operations in the Caribbean. This detachment flew the B-25 Mitchell medium bomber equipped with 75-mm cannon. The PBM aircraft of VP-210 were to locate the U-boats and illuminate them with flares for the B-25s. Unfortunately, no enemy contacts developed to test the effectiveness of this unique tactic. *1 November 1943: A five-aircraft detachment was based at Great Exuma, British West Indies, remaining until relieved by VP-32 in December. The detachment relieved VP-32 again from 30 June through 23 August 1944. *26 May 1944: Lieutenant J. F. Slavic and his crew made a forced landing during patrol due to a loose engine cowling. After landing safely and securing the cowl, the aircraft lost one engine during the takeoff. In the subsequent crash, the crew safely exited the sinking aircraft. All hands were rescued after 11 hours. *1 July 1944: Lieutenant Francis Gerli collided with the crash boat during takeoff at Great Exuma, resulting in an explosion which destroyed the boat and the aircraft. Six personnel in the aircraft were killed in the accident, with five more seriously injured. *4 October 1944: The squadron was reduced from 12 aircraft to 9 aircraft, with 14 combat aircrews. Personnel and aircraft detached from the squadron were sent to VPB-99. *November 1944: Two VPB-210 Mariners were fitted with two L8 searchlights apiece. Four of the squadron’s crews were given training in use of the lights. *17 June–10 July 1945: Operations were discontinued at NAS Guantanamo Bay and preparations were begun for disestablishment of the squadron. Aircraft were flown to NS San Juan, Puerto Rico, and turned over to HEDRON-11. On 2 July 1945, the entire squadron boarded for transportation to NAS Norfolk. On 10 July 1945, the squadron was disestablished.

He is a member of the Local Action and founder of the Land Justice League which are involved in conservation and environmental movements. He is known for his actions against the demolition of the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier in 2006 and 2007 and Choi Yuen Tsuen in 2009 and 2010. He was elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election in New Territories West. Social activism Chu was born in Hong Kong in 1977 and was educated at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. After his graduation in 1999, he studied Persian language at the Tehran University in Iran and worked as an editor and reporter, covering news in several Persian-speaking countries after he returned to Hong Kong. Chu became involved in cultural conservation and environmental issues and founded an activist group called Local Action. In 2006, he was one of the leaders to launch a campaign against the government's decision to demolish the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier for the Star Ferry and the Queen's Pier to make way for the land reclamation project. He camped inside the pier with other protesters and filed a judicial review with another environmentalist Ho Loy against the decision of the then Secretary for Home Affairs of 22 May 2007 not to declare the Queen's Pier a monument under the Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance (Cap 53). The Court of First Instance dismissed the judicial review application on 10 August 2007. In early 2009, he formed the Choi Yuen Tsuen Support Group to support the villagers who were forced to relocate due to the construction of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL). The movement grew into a massive protest in late 2009 and early 2010. After the proposal was passed by the Legislative Council in a controversial manner despite the protesters sieged the Legislative Council Building, Chu helped the villagers to rebuild a new eco-village. In mid 2011, he took part in setting up the Land Justice League, a community movement organisation. He engaged in grassroots work in Pat Heung and San Tin. He opposed the government's proposal of the North East New Territories New Development Areas. He was also involved in a \\"Going Local\\" campaign to preserve farmland and develop a sustainable communal economy in the New Territories. He ran in the 2011 District Council election in Pat Heung North, a constituency tightly controlled by the rural force. He ran again in 2015 District Council election in Pat Heung South under the banner of Urban-Rural Link, a campaign launched by the trio to promote green living and sustainable development. Despite his loss, Chu increased his votes from 283 to 1,482. On 29 March 2019, Chu lodged an inquiry to various local authorities, urging them to take the necessary steps to incorporate the Lok Ma Chau Loop into one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong (most likely to be a part of North District or Yuen Long District).關於︰落馬洲河套地區及特殊地區的選區劃定 Currently, the Lok Ma Chau Loop is the only unincorporated area in Hong Kong. Legislative Councillor =Candidacy= In 2016, he and like-minded, Demosisto's Nathan Law and Democracy Groundwork's Lau Siu-lai, contested in the Legislative Council election, where he ran in the New Territories West. He received the highest votes in the geographical constituencies by winning 84,121 votes without any party backing, leading the first runner-up, New People's Party's Michael Tien by about 13,000 votes. During the campaign, Chu took on the Heung Yee Kuk over its land rights, drawing public attention to the long-time allegations of collusion between the government, business, landlords and triads behind the Wang Chau housing project, which made the government to scale down the housing project from 17,000 flats to only 4,000 due to the pressure from the powerful rural leader Tsang Shu-wo who owned the brownfield land in Wang Chau. After the election, Chu was placed under round-the-clock police protection when he reported receiving death threats against him and his family. The incident escalated into a political crisis in the following weeks as the government was questioned over the alleged collusion. =As MLC= In the Legislative Council, Chu initially joined the 27-strong pro-democrats' caucus with Nathan Law and Lau Siu-lai but soon quit the caucus. In the 2017 Chief Executive election, he supported legislator Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats (LSD) to run for the Chief Executive through an unofficial civil petition, despite the mainstream pro-democrats backed former Financial Secretary John Tsang. Chu was criticised for his remarks in the pro- democracy primary of the 2018 Legislative Council by-election, in which he commented on Facebook warning the chance of veteran politician Frederick Fung, who became a backup candidate after losing to Chu-supported Yiu Chung-yim in the pro-democracy primary in case of Yiu's candidacy was disqualified, winning as voters might refuse to vote for him and therefore the camp should not blindly abide by the backup agreement. Fung later on announced his withdrawal as a backup candidacy, stating that he was under pressure. \\"Someone from the progressive democracy bloc told me that if I ran in the poll, they would definitely send someone as well [to challenge me],” Fung said. Chu denied he had been the one pressuring Fung to withdraw. Chu was also held responsible after Yiu who was believed to be largely dependent on Chu's campaign strategy, was narrowly defeated in the by-election. Disqualifications from village election candidacy (Autumn 2018) In November 2018 Kowloon West by- election, Lau Siu-lai, Chu's ally who signed a joint declaration advocating Hong Kong people's right to determination, was banning from running in the election based on her \\"pro-independence stance\\" as Hong Kong independence was one of the options in self-determination. It was widely speculated that Chu, who also signed the same declaration would also be barred from running in the re-election. In the same month Chu ran for the Village Representative election in Yuen Long. He was asked by Returning Officer Enoch Yuen if he agreed to uphold the Basic Law, agreed to recognise China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, and whether he supported Hong Kong independence. Chu restated his position that he has never supported Hong Kong independence: \\"I advocate and support the democratisation of the Basic Law and the political system – including but not limited to amending Article 158 and 159 of the Basic Law – as a goal of Hong Kongers’ self-determination after the Central Government blocked universal suffrage.\\" On 2 December, Chu was told that his candidacy was invalid, making him the tenth candidate barred from running in the election for his political belief and the first banned from running in the village- level election. Repeated ejections (May–June 2020) The pro-democracy camp (PDC) had successfully been filibustering the passage of the National Anthem Bill since October 2019, but their success was drawing to an end in May 2020. On 18 May 2020, Chu was involved in a scuffle that resulted in his forcible removal from the Legislative Council (LegCo) chamber. The incident started when a group of representatives from the PDC attempted to break through a ring of security guards around member Chan Kin-por who, pursuant to his appointment from a week earlier, had taken the chairperson seat to prepare the election of the chairperson of the Legislative Council House Committee. Following the removal or boycott of most PDC members, the regular business of the council resumed, with Starry Lee being elected chairwoman of the house committee. Chu said of the incident that \\"If Hong Kong was a democracy, we would not need to start scuffles like this\\", but that he \\"can foresee more fights within the chamber and outside the chamber.\\" On 28 May, during the second day of debate on the National Anthem Bill, Chu was ordered to leave the chamber on orders of President Andrew Leung for displaying a placard that was seen as mocking LegCo chairwoman Starry Lee. Chu's initial refusal to leave caused a delay in LegCo proceedings for about an hour. After the meeting resumed, fellow lawmaker Raymond Chan walked away from his seat to protest against the ejection of Chu, for which he was ordered by Leung to leave and later taken away by security guards. On 4 June, in an attempt to disrupt the third reading of the National Anthem Bill at the Legislative Council, Chu and fellow lawmaker, Raymond Chan, attempted to disperse pungent liquid towards the President of the Legislative Council, Andrew Leung. They were stopped before they could have reached the rostrum; Chan dropped the liquid and a lantern on the floor. On 16 June, LegCo president Leung announced that Chu and Chan would be fined roughly HK$100,000 each for their actions. Chu declared the same day that he and Chan would examine and possibly challenge the decision. Personal life Chu married his former colleague Au Pui-fun from the media industry in 2010. The couple have a daughter, Chu Puk-tsin (朱不遷), whose personal name literally means \\"not relocating\\", in commemoration his activism against the relocation of Choi Yuen Tsuen.

It is a Georgian building located in the oldest part of Poole Quay, and is currently used as a restaurant. History A representation of the Custom House being raided, as in 1747. The original Custom House building was built in 1747. In the same year, the Custom House was the site of a burglary, in which 30 smugglers, led by members of the Hawkhurst Gang, raided the house and took two tons of smuggled tea and 39 barrels of rum, worth over £500, that had previously been confiscated. The raid happened at night, with the gang reaching Poole at 11pm. The tea was then taken through Fordingbridge. Four men were convicted at the Old Bailey in 1749, during which they argued that \\"there was no crime in smuggling\\" and that they were just \\"recovering their own goods\\". Three of the four men convicted were hanged at Tyburn. In 1788 the Custom House produced a report on notorious smuggler Isaac Gulliver, noting he focused mainly on wine smuggling. The current Custom House in Poole was built in 1813, during a time in which Poole and Bournemouth were growing; the old Custom House building was destroyed by fire. In the nineteenth century, the Custom House was used for collecting extra taxes for boats entering Poole Harbour. In 1838, the building was run by Gartside & Co. The Custom House was closed by HM Treasury in 1883, with the customs being transferred to Weymouth's custom house. In 1954, the Custom House became a Grade II* listed building. Restaurant The Custom House was restored and originally opened as a seafood restaurant in 1997 before changing to the Custom House Cafe in 2018. It overlooks Poole Quay with views of Brownsea Island. On summer Thursdays, the restaurant hosts live music as part of the Poole Quay fireworks displays.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Eleven (VP-211) on 15 February 1943, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Eleven (VPB-211) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 14 June 1945. Operational history VPB-211 PBM-3s over Rio de Janeiro in December 1943 *15 February 1943: VP-211 was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, as a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3C Mariner under the operational control of FAW-5. Training continued at Norfolk through May. Shakedown training was conducted at NAAS Elizabeth City, North Carolina, commencing on 21 May 1943. *7 August 1943: Lieutenant (jg) E. C. Scully and crew attacked and damaged a surfaced U-boat off the coast near Elizabeth City. On the first and second bomb run, the bomb release malfunctioned. By the third bombing run the submarine was below the surface. The manual release was used and the U-boat was blown back to the surface. Lieutenant (jg) Scully made several strafing passes on the damaged submarine, but one after another of his aircraft's machine guns froze up until only the tail gun, firing single shots, remained. By this time the heavy anti-aircraft fire from the U-boat had severely damaged the hull of the Mariner. Scully was forced to leave the area before leaking fuel tanks forced him down. He managed to land safely and beach the aircraft on a spit of sand before it sank. *25 August 1943: A detachment of eight crews was sent to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, for advanced Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) warfare training at AsDevLant, returning on 25 September. *27 September 1943: VP-211 received orders to deploy to NAF Aratu, Bahia, Brazil. The squadron's last section of four aircraft arrived at Aratu on 16 October and relieved VP-74, coming under the operational control of FAW-16. VP-211 became a part of Task Force 44, an integral part of the Fourth Fleet. A detachment of six aircraft was maintained at Governor's Island, NAF Galeão, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, due to the distance of Aratu from the “slot” where U-boat hunting was so abundant. The slot was the area where the U-boats traversed the Atlantic from north to south via a regular route. On 12 November the squadron shifted its headquarters to Galeão for a three-month period, leaving a three-aircraft detachment at Aratu. NAF Galeão, while nearer to the hunting area, had primitive living conditions and frequently was shrouded in early morning fog. The squadron's first searchlight mission was conducted in February, and from that time on, nearly all of the squadron's patrols were conducted at night. *January 1944: The squadron's 14 to 16 hour patrols began to take their toll on the aircraft. Maintenance facilities in the area were very basic, so engine changes were made at sea off Florianópolis, Brazil. Engine changes were made in four sections of three aircraft each, with one Mariner undergoing the change, while the second stood by to assist in the maintenance, with the third hauling supplies, gasoline, personnel and food. *12 January 1944: The squadron suffered its first operational loss during a training exercise when Ensign Thomas E. Donahue and crew P-8 dropped a depth charge from too low an altitude. The munitions exploded near the tail, causing the plane to crash and burn. Crew P-4 landed immediately and rescued five critically injured survivors from the water. *10 June 1944: VP-211 was relocated to NAF Natal, Brazil, the equal of Galeao in terms of primitive living conditions. In addition, the operating area of the seaplane base at NAF Parnamirim Field was located on the Potengy River down river from the crews’ quarters. The primary duties while at this location consisted of barrier sweeps, which were plots predicated on the relative movement of German submarines conducted at distances approximately from base. *28 September 1944: Crew P-4 located a surfaced U-boat by radar and was driven off by the heavy anti-aircraft fire before an attack could be made. An accurate fix on the location of the submarine was made, and on 29 September two VB-107 aircraft flown by Lieutenants E. A. Krug and J. T. Burton made a coordinated attack on U-863. The U-boat was found in the same vicinity as the sighting made by VP-211 on the previous day. The sinking was confirmed by postwar review of enemy records. *29 September 1944: VP-211 was reduced in size from 12 aircraft to 9; these aircraft and personnel were sent to join VPB-98 at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. *21 November 1944: The squadron's second operational loss occurred when Lieutenant Robert H. Lind and crew P-2, while on patrol between Natal and Aratu, encountered a violent thunderstorm and crashed into the sea, losing all hands. *January 1945: VPB-211 was temporarily based aboard at Bahia Bay to assist in the training of the ship's crew in handling seaplanes at advanced bases. *February 1945: VPB-211 was temporarily based aboard at Bahia Bay to assist in the training of the ship's crew in handling seaplanes at advanced bases. *1–31 March 1945: The squadron was temporarily based aboard for advanced base training. *April 1945: VPB-211 was based aboard at Bahia Bay to assist in the training of the ship's crew in handling seaplanes at advanced bases. *16 May 1945: Convoy patrols were discontinued. On 24 May orders were received to turn over the squadron's aircraft to HEDRON-11 at NS San Juan, Puerto Rico, and proceed to NAS Norfolk for disestablishment. *14 Jun 1945: VPB-211 was disestablished at NAS Norfolk.

He further emphasized that the rope must retain its original twist, as it is sewn in place, to avoid distorting the edge of the sail.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Twelve (VP-212) on 15 March 1943, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Twelve (VPB-212) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 15 May 1946. Operational history *15 March–September 1943: VP-212, a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3S Mariner, was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, under the operational control of FAW-5. Ground school and flight training continued at Norfolk through September. Since 90 percent of the flight crews had no flying experience in the PBM aircraft, most of the officers in the unit were sent to NAS Banana River, Florida, for the three-month course, while 10 percent took the shorter three-week course. On 11 August the squadron was relocated to NAAS Harvey Point, North Carolina, for shakedown. On 25 August the squadron was sent to the AsDevLant at NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, for advanced training in Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and use of radar. The squadron returned to NAAS Harvey Point on 10 September for completion of flight training. *24 September 1943: The squadron suffered its first operational losses when Lieutenant William J. Walker, the squadron executive officer, and five members of his crew were killed in a crash while attempting a night landing at NAAS Harvey Point in stormy weather. *30 September 1943: VP-212 was transferred to NS San Juan, Puerto Rico, under the operational control of FAW-11. Duties at this location consisted of convoy coverage and ASW sweeps. A detachment was maintained at NAF Antigua, British West Indies. The primary function of the squadron was to block U-boats from entering the Caribbean convoy routes. Sweeps were flown north and south of Mona Passage and north and south of Anegada Passage. *17 December 1943: Lieutenant H. M. Whaling and crew were providing night convoy coverage for transports en route to Curaçao, Netherlands West Indies, when they approached what they believed to be one of the escort vessels. As it turned out, they had approached a surfaced U-boat and were driven off by intense anti-aircraft fire before an attack run could be made. Although not successful in sinking the submarine, the aircraft did interrupt the firing plot the U-boat commander was preparing to execute on the Spanish tanker Campestra. *1 April 1944: Lieutenant (jg) G. R. Gregory and crew attacked a surfaced U-boat northeast of Puerto Rico in broad daylight. Although a perfect straddle of depth charges was made, damage was assessed as minimal. The Sonobuoys dropped on the second run had failed to work due to dead batteries, a recurrent problem in the tropics. *27 May 1944: The squadron was relocated to NAF Port of Spain, Trinidad, British West Indies, with a detachment maintained at NAF Esquibo, British Guyana. In August, continuous coverage of convoy traffic was discontinued. One unusual duty assigned the squadron during this period was searching for U.S. Navy mines that had broken loose from their moorings and drifted into the shipping lanes. served as the advanced base at NAF Paramaribo and NAF Esquibo, British Guyana, until relieved by in November 1944. *12 January 1945: VPB-212 was relocated back to NS San Juan, with a detachment maintained at NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. *4 April 1945: VPB-212 was transferred to NAS Quonset Point, under the operational control of FAW-9, relieving VPB-84. Duties at this location consisted of convoy coverage and ASW sweeps. These activities were discontinued with the receipt of a dispatch on 21 May and training flights only were scheduled. *30 May–June 1945: VPB-212 began transferring its aircraft in sections of four to NAAS Harvey Point, coming under the operational control of FAW-5. Upon arrival of the last crew on 4 June the entire squadron was given home leave through the 15th. Upon return, the squadron was issued new PBM-5E aircraft. A period of reforming and retraining in navigation, communications and recognition began. Day and night familiarization hops were flown, and target practice on gunnery sleeves was conducted. *19 July–13 August 1945: VPB-212 was transferred to NAS Norfolk. When the last of the squadron’s three sections arrived on 24 July, all of the squadron personnel were granted leave through 13 August. *25 August 1945–March 1946: VPB-212 was transferred to NAS Alameda, California, under the operational control of FAW-8. On 27 August the squadron was sent to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington, on temporary duty. The squadron had barely begun training when the war ended and orders were received to begin demobilizing officers immediately, leaving inexperienced personnel to carry on. New replacement crews were often demobilized before they reached operational capability. The situation did not improve until March 1946, when 10 crews were certified as ready for operations. *15 May 1946: VPB-212 was disestablished at NAS Whidbey Island.

By 1908 Richards had gained experience as an automotive engineer working for Rolls-Royce and Belsize, and set up as an independent consultant in Manchester.The Commercial Motor, 20 August 1908, Page 10 Lee-Richards annular aeroplanes Non-flying replica of the biplane In 1910 Cedric Lee approached Richards to work on an annular biplane which he had acquired half- finished from J. G. A. Kitchen. Together they finished the aeroplane, fitting a Gnome Omega engine in the front. The machine is known variously as the Kitchen annular biplane and the Lee-Richards annular biplane. Flight tests in 1911 were disappointing and that Autumn the biplane was destroyed on the ground by high winds, when its hangar collapsed.Jarrett (1976)Lewis, P.; British Aircraft 1809-1914, Putnam, 1962, pages 340-343. A non-flying replica later appeared in the 1965 film Those magnificent men in their flying machines and is now on display at the Newark Air Museum. Lee and Richards continued experimenting with models and Richards especially further developed the aerodynamic theory of the annular wing. They developed a form having a circular lower wing with an auxiliary plane above the front half of the main wing. A full-size manned glider proved successful. Model tests of a new design at the National Physics Laboratory gave promising results, confirming that an annular monoplane would be aerodynamically stable and have benign stalling characteristics. Through 1913-14 three monoplanes were built and flown. All were stable in flight and successively showed improved handling. Richards would continue to promote the benefits of the annular wing throughout his life, but without success. While working for Beardmore in 1916 he patented an improved method of construction. WWI and aftermath The Beardmore W.B.III When war broke out, Richards was commissioned into the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as an inspector of Naval aircraft. He was sent to Beardmore, who were manufacturing other companies' designs under licence. In due course he resigned his commission to become assistant manager and designer. From 1916 to 1917 he produced their first in-house aircraft designs, achieving his greatest success with the W.B.III, a navalised version of the Sopwith Pup which Beardmore were manufacturing under license. Other Beardmore types which he designed included the W.B.1, W.B.2, W.B.IV, W.B.V and W.B.VI. After the war there was little demand for aircraft and he moved to Martinsyde as general manager, where they were changing over from aircraft manufacture to motor cycles.Flight, 22 January 1954,.Page 95 Science Museum In 1924 he went to work for the Science Museum, London and remained there until his retirement in 1954.

It is known for its singing staff and eccentric décor. In 2012, Bom-Bane's featured on the Canadian reality television show, World's Weirdest Restaurants and in 2016 on BBC Radio 3's The Verb. In 2007, Bom-Bane's won the ThreeWeeks Editors award for the best venue in that year's Brighton Fringe Festival. Venue Nick Pynn unveils the statue on 1 September 2007, the café's first birthday. By the door is Jane Bom-Bane. The small downstairs area is the main live venue, where past performers include Nick Pynn, Kate Daisy Grant, Stewart Lee, Bridget Christie, Mike Heron, Robin Williamson, Boothby Graffoe, Lorraine Bowen, Arthur Brown, Spacedog, George Egg, Joanna Neary, Foster and Gilvan, David Bramwell, Gilli Bloodaxe, Steve Hawley and Jerry Dammers. Each May, for the Brighton Fringe Festival, Jane Bom-Bane and her 'Bom-Bane Family Players' perform a musical, which often takes place throughout the building. Each table in the upstairs dining area has a 'mechanical secret.' One table top imperceptibly rises, another slowly revolves, and another contains a model of Brighton's Palace Pier, with working rides. Chimes ring out when customers lift the salt cellar on one table, and another has a screen showing 1920s black and white cartoons of Aesop's Fables. The tables were mainly built by Bom-Bane and her then partner, Nick Pynn. In 2007, she told the Guardian, \\"We stay up late and work together. I'll be busy painting and moulding the tiny parts, he'll be fixing a circuit.\\" On the wall outside, there was a statue of Bom-Bane, built by her brother-in-law, John Jostins, who worked on the R2-D2 from The Empire Strikes Back. During the night of 1 December 2012, thieves stole the statue from the wall of the restaurant. Jane Bom-Bane told the Argus, 'I feel like my alter ego has been snatched. It has no use or value to anyone else, but it is a part of us.' With the theft unsolved, puppeteer Isobel Smith organised a collection from café regulars to raise money for a new statue. The second one, built by the artist Paul Harrison, was unveiled on 11 January 2015. The original statue was later recovered and now sits in the dining room. On 22 July 2017, the replacement statue was attacked by vandals, who stole the head and the tray. The café regularly shows films and also runs occasional courses on art, photography, cryptic crossword solving, film, baking and singing.Nione Meakin, 'My Brighton -Jane Bom-Bane', Viva Magazine, September 2016 There is a children's homework club on Wednesday nights. 'One of the charms of the venue', writes Daniel Agnew, 'is how young children turn up to do their homework and are treated with the same respect as the musicians rehearsing in the Moroccan parlour downstairs. Indeed, the café possesses so many surrealist twists you would be forgiven for thinking the venue had originally been conceived in a dreamy child's mind.' Jane Bom-Bane Jane Bom-Bane was born Jane Bayley in Leek, Staffordshire.Andy Gregory (ed) The International Who's Who in Popular Music, Europa Publications 2002, p.52 After moving to and growing up in Coventry, she became lead singer of the Two-Tone band, the Swinging Cats, who released one single, 'Mantovani'. In the 90s, she went solo, playing the harmonium and singing her own songs, while wearing a selection of mechanical hats, which 'light up and turn and move in various ways'. A typical hat takes the form of an animated goldfish bowl.World's Weirdest Restaurants, April 25, Food Network Canada. World's Weirdest Restaurants presenter Bob Blumer described her hats as 'part genius and part outsider art. What I love about the hats is that they are not highly polished, finely tuned specimens. They are more like little kinetic high school art projects that sit on your head.' The idea to open a café came to Bom-Bane while running a monthly musical event in Brighton with Nick Pynn. She told Brighton's Source magazine, \\"I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to have your harmoniums and your hats in one place, and have a little venue down stairs, have a little café upstairs.’ I thought originally it'd just be me and the café, and play a few songs every now and then. It just evolved into what it is now, which is involving lots of other people playing, cinema clubs and all manner of stuff going on.\\" The café opened on 1 September 2006. Interviewed on the opening's tenth anniversary, Bom-Bane recalled, \\"I'd never run an eatery before, so the first year of Bom-Bane's was a steep learning curve. It wasn't until the second year that I put the music part of the plan into action.\\" Performances =Bom-Bane's the Musical= Jane Bom- Bane, Nick Pynn and Rosi Lalor perform 'Bom-Bane's the Musical', 30 May 2008 The tradition of employing 'singing staff' began when Bom-Bane hired Rosi Lalor and Candy Hilton. Bom-Bane told Source magazine: 'Bom-Bane's mark two, in terms of the people who worked here, involved a lovely girl called Rosi and her friend Candy. I just thought they were perfect for the place, but both turned out to have amazing voices and were really great at harmonising. I thought ‘I’ve got to harness this!’ And so, that became Bom-Bane's The Musical. I wrote all these songs about setting up Bom-Bane's, and the food, and everybody got involved.' Bom-Bane's the Musical, which included songs written by Lalor and Hilton, was first performed in the Brighton Fringe Festival in May 2008, and ran over the next two years. Lalor has said it was while working at Bom-Bane's that she \\"learned how to hold her head up whilst singing her songs. Jane also taught her how to enunciate her lyrics properly so that people could understand what she was saying. ('Rosi, you’ve spent ages writing these beautiful words, people deserve to hear them!')\\" =A Musical History of 24 George Street= For her 2011 fringe show, Bom-Bane researched the history of the building, writing songs about its previous occupants. According to the Argus review, 'Over the course of an evening – and a three- course dinner – audience members are taken on a musical journey through time. The building's story is told simply through song, from 1795 when the house was built, through to the present day....The performers recount the stories of the many families who have lived there over the years, from musical instrument maker William Baker in the 1830s to bicycle dealer Mr Moreman in the 1950s.' =Jane Bom-Bane’s House= In 2012, Bom-Bane first used the whole building as the setting for her fringe show. A small audience of four was led upstairs by Bom-Bane, singing a health and safety warning about the staircase, to the bathroom, 'where we were confronted by a beautiful tableau, accompanied with a song by the hostess. Next, the living room, where a rotating series of guest performers are made up of famous friends of Jane's doing wonderful and curious things. Then up another flight of steps to a display of Jane's infamous mechanical hats from previous productions, all impressively animated to a new musical number. Then up more stairs for a surprise performance in the attic, and finally to the master bedroom for a final song....Members of our party were audibly cooing and gasping at each new discovery, until we were, at last, led carefully back down the winding, narrow staircases into the restaurant for an all-you-can-eat-buffet....A magical end to a magical evening.' =5 Down 20 Across= In May 2013, to celebrate the centenary of the crossword puzzle, Jane Bom-Bane created 5 Down 20 Across, which turned the building itself into a puzzle. Audience members were invited to solve this by collecting clues from all the doors in the building. Each door had a black-and-white painting by a different artist. One of the doors, painted by Peter Chrisp, which told the story of the Franklin Expedition, can be seen on YouTube. =Merrily on High= The Silver Swans (l-r: Emma Kilbey, Eliza Skelton and Jane Bom-Bane) In 2013, Jane Bom-Bane wrote a Christmas musical, Merrily on High, which was performed throughout December. This featured puppetry by Daisy Jordan (Barely Human Puppets), with singing by the madrigal folk trio The Silver Swans, comprising Bom-Bane, Emma Kilbey and Eliza Skelton, who is also the café's chef. =The Long Lost River Song= Bom-Bane's 2014 May fringe show was inspired by Brighton's lost secret river, an intermittent stream called the Wellesbourne. Five audience members were invited to follow the river, as it flowed from its source in the attic to 'a sea-bound chorus in the cellar, followed by a feast of foods foraged en route.' Rachel Blackman described the show in Fringe Review: 'We are invited into her bedroom for one act and her bathroom for another. We trace the river through rooms in the house, all the way down to the restaurant level, gathering cast members as the river itself gathers momentum. Finally we land in the restaurant area where we are fed a three course meal of simple, delicious fare sourced locally.'Rachel Blackman, 'The Long Lost River Song', Fringe Review, 29 May 2014 4 For this show, the company comprised Jane Bom-Bane, Eliza Skelton, Foz Foster, Colin Uttley, Freya Bowyes, Martin Peters, Lynne Thomas, Sarah Angliss and Daisy Jordan. =Saippuakivikauppias= Bom-Bane's 2015 fringe show was called Saippuakivikauppias, which means 'The Soapstone Seller' in Finnish, and is also thought to the longest palindromic word. This was a second collaboration between Jane Bom-Bane and the puppeteer Daisy Jordan. The show dramatised a tale originally written, in verse, by Bom-Bane in 2002, the year of the Palindrome. The audience followed the Midgard Serpent down into the underbelly of the cafe, where 'the tale of a troubled craftsman driven and hampered by his compulsion to remain symmetrical was told through song, puppetry and animation.' The songs were sung by Bom-Bane, Martin Peters and Eliza Skelton. The performance was followed by a Finnish meal, created by André and Anna Schmidt, including mackerel pâté, Firewater (vodka and cranberry juice), meatballs (veggie meatball option included) and Mustikkapiirakka (blueberry pie).'An all-round sensory treat, this thoughtful existential fable effortlessly sucks the audience into its beautifully rendered world,' said Nick Aldwinckle in The Argus.Nick Aldwinckle, 'Saippuakivikauppias' review, The Argus, 5 May 2015. =Bom-Banimals= The lion in Bom-Banimals, the 2016 musical Bom-Banimals, in May 2016, was an animal themed fantasia, again taking place throughout the building. An audience of six was invited to move from room to room, encountering a series of musical animals (Eliza Skelton, Foz Foster, Kate Daisy Grant, Raven Kaliana, Jo McDonagh, Sebas Contreras, Kate Vaughan, and Tom Walker). Rachel Blackman described the experience in Fringe Review: 'We barely manage to squeeze into each of the modest spaces with the performers who gradually accumulate and eventually outnumber us. In each room we meet a different animal, all of whom must sacrifice a beloved item in order to find their authentic voice....if there is a message to be had, it is a light one, but touches on the notion that if we love someone, giving a piece of ourselves is a risk, but can pay off one hundredfold....And a plea maybe for the ongoing existence of this kind of intimate, real time, unrepeatable experience, where the value to each of us is so much more rich, raw and indescribable than the price of a ticket.' The show was also reviewed in Total Theatre and received five stars from the Argus. =Snow White and the Seven Sisters= For Christmas 2018, Jane Bom-Bane, with Eliza Skelton, wrote a folk musical, Snow White and the Seven Sisters. This combined the traditional fairy tale with stories of seven sisters, including the constellation, the waterfall in Norway and the chalk cliffs in Sussex. Keeping the theme of seven, the songs were in seven time. Eliza Skelton played Snow White, Jane Bom-Bane was the witch, and the rest of the cast comprised Daisy Jordan, Becca Dyer, Kate Daisy Grant and Martin Peters.News', Daisy Jordan's Barely Human Puppets website References External links *Bom-Bane's website *Rosi Lalor's website *Nick Pynn's website *'Jane Bom-Bane and her Mechanical Hats', a film from the Brighton Mini Makers Fair *Jane Bom-Bane's Talk during the 2012 'Agents of Change' at Fabrica Theatres in Brighton and Hove 1795 establishments in England Music venues in East Sussex Tourist attractions in Brighton and Hove ","title":"Bom-Bane's"},{"id":"51509531","text":"Esther Obeng Dapaah (born 9 May 1945) is a Ghanaian female politician and a lawyer.

After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops broke through Soviet lines. Mogilev was heavily fortified and bypassed by German tank forces. German infantry steadily reduced the pocket, and by late July, the defending Soviet troops had run out of ammunition and other necessary supplies. As a result, Soviet commander Fyodor Bakunin went against orders and ordered a breakout. A small number of Soviet troops were able to reach Soviet lines, and 35,000 were reported captured by German troops. The defense of Mogilev tied down four German infantry divisions, delaying their attack on Gomel for a week.  Background  In late June, Soviet troops began constructing defenses around Mogilev and on the Drut River 19 kilometers to the west of the city. The city's buildings were fortified and minefields and trenches were created. Attacks from the XXXXVII Motorized Corps and the XXIV Motorized Corps were repulsed. Heinz Guderian, commander of Panzer Group 2, decided to bypass the city instead of attacking it. He ordered the XXXXVI and XXIV Motorized Corps to head for the Sozh River. Map of the Battle of Smolensk, showing the Siege of Mogilev  Siege  = Encirclement of Mogilev = On 13 July, 13th Army commander Vasily Gerasimenko withdrew his army east towards the Sozh River, leaving the forces in Mogilev under the command of 61st Rifle Corps commander Fyodor Bakunin. XXXXVI Motorized Corps' SS Das Reich Motorized Division took blocking positions north of Chausy to prevent Soviet units at Mogilev from escaping to the northeast on 13 July. The XXIV Motorized Corps advanced east from the Bykhov bridgehead on 14 July. Chausy and Propoysk were captured the next day, completing the encirclement of Mogilev. Along with the Grossdeutschland Motorized Infantry Regiment and the SS Das Reich Motorized Division, the 3rd Panzer and 10th Motorized Divisions of XXIV Motorized Corps maintained the encirclement until 17 July. At this time, the Soviet troops in Mogilev included the 61st Rifle Corps' 53rd Rifle Division, 110th Rifle Division, and 172nd Rifle Division, the 20th Mechanized Corps' 26th and 38th Tank and 210th Motorized Divisions. Most of the 20th Rifle Corps' 132nd, 137th, and 160th Rifle Divisions were also in the encirclement, along with parts of the 148th and 187th Rifle Divisions from the 48th Rifle Corps, and the 1st Motorized Division. On the night of 16 July, Gerasimenko ordered all troops of the 13th Army except for the 61st Rifle Corps and the 20th Mechanized Corps to withdraw east to the Sozh. A group led by 172nd Rifle Division commander Mikhail Romanov was the core of the defense. Romanov's group included the 110th and 172nd Rifle Divisions, remnants or regiments from the 132nd, 137th, 160th, and 143rd Rifle Divisions, as well as the remnants of the 20th Mechanized Corps. The Soviet defenders also included units of the People's Militia. = Attacks of VII Army Corps = Between 16 and 17 July, the troops of the German 2nd Army reached the Dnieper. After relieving the units of Panzer Group 2, 2nd Army commander Maximilian von Weichs ordered VII Army Corps commander Wilhelm Fahrmbacher to lead the operations to take Mogilev. On 20 July, the 7th Infantry Division and 23rd Infantry Division attacked the city from the west. The attack was repulsed by entrenched Soviet troops and artillery fire. German troops crossed the Dnieper on the northern and southern flanks of the position, capturing a bridge over the Dnieper and breaking through Soviet defenses near Buinichi, only 8 kilometers from the center of the city. The 15th and 78th Infantry Divisions became part of the VII Army Corps so that it could close the encirclement. The 15th Infantry Division was placed between the 7th and 23rd Divisions, and the 78th was located southeast of the city. On 21 July the 9th Regiment of the 23rd Division outflanked Soviet positions on a bridge into Mogilev from the southeast, capturing it after heavy fighting. The 23rd broke through the Soviet inner defenses along the bend of the Dnieper and repulsed multiple heavy counterattacks. Late that day, Bakunin reported to 21st Army headquarters, stating that artillery shells had been \\"used up\\" and requesting more ammunition. TB-3 bombers had attempted to airdrop supplies, although a large number landed behind German lines and a large number retrieved by Soviet troops were of the incorrect caliber. Elements of the 1st Motorized Division fought their way into the encirclement from the north. On 22 July the 78th Infantry Division repulsed an attempt by Soviet troops to fight into the pocket from the northeast. It also repulsed an attempt by the 61st Rifle Corps to break out of the encirclement in its eastern sector. During the night the attacks of the 78th Infantry Division broke through the southern part of the Soviet lines, capturing 5,000 and large numbers of equipment. To stop the supply drops, German troops deployed Barrage balloons. On 24 July, the 23rd, 15th, 7th, and 78th Infantry Divisions advanced to the center of the city, beginning street fighting. By late 25 July, the Soviet troops in Mogilev had used up all of the ammunition, food, and fuel. = Soviet breakout = Bakunin ordered Soviet troops in Mogilev to break out to the east on the night of 2627 July, by which point the troops had almost entirely run out of ammunition. This contravened orders from higher headquarters. Thousands of wounded Soviet troops were left behind in the city with doctors. A small number of Soviet troops were able to escape and reach Soviet lines. Romanov was captured after his column attempted to join up with a German convoy and was destroyed.  Aftermath  Western Front commander Semyon Timoshenko reported on 27 July that Bakunin had been turned over to a military tribunal for his ordering the breakout. German troops reported capturing 35,000 soldiers and 245 guns during the operation. The 23rd Infantry Division lost more than 1,000 men in the operation. The defense of Mogilev prevented German troops from using its bridges for a week, although German troops built temporary bridges over the Dnieper in six other places. The Siege of Mogilev delayed 2nd Army's attack on Gomel for more than a week. This delay allowed Timoshenko to bring up reinforcements for the Battle of Smolensk. Mogilev later was called \\"Gallant Mogilev\\" and \\"the Belarusian Madrid\\" in Soviet sources.

Career On graduating, Tennent became a nursing sister at Wellington Hospital, and was appointed Assistant Matron in 1920. In 1922 she was given six months leave from her position to study midwifery; she passed the examinations with an equal-first in the country. In 1925 she was appointed Matron of Dunedin Hospital.

It was prepared by the International Organization for Standardization's Technical Committee ISO/TC 37, Terminology and other language and content resources, Subcommittee SC 5, Translation, interpreting and related technology. Description This standard \\"specifies requirements for all aspects of the translation process directly affecting the quality and delivery of translation services. It includes provisions for translation service providers (TSPs) concerning the management of core processes, minimum qualification requirements, the availability and management of resources, and other actions necessary for the delivery of a quality translation service. The use of raw output from machine translation plus post-editing is outside the scope of this standard. Neither does it apply to interpreting services.ISO 17100:2015 Translation Services-Requirements for Translation Services. Technical Committee ISO/TC37, 2015. Based on EN 15038, this standard transfers the original EN 15038 requirements to the ISO framework. For example, it defines resource types including human resources (such as translators, revisers, reviewers, proofreaders and project managers) as well as technical and technological resources. Translation steps including translation (including a check of translation by the translator himself or herself), revision by a second person, review (an optional step, designed in order to assess the suitability of the translation against the agreed purpose, domain, and the recommended corrective measures), proofreading (an optional pre- publication check) and final verification are defined by this standard. Besides the standard itself, there are six Annexes that help to explain certain aspects of the standard by providing examples or graphics so as to visualize the standard, e.g. Annex A visualizes translation workflow, Annex D lists pre-production tasks. =Minimum standards= The new characteristics of ISO 17100 compared to EN 15038 are: firstly, it sets minimum standards such as the requirements for translations to be subject to revision by a second person, which is an obligatory part of the standard. =Qualifications= Secondly, although widely and controversially discussed whilst in development, a new requirement regarding the appropriate qualifications in the subject area regarding the translation work is added in the standard as it prescribes that a translator should have “a certificate of competence in translation awarded by an appropriate government body”. \\"In this way, translator, proofreader and reviser all need to have sufficient knowledge in the field of the texts to be translated to understand and deal with any problems From EN 15038 to ISO 17100: the new standard for translation processes. TL Conference 2014 Warsaw.\\". =Pre-production= Thirdly, the work involved in the pre- production processes has been extended considerably. In this ISO standard, the success of a translation project lies in the cooperation between clients and contractors, rather than completely a responsibility of the contractors. Meanwhile, all relevant requirements including quality of the target text, nature and scope of quality assurance, use of style guides should also be defined and agreed on in advance. =Feedback process= Fourthly, the standard requires a process for handling client feedback, which is used to find out the actual quality of translation and the satisfaction of client. Meanwhile, the translation service provider is also responsible for the archiving of translation projects. =Data protection= Last but not the least, ISO 17100 states that data protection requirements must be met as translations are sometimes confidential, involving sensitive information from the client.

The low dense and spreading shrub typically grows to a height of and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has undissected, flat, linear leaves with a blade that is in length and wide. It blooms between May and October and produces an axillary raceme irregular inflorescence with orange or red flowers with green or pink styles. Later it forms ribbed or ridged, ovoid, simple hairy fruit that are long. The species was first formally described by the botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1923 as part of the work Contributions to the flora of Western Australia as published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The type specimen was collected by Gardner near Yorkrakine in 1922. The shrub is endemic to an area in the south eastern Wheatbelt and western Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it is found on sandplains and often on or near granite outcrops where it grows in sandy, sandy-loam and sandy-clay soils often with gravel. It has a scattered distribution between Mount Gibson and Wubin in the north down to Hyden and Southern Cross in the south where it makes up part of shrubland or mallee heath communities.

The once almost entirely agriculturally based village at the northern edge of the Usinger Becken first appeared in 1280 in the County Cleeberg under the name of Ketteneschbach.Eberhard Schrimpf: Bilder einer Stadt - Usinger Straßen, Plätze und Gebäude im Wandel der Zeit. Hrsg.: Stadt Usingen. Zweiter Bildband. Usingen Juli 2015, S. 80. The current district of Usingen was known far beyond the Taunus already early through good catering, later through the campsite in the forest and the former weekend-settlement below the Eschbacher Klippen. Geographical Setting The village is located on the eponymous river at the northern edge of the Usinger Becken. Hence situated at the northeastern border of the Taunus, it is surrounded by mixed coniferous forest, fields and meadows. It is located 2 km north of Usingen and 32 km north of Frankfurt am Main. In the north borders Michelbach, in the east Wernborn, in the south Usingen and in the west the Bundesstraße 456 with the direction to Grävenwiesbach and Weilburg. History Protestant Church The first documented mention was in 1280 as part of the County Cleeberg. Until the time of the Protestant Reformation, Eschbach belonged ecclesiastically and judicially to Grävenwiesbach. Through the Protestant Reformation it became setting of an own parish. In 1596 Eschbach became part of Nassau-Usingen. In 1933 the village had 907 inhabitants. Since the communal reform in Hesse that was empowered on 1 August 1972 Eschbach is a district of Usingen.Statistisches Bundesamt (Hrsg.): Historisches Gemeindeverzeichnis für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland.

They are situated some hundred meters above the northern edge of the village and have got a height up to 12 meters. The crag made of quartz is a visible part of an about 6 km long corridor that continues across the valley of the Usa River until the Wormstein in the city forest of Usingen. From a geological standpoint it is a dip fault that was formed through the internal buckling of the mountains. The tough quartz could resist on several places the erosion and appears today on many places in the Taunus, however rarely so spectacular like here. In the west of the cliffs on the other side of the Kreisstraße Usingen- Michelbach a bit hidden in the forest there is a „sister rock“, the Saienstein. In the south there existed earlier an Open-Air stage, whose remains are still visible. Even today there is a “Klippenkonzert” performed every year that is very popular in the local area.

The analyst tallies up certain types of translation errors in the document (misspellings, punctuation, etc.) and then uses SAE J2450 to come up with a final grade. The purpose of this metric was to create a consistent standard to judge the quality of translation of automotive service information. It does not matter what is the source or he target language. The metric can be applied to either human translation or machine translation.SAE J2450 Translation Quality Metric. (2001). Vehicle E/E System Diagnostic Standards Committee. History The SAE J2450 Translation Quality Metric was developed by Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).http://www.sae.org/about/ Its initial name was \\"J2450 Task Force on a Quality Metric for Language Translation of Service Information\\". The first version of SAE J2450 was Created by General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler; it was released in August, 2001 as a recommended practice. However, At the end of 2001, a European SAE-2450-Committee was founded to fix problems in and improve the original metric. Members of this committee came from the language staffs at Volvo Trucks, Daimler-Chrysler, Audi and Volkswagen and other European translation agencies. After negotiations between the American and European car makers, J2450 became an SAE-Norm in 2005. Description SAE J2450 bases quality scores on seven types of errors:, wrong term, syntactic error, omission, word structure or agreement error, misspelling, punctuation error and miscellaneous error. Errors in each category can be classified as either major or minor, with a numeric score attached to each error and severity level (ibid.). The composite score, which decides the translation quality of a text, is the weighted sum of the errors normalized by the number of words in the source text (ibid.). This simple statistical approach makes comparison of the quality figures of different texts easy, while examination of the errors in specific categories can assist in the identification of particular problem areas. Quality benchmark Since its publication, SAE J2450 Translation Quality Metric has become one of the most important measurements in judging the quality of translation in the automobile industry and has been adopted by many translation service providers and car manufacturers. SAE J2450 makes comparison of the quality figures of different texts easy; secondly, the examination of the errors in specific categories can assist in the identification of particular problem areas; finally, it helps to eliminate post-translation review processes, as already confirmed in the empirical study carried out by Don (2004).Mission Impossible: Improve Quality, Time and Speed at the Same Time.

He played a critical role in shaping the international humanitarian response to the Great Lakes Crisis at one of its most turbulent moments. He was responsible for providing clean water and sanitation to over a million people. On 18 August 2000, Comerford was found dead in his hotel room while on a mission, having been sent to the Congo ahead of 5,000 UN peacekeeping troops to assess structural damage caused by an occupying force of soldiers backed by neighbouring Rwanda. His report could have led to sanctions against Rwanda.  Early life and education  Comerford was born in Liverpool, the son of Bernard and Elizabeth Comerford. He grew up in Rossendale and later in Bury near Manchester with his two sisters Anne and Catherine and his brother Michael Comerford. He studied Engineering (M.A.) at the University of Cambridge, and later earned a second master in Irrigated Agriculture and Development from the University of Southampton and a certificate in development economics from the University of London. He completed his doctorate in disaster management at the University of Bristol before getting an MBA at INSEAD (Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires) in Fontainebleau. He was described by members of the 1993 MBA class at INSEAD as \\"someone who used his MBA to dedicate his life, which he ultimately sacrificed, to humanitarian service. He exemplified the best ideals of vision, leadership and courage inherent in an INSEAD education.\\" In 2010, Comerford was honoured in memoriam as one of \\"50 alumni who changed the world\\" at INSEAD's 50th anniversary celebration. At INSEAD he was on the founding committee of INDEVOR, INSEAD's student club which serves as a forum for those interested in social, environmental, and ethical issues. His leadership led to one of INSEAD's first course offerings in ethical development, \\"Business and Development in the Third World.\\"  Career  After graduating from INSEAD, Comerford worked with NGOs and UN organisations such as Oxfam, UNDP and UNHCR in hazardous regions, including Sudan, Liberia, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Rwanda and East Timor. Most of his assignments involved development, humanitarian assistance, disaster management and disaster risk reduction. During this time he raised three children with his wife, Deborah Verzuu.  Death and campaign against the UN  In August 2000, Comerford was sent to the Congo to assess damage to sanitation caused by an occupying force of soldiers backed by Rwanda. The country was being robbed of diamonds, cobalt and ivory by troops who controlled the Kisangani mining region. The Palm Beach hotel, where he checked in on 16 August, was also used by the rebel troops for processing their illegal money and diamonds. The UN did not ensure any protection even though the area was ranked a high security risk. On 18 August his body was found in his hotel room, suspended from the window bars by a belt. A Kenyan government pathologist concluded from broken bones in his neck that he must have been murdered, whereas a report commissioned by the UNDP under Mark Malloch Brown said it could also have been suicide. His family was denied a proper payment by the UN's insurers. As a consequence, Comerford's wife, Deborah, began an eight-year campaign for justice with help from former friend of Comerford and lawyer Andrew Granger of Taylor Wessing, who took the case pro bono. \\"Because UN immunity deprives staff of access to local courts, she had no option but to tackle the organisation's internal justice system.\\" The UN's administrative tribunal criticised the department responsible for its \\"reckless and callous\\" treatment of Joe's wife and made clear that the case was \\"seriously mishandled\\". The UN admitted as well, according to the independent Redesign Panel on the United Nations System of Administration of Justice, that the current internal justice system was \\"outmoded, dysfunctional, ineffective, and lacking independence\\". As a result of all this criticism, the General Assembly decided to introduce the new UN internal justice system.  Publications  * Comerford, J.B., Martin, J, Blockley, D.I., & Davis, J.P.

In 2018, analysis showed about 44% of Somalis in Denmark live in a parallel society. By December 2018, nearly 1000 Somalis in Denmark lost their residence permits after the Danish Immigration Service started a review of the permits in 2017. The permits were revoked as parts of Somalia are safe enough for refugees to return. Demographics (Statistics Denmark). Most Somalis in Denmark emigrated from Somalia following the start of the Somali Civil War (1986-), in the period between 1995 and 2000. According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2017, there are a total 21,204 persons of Somali origin living in Denmark. Of those individuals, 11,832 are Somalia-born immigrants and 9,372 are descendants of Somalia-born persons. 8,852 individuals are citizens of Somalia (4,730 men, 4,122 women). As of 2016, a total of 148 Somalia-born persons have been granted residence permits in Denmark for family reunification, 63 for asylum, and 6 for other reasons. Somali residents are generally young, with most belonging to the 15-19 years (2,818 individuals), 10-14 years (2,704 individuals), 5-9 years (2,210 individuals) and 20-24 years (2,075 individuals) age groups. Socioeconomics According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2016, among Somalia-born adults aged 30-59 in Denmark, around 66% of men and 79% of women live full-time in public housing units. This is because many arrived via family reunification or as refugees, and such immigrants usually settle in government-owned properties. Somalis primarily inhabit the regions of Hovedstaden (7,399), Midtjylland (6,471), Syddanmark (4,336), Nordjylland (1,576), and Sjælland (1,422), and the cities of Copenhagen (5,248), Aarhus (4,554), Odense (2,291), and Aalborg (1,289). =Crime= According to Statistics Denmark, Somali males are over-represented as perpetrators of crime. Somali male descendants were about 15 times more prevalent as perpetrators of violent crime. According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2016, Somalia-born male immigrants in Denmark aged 15-79 have a total crime index of 208 when adjusted for age. Their male descendants have a total crime index of 313 when adjusted for age. With regard to type of infringement, the male descendants of Somalia-born individuals have a penal code crime index of 611 when adjusted for age, of which the crime index when adjusted for age is 771 for violent offences and 602 for property offences. The crime index when adjusted for age is 162 for traffic law and 383 for special laws. The average crime index among the general Danish population is set at 100 and percentage points above or below that baseline reflect greater or lesser prevalence, depending on a population's most common age group and its relative socioeconomic status. As of 2016, a total of 1,179 persons of Somali origin were found guilty of crimes. Of these individuals, 1,033 were males and 146 were females, with males between the ages of 15-29 years (674 individuals) and 30-49 years (304 individuals) constituting most of the total. The most common types of offences were violations of special laws (554 individuals, of which 238 violated narcotics legislation), followed by violations of the penal code (499 individuals, of which 327 made offences against property) and traffic law (389 individuals, of which 341 breached the Road Traffic Act). Most of the persons received a fine (831 individuals), with the remainder given unsuspended imprisonment (185 individuals), suspended imprisonment (129 individuals), preventive measures (18 individuals), withdrawal of charges (10 individuals), no charges (5 individuals), or other decisions (1 individual). = Income = According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2015, Somalia-born immigrants in Denmark have an average retirement income of less than 125,000 Danish krone. As of 2016, male immigrants from Somalia aged 20-59 have an annual income of just under DKK 200,000 before taxation. Most of that income comprises earned income, with the remainder consisting of public transfers, investment income and second income. As of 2017, a total of 8,064 persons of Somali origin in Denmark received public benefits. Of these individuals, the government funds were primarily allocated toward social benefits (2,569 persons), the Danish State Education Grant and Loan Scheme Authority (2,450 persons), disability pension (1,085), net unemployment (809 persons), guidance and activities upgrading skills (585 persons), subsidized employment (325 persons), maternity benefits (146 persons), job-based sickness benefits (84 persons), persons receiving holiday benefits (10 persons), and early retirement pay (1 person). = Khat usage = According to a 2008 Danish Health Authority study on khat usage, among 848 surveyed Somali residents in Denmark aged 15-50, 67% of total respondents indicated that they did not chew khat, 48% of the men and 16% of the women reported having chewed khat within the previous month, with 29% of men and 6% of women reporting that they chewed khat two times or more per week. 50% of the respondents had never chewed khat, and 14% had formerly chewed khat but stopped. The plant has been a prohibited substance in Denmark since 1993. Virtually no 20 year-olds had chewed khat, indicating that khat prevalence was minimal among young Somalis. This indicated a shift in attitude in the younger generation since most khat users typically began to chew the plant between the ages of 20-24. Use of alcohol, cannabis and other substances was generally found to be uncommon among Somali residents, with very few individuals having tried them. Overall, the survey found that there was an intra-population trend among the Somali respondents to overestimate the number of khat chewers compared to the actual proportion, although khat chewing in Denmark primarily takes place within the Somali community. Education According to the Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research, in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Somali pupils constituted 6% of the student population in Denmark. They obtained PISA scores of 403 in mathematics (Matematik), 413 in reading (Læsning), 392 in science (Naturfag), and 382 in problem-solving (Problem-løsning). Of the most frequent countries of origin for students examined by the PISA, these were the lowest scores in all categories. As of the 2015 PISA, Somali pupils represent 8% of Denmark's ethnic minority student population. The PISA scores are now generally in the medium range of the most frequent countries of origin for students. Employment According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2014, Somalia-born immigrants aged 30-64 in Denmark have an employment rate of approximately 26.2%. Somalia-born individuals aged 16-64 also have a self-employment rate of around 3.3%. According to the Institute of Labor Economics, as of 2014, Somalia-born residents in Denmark have an employment population ratio of about 17%. They also have an unemployment rate of roughly 22%. \\\\- cf.

Early life Donald Mackay was the second eldest son of Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver, and his wife who was the daughter of Norman, son of Patrick O'Beolan of Carloway, Lewis. Donald's elder brother, John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, died in 1529 without legitimate male issue and therefore Donald was able to succeed him as chief of the Clan Mackay. Alliance with the Clan Forbes and Clan Campbell In around 1529 Donald Mackay of Strathnaver assisted the Master of Forbes (of Clan Forbes) and Sir John Campbell of Cawdor during a feud in which Alexander Seaton of Meldrum was killed. Historian Angus Mackay states that it is with interest that at this time the Mackays and Forbeses who claim to have sprung from the same kindred stock in the distant past, are found acting in concert. It was probably for the death of Seaton of Meldrum that Mackay obtained a pardon for himself and his Strathnaver clansmen dated 26 July 1536. In July 1537, the Master of Forbes and his sister-in-law, Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis, sister of Douglas, Earl of Angus, were both executed for conspiring against the king. Associated with Lady Glamis was one Alexander Makay who was sentenced to be banished from all parts of Scotland except for the county of Aberdeen. Sir John Campbell of Cawdor, brother of the Earl of Argyll, who had been associated with the Mackays and Forbeses in the killing of Seaton, also killed Maclean of Duart (chief of Clan Maclean) in bed in about 1529. Maclean had left his wife, Lady Elizabeth Campbell, exposed to certain death on a lonely sea-girt isle. The killing of Maclean resulted in a prolonged feud between the Macleans and the Campbells in which the Mackays of Kintyre suffered severely at the hands of the Macleans and it appears that the Mackays supported the Campbells during the feud. Meeting with James V of Scotland In May 1539, James V of Scotland, sailing from Leith around the north of Scotland, calling at Orkney and arriving on the Strathnaver coast, Donald Mackay of Strathnaver went on board to accompany the king on the rest of the voyage. The king also took other chiefs on board such as Roderick Macleod of the Lewes, Alexander Macleod of Dunvegan, John of Moidart, Alexander of Glengarry, Mackenzie of Kintail, Maclean of Duart and MacConnal of Isla. Some of these chiefs were received on board as enemies and imprisoned, while others as friends were rewarded. Donald Mackay was treated well by the king for on the 16 December 1539, after they arrived at Stirling, Mackay obtained a charter under the Great Seal of Scotland for his ancestral lands in heritage: Farr, Armadale, Straye, Rynewe, Kynnald, Golspie, Dirlot, Cattack, Broynach, Kilchalumkill in Strabroa, Davach Lochnaver, Davach Eriboll, the two pennylands of Stromay, the mill of Kinald, the island of Sanday extending to the three pennylands, the lands of Melness and Hope, with the mills, mill-lands, manors etc., formerly belonging to Y Mckay and his ancestors, the father of the said Donald, but in the king's hands by reason of nonentry, and now erected into the free barony of Farr, sasine to be taken at the principal messuage of Farr. Donald Mackay took sasine by procurators of the lands at the castle of Farr, which was located between Farr and Swordly, on 16 April 1540. Donald Mackay appears to have remained at court for at least twelve months as on 26 November 1540 he witnessed a charter of lands in Monteith of Perth to Anthony Balfour of Torre Estir. While at court, Donald Mackay also received a charter from Andrew Stuart, Bishop of Caithness for the church-lands in Durness, Strathnaver to himself and his heirs after him. Feud with Sutherland of Duffus Due to the part Donald Mackay had played with Forbes against the Seatons, Sutherland of Duffus consequently secured the nonentry of Mackay's lands in 1530 in an evident attempt to get possession of Mackay's lands of Strathnaver, similar to that that had been done by Sutherland of Dirlot at an earlier period. Some differences arose between Donald Mackay and Sutherland of Duffus over the lands of Kerrownashein, near Lochnaver, which Duffus claimed to hold from the church of Moray in virtue of a grant from Reginald Cheyne, and also as to the nonentry dues of Mackay's estate since 1530. In 1542 the matter was submitted to the arbitration of James Stewart, Earl of Moray. The Earl of Moray decided that Sutherland of Duffus should alienate to Donald Mackay and his heirs the lands which he had held from the church of Moray. Battle of Solway Moss Towards the end of 1542, the king of Scotland resolved upon a war with England. Donald Mackay of Strathnaver and his son Iye Du Mackay were summoned to muster at Lauder along with their clansmen. The disorderly Scottish army that set out for England under Oliver Sinclair was completely routed at the Battle of Solway Moss. Donald Mackay returned to Edinburgh with the king, but his son Iye Du Mackay was taken prisoner. The king died soon afterwards leaving an only child, Mary, Queen of Scots. At the instigation of the English king, Iye Du Mackay and some of the other Scottish prisoners promoted a scheme in which the infant Mary, Queen of Scots would be married to the king of England's son, the Prince of Wales. Battle of Alltan-Beath According to 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, who was a son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, in 1542, Donald Mackay of Strathnaver invaded Sutherland with a company of men and burnt the village of Knockartel and took goods from Strathbrory in Sutherland. The book Conflicts of the Clans describes the Battle of Alltan-Beath in which the Mackays were subsequently defeated by the Gordons of Sutherland,Foulis Press. (1764).The History of the Feuds and Conflicts Among the Clans in the Northern Parts of Scotland and in the Western Isles: from the year M.XX1 unto M.B.C.XIX, now first published from a manuscript wrote in the reign of King James VI.\\" The only changes made is the modernising of the orthography to 1890 standards:-- . electricscotland.com. Retrieved on January 05, 2013. although this battle is not specifically mentioned by either the Mackay historians or Sir Robert Gordon. According to Sir Robert Gordon, Donald Mackay was ultimately brought to the Gordon Earls of Huntly and Sutherland and upon his submission was, at their command, imprisoned in Foulis Castle. However, this version of events is disputed by historian Angus Mackay. Historian Angus Mackay explains that Robert Stuart, Bishop of Caithness, supporting the scheme of the English king for his son to marry the infant Mary, Queen of Scots as mentioned above, departed for England to join his brother the Earl of Lennox, and that the bishop made some arrangements with his relatives, including Mackay, for the protection of his castles and church-lands. As such Donald Mackay advanced into Sutherland and placed a party of his clansman in the bishop's Skibo Castle under the command of Neil Mackay of the Mackay of Aberach branch of the clan. On 28 April 1549, the bishop brought together at Castle Sinclair Girnigoe, all on equal terms, the Earls of Sutherland, Caithness and Donald Mackay, and they entered into a bond of friendship. Historian Angus Mackay states that this is an honest account of what had happened based on documents found at Dunrobin Castle and that Sir Robert Gordon has described it with his \\"usual untruthfulness\\". Feud with the Rosses It is evident that the Mackays once more raided the Rosses of Balnagown as a record dated 28 June 1550 shows that Donald Mackay and other relatives were charged with the \\"cruel slaughter of Alexander MacAne Ross\\" and other relatives, and that Alexander Ross of Balnagown was \\"amerciated\\" for not reporting and delivering to the clerks of justicary the letters which had been purchased by the wives, children, parents, and friends of the deceased duly \\"executed and endorsed\\".Mackay, Angus.

The current house was built in the late 17th century and remodelled for Edward Younge, a friend of Lord Pembroke, in around 1720–1740. History The manor of Little Durnford was mentioned in an inquisition at Amesbury on 6 October 1470, which found that a John Wodhull, the great nephew of the owner at the time, was the heir to the manor and Tytherley. The current house was built in the late 17th century and remodelled for Edward Younge, a friend of Lord Pembroke, in around 1720–1740. The house was designated as Grade I listed in 1953. Little Durnford Manor has been the seat of John Pelham, 9th Earl of Chichester since he purchased it in 1966; the family's previous seat, Stanmer House in East Sussex, was sold by trustees for the earl when he was three years old. Architecture A drive approaches the main house from the southeast, which is separated from a landscaped park by a strip of trees. The house has two storeys faced with flint and stone chequerwork, with five bays under a slate roof, and central glazed doors set within a modest Tuscan portico. It has a dining room described by Pevsner as \\"a splendid mid C18 room with a proud chimmneypiece and wall panels of tapestry framed in plaster\\". The doors feature pulvinated frieze and pediments, and the walls inside the house feature entitled plaster cornice with frieze, and baroque plasterwork, dating to the late 1740s. The main staircase is at the end of the hall and features turned balusters. The service wing was heightened in the early 20th century. View across to the pond in the grounds of the manor Grounds A walled cottage garden of approximately half a hectare lies to the north of the house, and is divided into several sub-plots, each with their own identity. The grounds also contain a lake, a swimming pool, and a cluster of cedar trees.

Career Eaton was educated at Berkhamsted School and later studied at the University of Warwick between 2005 and 2008, graduating with a first class degree in History and Politics. After working for PoliticsHome, he was recruited to the New Statesman in 2009 by editor Jason Cowley as a staff writer and later edited the magazine's political blog The Staggers, which was named online comment site of the year at the 2013 Comment Awards. He was political editor of the New Statesman from 2014 to 2018, joint deputy editor from 2018 to 2019. After his controversial Roger Scruton article, he moved to the position of assistant editor. Since February 2020 he has worked as Senior Online Editor. He has also written for The Times, The Sunday Times and The Evening Standard. Eaton has featured in debating panels on various news stations such as BBC News, Sky News and RT, discussing issues including health tourism and Scottish independence. In February 2015, he sat on a panel hosted by the PR company Fishburn at the Royal Society of Arts on the 2015 general election. In April 2019, Eaton published an article in the New Statesman based on an interview he had had with conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, in which he claimed Scruton had made a number of racist remarks. He quoted Scruton as describing the \\"invasion of huge tribes of Muslims from the Middle East\\", and how \\"each Chinese person is a kind of replica of the next one\\". The article led to Scruton being removed as a government adviser. In response, Eaton posted a photograph to his public Instagram account showing him drinking from a bottle of champagne with the caption, \\"The feeling when you get right- wing racist and homophobe Roger Scruton sacked\\". Various figures criticised Eaton claiming he had mischaracterised Scruton's comments. Eaton apologised for the Instagram post, but defended the interview. He was demoted several months later. The New Statesman later apologised to Scruton, saying that partial quotations used to promote the article did not accurately represent his views. In July 2019 Scruton was reappointed to the government commission.

Biography John Callion was born on 14 September 1946 in Workington, Cumbria. He developed an interest in birds while still at school, and has devoted over 50 years to the study of birds, in particular the European stonechat, the Eurasian dotterel, the whinchat and the wood warbler. Callion has been an active member of the British Trust for Ornithology since 1973 and was formerly its representative in Cumbria. He was a founder member of the Cumbria Bird Club, the Cumbria ornithological society, which was established in 1989 and he was elected its first chairman. He has written numerous papers on birds and bird-life. He is the co-author of The Breeding Birds of Cumbria - A Tetrad Atlas 1997-2001.

He carried out his research at close quarters in the field in his native Cumbria, and in France and Spain. His study has gained him recognition as an authority on the European stonechat. In an article in The Times entitled Stonechats' secrets revealed, the British naturalist, author and former Man Booker Prize judge Derwent May hailed Callion's findings and revelations as 'splendid contributions to knowledge', and said: > \\"He has found 1,300 nests and put coloured rings on the legs of numerous > nestlings to follow the story of their lives... > Callion describes, as never before, the light-hearted way in which the > female takes her incubation duties at first, coming off the eggs every hour > and stopping to preen casually, before going back.

They were joined in the play-offs by the teams that had finished fourth and sixth in the Second Division: Crystal Palace defeated Swindon Town in their play-off semi-final, while Blackburn Rovers defeated Watford in the other semi. Blackburn Rovers won the first leg 3–1. After 90 minutes of the return leg Crystal Palace were winning 2–0, this forced the game to go to extra time where a further goal from Palace meant they won 4–3 on aggregate and were promoted to the top division of the English football league system after an eight-year absence.

Route to the final The teams who finished first and second in the 1988–89 Football League Second Division were promoted automatically and the teams from third to sixth entered the play-offs to determine the third promoted team. Blackburn Rovers finished fifth in the league and were drawn to play fourth- placed Watford. The first leg was at Ewood Park and ended in a scoreless draw. In the return leg at Vicarage Road Neil Redfearn scored for the hosts and Simon Garner for the visitors. A 1–1 draw was enough for Blackburn to progress to the final on the away goals rule. Crystal Palace finished the season in third-place, one point off automatic promotion, and were drawn to play sixth- placed Swindon Town. The first leg at Swindon's County Ground saw the hosts take a 1–0 lead into the second leg thanks to an own goal from Palace defender Jeff Hopkins.

Background The impetus for the creation of a dedicated maternity hospital was dissatisfaction on the part of the governors of the Middlesex Hospital with its maternity facilities. A new hospital with 20 beds was established in 1749 in Brownlow Street, Long Acre, Holborn, under the presidency of the 2nd Duke of Portland, and initially called the Lying-In Hospital for Married Women. (\\"Lying-in\\" is an archaic term for childbirth, referring to the long bedrest prescribed for new mothers in their postpartum confinement.) Consequent on the establishment of the City of London Lying-In Hospital for Married Women in 1750, and the General Lying-In Hospital (later renamed the Queen Charlotte's Hospital) in 1752, the Holborn hospital changed its name to the British Lying-In Hospital for Married Women in 1856. Early years The hospital was funded by voluntary subscriptions and donations. At the outset, the hospital provided only for in-patients, but by 1828 extended to an out-patient service, supervising home deliveries. In the 1870s, it was treating about 750 in-patients per annum. The creation of the hospital was not without controversy at the time, and the nature, characteristics and effects of the British in particular, and maternity hospitals in general, continue to be a subject of study. Prior to the hospital's creation, childbirth was for the most-part a domestic affair relying on the good offices of largely untrained (if well-experienced) midwives (traditional birth attendant); only the rich were served by male physicians. The British Lying-In Hospital offered — to married women only — a largely female-only space removed from the home in which childbirth was supervised almost exclusively by female midwives under the supervision of female matrons. The intervention of male physicians was a rare event. The hospital was attacked within the first two years of operation by Frank Nicholls, a prominent physician who issued, anonymously, a satirical essay, the Petition of the Unborn Babes, which raised a number of concerns questioning the involvement of (allegedly brutal) men-midwives, and asserting high mother and baby mortality rates. Nicholls's publication can be seen to set the tone for much of the subsequent discussion of maternity hospitals to this day. A Vindication of Man Midwifery (1752) attempted a positive spin, but the debate about Man Midwifery and the use of forceps raged for at least the next century. Victorian era It moved to a new purpose-built building with 40 beds in Endell Street, in 1849. The gender separation of roles at the British was called into question from 1862 when the then physician-in- residence, James Edmunds, established with other the Female Medical Society, and in 1864 when the Ladies' Medical College was established to train women in midwifery and obstetrics. From 1867, its students gained clinical experience at the British - albeit the nature of Edmunds's innovation led to disputes amongst the governing board and unsuccessful effort to unseat him. A note in Old and New London: Volume 3 states that the hospital had by 1874 treated 47,000 in-patients. Merger and re-invention The British Lying-In Hospital closed in May 1913 in anticipation of its amalgamation with the Home for Mothers and Babies and Training School for District Midwives in January 1915. The newly amalgamated establishment was called the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies. The National Archives hold records of births and baptisms at the hospital in the period 1749-1868, and the London Metropolitan Archives holds a wealth of organisational records.

Nolan, Karl Marx: The Materialist Messiah, p.28 In 1869, Mottershead was elected to the General Council of the International Workingmen's Association, on which he was long known as an ally of Karl Marx, and acted as its corresponding secretary for Denmark. However, he fell out with Marx, in particular due to his refusal to consider Irish independence, and lost influence in the association after attending the 1872 Hague Congress while drunk.Jonathan Sperber, Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century LifeKenneth Lapides, Marx and Engels on Trade Unions, p.208 Mottershead was also a prominent trade unionist, and served on the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress in 1874/5, representing Preston Trades Council. He lost his seat the following year after coming behind Thomas Birtwistle in the voting.George Howell, Labour Legislation, Labour Movements, and Labour Leaders, p.360 At the 1874 UK general election, Mottershead stood as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Preston. A meeting of 5,000 workers at Preston Corn Exchange, chaired by Alfred Bailey, resolved to support his candidature. At that meeting, Mottershead stated that he was \\"determined to create a third party\\" representing labour.\\"The Labour candidate at Preston\\", Manchester Guardian, 31 January 1874 He ran against two Conservatives; they were both elected, taking 6,512 and 5,211 votes, while Mottershead came last with 3,756.\\"The forthcoming election at Preston\\", Manchester Guardian, 20 April 1874 When a by-election arose later in the year, Mottershead was again proposed as a candidate, although ultimately the election was unopposed. In the late 1870s, Mottershead was a member of the executive of the Labour Representation League, using this position to campaign against war with Russia. He also sat on the executive of the London Trades Council. In 1883, he attended a conference in support of the Tichborne Claimant. He stated that, although he did not support the claimant's case, he felt that they had suffered enough.Rohan McWilliam, The Tichborne Claimant, p.179 Mottershead died in 1884, after suffering a fit while crossing Westminster Bridge.

It is being studied as a high production volume chemical in the \\"High Production Volume (HPV) Chemical Challenge Program\\" of the US Environmental Protection Ministry EPA.Assessment Plan for Ethanesulfonic Acid, 2-Hydroxy-, Monosodium Salt (Sodium Isethionate, CAS #1562-00-1) in Accordance with the US EPA High Production Volume Chemical Challenge Program (PDF; 292 kB). Production Sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate is formed by the reaction of ethylene oxide with sodium hydrogen sulfite in aqueous solution: :Sodium isethionate EO To avoid contamination and suppress the formation of by- products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH. The reaction has to take place under the exclusion of oxygen and under precise control of the stoichiometry of the reactants, the temperature, the pH and the throughput. Properties Solid sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate is a colorless, free-flowing, non-hygroscopic solid, which dissolves readily in water and has good biodegradability. Due to the method of synthesis samples often contain traces of sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen sulfite causing aqueous solution to possesses a mildly alkaline pH of about 10.Datenblatt der Oriental Union Chemical Co., Sodium Isethionate – An Eco-friendly Surfactant for Industrial Applications, (PDF; 90 kB), abgerufen am 17. August 2012. Use The main use of sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate is the production of the isethionate class of surfactants. These are readily foaming and particularly mild, making them suitable for cleaning sensitive skin and are therefore mainly used in baby soaps and shampoos.Kosmetik und Hygiene, herausgegeben von W. Umbach, 3. vollständig überarbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, Verlag Wiley-VCH, 2004, . Because of its pronounced skin compatibility sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate is added to soaps and liquid skin cleansers with up to 15 parts by weight. From sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate the so-called biological buffers such as HEPES, MES, PIPES etc. are easily accessible. The addition of 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate to electroplating baths allows higher current densities and lower concentrations than the much more expensive methane sulphonic acid with improved appearance.

He is best known for his performances as a two-year-old in 2002 when he won five of his seven races including the Shergar Cup Juvenile, Tattersalls Breeders Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes, as well as finishing second in the Two-Year-Old Trophy. In the following year he failed to win in six races but finished fourth in the 2000 Guineas and third in the Irish 2000 Guineas. In 2004 he recorded his first victory in eighteen months when he won the Leicestershire Stakes but was well beaten in his remaining races and was retired at the end of the year. Background Tout Seul is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by G. Johnston King. As a foal he was offered for sale at Goffs in November 2000 and was bought for IR£6,800 by the bloodstock agent Sheena Collins. As a yearling in September 2001 at Tattersalls Tout Seul was again put up for auction and was bought for 12,500 guineas by the trainer Fulke Johnson Houghton. The colt entered the ownership of the Eden Racing syndicate and was trained throughout his racing career by Johnson Houghton at Woodway stable at Blewbury in Berkshire. He was ridden in most of his races by Steve Carson. Tout Seul was probably the best horse sired by Ali-Royal, a consistent, top-class miler who won the Sussex Stakes as a four-year-old in 1997. Tout Seul's dam Total Aloof won two minor races as a three-year-old in 1996. and was a granddaughter of the Yorkshire Oaks winner Condessa. The Racing Post's breeding correspondent Tony Morris wrote that the colt was \\"unfashionably bred\\" and that Tout Seul was \\"better than he could have been predicted to be, based on our knowledge of his immediate antecedents\\". Racing career =2002: two-year-old season= Tout Seul began his racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Chepstow Racecourse on 6 June. Starting a 14/1 outsider in a ten-runner field he took the lead in the final furlong and drew away to in by three lengths from Graduation Day. Eight days later, in a novice race (for horses with no more than one previous win) over the same course and distance he started 5/2 favourite and won by a length from the filly Elidore, to whom he was conceding nine pounds in weight. The colt then ran on 27 June at Salisbury Racecourse in an auction race (a contest in which the weights carried by the horses are determined by the median price of their sire's offspring at auction) and finished second of the seven runners behind Cosmo. In the Shergar Cup, an international jockeys' challenge series run at Ascot Racecourse Tout Seul started 9/2 favourite for the Juvenile race which was run under auction race rules. Ridden by Kieren Fallon he was restrained at the rear of the field before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two and a half lengths. Tout Seul was then sent to Ireland for the Tattersalls Breeders Stakes (a race restricted to two-years-olds sold at Tattersalls) over six furlongs at the Curragh on 24 August. With Carson back in the saddle he started 3/1 favourite in a 25-runner field and won by one and a half lengths from Cosmo after taking the lead a furlong out. Tout Seul was moved up to Listed class for the Two-Year-Old Trophy over six furlongs at Redcar Racecourse on 5 October and started second favourite behind Monsieur Bond in an eighteen runner field. After racing down the centre of the track he was switched right by Carson and began to make progress in the last quarter mile but failed by a head to overhaul Somnus. Two weeks later the colt was stepped up to Group for Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes over seve furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. The Roger Charlton-trained Trade Fair started favourite despite his only win having come in a maiden, whilst Tout Seul was a 25/1 outsider. The other fourteen runners included Tomahawk (runner-up in the Middle Park Stakes), Al Jadeed (Royal Lodge Stakes), Rimrod (Stardom Stakes), Zafeen, Indian Haven, Dublin (Vintage Stakes), Governor Brown (Somerville Tattersall Stakes), Mario Marini (Marble Hill Stakes), Ontario (Anglesey Stakes) and Saturn (Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes). Carson restrained the colt in the early stages before making ground along the stands-side rail in the last quarter mile. He took the lead 50 yards from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Tomahawk with Trade Fair taking third ahead of Zafeen and Saturn. Fulke Johnson Houghton, who had last won the race with Ribofilio in 1968 said \\"It's a long time since then, isn't it? But didn't this fellow do it well? He's never been a flashy worker at home, so it's been difficult to know just how good he is, but he's always had a lovely turn of foot. Isn't he just a grand little horse?\\" Steve Carson, who was winning his first Group One race said \\"It's definitely the best feeling! It all went pretty smoothly for me. I jumped him out and got him a lead but I was a bit further back than I wanted to be. Two furlongs out I was struggling but he picked up and quickened past them and I just put him on the rail because he runs about a bit in front. He's the best I've ever sat on.\\" =2003: three-year-old season= On his three- year-old debut, Tout Seul started at odds of 7/1 for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile on 3 May. He briefly took the lead inside the last furlong but was overtaken in the final strides and finished fourth behind Refuse To Bend, Zafeen and Norse Dancer. In the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later he kept on in the last quarter mile without ever looking likely to win and finished third behind Indian Haven. In the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June he made no impact and finished seventh behind Zafeen. Tout Seul embarked on an international campaign in the autumn of 2003 but had little success. He finished sixth behind Special Kaldoun in the Prix Daniel Wildenstein at Longchamp Racecourse before being sent to Japan where he was unplaced behind Durandal in the Mile Championship. He ended his season in the Listed Capital Stakes over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 30 November and came home fifth of the twelve runners behind Siberian Hawk. He was ridden by Fallon in both of his Japanese races. =2004: four-year-old season= Tout Seul began his third campaign in the Listed Leicestershire Stakes over seven furlongs at Leicester Racecourse on 24 April. He started the 7/2 second favourite behind the Park Stakes winner Polar Ben, whilst the other nine runners included Makhlab (Horris Hill Stakes) and the veteran sprinter Bahamian Pirate. After tracking the leaders, Carson produced Tout Seul with a strong late run to take the lead inside the final furlong and win by one and three quarter lengths from Polar Ben. Tout Seul failed to show his best form in six subsequent races. He finished last in both the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury in May and the John of Gaunt Stakes at Haydock Park in June. He ran sixth behind Trade Fair in the Minstrel Stakes at the Curragh in July and tenth behind Norse Dancer in the Sovereign Stakes at Salisbury in August. In October at Newmarket he finished fourth in both the Joel Stakes (behind Polar Ben) and the Ben Marshall Stakes. Assessment In the ratings for British two-year-olds of 2002 Tout Seaul was rated second behind Oasis Dream. Stud record Tout Seul was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Tenuta della Calandrina near Rome in a deal arranged by McKeever St Lawrence and Federico Barberini.

History News After Noon launched on 7 September 1981 and replaced a much shorter lunchtime news bulletin called The Midday News. It was initially billed as \\"the first television news of the day\\"A clip of the opening of the first edition of News After Noon as when the programme started breakfast television had not launched in the UK. News After Noon was replaced by a new lunchtime news programme The One O'Clock News when the BBC launched its daytime television service and the final edition of News After Noon was broadcast on 24 October 1986.A clip of the start and end of the final edition of News After Noon Format News After Noon was the first BBC television news bulletin to last for a full 30 minutes – the Nine O'Clock News was 25 minutes in length. After 25 minutes of news there was a weather forecast, after which the regions left the programme for their lunchtime regional news bulletin. However, at this time BBC South East did not broadcast regional news bulletins so the final three minutes of News After Noon, which consisted of a financial report and a recap of the news headlines with in-vision subtitles, was only seen in London and the south east. This continued until BBC South East launched a regional news bulletin on 2 September 1985, after which News After Noon lasted for 25 minutes and the weather forecast followed the regional news bulletins. Presenters Throughout its five years on air the programme had a two-person presentation team. Richard Whitmore normally presented the programme alongside either Moira Stuart or Frances Coverdale, although the latter became the main co-presenter towards the end of the programme's run. Both Richard and Moira continued as daytime newsreaders after the demise of News After Noon as they shared presentational duties of the hourly BBC News Summaries that formed the backbone of the new daytime schedule. Other presenters included Laurie Mayer, Chris Lowe, Fern Britton, Sue Carpenter, Anne Diamond and Jane Franchi. Broadcast times News After Noon was broadcast in two time slots. Between September and May the programme ran from 12.30pm until 1pm. However Pebble Mill at One did not broadcast during the summer; when it was not on the air News After Noon was shown between 1pm and 1.30pm. Also during the summer months shorter editions of News After Noon (sometimes with one presenter instead of two) were broadcast when the BBC was showing live cricket coverage. This was to ensure that viewers did not miss the end of the morning's play and the start of the afternoon's play. On these days News After Noon would last for 20 minutes instead of the usual 30 minutes.BBC Genome Project home page References 1981 British television series debuts 1986 British television series endings BBC television news shows British television news shows BBC News ","title":"News After Noon"},{"id":"51511054","text":"Víctor Castro may refer to: * Víctor Castro (landowner) (1820–1900), landowner in California * Víctor Castro (weightlifter) (born 1992), Spanish weightlifter * Víctor Castro (weightlifter, born 1977), Peruvian weightlifter * Victor Hugo Castro (born 1975), boxer from Argentina * Víctor Manuel Castro (1924–2011), Mexican actor, screenwriter and film director ","title":"Víctor Castro"},{"id":"51511062","text":"New Albany and Salem Railroad Station, also known as the Louisville and Nashville (Monon) Railroad Station, was a historic train station located at Gosport, Owen County, Indiana.

It was one of the first areas to be settled in the town, and includes seven agricultural properties, with six farmhouses built before 1835 and a number of surviving 19th-century farm outbuildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Newbury is a rural community located on the upper reaches of the Connecticut River in central eastern Vermont. It was, along with neighboring Haverhill, New Hampshire, one of the first colonial settlements above Charlestown, New Hampshire, with early settlement beginning in the 1760s. The Newbury side had particularly rich agricultural land in an area known locally as the Great Oxbow, created by a large bend in the river. The northern end of the oxbow became a nexus of agricultural settlement. This area was joined to other river settlements by a road (now US 5). One of the houses still standing in the area was built in 1775 by Thomas Johnson, one of the early settlers. with US 5 follows a roughly north-south route in the area, and thus bypasses the large curve of the river oxbow. The historic district covers roughly the northern half of US 5 between its closest approaches to the northern and southern ends of the bend. The area includes seven properties originally developed as farmsteads, six of which were built before 1835. These are all relatively modest examples of Federal and Greek Revival architecture, except the Johnson- Bailey House, which is one of Newbury's few surviving examples of Georgian architecture. The seventh house, is a vernacular house built about 1870. Most of the surviving farm outbuildings (barns and sheds) date to the second half of the 19th century, while there are also a few 20th-century garages.

It was produced in France and Benin and was intended to comment on the situation of African refugees in Europe. Plot In the year 2033, the United States of Africa is a thriving and affluent country located in Africa. At the same time, Europe struggles with economic and political crisis, poverty and underdevelopment. Olivier (Stéphane Roux) is a computer scientist who lives in France with Pauline (Charlotte Vermeil), a teacher. Both are unemployed with few prospects given Europe's dire economy. The desperate couple decide to immigrate to Africa in hope of finding a better life, even knowing they will face anti-European discrimination in Africa. On arrival in Africa, Olivier and Pauline's entrance visa is rejected. The couple then try to illegally cross the border hidden in a smuggler vehicle, but are stopped by border police and detained until they can be deported back to France. Olivier manages to escape, and is taken in by a group of poor white Africans who live in housing projects. He eventually steals the identity of a dead white man so he will have employment documentation. Meanwhile, Pauline gets a job as a domestic servant to Modibo Koudossou (Sylvestre Amoussou), a politician who is sponsoring a controversial immigration reform bill to address the flood of economic refugees from Europe. Against a backdrop of political intrigue that includes an assassination attempt by corrupt political opponents, Pauline and Modibo grow increasingly attracted to one another.

It consists of about 70 buildings with about 90 residents. These buildings make up the village of Bschlabs itself and the hamlets Aschlen, Sack, Windegg, Mitteregg, Taschach, Egg and Zwieslen. The village is the municipal seat of Pfafflar. Bschlabs is located on the southern slope of the Namloser Wetterspitze with an elevation of in the valley opposite of the Spitzkopf (. Bschlabs' population is decreasing along with Pfafflar as a whole.  History  Engadine religious refugees settled in the Pfafflar valley. Pfafflar was mentioned for the first time in 1300 AD as “Pavelaers”, which is based on the Latin term “pabularium” (alpine pasture, pasture ground) or “pabulariu” (feeding stable).  Geography  The settled area is composed of the three widely spaced districts or localities of Bschlabs, Boden and Pfafflar in the Bschlabertal valley, a side valley of the Lechtal valley. Up to the 20th century the parish estate was also a tavern called “Zur Gemütlichkeit”.  Names  In 1284, the village was called Bislafes. This was later changed to Pislaves and was modified to Piselaves, Pshlavess or Pischlaabz. The name derives from pos & l'aves (\\"behind the waters\\"), likely due to the confluence of Streimbach and its tributaries. The three hay barns on the emblem of the municipality represent both the name of the municipality and the three villages that make up the municipality: Bschlabs, Boden, and Pfafflar.  Churches  = Sanctuary Maria Snow = Kaplaneikirche Our Lady Mary of the Snows, cemetery chapel and Warrior Chapel () The church was built in 1639 as a chapel and consecrated in 1648 by the auxiliary bishop of Brixen.

In 1670 the first chaplain, Nicholas Kranebitter settled in this valley. He was priest for 40 years and was buried beneath the altar. The records of the oldest Taufbuches in the parish, start with the 31 October 1670. The church was enlarged at the beginning of the 18th century. The tower was built from 1770 to 1780, with an octagonal floor and onion dome. In 1857 they built a sacristy. Two years later the high altar was built. In the middle. Instead of a painting, the figure of Madonna and Child was used. In addition to the double row of columns, the figures of the apostles, left Paul, right Peter and two other saints (all by Josef Georg Witwer 1775). Statuettes filled round niches, including figures of Barbara and Ignatius, John Nepomuk and Katharina (from Josef Anton). In 1884 the left side altar added a guardian angel painting, while the right side altar painting was of St. Joseph with Jesus on both sides with putti (widower Werkstätte). The mid-19th century pulpit showed a Jesus and Mary monogram, symbols of divine virtues, Holy Eucharist and law panels with sword and palm. The cross above the sacristy entrance is from Balthasar Jais from Imst (1740). In the glass display cases: on the left was Madonna clothed with Child, 18th century; on the right was Lady with blue star mantle. The stained glass of the top and bottom semicircular closed church windows from the Tyrolean Stained Glass Innsbruck (1919) represent the Annunciation, Visitation and Nativity.

The stupas were originally constructed during the Western Xia, but have been renovated and rebuilt several times over the centuries. Description Entrance to the 108 Stupas tourist site The location of the 108 stupas has been turned into a major tourist site, and a large area of land between the stupas and the Yellow River has been paved over and landscaped with ponds. A number of buildings have been erected on the site, including a tourist reception centre and an exhibition hall. The exhibition hall describes the history of the stupas, and shows photographs of what they looked like when they were investigated and renovated during the 1980s. The 108 stupas are arrayed in a triangular formation up the side of a hill, facing southeast, overlooking the Yellow River. There is one large stupa at the apex of the triangle, with a Buddhist hall behind it, and below that are eleven rows of one hundred and seven smaller stupas on brick platforms of increasing width running down the hill. The number of stupas on each level is: 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19. The reason why there are a 108 stupas is that the number 108 is a sacred number in Buddhism, for example Buddhist rosary beads number 108. Odd numbers are also considered auspicious in Buddhism (so pagodas always have an odd number of storeys), which is why the number of stupas on each row is an odd number. ratha-shaped base The first row of nineteen stupas starts slightly up the hillside, so the bottom platform is high. The width of the bottom platform is , and the height from the bottom platform to the top platform with the large stupa is . The stupas have undergone intensive renovation in recent years, and they do not represent their original Western Xia form, although they are in the original position and formation. In 1987 the small stupas were in height, with a diameter of , but after renovation and the addition of a canopy and finial they are now somewhat taller. The stupas are all made of brick, with several different designs. The bottom row (19 stupas) and the large stupa at the top have a zigzag ratha-shaped base, whereas the remaining 88 stupas all have an octagonal base. Rows 1 and 12 (20 stupas), rows 2–6 (23 stupas), row 7 (9 stupas), and rows 8–11 (56 stupas) each have slightly different shapes of hemispherical domed stupa body. Whole bricks are used for the stupa base, and half-bricks are used for the body of the stupa. The original stupa canopies and finials had all been lost by the time the stupas were restored in 1987, but as part of the restoration each stupa is now capped by a lead canopy of several designs (round or octagonal, with one or two balls on the finial). In 1987 the large stupa was high, with a diameter of , but after renovation it is now somewhat taller. Unlike the small stupas, which are all solid, the large stupa has a small opening on the east side, with a small room in the centre. This is currently occupied by a Buddhist statue and an offering box. History Fragment of the Tangut version of the Thousand Names of the Buddha of the Present (現在賢劫千佛名經) [N11·003], found in 1987–1988 The 108 stupas are believed to have been originally constructed during the period of the Western Xia kingdom (1038–1227), as part of a Buddhist temple complex. The remains of a temple and two small stupas were originally located in front of the 108 stupas, but due to the construction of a dam nearby (which for some years caused the area in front of the stupas to be flooded), in 1958 the two stupas were demolished. Two Western Xia period silk Buddhist paintings were found inside the two stupas, and fragments of Tangut Buddhist texts, miniature terracota stupa models, and clay tsha-tsha (small tablets made of stamped clay) were also found in the vicinity of the temple. Further evidence that the temple complex dates back to the Western Xia comes from an octagonal brick platform (on which a stupa would originally have stood) which is located on the hillside just north of the 108 stupas. In 1987 fragments of Buddhist sutras written in the Tangut script were discovered in this platform, together with about a dozen clay stupa models. Artefacts discovered during the renovation of the 108 stupas included four painted clay Buddhist statues and over a hundred plain and painted clay stupa models (between 5 and 12.5 cm in height) from the large stupa, seven tsha-tsha from two of the small stupas (nos. 17 and 85), a painted clay Buddhist statue from stupa no. 41, and three pottery stupa finials (between 13 and 17.5 cm in height) from stupa no. 101. During renovation in 1987 it was possible to reconstruct the architectural history of the stupas. The original stupas were made of sun-dried mud bricks surrounding a central wooden supporting pillar. The mud core was coated in white plaster, with lotus flower designs or Sanskrit text painted in red around the base. Later the stupa bases were strengthened, and additional mud was applied to reinforce the stupa body. The stupas were replastered twice during the Yuan and Ming dynasties. During the early Qing dynasty the stupas underwent a major renovation, and the dilapidated mud stupas were encased in brick to protect them. The brick casing was thinly coated with white plaster several times up to the 1980s. By 1987, most of the stupas were in a very poor state of repair, with missing brickwork exposing the mud and plaster core. None of the stupas preserved the top part, and in some cases only the stupa base remained. During 1987–1988 the outer brickwork of the stupas (dating to the early Qing dynasty) was repaired and rebuilt using the few relatively complete stupas as models. The white plaster that still covered the brickwork of most of stupas at that time was removed, and the stupas assumed their current form.

The church was built in the early 12th century and then rebuilt around 1220, and is today a grade II* listed building. History The original nave was built in the 12th century and was rebuilt in 1220, after which the church was altered little until Victorian times. The present vestry, organ bay, and the south porch were all added during restoration work in 1857. The church was hit by a German V-1 flying bomb during the Second World War on 3 August 1944 and restored by Frederick Etchells in 1950. Architecture The church is built predominantly from Bargate rubble, with ashlar dressings and a tiled roof. The porch has a slab roof and the bell tower and spire are covered by wood shingles. The structure consists of a nave, supported by buttressing, and chancel, with the chapel in the chancel at the north end; the vestry, organ bay, and porch to the south; and the bellcote to the west. The north and south sides of the nave contain lancet windows with round arches and the east a larger 15th-century stained-glass window. Other windows date from the 13th to the 19th centuries. The font dates from the 20th century. Features Among the significant memorials in the church are a monument, built in 1910 by Albert Toft and dedicated to Alistair Mackenzie, and an art nouveau-style wall tablet. Outside are the village stocks and Abinger Common War Memorial, with which the church forms a group of listed buildings. The war memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who also designed the nearby house Goddards; it was damaged by the same V-1 flying bomb as the church, and was restored in 1948.

In the process of looking for a screamer, they recruited a vocalist, Maria Petersèn. They changed the name of the band to Escape the Day. Whilst no albums or extended plays were made by this 6-member line-up, they recorded and released 10+ songs via YouTube between 2009-2011 including \\"Turn Back Time\\". In 2011, they recruited Jonas Jenelin as screaming vocalist, allowing them to blend their current 90s-trance influenced metal sound with their earlier metalcore style of Mindscape. They released a teaser for a new song titled \\"Rain\\" that featured Jenelin. However, Escape the Day went on hiatus and eventually revealed that both Maria Petersèn and Niklas Jonsson had left the band. = Reunion (2012–2014) = Escape the Day returned in early-2012 as a 7-piece, with Angeline Stenbock on vocals and Neil Grant on drums.

Sion is on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean in front of the island of Yeu (Île d'Yeu). Sion-sur-l'Océan is part of the commune of Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez.  Geography  Sion is located on the coast between ocean, beach, dune, forest and rocky ledge. The resort has three beaches (Bussoleries, the small beach and the grand beach) and a few cracks visible at low tide. The main beach is made of fine sand and stretches over 10 km (continuing by the \\"plages des demoiselles \\" in Saint Jean de Monts). The footpath dunes between sea and is 9 km to St Jean de Monts. The main beach is lined with white dunes made of fine sand, which quickly leaves the room for a gray dune flatter and covered with varied plants (immortal, Ephedra distachya, burnet rose, sedum, etc.). Behind the dunes, Sion forest extends over 500 hectares of forest landscaped with numerous hiking trails. The forest was once dotted with campsites and especially summer camps. These colonies were for most establishment managed by the \\"red municipalities\\" (communists) in the Paris suburbs. There are now 3 or 4 in activity, some \\"remnants\\" of the old facilities are still visible in the forest. A monument to the rail worker died for France during the 39-45 war was erected on top of a dune. This forest of cypresses, pines and oaks covers many dunes giving it an undulating appearance. It has undulating layout of views with orientation tables overlooking the forests. The rocky ledge of Sion is also equipped for walks and has many outstanding attractions such as \\"5 pineaux\\" and \\"Devil's Hole\\". In opposition to the forest this part of the coast is urbanized and constructed prewar villas and modern houses and buildings of 70/80 years and we continue to build again. Popular for its panoramic view of the Bay of Sion is on this part of the city that house prices are highest. The area of the village is in full redesign with the development of a major infrastructure project on the scale of the town: thalassotherapy. Sion-sur-Ocean is facing the island of Yeu which more or less we see the coast on the horizon depending on the moisture in the air. The night of the two headlights of Yeu island are visible. The \\"skyline\\" of the town of Saint Jean de Monts is also visible north of Sion.  Sports and Tourism  Many water activities can be practiced such as sailing, canoeing, surfing and kiting. Environment conducive to walking, riding, canoeing and cycling. Tourism is favorised by numerous food and housing accommodation. Sion neighborhood has made the town of Saint- Hilaire-de-Riez one of the most touristic cities of Vendée. Between sea, forest and dunes, Sion Ocean has kept its soul and charm of an authentic old fishing port. Every summer, the fireworks fired from the sea attracts thousands of people (50,000 in 2016).  History  The creation of the Village of Sion is mainly the work of Baranger family. In 1871, Jean-Marie Baranger (a seafarer from the Hamlet Orouet) takes possession of the piece of land on the coast, which today includes the center and its shops. Later, he will give up to the city space to build roads (rue de l'Yser, promenade and Sea Street Estivants). Generation by generation the initial field will be divided. The family Baranger will be at the initiative of opening shops for the tourist development of the town, such as restaurants and hotels, but also bars, a grocery, a hairdresser, a souvenir shop and a store repairing and selling bicycles. 150 years later, it is still his great-grandchildren who take certain businesses from the town (Hotel of Tourists, grocery store, restaurant le carré, hairdressing Baranger).

The place name of Manderscheid is first recorded in a deed of gift by Ottos II to the Archbishop of Trier dating to 973. This is not, however, as is often maintained in the literature, the earliest record of the castle, which is first historically known from the feud over St. Maximin's Abbey in front of Trier between Count Henry the Blind of Namur-Luxembourg and Archbishop Albero of Trier, between 1141 and 1146.c.f. Gesta Alberonis auctore Balderico, in: MGH SS VIII, p. 253 The free lords of Manderscheid first appear in 1142 in the list of witnesses in a deed of gift. In the 14th century, the village of Obermanderscheid gave its name to the Electoral Trier Amt of Manderscheid, which existed until the late 18th century. However, the seat of government was not at the castle, but in the Kellerei of the neighbouring village to which Elector Baldwin had granted town rights in 1332 (according to other sources they were granted by King Louis the Bavarian as one of a number of rights). The local estates of the Elector of Trier formed a sort of bridgehead into the surrounding sovereign territory of Luxembourg. In 1673 the castle, still owned by the Electorate, was finally destroyed by French troops. Today: the ruins of the Oberburg were thoroughly renovated in 1921 by the municipality of Manderscheid, on whose land it stands, and it is open to the public.

MartinThe Weatherbird is a cartoon character and a single-panel comic. It is printed on the front of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and has been in the paper continuously since 1901, making it the longest-running American newspaper cartoon and a mascot of the newspaper. Cartoonists The Weatherbird, in its long run, has been drawn by just six cartoonists (three of them, by coincidence, named Martin): #Harry B. Martin (1901 – 1903) #Oscar Chopin (1903 – 1910) #S. Carlisle Martin (1910 – 1932) #Amadee Wohlschlaeger (1932 – 1981) #Albert Schweitzer (1981 – 1986) #Dan Martin (1986 – present ()) Another Harry Martin Weatherbird, showing the cigar associated with the character until the late 20th century The character first appeared on February 11, 1901, Harry B. Martin originated the character, which was originally called \\"Dickey Bird\\" ('dicky-bird' is a generic slang term for any small bird). Martin had originally intended to rotate through just a few versions of the bird – one for rain, one for heat, etc. – but readers asked for a new drawing each day, which he then provided. Martin later moved to New York where he drew the strips It Happened in Birdland (1907–1909) and Inbad the Tailor (1911–1912, for the New York American). Martin became a golf correspondent and an authority on golf (writing 15 books on the subject) and a founder of the American PGA. Oscar Charles Chopin (1873 – 1932) inherited the Weatherbird from Martin, drawing it until 1910. An S. Carlisle Martin Weatherbird S. Carlisle Martin took over the Weatherbird in 1910. He started the tradition of making the Weatherbird comment on the news in addition to the weather, and started a pattern of six words or less for the bird's comments. He was assisted by Carlos Hurd, and drew the Weatherbird until his death in 1932. In 1912, the Post-Dispatch began running a full-page, multiple-panel color strip on Sunday, titled \\"Jinx and the Weather Bird Family\\", and featuring the Weatherbird (called \\"George\\" in the strip), his wife, and their mischievous Katzenjammer Kids-like children in various putatively comical escapades. (Jinx was an imp who observed or initiated the hijinks; later the strip was later retitled to just \\"The Weather Bird Family\\".) Carlisle Martin drew the strip, but the scripts were by Jean Knott, who later drew and wrote strips in New York. The strip apparently did not last past 1912. Amadee Wohlschlaeger had the longest tenure as Weatherbird artist: just short of fifty years. Wohlschlaeger was also the Post-Dispatch sports page cartoonist and drew for the Sporting News. Wohlschlaeger recalled that when barely out of his teens \\"I was doing sports art for the Post and when Carlisle died, I stayed up all night and drew 12 Weatherbirds so I could put them on the feature editor's desk the next morning. The feature editor grabbed me later in the day and said, 'You've got the job'\\". Wohlschlaeger retired in 1981 and lived until age 102, in 2014. Dan Martin's Weatherbird (this one marking the 2004 death of Ronald Reagan). The Weatherbird has long since traded his wings and tail for hands. Martin's bird shows a bit of beak, though, in contrast to Amadee's entirely flat face. In his nearly half-century-long tenure, Wohlschlaeger's Weatherbird commented on events such as D-Day, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the Apollo 11 moon landing, but his favorite cartoon appeared on October 2, 1944: it showed the Weatherbird dressed in St. Louis Browns uniform and standing on his head, in honor of the Browns' first and only American League pennant. Albert Schweitzer drew the first Weatherbirds to appear in color. Schweitzer drew the Weatherbird with pink feathers, although he had appeared darkly shaded before. A long-time Post-Dispatch veteran, his retirement came just five years after he took over the strip. Dan Martin took over the strip in 1986. He eliminated the Weatherbird's emblematic cigars and drew a bird with a bit more of a beak (previous cartoonists had atrophied the beak to the point of flatness). Martin wrote the book The Story of the First 100 Years of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Weatherbird. Other manifestations The Weatherbird inspired the name of John Hartford's \\"Weatherbird Reel\\". left Weatherbird brand shoes for children, using pictures of the Weatherbird in advertising, were offered starting in 1901 by the St. Louis-based Peters Shoe Company, later part of International Shoe which continued to base the brand's image on the Weatherbird until 1932 (the brand itself continued at least through the 1950s). Two of the original windows from the Peters Shoe Company factory, featuring pictures of the Weatherbird, adorn the Weatherbird Cafe in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch office. A life-size Weatherbird costume is used by the Post-Dispatch for promotions such as meet-and-greets at local bars.

Early life and education Macdonald was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1867 to George Macdonald, a tailor, and his wife, Margaret, née Smyth. The family soon moved to Waterford and subsequently to Chester in England, where he was educated at the King's School for Boys. In 1886, he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics, graduating with a third-class B.A. degree in 1889. From 1889 to 1891 he studied medicine at University College, Liverpool. In 1897 he qualified L.R.C.P., M.R.C.S. by passing the Scottish Conjoint Board Examination. Career In 1891, Macdonald was appointed the Holt Fellow in Physiology at University College, Liverpool, where he did research under Francis Gotch from 1891 to 1897. After gaining his medical qualifications, he served as house physician at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary for about six months in 1897, under James Barr. From 1897 to 1899, he was a lecturer in physiology at University College, Dundee under Waymouth Reid. In 1899, he returned to University College, Liverpool (from 1903, the University of Liverpool), as senior lecturer in physiology (1899–1903), with a British Medical Association research scholarship (1899–1901), under Charles Scott Sherrington. From 1903 to 1914, Macdonald held the Chair in Physiology at the University College, Sheffield. In 1906–1907, he additionally served as the acting Dean of the Medical Faculty, during the period when the college became Sheffield University. At Sheffield he planned the physiology department, which was at that date one of the leading facilities in the subject in England. In 1914, he returned to the University of Liverpool, succeeding Sherrington as the Holt Professor of Physiology, where he remained until his retirement in 1932. He also served as the Dean of the Medical Faculty (1917–20). Research Macdonald's early work was on nerves, initially in collaboration with first Francis Gotch and then Waymouth Reid. W. J. O'Connor states: He continued to research this topic at Liverpool, publishing a series of papers in the Journal of Physiology and the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He studied nerve electrical currents, potassium and chloride ions, among other topics. In around 1908, he began to research the mechanism of contraction in striated muscle, publishing an influential paper on the topic in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology. In around 1912, his attention turned to the problem of measuring muscular work in humans. He built a human calorimeter, now in the Wellcome Medical Museum, with which he studied how the heat produced was related to factors such as the intensity of exercise and the subject's weight. With F. A. Duffield, he also studied respiratory gas exchange. Awards and honours He was a member of the Physiological Society from 1894. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1917. Personal life Macdonald married Katherine Mary Stewart, who was from Stornaway, in 1898. The couple had eight children, three sons and five daughters. One of his daughters, Margaret S. Macdonald (Margaret Munday), collaborated with Macdonald at the end of his career. After his retirement, he lived with his son in Lincolnshire and at Bridge of Allan in Stirlingshire, Scotland.

Definition and differentiations  Hybrids of the domestic cat with non-domestic species (e. g. the Bengal cat or the Savannah cat) are not normally considered wild cats. While this distinction is often overlooked in the media and in the public eye, such cat breeds (especially the F5 and subsequent generations) are much closer to the domestic cat in terms of housing and husbandry requirements, behavior, and legality. Unlike many other exotic pet species, wild cats usually cannot be kept indoors and require a large outdoor enclosure. This blurs the distinction between a wild cat being kept as an exotic pet and a private animal collection or menagerie. Usually, an enclosure meant for a pet exotic cat is built adjacent to the house in order to give the animal access into the living quarters. Tame big cats kept by animal trainers (e. g. in circuses, private zoos or the film animal industry) are commonly mistaken for exotic pets. While the husbandry conditions and handling might be similar to a purely private setting, the common definition of a pet only includes animals kept for companionship or pleasure. Professional holders, breeders, or exhibitors do not meet this definition.  History  Exotic felids have a long tradition in human care. The ancient Egyptians kept servals in the same role as the African Wildcat (the wild ancestor of modern house cats). Cheetahs have also been kept throughout the world, both as companions and as hunting aides. Caracals have also been tamed and trained, primarily by Arabian and Asian rulers. Other large cats sometimes were also kept as companions, but were mostly limited to menageries owned by royal families.  Species kept as exotic pets  In general, small cat species are more commonly kept as exotic pets than larger ones. Big cats are substantially more expensive to maintain, pose a greater danger when being handled in direct contact, and may not always remain handleable when fully grown. This typically limits their keeping to professional animal trainers and zoo settings. = Servals and caracals = Servals and caracals have the longest history as human companions. Part of their popularity can be attributed to the fact that they readily hybridize with domestic cats. The resulting crosses (savannahs and caracats) inherit traits of both the domestic cat and the wild species. Like domestic cats they are sometimes kept as pest controllers.http://www.catsg.org/m/index.php?id=111 = Lynxes and bobcats = Nearly all species of the genus Lynx (with the exception of the Iberian lynx) are kept as exotic pets. Unlike other small cat species, they are not known to hybridize with the domestic cat. = Ocelots = Ocelots were popular as an exotic pet in the 50s and 60s. The passage of the Endangered Species Act in the United States effectively ended their keeping outside of zoological facilities due to interstate animal movement restrictions. Their popularity is also limited by their comparatively high aggression. No hybrids with domestic cats are known. = Pumas = While being considered small cats taxonomically, pumas are comparable in size to some of the big cats. They are typically less aggressive and more affectionate than big cats, which has led to some popularity as exotic pets. = Cheetahs = The cheetah has a long history as a human companion. However, difficulties in breeding prevented this species from becoming a widespread exotic pet in modern times. = Tigers = Tigers were once only kept by royalty; today it is a popular exotic pet. = Lions = Lions were also once only kept by royalty; today in some areas one has to have a permit to keep one; in some areas one can get one from the pet shop, while in other areas one may not own one.

Born and raised in Cairo, Egypt, Zaher was fascinated by art and paintings from an early age. A graduate of Fine Arts in Zamalek, Cairo, 1994,http://fineart.anamil.net/CVDetail/1181  Early work  The early paintings of Islam Zaher focused on the human figure. In 1994, in his graduation project, Zaher depicted naked male figures lying in bed while covering their faces with their hands. Zaher returned to this same theme in later years. The project, a triptych, was inspired by the idea of mental illness and the struggles of the inner self. Shortly after graduation, Zaher visited the same concept with a drawing with pastels of a male nude sitting on a wooden chair in a seeming silence but vibrating with charges of trapped emotions. The pastel drawing won second place in the 1995 Saloon of Youth. In the 1998 Saloon of Youth, Zaher won the Grand Jury award and the International Critics Award (ICA) for his oil painting \\"Screaming in Quietness.\\" Other than the figure paintings, Zaher experimented with still life and landscape. These paintings and drawings usually featured unconventional compositions and colors. The oil paintings, much like his figuration paintings, are characterized by thick layers of impasto paint, something that gives the paintings a striking and powerful impact on the viewer.  Paintings and subjects  Islam Zaher’s loyalty to the essence of oil paint as an alive, tactile medium lies at the core of his art practice. Obsessed with the expressive potential of color and paint skin, his work seeks to translate cerebral processes into raw, psychologically charged images. Zaher’s sophisticated palette and his annihilation of form and contour stem out of his expert draftsmanship and innate understanding of the medium of painting. On his \\"Intuited Happiness\\" series of paintings and drawings, Louise Sarant wrote: \\"Zaher depicts the schizophrenia that prevails in Egyptian society through a mixture of large paintings filled with bright colors and minimalistic drawings in various shades of brown...In one painting, a bride stands, small and dull in her fluffy white wedding dress, while the power of the celebration seems to crush her thin figure.

Dumitrescu; November 26, 1901-February 27, 1982) was an Ottoman-born Romanian prose writer and playwright. He was born into an Aromanian family in Ohrid, a city that formed part of the Ottoman Empire's Manastir Vilayet and is now in North Macedonia. His parents were Vasile Dimitrie (later Dumitrescu), a bucket-maker, and his wife Despina (née Gero). The family emigrated to Balș, in the Oltenia region of the Romanian Old Kingdom. Mihail attended primary school there, followed by high school in Caracal and Craiova, belatedly taking his degree in 1935. He studied at the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University, graduating in 1928. For a time, he was a high school teacher, later moving on to the university system. His first published work appeared in the Craiova magazine Flamura in 1922. His first book, the 1927 Capcana, included short stories and sketches. From 1938 to 1948, he headed Editura Bucur Ciobanu. Drumeș achieved unusual popularity through the novels Sfântul Părere, first published in 1930, retitled Cazul Magheru from the second printing and running for eighteen; and Invitație la vals (1939; 34 printings). His work appeared in Ramuri, Adevărul literar și artistic, Rampa, Convorbiri Literare, Vremea, Falanga and Universul literar. Drumeș also published theatrical plays: Năluca (1940) and Trei comedii. Școala nevestelor. Calul de curse. Liniștea soțului (1940). Later in life, he wrote historical novels such as Se revarsă apele (1961) and Codrul Vlăsiei (1966), in an attempt to rework his style and epic manner. His output is melodramatic, erotic and has vague social implications. He left behind in manuscript form several plays, radio and television screenplays, dramatizations and memoirs.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române, vol. I, p. 526.

Born in Leicester in 1869, Miss Townsend moved to Devon in 1926 together with her two sisters. In May 1932, one of her sisters, Elizabeth, was seriously ill in Kingsbridge Cottage Hospital. On 7 May, Emma was visiting her when she heard screaming from the next ward. One of the patients in the next ward was nine-year old William Yeoman, who was being assaulted by his father, William Jarvis Yeoman. Mr Yeoman had arrived at the hospital with a shotgun concealed under a coat with the intention of shooting his son. He was interrupted by a nurse but managed to fire at his son before striking him with the gun; it was the boy's screams that Emma Townsend had heard. Without hesitation, Townsend attempted to disarm Yeoman but each time she tried, he pushed her aside, on one occasion striking her with the gun, causing a scalp wound. Yeoman eventually broke away and ran from the hospital. Yeoman was captured by the police some hours later, but in the meantime had murdered his wife and other two children. William died two days later from injuries inflicted during the assault. Emma Townsend was treated for the head wound and later discharged. Yeoman was charged with the murders of his family and the attempted murder of Emma Townsend. He was tried at Devon Assizes in June 1932 and found guilty but insane; he was ordered to be detained during His Majesty's pleasure. Giving evidence, Miss Townsend described her actions by saying, \\"I did my best\\". The trial judge, Mr Justice Charles, responded, \\"I think you acted with great courage\\". On 6 September 1932, the award of the Empire Gallantry Medal to Emma Townsend was published in the London Gazette. The citation ran: In subsequent interviews, Miss Townsend maintained that she did no more than anyone else would have done in the circumstances. She was reluctant to talk about the incident as her sister had died only a few days afterwards. Like all recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal, Miss Townsend's medal was exchanged for the George Cross after its introduction in 1940.

The memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, was unveiled in 1921 and is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing—the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world—and the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Hartburn's memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a broadly similar design. Many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated with pre-war clients and friends. The commission for Hartburn came from Mr and Mrs Straker of nearby Angerton Hall, the gardens of which Lutyens renovated with Gertrude Jekyll in 1904.Skelton, p. 83. History and design The war memorial was built by HJ Robinson of Clay House in nearby Meldon. It was unveiled by Colonel EPA Riddel, CMG, DSO, commander of the 149th (Northumberland) Brigade. The memorial stands on a small triangular green in the middle of the village. It is one of Lutyens' fifteen War Crosses, the majority of which stand in small villages across England. Typical of Lutyens' War Crosses, it has a long, tapering shaft with short arms moulded near the top, though it has uncommonly deep bevelled edges and sits on a deep two-tiered stone base, which itself sits on a small stone circle in the grass. The main inscription is on the north face: \\"PASS FRIEND ALL IS WELL / 1914 HARTBURN 1919\\"; the inscription \\"1939 HARTBURN 1945\\" was added to the south face after the Second World War.Skelton, p. 169. Hartburn War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 30 January 1986. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

He was known professionally as just \\"Amadee\\" as he signed his cartoons that way. He was a long-time sports cartoonist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in an era when newspaper sports pages usually featured a prominent cartoon as an essential element of their layout. He drew the Weatherbird cartoon for over 49 years.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wohlschlaeger_amadee.htm Life and career Wohlschlaeger was born on December 3, 1911 in St. Louis and grew up in the Carondelet neighborhood in the far south of that city, where he developed a passion for drawing when a small child. He did not attend high school (although he did later take art classes at Washington University), starting at age 14 at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, where his father was a printer, as a copy boy earning $7.50 (about $ in dollars) a week. In 1929 at age 17 he was hired into the paper's art department. In 1932, Wohlschlaeger took over as the artist for the Post-Dispatch's Weatherbird, which was created in 1901 and remains in continuous daily use. He was the fourth artist to draw the Weatherbird. Wohlschlaeger drew the Weatherbird, usually accompanied by a pithy observation on current events, for almost fifty years, from 1932 to 1981. His Weatherbird marked D-Day, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and many other notable events. Wohlschlaeger drew his first sports cartoon for the paper in 1936. Among his contributions was his \\"Cardinals Camp Capers\\" cartoon, sent in from spring training. In 1939 he filled in as the Post- Dispatch's editorial cartoonist, drawing caricatures of Hitler and Mussolini as well as local politicians. Wohlschlaeger drew many covers for the Sporting News, which was then produced in St. Louis and known as \\"The Baseball Bible\\". He also drew covers for University of Missouri football programs for over thirty years, and covers for the annual St. Louis Baseball Writers dinner. Wohlschlaeger retired in 1981. He was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.

The metric defines an ABC score as a triplet of values that represent the size of a set of source code statements. An ABC score is calculated by counting the number of assignments (A), number of branches (B), and number of conditionals (C) in a program. ABC score can be applied to individual methods, functions, classes, modules or files within a program. ABC score is represented by a 3-D vector < Assignments (A), Branches (B), Conditionals (C) >. It can also be represented as a scalar value, which is the magnitude of the vector < Assignments (A), Branches (B), Conditionals (C) >, and is calculated as follows: :: = \\\\surd(A^2 + B^2 + C^2) By convention, an ABC magnitude value is rounded to the nearest tenth.  History  The concept of measuring software size was first introduced by Maurice Halstead from Purdue University in 1975. He suggested that every computer program consists mainly of tokens: operators and operands. He concluded that a count of the number of unique operators and operands gives us a measure of the size of the program. However, this was not adopted as a measure of the size of a program. Lines of code (LOC) was another popular measure of the size of a program. The LOC was not considered an accurate measure of the size of the program because even a program with identical functionality may have different numbers of lines depending on the style of coding. Another metric called the Function Point (FP) metric was introduced to calculate the number of user input and output transactions. The function point calculations did not give information about both the functionality of the program and about the routines that were involved in the program. The ABC metric is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the LOC, FP and token (operation and operand) counts. However, an FP score can also be used to supplement an ABC score. Though the author contends that the ABC metric measures size, some believe that it measures complexity. The ability of the ABC metric to measure complexity depends on how complexity is defined.  Definition  The three components of the ABC score are defined as following: * Assignment: storage or transfer of data into a variable. * Branches: an explicit forward program branch out of scope. * Conditionals: Boolean or logic test. Since basic languages such as C, C++, Java, etc. have operations like assignments of variables, function calls and test conditions only, the ABC score has these three components. If the ABC vector is denoted as <5,11,9> for a subroutine, it means that the subroutine has 5 assignments, 11 branches and 9 conditionals. For standardization purposes, the counts should be enclosed in angle brackets and written in the same order per the notation . It is often more convenient to compare source code sizes using a scalar value. The individual ABC counts are distinct so, per Jerry Fitzpatrick, we consider the three components to be orthogonal, allowing a scalar ABC magnitude to be computed as shown above. Scalar ABC scores lose some of the benefits of the vector. Instead of computing a vector magnitude, the weighted sum of the vectors may support more accurate size comparison. ABC scalar scores should not be presented without the accompanying ABC vectors, since the scalar values are not the complete representation of the size.  Theory  The specific rules for counting ABC vector values should be interpreted differently for different languages due to semantic differences between them. Therefore, the rules for calculating ABC vector slightly differ based on the language. We define the ABC metric calculation rules for C, C++ and Java below. Based on these rules the rules for other imperative languages can be interpreted. = ABC rules for C = The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for C: # Add one to the assignment count when: #* Occurrence of an assignment operator (=, *=, /=, %=, +=, <<=, >>=, &=, !=, ^=). #* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (++, --). # Add one to branch count when: #* Occurrence of a function call. #* Occurrence of any goto statement which has a target at a deeper level of nesting than the level to the goto. # Add one to condition count when: #* Occurrence of a conditional operator (<, >, <=, >=, , !=). #* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘else’, ‘case’, ‘default’, ‘?’). #* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator. = ABC rules for C++ = The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for C++: # Add one to the assignment count when: #* Occurrence of an assignment operator (exclude constant declarations and default parameter assignments) (=, *=, /=, %=, +=, <<=, >>=, &=, !=, ^=). #* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (prefix or postfix) (++, --). #* Initialization of a variable or a nonconstant class member. # Add one to branch count when: #* Occurrence of a function call or a class method call. #* Occurrence of any goto statement which has a target at a deeper level of nesting than the level to the goto. #* Occurrence of ‘new’ or ‘delete’ operators. # Add one to condition count when: #* Occurrence of a conditional operator (<, >, <=, >=, , !=). #* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘else’, ‘case’, ‘default’, ‘?’, ‘try’, ‘catch’). #* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator. = ABC rules for Java = The following rules give the count of Assignments, Branches, Conditionals in the ABC metric for Java: # Add one to the assignment count when: #* Occurrence of an assignment operator (exclude constant declarations and default parameter assignments) (=, *=, /=, %=, +=, <<=, >>=, &=, !=, ^=, >>>=). #* Occurrence of an increment or a decrement operator (prefix or postfix) (++, --). # Add one to branch count when #* Occurrence of a function call or a class method call. #* Occurrence of a ‘new’ operator. # Add one to condition count when: #* Occurrence of a conditional operator (<, >, <=, >=, , !=). #* Occurrence of the following keywords (‘else’, ‘case’, ‘default’, ‘?’, ‘try’, ‘catch’). #* Occurrence of a unary conditional operator.  Applications  = Independent of style of coding = Since the ABC score metric is built on the idea that tasks like data storage, branching and conditional testing, this metric is independent of the user’s style of coding. = Project time estimation = ABC score calculation helps in estimating the amount of time needed to complete a project. This can be done by roughly estimating the ABC score for the project, and by calculating the ABC score of the program in a particular day. The amount of time taken for the completion for the project can be obtained by dividing the ABC score of the project by the ABC score achieved in one day. = Bug rate calculation = The bug rate was originally calculated as Number of bugs / LOC. However, the LOC is not a reliable measure of the size of the program because it depends on the style of coding. A more accurate way of measuring bug rate is to count the - Number of bugs / ABC score. = Program comparison = Programs written in different languages can be compared with the help of ABC scores because most languages use assignments, branches and conditional statements. The information on the count of the individual parameters (number of assignments, branches and conditions) can help classify the program as ‘data strong’ or ‘function strong’ or ‘logic strong’. The vector form of an ABC score can provide insight into the driving principles behind the application, whereas the details are lost in the scalar form of the score. = Linear metric = ABC scores are linear, so any file, module, class, function or method can be scored. For example, the (vector) ABC score for a module is the sum of the scores of its sub-modules. Scalar ABC scores, however, are non-linear.

Whitman or Wightman Jacobs (1727 – 1801) was an American Baptist clergyman known for his leadership of a Separate Baptist Church in Thompson, Connecticut, and his ministry and departure from Royalston, Massachusetts following Shays' Rebellion. Early life He was born in Bristol, Rhode Island, to Nathaniel Jacobs and Mercy Whitman. His father founded Jacobs' Inn, a well known institution in Thompson, Connecticut, of which both George Washington and Lafayette were guests. The inn was located in the northeastern corner of Connecticut, halfway between Hartford and Boston. Whitman Jacobs was \\"of the unadulterated Roger Williams stock\\". Ministry Elder Jacobs moved from Rhode Island to Thompson, Connecticut to found a baptist church in 1750. This church was part of the General Six-Principle Baptists association. In his ministry, he baptized many people around New England. The American Baptist Magazine describes him and others as having travelled to Framingham, Massachusetts to preach and spread their faith. In 1762, he baptized four people there, followed by six and seven more the following years. On June 19, 1767, Elder Jacobs met with others in the process founding the Baptist Church in Royalston, Massachusetts, where he eventually became the first pastor. This church was the 5th in Worcester County and the 22nd in Massachusetts. He was pastor in Thompson, Connecticut for 20 years prior to his tenure in Royalston, and many of his parishioners from Thompson moved to Royalston. Reverend Jacobs was installed in Royalston on December 13, 1770. His salary was $50 per year. He resigned in 1786. Sources say that he was pushed out because he had a difference of opinion with his congregation regarding the Shays Rebellion. Jacobs sided with the government, while most of his congregation agreed with Daniel Shays. After Royalston, he was pastor in Guilford, Vermont Family life He married Rebecca Rice and had 2 children, and later married Rebecca Grow and had 10 children. He died on March 28, 1801, while living with his son Joseph in Royalston, Massachusetts.

He had previously won a Four-Year-Old World Championship in 2012. Honors has also been used for breeding. Life and career Honors is a black stallion owned by Keith and Dan McSwain of Milton and Gainesville, Georgia, respectively. He is trained by brothers Larry and Gary Edwards, of the Edwards and Sons Stables, Dawson, Georgia. The Edwardses began working with Honors when he was nearly three years old. Larry saw the horse at fellow trainer Joe Fleming's stable in Shelbyville, Tennessee, called the McSwains, and purchased Honors the next day. He had been previously trained by Steve Aymett and his daughter Kelly Aymett. In 2012, ridden by Larry Edwards, Honors won the Four-Year-Old World Championship at the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. In 2016, at the age of 8, he won the B division of the Stallions Five and Over class before being entered in the World Grand Championship. He and Larry Edwards won first place out of a field of seven horses, in a unanimous vote by the five judges. Gary Edwards praised the way the horse responded to his brother, saying, \\"Larry loves him. And Honors knows it.\\" Several hundred people went to the barn after the show, where they were allowed to see and photograph Honors. The Shelbyville Times-Gazette commented that Honors was unusually popular, even for a World Grand Champion. The win was controversial. Honors had been disqualified four times between 2013 and 2015 for violations of the \\"scar rule\\" of the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) which allows a horse to be pulled from competition if it shows signs of having been sored in the past. In addition, the Edwards brothers had multiple previous HPA violations and suspensions on their record. In 2014, when Honors had been disqualified twice by the same official, the McSwains had the horse examined by veterinarians at Auburn University in Alabama and Louisiana State University, who found no sign of damage that violated the scar rule. In April 2016, McSwain had filed a lawsuit against the USDA, alleging violations of due process, and seeking a number of legal remedies including reversal of Honors' past disqualifications and injunctive relief. In May, federal district court judge Richard W. Story granted a preliminary injunction, noting that there was no appeals process for owners to contest disqualification, and the ruling prevented veterinary inspectors from disqualifying Honors from future competitions without having a hearing where a disqualification could be challenged. This ruling allowed Honors to be shown in 2016, and the McSwains's lawsuit against the USDA was still pending at the time of the Celebration. Because of the accusations of soring, the morning after the World Grand Championship, the Edwardses volunteered to have Honors biopsied to prove he was sound. Besides his show career, Honors has also been used for breeding, and has sired offspring who sold for high prices at auction. In reference to the desired qualities of a show horse, Gary Edwards said, \\"He [Honors] has it all\\".

In essence, it was a scaled up version of the Jumo 004 (the Jumo 004 had already reached serial production by 1944). It was intended to power the EF 132 and variants of the Ju 287. Development After the Jumo 004 had entered serial production, the Technical Department of the RLM requested Junkers to build a much larger engine capable of powering the heavy jet bombers then under development for the Luftwaffe. Initially, Junkers proposed modifications of the Jumo 004, specifically the 109-004G and 109-004H. However, these variants were rejected as they were not powerful enough, and Junkers began to design the 109-012.Kay, p. 89 The engine was to feature an 11-stage axial compressor enclosed in a sheet-steel casing and a 2-stage, air-cooled turbine. It was proposed that a bleed air system should be installed after the fifth compressor stage to supply compressed air, if needed. The RLM ordered ten pre- production examples of the 109-012 to be built at Dessau for testing, where several parts for the engines including nine exhaust cones were already completed. In December 1944, the RLM issued an order to Junkers calling for the firm to cease development on the 109-012, and further design work was moved to several other firms.

Naval and coast guard career  As a naval officer he was trained in missile warfare by the Soviet Navy as part of an Indian Contingent sent for training to Vladivostok. Following that he served in the \\"Killer Squadron\\" where he was the first person in the history of the Indian navy to fire a missile from an Indian naval warship. During that exercise he served on INS Nirbhik, a Vidyut class missile boat. He was part of the missile boat group sent to attack Karachi Harbour that effectively ended the 1971 Indo-Pak war. INS Nirbhik was diverted just before the operation to provide rescue support to the sinking warship INS Khukri.  Philately, numismatics and music  Cdr. G. Sri Rama Rao and Mrs. Ramalakshmi Gandikota Since childhood Sri Rama Rao has had an interest in music, stamps, coins and currency. Today he is one of the most well known philatelists and numismatists in Andhra Pradesh with a number of local, state, national and international awards. These include 5 Limca Book of Records (India) and 4 Asia book or records. Sri Rama Rao was instrumental in the planning, design and photographic contribution to the development and release of a special folder of stamps on Indian Musicians on 3 September 2014 in Visakhapatnam. On that occasion he was felicitated by the Chief Postmaster General of Visakhapatnam and the vice chancellor of Andhra University. In 2013 Sri Rama Rao was honored by Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna with the traditional shawl placed on his shoulders for his achievements to philately and numismatics in music and stated in his visitors book, \\"He is doing a great service to music\\". In 2014 Sri Rama Rao was invited to exhibit musical stamps and coins on the occasion of the release of the commemorative stamps on Indian musicians in Visakhapatnam. Over 1200 school students visited this philatelic and numismatic tribute to music. Sri Rama Rao was invited to deliver the inaugural lecture demonstration at the 2014 Madras Music Festival by the Madras Music Academy and conduct an exhibition of rare stamps and coins on music. He delivered this lecture on 16 December 2014 to the wonder and amazement of audience from around India and the World on the variety of stamps dedicated to music, their history from the earliest to modern times and the variety of such stamps. On 7 February 2016, Cdr. G. Sri Rama Rao participated in the international fleet review as part of the veteran Indian naval officers and sailors contingent. He also set up an exhibit of stamps and coins on the Indian navy and music at the Visakha Museum on the invitation of the Indian Navy.

One of their first vehicles was a collaboration with Jensen Motors for a tractor unit, used primarily for railway deliveries, and they then produced a number of vehicles which were aimed at the dairy industry and bodied as milk floats for retail milk delivery. They had some success with exports to Canada, and two independent companies bearing the Helecs Vehicles name were set up, in 1952 and 1955. All of the companies became insolvent in 1956. One of the vehicles for which they built the chassis is on public display at The Transport Museum, Wythall. History Hindle Smart and Co. Ltd. was an electrical engineering company initially based at 20 Wilmslow Road Withington, south Manchester, and then in the late 1940s in Ardwick, at 27a New Bank Street. It was formed by Mr Noel Hindle and Mr Robert Eric Smart around 1931, as they celebrated 20 years of working in partnership in 1951. Activity during the Second World War can be traced from a series of advertisements that they placed in the classified section of the Manchester Guardian newspaper. In October 1942, they were sole agents in Manchester for sales of the Wilson Electric range of battery-electric road vehicles, made by Partridge Wilson Engineering of Leicester. They stocked a large number of Wilson spare parts, and were also able to undertake repairs to most other makes of battery-electric vehicles. Due to wartime restrictions, they advertised a limited range of new battery vehicles in September 1943, and from January 1944 mentioned the Wilson MW 25 cwt and the AMW 22 cwt models, with the slogan \\"Britain's Best Electrics\\". From late 1946, they also advertised sales of the Graiseley Electric Vehicles 10 cwt pedestrian controlled vehicle. After the Second World War, Jensen Motors of West Bromwich, near Birmingham, made a small petrol-engined articulated lorry, called the Jen-Tug, which was used primarily by railway companies for local deliveries at goods depots. In 1948 they made an agreement with Hindle Smart to build a battery-electric version of the Tug, which was called the Jen-Helecs. They produced the Jen- Helecs Model 210, a battery-electric tractor unit suitable for use with semi- trailers of 30–40 cwt capacity. It had a maximum speed of 16 mph, a range of 20 miles and was fitted with a 36-cell 192 Ahr battery, mounted in two panniers, one on either side of the chassis. It was controlled by a foot- operated pedal, and was supplied with a selenium metal rectifying charger unit, which incorporated a cut-out relay to disconnect the battery once it was fully charged. Ancillary electrical equipment on the tractor was of 12-volt double pole design, but the trailer used a single pole system, to ensure compatibility with existing Jen-Tugs. The track of the rear wheels was much narrower than that of the front wheels, to facilitate easy coupling and uncoupling of the trailer. In September 1949 it was announced that a Jen- Helecs would be trialled at , as part of an evaluation of electric vehicles by British Railways. They also tested vehicles built by Northern Coachbuilders (later Smith Electric Vehicles) and Brush, at Coventry, Bath, and Glasgow. It is not clear how successful the design was, but the agreement with Jensen, which is now held at the University of Warwick Modern Records Centre, was terminated in 1952. None of the trucks are known to have survived beyond the 1950s, although Dinky Toys produced a diecast model of the Jen-Helecs between 1953 and 1959, resulting in an otherwise obscure vehicle being better known than it might have been. Jensen Motors went on to produce sports cars, including the Jensen Interceptor. An advert in Commercial Motor magazine from 1 July 1949 mentions that there was a Jen-Helecs drivers club, for drivers of Jen-Helecs, Sunbeam and Wilson Electric vehicles. Membership entitled the user to a free badge. In early 1949, a Mr E E Grant joined the company, who had previously worked for Partridge Wilson Engineering in Leicester, manufacturers of charging equipment for accumulators, and also their own range of battery- electric road vehicles. Grant's role was to develop the Hindle Smart electric vehicles, which Commercial Motor listed as the Helecs, the Jen-Helecs, and the Wilson. Hindle Smart also bought the goodwill of the Sunbeam range of milk floats at this time, following the bankruptcy of Sunbeam and the sale of its commercial vehicle arm to Guy Motors. In mid-1949, the company issued an illustrated brochure with details of their range of electric vehicles, together with information about a battery hire scheme, which allowed purchasers to spread the cost of the vehicle battery over 36 months. The brochure also included details of suitable battery chargers. At the 1949 Dairy Show, held at Olympia in October, Hindle Smart showcased the Tough Ten model, which was fitted with a van body and carried a payload of 10 cwt. Many of the expendable parts had been designed with generous bearing surfaces, to extend their life. The batteries were located in the middle of the vehicle, while the chassis was sprayed with zinc, painted with zinc chromate and finally covered with anti-sulphuric paint, to give good protection against rust. The contactor panel, the main controller and the resistance unit could be removed easily for maintenance, and there were large removable panels to give access to the battery and transmission. Brush had entered the market for battery electric road vehicles in 1945, having bought designs and manufacturing rights from Metropolitan Vickers. In 1950 they decided to stop producing 4-wheeled designs, just retaining their 3-wheeled Brush Pony model. They kept enough spare parts to enable them to service existing 4-wheeled models for another ten years, but sold the rest of their stock of parts to Hindle Smart. The Company and Robert Smart jointly obtained a patent in 1950, number GB639521, for an improved method of controlling the charging of batteries, particularly those used in electric vehicles. 1950 also saw the unveiling of the Helecs Intruder at the Commercial Motor Show, held at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre. The manufacturer had tried to get away from the traditional box-like appearance of many battery-electric vehicles of the time, by the introduction of curved panels in the bodywork, and a large single windscreen with a curved lower edge. It was designed for a payload of 25 cwt, and had a box frame chassis, which was strengthened by the use of tubular cross members. Motion was controlled by a four speed contactor, which automatically selected a sequence of speeds at a pre-determined rate. Again, attention had been given to ensure that the electrical parts were accessible and easily removable. In August 1951 the managing director, Mr Noel Hindle, travelled to Holland where demonstrations of the Intruder had generated interest in the vehicles. =Development= Improvements to the design of the Intruder, to produce a Series II model, were made in time for it to be exhibited at the October 1951 Dairy Show. It still carried a payload of 25 cwt, but the chassis was of all- welded construction, with the side beams parallel to each other. This enabled the springs to be mounted so that they were parallel to each other, which improved the suspension and the ride quality. The battery system was upgraded from 60 volts to 72 volts by including an exta six cells, and was moved from the middle of the vehicle to two panniers of 18 cells each, which were mounted outside the main frame. They supplied a motor through the control panel, which was now accessible from the cab, rather than through a removable panel. A total of five contactors with automatic sequencing gave four forward or reverse speeds, and the direction of travel selected was indicated by red and green lights on the dashboard. The wheelbase remained the same, at but the front overhang was increased, to provide a little more room for the driver. Forward visibility was improved by the provision of a deep windscreen. Early the following year, the marketing of battery-electric road vehicles was split off from the core business of Hindle Smart by the formation of a new company, Helecs Vehicles Ltd. The new company was also responsible for the appointment of distributors and agents for the vehicles. In March 1952 they announced a new pricing structure for their vehicles, which were listed as the Tough Ten and the Intruder. Prices for both ranges were quoted for a bare chassis, a chassis with cab, and a chassis, cab and milk float body. Helecs received a second order for seven vehicles, a mixture of Tough Ten and Intruder models, from their agent in Toronto, Canada in August 1952. They were supplied in chassis form, with bodies for bread delivery built locally. The Tough Ten model was also displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition, held in Toronto, and the model on show was a bread van. At the 1952 Commercial Motor show, they displayed a new model called the Endeavour, which was a general purpose vehicle designed for a payload of 30 cwt. They also showcased two Tough Ten models, one a bare chassis, and one with a milk float body. The Endeavour had a heavy duty traction motor, which was attached to a sub-frame by Metalastic flexible mountings. A Layrub shaft delivered power to the double reduction rear axle. Helecs used a controller which was built as a removable unit, so that removing two bolts and some electrical connections allowed the whole panel to be withdrawn from the vehicle. A Layrub shaft was also used on the Tough Ten vehicles. The next new model was the Helpmate, which was unveiled at the 1953 Dairy Show. It was suitable for a payload of 18 cwt, equivalent to of milk. The vehicle featured a steering wheel which was in the centre of the front panel, and was mounted vertically. A new feature was the Elexmatic power-unit, which provided a steady rate of acceleration by means of a carbon compression cylinder with a spring-loaded piston. Control was by two floor- mounted pedals, an accelerator and a brake, while the Metalastic mountings for the traction motor were retained from earlier models. Two 8-cell batteries were mounted in panniers on either side of the chassis, and the 32-volt battery gave a range of around . Like previous models, the controls were built as a single unit which could be easily removed for maintenance. Helecs claimed that the Elexmatic controller enabled the battery size, and hence weight, to be reduced by one third, without compromising the range of the vehicle. The Helpmate was an unusual looking vehicle, as it had a cab which was much narrower than the rear platform, and was placed centrally, with a step at either side. The Helecs Helpmate Can-Stand was a variant of the Helpmate, produced for the Canadian market in 1954. The cab was offset to one side, for left hand drive, and the pedals were adapted to allow the vehicle to be driven while standing up. In particular, the accelerator was operated by the heel, while the brake pedal remained fairly conventional. It included a pedestal seat for use when driving between the depot and the start of the delivery round, and an Elexmatic Pack controller, to allow a smaller size of battery to be used. In early 1955, the company name became Helecs Vehicles (Manufacturers) Ltd, and they relocated from Ardwick to Little Western Street, Rusholme. Due to rising production costs, the price of the Helpmate was increased by 11 per cent in mid 1955. The company won an order to supply Transmutor control equipment, worth £100,000, to an American company at about the same time. Helecs Vehicles Ltd showed one of their Helpmate vehicles, which was fitted with the Elexmatic Pack, at the 1955 Dairy Show. They also announced that they had produced a new type of electrically operated clutch, and there was some speculation that they were developing a delivery vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine. Less clear is their involvement in another project. TH Lewis of London built Lewis Electruk milk floats for Express Dairies, but in 1955, the demand for Rider Pram models exceeded the production capacity. An order for 168 extra vehicles was therefore placed with Ross Auto Engineering of Southport, Merseyside. Ross were given the plans for the 10 cwt model, and when delivered, the vehicles were almost indistinguishable from the Lewis model. However, they all carried chassis plates indicating that the chassis at least had been built by Helecs Vehicles Ltd. Helecs Vehicles appeared in the Commercial Motor list of vehicle manufacturers published in mid-1956. Surprisingly, Jen-Helecs were also listed, at the same address in Rusholme, despite the fact that the agreement with Jensen Motors had ceased in 1952. =Demise= From 1955, production of the Helecs range of battery electric road vehicles had been taken over by Ross Auto Engineering of Southport. Commercial Motor noted that Helecs Vehicles, along with Renault and Citroën among others, would not be exhibiting at the 1956 Commercial Motor show, and on 11 January 1957 announced that the company was no longer trading, as it was being wound up. All of the Hindle Smart group of companies went into voluntary liquidation, and a notice appeared in the London Gazette, stating that a meeting of creditors of Helecs Vehicles (Manufacturers) Ltd would be held on 10 April 1956 at the Berners Hotel in London. It was signed by Noel Hindle. A further three notices appeared on 8 May, again signed by Hindle, stating that resolutions had been passed to wind up the companies on 10 April, and that Mr Harold Beattie of York Street, Manchester had been appointed as the liquidator. In all cases, the companies were unable to continue trading because of their liabilities. Finally, four notices appeared in the London Gazette in October 1957, announcing general meetings to hear how the liquidator had disposed of the assets of the various companies. The meetings were to be held on 2 December at Norfolk Street, Manchester. The meeting for Helecs Vehicles Ltd was at 11:00 am, that for creditors of Hindle Smart (EVS) Ltd at 11:05 am, then Helecs Vehicles (Manufacturers) Ltd at 11:10 am, and a fourth, for members of Hindle Smart (EVS) Ltd, at 11:20 am. The liquidator at this point was stated to be H C Gill. Preservation One of the Lewis Electruk lookalikes, the chassis of which was built by Helecs Vehicles, is on display at The Transport Museum, Wythall, near Birmingham. It was supplied to Express Dairies in 1955, where it carried the fleet number RP90 and the registration number RLW 610, and was sold on to Bournemouth & Parkstone Co-operative Society some ten years later. In 1978 it was sold again, to Muscliffe Farm Dairy in Bournemouth, where it lasted for another five years. It was then privately owned for five years, and was donated to the Museum Trust in 1988. They have restored it and repainted it in Express Dairies livery. They also own the chassis of a second Helecs 10, which is not on public display.

In 1957, he was the first to note that ferrichrome could act as an iron transport agent. Books In 1958, Neilands and his colleague Paul K. Stumpf co- authored a textbook, Outlines of Enzyme Chemistry, that has been called \\"seminal\\". He also wrote the book Harvest of Death, which discussed the putative dangers of herbicides and defoliants and was published in 1971. Political activism Neilands was very active in politics; most notably, in the 1950s, he successfully fought to prevent Pacific Gas and Electric Company from building a nuclear reactor at Bodega Bay. In the late 1960s, he ran, unsuccessfully, for the Berkeley City Council. He also protested against the Vietnam War and the Gulf War on the UC Berkeley campus. Death Neilands died on October 23, 2008 at the age of 87, after briefly battling a rare form of tuberculosis.

Note that the materials and styles can be very different on the same types. Building typology refers to the study and documentation of a set of buildings which have similarities in their type of function or form. There are two sides to the term \\"building typology\\". The first is a functional typology that categorizes buildings by the similarity of their use into groups such as hospitals, schools, and shopping centers (see more examples in the list of building types by use). The second is a typology that groups buildings according to their forms, which is explained in this article. Formal building typology may be based on configuration, format, or relationships of building to streets and each other. Any single functional type can be subdivided into formal types. For example, the residential functional type may be further subdivided into formal categories such as high rise towers, single family homes, duplexes, and townhouses. The townhouse building is one formal type that has a specific configuration: single units are placed side-by-side with others, vertically oriented up to four stories tall, and facing the street. Many more variations of this formal type are found around the world, each with variations that are the result of local materials, cultural habits, age and technology. Documenting a type is the process of discovering the elements of similar forms which are the same. Usually building types are distinguished by their basic form, site configuration, and scale, but not their specific architectural style, color, or even precise use and are related to the era, the culture, and the environment in which they arise. History The idea of autonomous building types arose in part from the general Enlightenment predilection for categorization, a prelude to scientific discovery. At first types were intended as ideal models, which could be variously copied. In this sense types were commonly used forms (a basilica, for example), that were adapted over time in new buildings with quite different uses: from Roman fora to early church forms (St. Peter's Basilica), to 19th century train stations. The fact that these forms are very similar and are derived from each other is an important way of understanding typology: types are evolved over time and therefore can convey a sense of history or cultural continuity. The idea of building types as formal configurations was enhanced by J.N.L. Durand, who developed two important works: the Parallele (1799), a huge, handsome book that reproduced plans, elevations and sections of historic buildings at the same scale. He categorized them by formal types, so that their basic similarities could be recognized. Durand followed up with a second book that manipulated and reconfigured the classical elements of architecture—columns, walls, etc.—in order to adapt them to new, emerging uses. Durand's system, a language of architecture, demonstrated one essential characteristic of types: a way of designing that was neither entirely free of constraint nor overly prescribed. Documenting a building type Most buildings of any city can be recognized as belonging to a building type. In the US, for example, several residential types exist, such as garden apartments, townhouses, and high rise housing. Each of these may have many subtypes: even within one part of a city there may appear two or three predominant residential types such as a small post-WWII house or a strongly horizontal ranch house. Anyone can begin to identify types simply by observing the common buildings in a place. Architectural and urban designers document types more thoroughly, by measuring them, dating them, noting similar changes to the type that arise over time, and identifying their recurring locations in the city. The uses of building typology in history and practice Houses along the canal in Delft are a type common just to this area. Building types are critical to architects because they are a starting point for designing. One need not reinvent the form if a common building type, say an office building, is wanted. Most architects develop a sense of common building types over time, even without acknowledging their importance. Architects know the approximate dimensions, bulk, site placement, and internal circulation that dictates most types. This allows them to work quickly to determine the parts of the design problem which are unique: material, orientation, structure, specific dimensions, entrance, and so on. One school of thought in Italy, started by Saverio Muratori, recognizes the importance of typology in providing continuity in the city. These architects have been influential in recognizing the role of type for modern architecture, where the newest buildings are encouraged to actively assimilate many typological characteristics, without imitating historical styles. A common type in Asia is the \\"shophouse\\" which has an open shop on the ground floor and rooms above for living. Historians, anthropologists, and architectural historians use the documentation of type as a key to other characteristics in a city, for example events, political control, or economic changes. As theory tells us, when a type evolves over a period of time, this is an indication that conditions in the city have changed. Anne Moudon documents changes in the types of an Alamo Square neighborhood to tell a kind architectural, cultural and economic history. She also identifies the block, lot and street pattern as key to typological continuity. Multiple studies using this method have identified important building types, for example Chinese shophouses, Shanghai's Shikumen housing, terrace housing in Great Britain, Courtyard buildings in France, and the atrium houses found in many hot climates. Atrium types are also important for mosques, shopping malls, and some hotels. Building type and urban design Common types are the building blocks of the city. Usually, a neighborhood streets and lots are laid out so that the common type can be built there. This occurs today in suburban subdivisions, but it has been a pattern in history, as well. This combination of types, streets and lots is called an urban tissue, or a plan unit. When studying a city, a designer identifies the common tissue patterns in place and may decide to link to them, imitate them, or otherwise recognize them as an historical artifact. A movement of urban theorists and practitioners in the US, New Urbanism, has identified building typology as a key to defining more user-friendly places. In trying to preserve neighborhoods or building new ones, building types once again become the building blocks of the city, and may be codified in law as form-based codes.

He benefited from the patronage of the Mirdasid dynasty, whose emirs (princes) he frequently praised in his poetry. His works were published as Diwan Ibn Abi Hasina in 1956. Biography Ibn Abi Hasina was born in Ma'arrat al-Nu'man in 998 and belonged to the Banu Sulaym, a large and geographically widespread Arab tribe, hence his epithet al-Sulamī.Rikabi, p. 686. He received much of his early education in his hometown, which at the time was a cultural center. In circa 1019, he met Thimal ibn Salih, the son of the Mirdasid leader Salih ibn Mirdas, in the town of al-Rahba.Zakkar, p. 91. He dedicated a poem to Thimal during that encounter and in 1022, which exhibited his poetic skills and attracted the Mirdasids' favor. When the latter established their state in Aleppo in 1024–1025, Ibn Abi Hasina took residence there and came under Mirdasid patronage. He devoted numerous poems praising their virtues and conquests. In 1045, Ibn Abi Hasina was sent by Thimal, then emir of Aleppo, to Cairo on a diplomatic mission to the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir. Ibn Abi Hasina wrote al-Mustansir a panegyric and was granted a noble title, making him an amir (prince). He later visited Damascus and wrote poems praising its beauty and dedicating a eulogy to the city's qadi (head Islamic judge), Hamza ibn al-Husayn. Throughout his life, Ibn Abi Hasina remained loyal to the Mirdasids. He died in Saruj on 22 July 1065. Poetry Ibn Abi Hasina specialized in the panegyric, which accounted for most of his literary work. According to historian J. Rikabi, Ibn Abi Hasina \\"was distinguished by the quality of his language, his themes remaining the traditional ones\\". In his panegyrics to the Mirdasid emirs, he extolled their generosity, bravery, martial skills and noble ancestry, all virtues honored in Bedouin culture. However, he also wrote romantic and elegiac poetry. He often sent his poetry to his contemporary and hometown friend, al-Ma'arri, for the latter's commentary. Ibn Abi Hasina's diwan (poetry collection) was published in Damascus in 1956 by Muhammad As'ad Talas. The diwan consisted of two volumes, the first containing Ibn Abi Hasina's poems, the second containing commentary by al-Ma'arri. Among the poems attributed to Ibn Abi Hasina is the following verse: > When we stopped to say a mutual farewell, > and whilst her heart and mine were overflowing with passion and with love, > she wept liquid pearls; > my eyelids let fall cornelians, > and both formed a necklace on her bosom. > — Excerpt from a love poem attributed by historian Ibn Khallikan (d. 1282) > to Ibn Abi Hasina, whom he describes as a \\"poet of some reputation\\".

Professional gaming houses began in South Korea for professional StarCraft players. It also refers to gambling establishments.  Concept  They provide opportunity for professional gaming teams to house all of their players in a streamlined environment that the teams can cater and control. Instead of the players having to link up online, all are in a singular area so they can effectively scrimmage and practice with one another to get better at their respective video game. The houses can even have psychologists, analysts, nutritionists, trainers, and chefs so the players can take advantage of them should the need arise. The houses can bring a sense of reality into a virtually fueled lifestyle. Because all of the players are with one another, they must learn to live with each other and will bond through the good and bad. With how strenuous these players lives can be, it is important to keep them in their senses and have a grasp of social connection, apart from the games itself. The houses range in aesthetic appeal and can be smaller few bedroom houses with players sharing rooms where they might just have a mattress on the ground, or they can be extremely lavish and furnished with quality amenities in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California with A-List celebrities.

Players practice for around six to ten hours on any given day on their chosen title, within their “work environment” as to simulate competition conditions. The players have almost no privacy, as the team is in close proximity to each other for almost 24 hours a day - which can spark arguments. Another of the concerns regarding players' health is that the players are eating unhealthy meals due to time constraints. Combined with the high-level competitive field creating extra stress, the need is great for players to receive a fitness coach, a psychologist, a nutritionist, and other services - which they often employ in-house for players.

She was honoured by three countries for her courage while nursing in the war, and was awarded the Military Medal.  Early life  Anna Violet Thurstan was born on 4 February 1879 in Ore, Sussex. She was the eldest child of Anna (née Reid) and Edward Paget Thurstan, a doctor, and had three younger brothers. The family moved often and the teenage \\"Vi\\", who would later call herself Violetta, went to boarding schools including a German Catholic school and the Ladies' College, Guernsey. She started nursing in the UK in 1897 and trained at the London Hospital, Whitechapel under matron Eva Luckes. From 1905 to 1914 she nursed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary while simultaneously building on her language skills and studying history and geography. This led to an external degree from the University of St Andrews: an LLA in modern languages and fine art.

Soon the occupying German army ordered all British nurses to leave and forced her to go to Copenhagen under armed escort. From there she travelled north through Sweden and Finland to reach Russia, where she joined the flying column, or mobile medical unit, headed by Prince and Princess Peter Volkonsky. As part of this unit she tended to the wounded in Łódź after it was bombarded, and then nursed in and around Warsaw. She was wounded with shrapnel, and also became ill with pleurisy. Unable to work, she wrote her first book, Field Hospital and Flying Column, which described the previous few months of her life. This book ran to a second edition in London and New York and was translated into French.Violetta Thurstan, Aventures d'une infirmière anglaise en Belgique et sur le front russe (Traduction et avant-propos de Michel Epuy), Payot 1915 During her convalescence in England Thurstan gave lectures in various cities about her experiences. In her book she argued that properly trained nurses were essential for nursing work and pressed the case for state registration of qualified nurses. For some years she was organising secretary for the National Union of Trained Nurses (NUTN). By the end of 1915 she was back in Russia as a representative of the NUTN offering support for refugees on the Eastern front. This was described in The People who Run: the Tragedy of the Refugees in Russia: a \\"vivid account\\" of the situation for about five million \\"haggard\\" people, by Thurstan's estimate.Mrs (Rosa) Stephen Graham, 'Refugees in Russia', The Times Literary Supplement, 29 June 1916, p. 303 Late in 1916 she was made matron of a hospital in De Panne, close to the Belgian front line, and shortly after that was posted even nearer the front to manage a dressing station in Koksijde. Her efforts in evacuating wounded soldiers from Koksijde under fire earned her the Military Medal.London Gazette, 19 Nov 1917, p. 11961 She also received the Russian Cross of St George (4th class), the Belgian Queen Elisabeth Medal,British Journal of Nursing, 6 October 1917, p. 225 the Serbian Order of St Sava, the 1914 Star'Somerset Weaving Expert', Bath Chronicle and Herald, 16 June 1934 p. 14 and other awards. The evacuation left her with delayed concussion and she needed another period of convalescence in the UK. She published A text book of war nursing in 1917. Her last posting of the war was as matron to Ostrovo field hospital in Macedonia near the Salonika front. Malaria put an end to her time there. On recovery she was appointed to the Women's Royal Air Force as an administrator serving until September 1919. In 1978, she wrote another book about this period of her life, The Hounds of War Unleashed, which does not match all the details of Field Hospital, and may contain fictional elements. One academic suggests that her wartime books are influenced by her \\"romantic vision\\" of life. It has also been said that some information about Thurstan's earlier life is unclear and confusing.

Around 1923 she was appointed Director of Bedouin Industries'Miss Violetta Thurstan', The Times (obituaries), 17 April 1978, p. 18 in the refugee camps in the Libyan desert, under the Egyptian Frontier Districts Administration run by the British. Here she oversaw Bedouin women making carpets. She was responsible for purchasing supplies and on one of her trips to buy wool she was, according to a newspaper report, the first European woman to spend the night ashore in a Red Sea port. The same newspaper said no European woman had ever been as far into the desert as she had. She had many opportunities to travel in the region, and across Europe when going home on leave. During this time she was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was later made an honorary fellow. She wrote on dyes for the Egyptian Horticultural Review and in 1930 published Use of Vegetable Dyes for Beginners, which sold well in four editions, and is still a well-regarded text. She was back in the UK when her A Short History of Decorative Textiles and Tapestries came out in 1934, as well as Weaving Patterns of Yesterday & Today, also in the 1930s. These were followed in 1956 by Weaving Without Tears. A silk cot cover which Thurstan designed and wove in 1935 is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Spanish Civil War and Second World War  In 1937 she went to help in the Spanish Civil War, as part of Sir George Young's Universities Ambulance Service,'Miss Violetta Thurstan's Return', Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, 5 June 1937, p. 5 and worked to have prisoners in Almería released. When the Second World War came she was commissioned in the Women's Royal Naval Service after claiming to be less than fifty years old. Her language skills were deployed in Naval Intelligence, where she boarded ships in searches for contraband. Afterwards she took part in the 1945 post-war Catholic Relief Programme. (She had converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism not long after the First World War.) She worked with displaced people and prisoners of war in Italy, Egypt and Austria, and helped evacuate and resettle children. She then did similar work with the Allied Commission in Austria in 1946–1948. She was made a companion of the Vatican by Pope Pius XII.  Later life  In her seventies she went to live in Cornwall where she wove, taught crafts and wrote. She published two novels: the first of them a biographical novel, Stormy Petrel, in 1964 and The Foolish Virgin, inspired by her post-war aid work, in 1966. Thurstan went on travelling, leading a pilgrimage of Cornish women to Rome in 1958, and going to Greece in 1966 as a crafts adviser. She continued to be involved in textile arts within the UK and attended a World Crafts Council meeting in London in 1967. She also advised on a dye garden at Probus Gardens in Truro in 1976. In 1973 she was involved in setting up the Cornwall Crafts Association and at the age of 94 she was made a Fellow of the Society of Designer Craftsmen. She died at home in Penryn on 13 April 1978 at the age of 99.

In Nazi Germany it was used as a camp for educating teachers. After 1945 it became a temporary hospital and eventually a place for \\"maladjusted children\\" during the GDR regime - it is now a youth village. The surrounding district of Groß Köris is called Rankenheim. History Friedrich Wilhelm Ranke was a Prussian councillor, brother of the historian Leopold von Ranke. Since 1843 he bought in Groß Köris and neighbouring communities land where he built a brick factory and a bakery et al. and cut peat. In 1865 he built on a parcel of 15 hectare on the banks of Zemminsee a mansion, stables and outbuildings.Markus Vette: Wilhelm Ranke, 2014, pp 62. After Ranke's death on 16 June 1871, the property was transferred to a community of heirs, who sold it. After several changes of ownership of Rankenheim fell to Dresdner Bank. Rankenheim on a map from Brockhaus, 1894 Third Reich era Dresdner Bank transferred Rankenheim 1935 to the \\"Jubilee Foundation for Education\\" which repurposed Rankenheim as a training camp for the \\"Central Institute of Education\\". Initially, the Institute carried out so- called 'National Political Courses' for students, as they were carried out in many places in Germany in camp school for indoctrination and disciplining of youth. Everyday life in the camps \\"was strictly regulated and followed - as with all forms of Nazi camp education. A detailed service plan in which military training and ideological indoctrination played a prominent role.\\"„Camp and column are building the new reform of education“ - Nationalpolitische Lehrgänge. The same time Rankenheim served as a \\"Reichs seat for teacher instruction\\" of the Central Institute, that conducted teacher training camps on behalf of the Nazi Ministry of Education. The first of these camps took place in October 1935 under the direction of Hans Reinerth and Alfred Pudelko.Deutsche Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung - 1.1935, S. 160 f . In other camps, among others Rudolf Benze and Bernhard Kummer contributed their racist ideas, but also well known lecturers like the Indo- Germanist Kurt Stegmann of Pritzwald gave lectures here.Anastasia Antipova, Gerd Simon: Chronologie Stegmann, Kurt (von Pritzwald), 2011 In the beginning these camps were also held in the Western German Essen-Kettwig. When Germany started the war Rankenheim became the only place for teacher camps. The aim of these camps was to retrain all teachers to the National Socialist education ideology and to reorganize of the school system. 80-100 teachers from all over Germany were trained in several days (usually eight days) events with appeals, fatigue duty, sport, marches (or excursions) and (relatively short) lectures. Topics were such as \\"military training in math and science classes\\" whose goal was summarized as follows: \\"It is always important to focus the students - according to their age and their kind - on the important things for the life and the self-assertion of the German people in his small lebensraum and thereby evoke their joyful willingness to full commitment to the maintenance of German soil and life.\\"Kupsch: Bericht über den Lehrgang \\"Wehrerziehung im mathem. und naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht\\" in der Schulungsstätte Rankenheim des Zentralinstituts für Erziehung und Unterricht, Berlin.

From autumn 1941 the Prague branch of the Central Institute organized the retraining of Czech teachers who were also (with a higher proportion of ethnic-racist lectures) performed in teacher camps in Rankenheim. Due to the war in August 1943, the library and the archives of the Central Institute were moved to Rankenheim, this included the entire stock of the orthopaedagogy archive Berlin. From February 13, 1945 Rankenheim was officially the \\"main office\\" of the Central Institute, even if the operation was practically deadlocked and was passed from the apartment of Rudolf Benze in Potsdam.Andreas Kraas: Lehrerlager 1932–1945. Politische Funktion und pädagogische Gestaltung., S. 199. In these training camps a very large number of teachers were indoctrinated: until 1941 10.000 teachers had been retrained in over 150 camps.Andreas Kraas: Lehrerlager 1932–1945. Politische Funktion und pädagogische Gestaltung., S. 219. At the end of war Rankenheim was temporary a hospital. After the liberation from National Socialist dictatorship an orphanage was established in 1945; Rankenheim been operated since 1947 by the government as the state protectory with 100 beds. The documents of the Central Institute were evacuated and mostly burned. GDR- Era From 1952 \\"maladjusted\\" boys were housed in Rankenheim. The characterization of the home was transformed in the following period in the documents several times of \\"special home\\", \\"auxiliary boarding school\\" and \\"home for maladjusted, formable moronic children\\". The capacity was 75 places, the competent institution was the administrative district Königs Wusterhausen. In November 1965, Rankenheim was incorporated in the \\"Kombinat der Sonderheime für Psychodiagnostik und pädagogisch-psychologische Therapie\\" (combine of the special homes for psychodiagnostics and pedagogical-psychological therapy) as a special home for \\"maladjusted\\" \\"auxiliary pupils\\" or those with or with a \\"behavioural disorder\\". There were housed up to 72 boys aged 7 to 15 years old in six groups, each group corresponded to a school class. The schooling took place in the group rooms. 1979 a school was also built with a gymnasium in Rankenheim. Important therapeutic agent was focused on the milieu: \\"the influence of external circumstances at the home and the daily routine of the children in care\\".Reappraisal of residential education in GDR-expertises, 2012, S. 336. In 1988 the Combine was transformed in the \\"Pedagogical Medical Centre\\" (PMZ). Rankenheim became an institution of the Bezirk Potsdam. Die Wende After the end of GDR Rankenheim was subordinated to the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport Brandenburg as well as the other former facilities of the Combine. The Ministry reinstated 1992 the \\"Foundation Great Orphanage Potsdam\\", with the task of reorganizing the sponsorship for these facilities. For this purpose, the Foundation in 1994 founded the \\"GFB-gemeinnützige Gesellschaft zur Förderung Brandenburger Kinder und Jugendlicher mbH\\" (Charitable Society for the Promotion of Children and Adolescents in Brandenburg Ltd.), which took over the sponsorship of eight institutions including Rankenheim. Rankenheim was rebuilt and conceptually reorganized and persists as a children and youth village under the law of German child and youth services. Today besides of 33 home places in Rankenheim there is an office of the foster children service and a public school. References * Andreas Kraas: Lehrerlager 1932–1945.

The 1594 trial of alleged witch Allison Balfour is one of the most frequently cited Scottish witchcraft cases. Balfour lived in the Orkney Islands of Scotland in the area of Stenness. At that time in Scotland, the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563 had made a conviction for witchcraft punishable by death. Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, known as Black Patie, had control of Orkney in 1594 at the time of Balfour's trial. Patie was convinced that his younger brothers, especially John Stewart, Earl of Carrick, were plotting to kill him. Patie discovered poison in the possession of one of John's servants, Thomas Paplay, who after being tortured for eleven days confessed and implicated Balfour among his co-conspirators. Although Paplay retracted his confession just before his execution, Balfour and her family were transported to Kirkwall, where they were tortured until a confession was extracted. Balfour was tried, found guilty of witchcraft, and sentenced to death. Just as Paplay had done, Balfour retracted her confession immediately before her execution on 16 December 1594, publicly proclaiming her innocence and detailing the tortures carried out on her and members of her family. She was executed at Gallow Ha' in Kirkwall on 16 December 1594. Background The islanders of Orkney had a long tradition of belief in forms of witchcraft, sorcery and supernatural creatures. Magical powers were accepted as part of life and were not questioned. Witch hunts in Scotland began in about 1550; the parliament of Mary, Queen of Scots passed the Scottish Witchcraft Act in 1563, making witchcraft convictions subject to capital punishment. Although the Orkney archipelago was officially under Norwegian law until 1611, it had been held by Scotland from 1468 under the rule of Scottish earls. Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, known as Black Patie, had control of the islands in 1594 at the time of the first witch trials. The Stewart family had a lot of ill- feeling towards each other: Patie had an acrimonious relationship with his father and showed a particular animosity towards his younger brothers, especially John Stewart, Earl of Carrick, whom Patie was convinced intended to have him murdered. He had found Thomas Paplay, John's servant, with poison. Paplay was tortured for eleven days until he confessed, naming Allison Balfour among the conspirators. He retracted his confession just before his execution. Only sparse information is available on witch trials in Orkney before 1612, but details of Balfour's conviction have been described by Julian Goodare as \\"one of Scotland's most frequently-cited witchcraft cases.\\" Balfour lived in an area of Stenness known as Ireland, with her aged spouse Taillifeir and her children. A natural healer of some repute, she had been asked for advice on how best to cast a spell on Black Patie by his brothers and their friends, who were plotting to kill him. The first of several alleged consultations took place in October 1593, the outcomes of which are unknown but Black Patie suffered no apparent ill-effects. Nevertheless, Balfour was arrested and transported to Kirkwall to be tried in December 1594. The case was unusual as it was instigated purely on the authority of Patie, whereas most Scottish witch trials required a commission of justiciary. Most witch trials were held in St Magnus Cathedral, where prisoners may also have been incarcerated, but Balfour was held in Kirkwall Castle. The Orcadian historian Ernest Marwick speculates that torture may have taken place in the cathedral. Balfour was interrogated for two days by Henry Colville of Orphir, a minister and close friend of Patie. Torture Henry Colville attempted to gain sufficient evidence from Balfour to enable Patie to take action against his brother, John Stewart. She was subjected to brutal torture for a period of forty-eight hours with Colville assuming the roles of \\"interrogator and spiritual comforter\\". Her legs were enclosed in a contraption called caschielawes, a device made of iron that could be heated by a furnace until the victim's flesh started to burn. When she lost consciousness, as she did several times, the device was removed until she could be roused and the torture resumed. As Balfour continued to protest her innocence, Colville turned his attention to her husband, her son, and her seven-year-old daughter. Taillifeir, her husband, was tortured in front of her by the use of lang irons although it is unclear exactly what type of device this was. Marwick describes them as being fetters but historian Sigurd Towrie characterises them as a method of pressing by placing of stones on the victims body. When Balfour still would not confess she was forced to watch her son having his legs put into an iron boot. The device, which stretched from his knee to his ankle, was struck fifty-seven times with a large hammer. The boots inflict severe crushing and mutilation to the flesh and bones. Balfour reached her breaking-point when Colville tortured her daughter. He placed the young girl's hands in thumbscrews, also called pinniewinkles, pulverising the child's fingers. Colville assured Balfour that she would not be executed if she confessed. She relented and finally Colville secured enough of an admission of guilt for the court to be able to sentence her. Execution and aftermath Despite Colville's pledge, Balfour was found guilty of conspiring to murder by the use of witchcraft and was sentenced to be strangled and burned. On 16 December 1594 Balfour was taken to Gallow Ha' in Kirkwall to be executed. Before the strangulation she was required to make a declaration in front of the gathered crowd and five ministers, including Colville, for the notary public; instead she proclaimed her innocence and detailed the tortures carried out against her and her family. Immediately prior to Balfour's sentence being enacted, attempts were made to have her implicate the Laird of Stenhouse, Patrick Bellenden, in the conspiracy by questioning her about a piece of wax he had given her. It had been retrieved from her purse when she was arrested and her inquisitors considered it was to make an effigy. She denied their claims, stating it was to produce a treatment for Lady Bellenden's colic. The long-standing acrimony between Patie and his brothers continued unabated; on 24 June 1596 John Stewart, Earl of Carrick was accused at the justiciary court in Edinburgh of scheming with Balfour to poison his brother, Patie. John Stewart defended himself by asserting that the confession should be ignored, as it was retracted and had only been obtained under torture. He was found not guilty. Colville had continued to support Patie, and during 1595 was appointed Patie's depute. Three weeks after John Stewart's acquittal, Colville was attending to business on Patie's behalf at Nesting in Shetland. Stewart, together with a group of his friends who for a variety of reasons also despised Colville, sailed from Montrose to Shetland, replenishing supplies en route at Orkney. They landed in Shetland at Tingwall and made their way overland to where Colville was staying. It is uncertain which member of the group \\"maist schamefullie, crewallie and unmercifullie slew him\\" in July 1596, but on 14 October that year Stewart was tried for the murder and once again acquitted. William Stewart and Gilbert Pacock, one of John Stewart's employees, had in the interim been beheaded for the crime.

It occurs when the immigration officer conducting the adjustment of status interview suspects that a couple's marital status is fraudulent. The Stokes interview is offered as a second chance for the couple to prove their marriage's legitimacy. What separates the Stokes interview from the initial adjustment of status interview, which is usually the only interview necessary in the process, is that during the Stokes interview couples are interviewed separately instead of together. The two interviews are recorded and compared for discrepancies. Applicants have a right to have an attorney present throughout both separate interviews. The Stokes interview is also sometimes known as a marriage fraud interview. Origin The Stokes interview originated from the Federal District court case of Stokes vs. the INS in 1975. Two U.S. citizens, Charles Cook and Bernard Stokes, who married citizens of Guyana filed a suit challenging the INS procedure for determining whether to grant preferential status on the ground that the two non-citizens were \\"immediate relative\\" of U.S. citizens. The couples had been married in civil ceremonies, each man filed a Form I-130 petition for their wives listing them as \\"immediate relative\\". The result of this case was that when an immigration officer questions the legitimacy of a couple's marital status they may conduct a secondary interview for investigation. The applicant must be provided a written notice describing the rights of the parties involved. A second attachment of the rights must be provided with the appointment letter, as well as a list of the documents required to be submitted at the time of the interview. Stokes interviews were originally conducted by the Immigration & Naturalization Service (INS) until it was disbanded in 2003. Its responsibilities were assumed by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), responsibilities including, Permanent Residence or green cards, the processing of Form I-130s, Adjustment of status and Stokes interviews as well as many others. Required documents The documents an applicant must provide at a Stokes interview are as follows: * Photo identification of the citizen spouse * Proof of the petitioner's citizenship * Immigrant spouse's passport * Marriage certificate * Employment letters and the last two pay stubs * Bank account information * Rent receipts * Tax returns * Insurance policies * Utility bills * Photo albums Many other documents may be requested by the immigration officer depending on the particular circumstances of the case. Process During a Stokes interview a couple will be interviewed both together and separately. The process often takes several hours to complete. Each member of the couple will be asked many personal and intrusive questions about themselves and their spouse. The spouse will be asked the same questions separately. The two interviews will be recorded and compared for discrepancies. The couple may be allowed a chance to explain discrepancies should they occur. It is recommended that applicants answer the questions as honestly and truthfully as possible. If an applicant does not know the answer to a question or has forgotten, it is recommended that they say \\"I don't know\\" or \\"I don't remember\\" rather than attempting to make something up. It is important to keep in mind that very few couples seeking the citizenship or status adjustment of a partner undergo the Stokes interview. Most couples applying for citizenship will only undergo the Adjustment of Status interview after filing their form Form I-130 petition.

McCord, the daughter of Langdon Cheves, was born in 1810, in South Carolina. She was educated in Philadelphia. In 1840, she married David James McCord, becoming a widow in 1855. She mainly resided in Columbia, South Carolina. She was active as an author from the 1840s onward, and her production is regarded as an important contribution of Southern Antebellum literature. McCord's writings consisted principally of essays and reviews, and she wrote well on the subject of political economy. Her published volumes included, My Dreams, a volume of poems, published in Philadelphia in 1848; Sophisms of the Protective Policy. A translation from the French of Bastiat, published in New York. 1848; Caius Gracchus. A five-act tragedy, published in New York, 1851. McCord was a contributor to the \\"Southern Quarterly Review,\\" and the \\"Southern Literary Messenger,\\" for a number of years from 1849. Her poetry was simple and clearly uttered. Henry Timrod, Paul Hamilton Hayne, William Gilmore Simms, William Henry Trescot, Requier and James Matthews Legaré were her contemporaries; some of these were among her personal friends. Early years and education Louisa Susannah Cheves was born December 3, 1810, in Charleston to Langdon Cheves and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Dulles. Her paternal grandfather, Alexander Cheves, came from Aberdeen, Scotland, to the U.S. in the latter half of the 18th century. He married Mary Langdon, a daughter of Dr. Thomas Langdon, of Virginia. They settled in the frontier country of South Carolina in what was later Abbeville County. Here, during a Native American raid on September 17, 1776, in a block house where the people had taken refuge from the Native Americans, Langdon Cheves was born, the father of Louisa McCord. Her maternal grandfather, Joseph Dulles, a native of Dublin, came to the U.S. during the same period in which Alexander Cheves had come. He married Sophia, the daughter of Colonel William Heatley, of St. Matthew's parish, South Carolina, and his wife, Maria Louisa Courtonne, the daughter of a Huguenot pastor. Their daughter, Mary Elizabeth, became the wife of Langdon Cheves. Of this union, Louisa was the first-born. The early years of Louisa Cheves' life were closely influenced by her father's interests and surroundings. In October, 1810 (the year of her birth), Langdon Cheves was elected from the Charleston Congressional District to Congress, where he took his seat in session with Lowndes, Williams and Calhoun, forming an integral factor of that group of Southern statesmen whose opinions express a distinct school of political purpose and constitutional interpretation in U.S. history. In 1814, Clay was appointed on the Ghent Commission, and in the vacancy created by his absence, Cheves was made Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. This position he held until 1816. From 1816 to 1819, he was Judge of the South Carolina Circuit Court. During these years, Louisa was a little child. When she was nine years old, Langdon Cheves was called to adjust the financial difficulties of the United States Bank at Philadelphia. At this time, his two daughters, Louisa and Sophia, the latter of whom became Mrs. Charles Thompson Haskell, were sent to the school of a Mr. Grimshaw, an Irishman then living in Philadelphia. Later the sisters were placed under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Picot, French refugees, with whom they continued to study for several years, becoming thoroughly conversant with the French language. Subsequently, the girls were introduced to Washington and Philadelphia society. It had not been her father's intention to educate his daughters in any other way than that usually given women in that day—a lighter academic course, with a \\"finishing school\\" for French, astronomy, and so forth. The graces of education were stressed rather than fundamentals. But Louisa early developed a passion for mathematics, and stated that a girl with such a love of knowledge should have every opportunity to perfect herself not only in mathematics, but also in other branches not then usually undertaken by women. She was then given just the same mathematical instruction that her brothers received. In this her education was unusual. In her father's study and at his table she met and heard the discourse of men whose speech has expressed national policies, whose style both in written and in spoken English is classic. Her father's contemporaries were Webster, Calhoun, Clay and their associates. Political economy was the gospel of their theories. The young girl, hearing them express their theories, learned to think deeply on political issues. The father's secession theory influenced Louisa and largely determined her mature writing. During a part of this period, the Cheves family lived in \\"Abbeville,\\" outside of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After a residence here of about eight years, the family then retired to South Carolina. Lang Syne plantation When still a young woman, she came into the possession of Lang Syne Plantation, formerly belonging to a great-aunt, Mrs. Lovell, a daughter of Colonel William Heatley. \\"Lang Syne\\" was in St. Matthew's parish, on the Congaree River near Fort Motte, South Carolina, about from Columbia. This she administered during her young womanhood with a high degree of skill, executive ability, and a careful attention to details. In May 1840, she married the lawyer, David James McCord (d. 1855), of Columbia, South Carolina. He was a gentleman of considerable local distinction as a lawyer, public speaker, writer/editor of the \\"Statutes at large of South Carolina\\", and a frequent contributor to the Southern Quarterly Review. He was one of the best writers in the US on Free Trade. They lived happily for 15 years. McCord died in 1855. Writer =Poetry= My Dreams In the year 1848, McCord published her first book of poetry. My Dreams, a collection of fugitive poems, from the press of Carey & Hart, Philadelphia. A close study of these poems reveals a genuine poetic talent, but there is not the certainty of maturity, not the metrical perfection of first-rate poetry. The lyrist is an honestly doubting lyrist in many passages. There are a number of them that are either of adolescent composition, withheld until 1848 for publication, or at least of adolescent conception, possibly worked over for this volume. Hope is the keynote of a majority of the poems in this collection; but in many instances the hope is unaccompanied by any certainty of faith which a woman of McCord's full life and wide experience must have developed at the time this collection was published. A few of the poems are narrative myths, a direct reflection of her classic temperament. They suggest early Greek myths, and meet the reader with such titles as \\"The Daughters of Hope,\\" who are cleverly personified as Fancy and Happiness, and, Happiness being lost in Life's confusion, Fancy assists her mother, Hope, to chase Happiness through all time. Others included \\"The Falling Star,\\" \\"Love, Wisdom, Folly,\\" \\"The Comet,\\" \\"The Star That Followed Me,\\" \\"Conduct of the Sources of Good and Evil,\\" \\"The Home of Hope\\" and \\"The Voice of a Star.\\" Then there is a grouping possible among them of simple narratives of the world of concrete things. For example, the pathetic \\"Poor Nannie\\" and \\"The Blood Stained Rose,\\" \\"The Birth of the Evergreens\\" and \\"Pretty Fanny.\\" But it is in the third division of these poems that McCord's maturity expresses her feelings, and in the poems of this group that deal with the eternal riddle of life and death. They suggest the suffering spirit. \\"My Dream Child,\\" \\"The Village Churchyard,\\" \\"The First Beam of Light,\\" \\"My Dead,\\" \\"Ye're Born to Die\\" and others are found here. Probably the best among them is \\"The Voice of Years.\\" Caius Gracchus It was not until three years later, in 1851, that McCord essayed a longer poetic effort in Caius Gracchus, a tragedy in five acts. This showed a maturity and a greater care in preparation. The main source of the plot is the story of the Gracchi, which McCord follows rather closely. The play was probably never intended for the stage; it belongs to that class of classic closet dramas that were in vogue in the first half of the 19th century. The character interpretation is probably the strongest and most valuable work. Caius is heroic, and his girl wife is as winsome as a Roman girl could well be; the mob in its vacillations is accurately drawn, and Cornelia is a masterpiece. The probability is that the real Cornelia was a favorite heroine of McGord's. Their lives bear similarities in biography; they were called upon to make supreme sacrifices that were identical, and they endured with similar silent heroism. =Prose= From 1849, she was a contributor to The Southern Quarterly Review, The Southern Literary Messenger, and De Bow's Review. These essays were characterized, not only by sharp logic and scintillating wit, but by a spirit of earnest, conservation. Among the most prominent were \\" Justice and Fraternity,\\" \\"The Right to Labor,\\" \\"Diversity of the Races, its bearing upon Negro Slavery,\\" \\"Negro and White Slavery,\\" \\"Enfranchisement of Women,\\" \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" \\" Carey on the Slave-trade,\\" \\"Negro Mania,\\" \\"Woman and her Needs,\\" \\"British Philanthropy and American Slavery,\\" \\"Charity which does not Begin at Home,\\" and \\"A Letter to the Duchess of Sutherland from a Lady of South Carolina.\\" Davidson said that McCord was a contributor to the Southern Literary Messenger, to DeBow's Review, and to the Southern Quarterly Review. Examination of the complete files of the Southern Literary Messenger does not show her name; this is no negative proof, however. There are numerous anonymous articles, a few of which suggest McCord's style. A few poems are suspiciously like some selections found in \\"My Dreams,\\" but because there is no signature her authorship cannot be inferred. In the editorial reminiscences secured and edited by Benjamin Blake Minor, one-time editor of the Messenger, McCord's name is not mentioned. The same problem is faced in a review of De Bow's Review. Her signature cannot be found, nor is her name acknowledged by J. D. B. De Bow in his quarterly Table of Contents. However, the Table of Contents of DeBow's Review lists only the signed articles; there are numerous unsigned ones. So accepting the statements of Duyckinck and Davidson, who agree that McCord contributed to these magazines, the assumption is made that for these magazines, except the Southern Quarterly, she worked anonymously. Though it is regrettable, it is true to type. Women authors often disguised their names under masculine noms de plume. However, most of her contributions to the Southern Quarterly Review were signed, and were easily available. It was as a political essayist, however, that McCord was most known. She published numerous essays in Southern papers, normally within political issues. Her views were conservative, Southern, pro-slavery, idealizing Southern society. She was one of the few women who wrote on the subject of political economy. In 1848, George P. Putnam, of New York, published her Translation of Bastiat's Sophisms of the Protective Policy, with an introductory letter by Dr. Francis Lieber, professor of political philosophy and economy in South Carolina College. Her contributions on this subject to the Southern Quarterly Review were characterized by vigour and an enlarged acquaintance with the subject. Among them may be named particularly \\"Justice and Fraternity,\\" July, 1849; \\"The Right to Labour,\\" Oct., 1849; \\"Diversity of Races, its Bearing upon Negro Slavery,\\" April, 1851. =Literary work= McCord's literary work set forth the political doctrines of lassez faire and self-determination. Her interest in political and sociological questions was broad. She knew past history, was attuned to current events, and she perceived the tendencies of humanity. She was, above all else, the votary of political economy. Her style was polemical, at times satirical, always coherent and clear. She was virile, intense, at once possessing the force of a statesman's thinking together with the versatility of wit. As pure literature, these magazine articles did not have a place. As attainments of what they set out to do, they were successful. In every instance, she was on familiar ground; she knew more of the subject than she expressed. She expressed the convictions and reasonings of then-contemporary thinkers of her section ably. The writers who cut the fresh pages of the Southern Quarterly Review at that time read with relish the convincing and cleverly-arranged arguments in support of their position as expressed by McCord's writings. Witticisms were found in McCord's writings; not airy wit, as might be expected from her French training, but Horatian satire. This was also her conversational style. McCord was a conservative. She advocated State sovereignty, favoring secession, and a political confederation founded upon a community of interests. Her vision was of a great Southern confederacy in which the culture of classical learning would continue to flourish, in which an economic independence would be maintained through the cotton industry, in which the Afro-American would be most comfortable and happy in a state of slavery, and in which the white master, with his labor question settled, would be furnished the leisure requisite for the pursuit of science and art. Activist =Women's suffrage= Another popular topic of her day on which McCord commented was the question of woman suffrage. The Westminster Review for July, 1851, had contained some equal suffrage articles. The third session of the Women's Rights Convention had been held at Worcester, Massachusetts, on October 15, 1851. McCord's essay was based largely on the Westminster Review article and on the proceedings of the convention. She said that public service in affairs of state is by its nature masculine, and that the men of the race are naturally and harmoniously at home in the discharge of this service; \\"That woman is neither man's superior, equal, nor inferior; she is his different\\". She went on to say, \\"Woman will reach the greatest height of which she is capable —the greatest, perhaps, of which humanity is capable— not by becoming man, but by becoming more than ever woman.\\" These phrases were the expression of the conviction of the old South. In discussing the Woman's Rights movement, she replied to a proposition of an English review, that \\"a reason must be given why anything should be permitted to one person and interdicted to another.\\" \\"A reason —a reason why man cannot drink fire and breathe water! A scientific answer about hydrogen and oxygen will not answer the purpose. These are facts, not reasons. Why? Why? Why is anything on God's earth what it is? Can Miss Martineau tell? We cannot. God has made it so, and reason, instinct and experience teach us its uses. Woman, Nature teaches you yours.\\" =Service to the Confederacy= Front elevation of the McCord House, built 1849 Early in the summer of 1861 the Soldiers' Relief Association was organized, with McCord as president. In July 1861, she was made president of the Ladies' Clothing Association. The first-named organization made the uniforms for the company of her son, Captain L. Cheves McCord, his mother furnishing the material. She resigned her presidency of the Soldiers' Relief Association in order to give her whole time to the military hospital established within the South Carolina College; this was in 1862, and here she gave her greatest service. In her home, at the northwest corner of Pendleton and Bull streets, across the street from the college property, she received supplies from the women of the city -— supplies available for nourishment for the sick, and hospital comfort. Early every day, there was made in her kitchen a supply of corn bread and broth, heaped into plates and left on a long dresser on her back piazza, served day after day as the nourishment for wounded soldiers who could drag themselves across the street from the convalescent building on the campus. All her carpets were cut into blankets. All wool mattresses were ripped up and their contents spun into yarn for soldiers' socks. Even the hair of rabbits killed on the plantation was saved, and, when combined with a little wool and the ravelings of old black silk scraps, made a gray yarn, of which officers' gloves were knitted. All of the lead from her houses —even the lead pipes from an elaborate system of waterworks on her plantation— was sent to be melted into bullets. Before the end of the war, all her horses had gone into the army. In the midst of all this activity there came from second Manassas the news that her son, Cheves McCord, had died. On the morning of February 17, 1865, McCord was warned about the invasion of her city. During the occupation of the city by Sherman, McCord remained in her own home, though the house, such part as was not reserved for her use, was occupied by General Howard and his staff as headquarters. When General Howard left, a guard was set before the premises \\"to protect it,\\" which guard promptly set work to pillage the house, though a young officer gave some protection. Her two daughters had been sent to the hospital by her previous to Sherman's entrance to the town in the hope of greater protection for them under the hospital's flag during the turmoil. McCord lived long enough to see reconstruction. However, when, in 1869, the suggestion was made that a monument be erected to the Confederate soldier, it was to McCord that the women of the State at once turned for leadership. She was made the first president of the association, and in this capacity, she organized the first efforts of Columbia women to perpetuate the memory of the Confederate soldier. Later years After the war, McCord left South Carolina for a time, went to Charlottesville, Virginia, and thence further to Canada —to Coburg and other points. But, finding that she could not remain away from South Carolina, she returned, and, though embittered by it, took the oath of allegiance that she might have the disposal of her own property. The latter years of McCord's life were spent in Charleston, in the home of her son-in-law, Major Augustine T. Smythe, and his wife, her daughter Louisa. McCord purchased the Rebecca Screven House in 1879. In the spring of 1879, the unveiling of the Confederate monument took place at Columbia, her little granddaughter, Cheves McCord, actively participating in the ceremony. On November 23, 1879, after a brief illness at her home in Charleston, she died and was buried in Magnolia Cemetery.
