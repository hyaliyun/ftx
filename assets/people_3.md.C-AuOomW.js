Wrockwardine is located approximately 7 miles from Wrockwardine Wood. Wrockwardine Wood is located in North East Telford in Shropshire and is bordered by Donnington, St Georges, Trench, The Nabb and Oakengates. The local government parish of Wrockwardine Wood and Trench comprises most of the Church of England parish of Wrockwardine Wood. 18th century industrial revolution Wrockwardine Wood was inhabited by coal and iron mine workers and their families. So many people had become Primitive Methodists that the Church of England set up a new parish in 1833 and built a very attractive red brick church (Holy Trinity). The 2 Methodist chapels recently closed, being replaced by Oakengates United Church (Methodist and United Reformed Church.) Wrockwardine Wood & Trench Parish Council has a Labour Party majority. The Snake \\"The Snake\\" is a small woodland area in Wrockwardine Wood. It was also known as the Cinder Hill for many years. It consists of one main lake and many small swamps along with a large field and many pathways connecting Wrockwardine Wood to Donnington. The route of the Donnington Canal ran through the southern section of the area, and there was also a Tin Chapel (the \\"dissident Methodist\\" Central Hall) that sat on top of one of the many \\"hills\\", but was dismantled during the 1980s. The area is commonly known as \\"The Snake\\" because of its winding paths which locals say reminded them of a snake. The surrounding woods and clearings landscaped by Wrekin Council are signposted as \\"The Central Hall\\". The area is used by many people, especially those travelling to and from schools and the supermarket in Donnington Wood on the site of a former pit mound known as the Nobby Bank. The hilly wooded Cockshutt is nearby. Wrekin Council preserved these old industrial places as countryside.

He first appeared during the first episode on 30 March 1997, and departed on 27 November 2003. Roy was the show's longest- running original character. Casting During his tenure at Family Affairs Petit shadowed directors in order to direct episodes while still appearing as Roy. Development In 2000, following his character mellowing, Petit told a Soaplife reporter that \\"I want [Roy] to become a really evil, murderous bastard who's completely lost his marbles - again.\\" Roy begins a relationship with Claire Toomey (Tina Hall) and she uses him for financial gain in their business. Roy begins to develop feelings for eighteen-year-old friend Sara Warrington (Beth Cordingly). Petit told Sally Brockway from Soaplife that he did not understand how Roy managed to resist Sara's continuous advances. Roy does not feel able to be with Sara due to their age difference. He believes her to be vulnerable and he thought himself a father figure. He offered her guidance and understanding over their shared pasts of drug addiction. Petit added \\"Sara's still very immature and has never had a proper relationship. Roy sees her feeling for him as some schoolgirl crush and thinks he'd be taking advantage if he succumbed. He's been very strong because he's smitten with her. Meanwhile Claire does not want Sara around because she is aware of Roy's feelings before he knew himself. Petit believed that Roy cares about Claire but cannot continue a relationship when he loves Sara. He added \\"he was never in love with Claire, I think it was just a convenience thing. It certainly helped him get over Maria, anyway.\\" Storylines Initially a close friend of Duncan Hart, Roy soon fell into the clutches of villain Pete Callan who set him up dealing in drugs. Roy soon became addicted to the drugs he was selling, before kicking the habit and dissolving his association with Pete who he now hated. He later started romancing Duncan's sister Melanie Hart, but was disapproved-of due to his drug-dealing history and former association with the hated Pete. In an attempt to break-up the relationship, Melanie's sister Holly Hart planted drugs in Roy's jacket and informed the police. Roy was charged with drug possession. After being made homeless and living rough he got his life in order again, eventually becoming engaged to Melanie. However tragedy struck hours after their wedding in January 1999 when Melanie and her entire family were killed in a gas explosion that tore through the boat on which the wedding reception was being held. Roy, who had earlier disembarked the boat to get a hangover cure for Jamie Hart, was the only member of the wedding party to have survived the blast. He became mentally unbalanced after this loss; adopting army dress, killing and adopting a pigeon he named \\"Pete,\\" shaved his head and later kidnapped and attempted to murder Claire Toomey which he should have been arrested and spent time in prison for. He eventually got his life in order again and started a romance with Maria Simons. He later opened an internet cafe business on Stanley Street in Charnham, and started a new romance with Nikki Warrington after her engagement ended. They were later married, and had a child. Ironically, Roy himself died in a fire whilst trying to rescue Nikki; a fire caused by an arson attack which destroyed his internet cafe business in 2003. At the time he left the series he was the second to last remaining original cast member. At that time he was the only character in the series to have appeared continuously since its debut. The other original character at that time, Claire Toomey (Tina Hall), had taken a long break from the series. Reception A Soaplife reporter described him as a quiet businessman with a coloured history.

History Andacollo is a copper and gold mining city located in the mountains of the Small North (El Norte Chico) in Chile. It was founded in 1891. Several legends are told about the name of the city. Some say that it comes from the Quechua Anta-Goya which means cobre-reina (copper queen). Others say that the name means \\"Hurry up, Collo\\" (Anda, Collo). According to these legends, La Virgen del Rosario, also known as la Virgen Morena, or Black Madonna, appeared to an indigenous miner called \\"Collo\\" in the form of a small wooden statuette hidden in rocks. The statue told the newly converted Collo to build up a church at the place where Andacollo is located today. As many miracles are attributed to the Dark Lady (like stopping the smallpox epidemic of 1871) the city celebrates the Virgin every year on December 24 to 26. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Andacollo had 10,288 inhabitants (5,148 men and 5,140 women). Of these, 9,444 (91.8%) lived in urban areas and 844 (8.2%) in rural areas. The population fell by 16% (1,958 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

It is found in Sri Lanka and India. Description upright The dark wanderer resembles Pareronia valeria in colour and in the disposition of the markings, but differs as follows: Male upperside: ground colour a deeper blue. Forewing: the terminal black border much broader generally, entirely without the transverse sub-terminal series of bluish-white spots; in a few specimens there are one or two of these spots present, but nothing like the series so conspicuous in P. valeria hippia. Hindwing: the terminal black border very broad, narrowing slightly but distinctly towards the tornal angle. Proportionately this border is even broader than in the forewing. Underside: as in P. valeria. The female closely resembles the female of P. valeria, but on the upperside the outer black margins beyond the discal markings on both forewings and hindwings are proportionately much broader, the transverse subterminal series of spots that crosses the wing is further from the terminal edge. On the underside the terminal black borders are broader and darker, the subterminal series of spots on apex of the forewing and on the hindwing absent or so very thickly overlaid with the dusky brownish black of the terminal margin as to be very indistinct and blurred. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen in both sexes much as in P. valeria hippia. Range This species lives in southern India, the Western Ghats, the southern Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka. Larva \\"Long, cylindrical or slightly depressed and tapering slightly from the head, which is large, to the tail which ends in two short strong spines clothed with bristles. The body is clothed with very minute hairs. Colour green, with a lateral row of conspicuous white spots from the 5th to the 12th segment and rows of smaller spots on the back. Food-plant, Capparis heyneana.\\" Pupa \\"Suspended by the tail and by a very long band ... thoracic portion bent back almost at right angles to the abdominal; head produced into a very long sharp snout; wing-cases forming a keel nearly half an inch in depth, and so thin as to be almost transparent.

A well-known resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, it is located on a gore 52 km south of Burgas and has a beach strip of about 1 km¬≤. The average temperature is 29 ¬∞C in July, often reaching 30-33 ¬∞C and making Primorsko a favourable place for tourism. Sea temperature in July and August is 27-28 ¬∞C. Primorsko enjoys more than 2300 sunshine hours a year, mostly in summertime. The rivers Ropotamo and Dyavolska reka run close to the town. The Ropotamo nature reserve and Snake Island reserve are also nearby. Since 1998 it is the seat of Primorsko Municipality.  History  Remains of stone anchors from the second half of the 2nd millennium and the 1st millennium BC have been discovered in the waters around Primorsko, which can possibly be linked to Neolithic navigation. Remains of lead anchors from the 4th-5th century BC have also been found, as well as traces of Copper Age pottery and stone tools. Valchanovo kale, the ruins of a nearby medieval fortress, which inhabited from the Early Iron Age to the Late Middle Ages, are often linked with the fortress of Ranouli mentioned in the Hambarli inscription of Krum of Bulgaria. Medieval amphoras and pottery have been found in the mouth of the Ropotamo, and the ancient waystation and fortress of Gera is thought to have been located on Maslen nos. Ottoman documents of the 16th century mention a locality called Zonarita in the area. The eastern traveller Evliya √áelebi marks a cove by the name of K√ºpr√º liman at the place. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, there existed a pier used to transport Strandzha wood and charcoal to Constantinople and other major cities. The modern Primorsko was founded in 1879 as Kyupria by four families from Zabernovo and Balgari, (who had left their villages after the Berlin treaty left them in Turkey) who cleared the forest and built houses. In the vicinity were two abandoned Circassian villages; the Circassians had fled to Turkey fearing retribution for their atrocities in Bulgaria. Other Bulgarians from Central Strandzha came and briefly populated these villages, but then decided that Kyupriya's pier is a better source of income, and soon moved there despite the danger of malaria which Dyavolsko blato (Devil's Swamp) constituted. The town was renamed to Primorsko in 1934. Primorsko was declared a national sea resort in 1953. In 1981, it was merged with Kiten and became a town, and in 1998 it split from Tsarevo municipality by means of a local referendum. One of the smaller towns in Bulgaria by population, Primorsko has seen a remarkable increase of residents in recent years, topping the list of Bulgarian towns by population growth between December 2004 and June 2005 with 13.5%.  Transportation  The city has its own airport; its runway too short for airliners it has no scheduled service, serving only recreational and private aircraft.  Climate  Primorsko has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfa) bordering on a mediterranean climate with light continental influences.

Serving as the major east-west route in the city, it spans from the Bee Line Highway (SR 710) to Federal Highway (U.S. Route 1 or US 1) and SR A1A. Route description The western terminus is an intersection with Bee Line Highway (SR 710) near North Palm Beach County General Aviation Airport at the Palm Beach Gardens city limits. It begins as a two lane road through undeveloped sections of Palm Beach Gardens, with the first development on the road occurring after a canal crossing two miles from the western terminus and becomes a four lane road. The road then creates the border between two major golf country clubs, with the Country Club at Mirasol to the north and the Professional Golfers' Association of America's National Golf Club, where PGA Boulevard receives its name, to the south. Following the Avenue of Champions/Jog Road intersection, SR 786 reaches the intersection with Florida's Turnpike (SR 91), with an overpass with the toll road just east of it. To the east of the Turnpike, PGA Boulevard borders the Ballenisles Country Club to the south, and other residential communities to the north, and quickly transitions to a commercial road, with a shopping center on both sides of the road heading closer to Military Trail. After this interchange, PGA Boulevard moves to the northeast and quickly approaches the interchange with Interstate (I-95 or SR 9), an overpass with SR 811 and access via a side road. This overpass also crosses the Florida East Coast Railway, where Tri-Rail has proposed adding a station. Afterwards, the road heads straight east and forms the southern boundary of The Gardens Mall, with other shopping centers on the southern side of the road. At the southeast end of the mall, the southern side of PGA Blvd. forms the northern border of the Palm Beach State College Palm Beach Gardens campus until an intersection with Prosperity Farms Road. Afterwards, the road passes through a drawbridge over a canal before reaching the eastern terminus at the intersection with Federal Highway (US 1-SR 5) and SR A1A. East of US 1, PGA Boulevard becomes Ocean Boulevard and SR A1A, which continue along a barrier island of the Atlantic Ocean and pass through John D. MacArthur Beach State Park. History Most of the original alignment of the highway was known as \\"Monet Road\\" (named for a settlement located near the modern day intersection of RCA Boulevard and SR 811 in Palm Beach Gardens) and was a gravel road. The highway had received the \\"PGA Boulevard\\" name in 1965 six years after the incorporation of Palm Beach Gardens at the request of the city's founder John D. MacArthur. Following a realignment of SR 786 east of I-95, a portion of the old road was renamed \\"RCA Boulevard\\" due to the road serving a new RCA factory there. From 1973 until 1987, SR 786 served as the temporary northern terminus of I-95 in southeastern Florida, when a previously approved alignment in which I-95 would be cosigned with Florida's Turnpike for a stretch from PGA Boulevard northbound to SR 70 in Fort Pierce was rescinded in favor of a separate alignment for I-95\\"Squabbles unnecessary\\".

The anime is directed by Makoto Moriwaki (High School! Kimengumi The Movie) and produced by Hideyuki Kachi and Kazuya Watanabe. The series was written by Takashi Yamada (Yumeiro Patissiere) with character designs from Tomoko Miyakawa. It ran on TV Osaka and TV Tokyo from April 3, 2005 to March 26, 2006, spanning 52 episodes. Story =My Melody= A year after the events of Kirara, Kuromi and Baku are imprisoned in a dungeon in Mary Land. They make their escape with the Melody Key and the Melody Bow, but in their haste forget the instruction manuals. They flee to the human world and shortly after arriving, Kuromi discovers the power of the Melody Key, which makes wishes come true using the power of darkness. If the person who wishes enjoys the nightmare, he or she will produce Black Notes, which Baku promptly eats to store them. What neither one of them realize is that when 100 Black Notes are gathered, the Spirit of Dark Power will be revived to destroy the human world and devour all the humans' dreams. Because Mari Land is formed from the dreams of humans, even the incompetent King is able to sense danger to his people. He gives the Melody Tact to My Melody and sends her to the human world, with a mission to collect 100 Pink Notes to create the Dream Power to combat the Spirit of Dark Power. Along the way, My Melody meets a human girl named Uta Yumeno, and her world is about to change forever. =KuruKuru Shuffle= Set a year after Onegai My Melody, the story revolves around Kuromi and Baku's second escape to the Human World as they this time, obtained a new Melody Key and the Melody Pick, an item associated with the Spirit of Dark Power. Because of this, the King of Mary Land appointed My Melody once again to capture both fugitives and prevent the Spirit of Dark Power from resurrecting for the second time. In the human world, Uta misses My Melody and wonders what is she doing right now back at Mari Land. But then a new student named Jun Hiiragi who arrived from England into Uta's school and she notices he's Keiichi's little brother. Baku and Kuromi also arrived at the Human world also and learned that if they collected black notes that coincides with the Solf√®ge scale, their wishes will come true and decided to wreak havoc into the city once more. Back at Mari Land, Keiichi Hiiragi is being judged guilty on his crimes against Mary Land and to make up for it, he must help Uta and My Melody fight the darkness but in secret or he'll be severely punished. It's up to Uta and Melody to stop the Revival of the Spirit of Dark power once again, before it's too late. =Sukkiri= A year after the second defeat of the Spirit of Dark Power, My Melody and her friends went back to Mary Land until Baku \\"dropped a bomb\\" in the middle of the flower field, taking out black notes all over Mary Land and the human world. After a short while, Mary Land had their \\"High court\\" and took the King off the throne. When the time came to choose the next ruler of Mary Land, a black note came into the minister, turning him into a \\"Huff-Huff\\" which is left over residue of Dar- chan. My Melody refreshed him and was chosen to be a candidate for Princess. However, she has to pass a trial by turning all of the black notes into Twinkle Gems to put in her crown. As soon as Kuromi heard this, she was over raged because she wanted to become the Princess as well, but then a very Mysterious Woman gave her an intriguing offer. Kuromi now has to collect Anger Gems and put on her crown to become the Dark Princess and rule over Mary Land. The two decides to go the human world in their separate ways and collect every black note for them to become the next ruler of Mary Land. Not knowing to everyone...that the spirit again will make its rise as he intends to plunge both Earth and Mary Land into eternal darkness. =Kirara= Set before the events of the Uta Arc, Mary Land is celebrating a special event which involves watching the Shooting Star on which they can grant someone's wish. In the Human World, Kirara Hoshizuki, a normal elementary girl is watching the stars that night until she was visited by the King of Mary Land, and invites her to his world. As the king takes her to Mary Land, she meets My Melody for the first time and became friends as they both watched the shooting stars. But in an unexpected predicament, the Wishing Star crashed into Mary Land and broke into pieces. Even worse, the passageway that connects back to earth is damaged as well. During the disaster, My Melo and Kirara met Prince Sorara, the prince of the star who somewhat transformed into a giant chick after the Wishing Star is broken to a million pieces and both My Melo and Kirara needs to collect all the pieces of the Wishing Star, for both Sorara and Kirara to go back to their respective worlds. =High school= Set three years after the end of Sukkiri, Uta Yumeno, now a sophomore in High school, is living a good life in the human world with her family and friends. However, back in Mary Land, Kuromi steals a dark item called Dokurobou, which contains powerful dark magic that can plunge Mary Land into chaos and again escapes into the human world with the said item. As she reaches the human world, she meets with Uta and Kakeru Kogure once more and starts to cause trouble. Luckily, My Melody comes to the human world as well and now must prevent the dark magic inside the Dokurobou from unleashing into the human world. Characters Interestingly, the characters in Onegai My Melody were both characters from the original character series and characters created exclusively for the anime. The denizens of Mary Land were somewhat considered \\"Living Dolls\\", in reference to Maki's phobia of cute things. Some of the characters in the series were officially added to the Sanrio canon following the show's initial run. For instance, Kuromi, who appeared in the first season of Onegai My Melody, became an official character of the Sanrio parent franchise in 2005. Several cameo characters from other Sanrio franchise appears in the anime as well. Hello Kitty appears in the eye- catches of the first and second series while Berry and Cherry appeared as narrators for the fourth series. Music The music for all four seasons of the anime was composed by Cher Watanabe, whose other notable works include the soundtrack of the anime Maken-ki! and Jewelpet Kira‚òÜDeco!.

He was convicted by a jury in Manhattan federal court on December 14, 2004 on multiple cocaine importation charges. He is married and has one child. Background and Trial Herbert was arrested in Belize and extradited to the United States. The four-count indictment charged Herbert with conspiring with others to import tons of cocaine into the United States between March 2001 and August 2002, and with three separate instances of shipping cocaine from the waters off Belize to Mexico, with the intent or knowledge that the drugs would be transported to the United States. According to the evidence at trial, Herbert was enlisted in March 2001 by a corrupt Belizean government official working with the Mexican Juarez Cartel to assist in the smuggling of ton-quantities of cocaine from the Atlantic coast of Colombia to Calderitas, Mexico. Herbert, assisted by armed members of a Belize City street gang, the \\"George Street Crew,\\" received the one-ton-plus cocaine shipments in the waters off Belize from speedboats dispatched by high-level cocaine supplier Mauricio Ruda-Alvarez. Herbert and his associates then transported the shipments through the reefs and small islands off Belize to the port of Calderitas, Mexico. in Calderitas, Juarez Cartel operatives, assisted by corrupt Mexican police, took custody of the cocaine and shipped it to the US. Conviction On December 14, 2004, the jury found Herbert guilty on three counts of manufacturing or distributing of narcotics for illegal importation under 21 USC sections 959(a), 960(b)(1)(B)(ii), and 812 and 18 USC section 2, and one count of attempt or conspiracy to import or export narcotics.United States v. George Enrique Herbert, case no. 03-cr-00211-SHS, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The jury also found that Herbert used firearms in furtherance of the narcotics crimes, and that he managed and supervised other offenses. Each of the four counts of conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Jorge Manuel Torres Teyer and Victor Manuel Adan Carrasco, leaders of the Juarez Cartel in Belize and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, with whom Herbert conspired, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court in 2003, and were sentenced in May 2004. Mauricio Ruda-Alvarez, the Colombian cocaine supplier, was found murdered in the trunk of a car in Medell√≠n in October 2002. The evidence at trial established that two months prior, in August 2002, Ruda-Alvarez had commissioned a failed attempt to kidnap Herbert over a shipment of cocaine Herbert had stolen.United States Southern District of New York Press Release December 15, 2004 Herbert is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution Victorville, at Adelanto, California, and his projected date of release is June 1, 2032.Inmate # 52659-054, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep't of Justice, at .

This is a skillful metafictional literary pirouette that seems to give more credibility to the text, making believe that Don Quixote was a real person and the story is decades old. However, it's fairly obvious to the reader that such a thing is impossible, and that the pretense of Cide Hamete's work is meant as a joke. In the preface of Part One of the novel (published in 1605), Cervantes indicates that he is not the original author, but is simply passing on information that can be found in \\"the archives of La Mancha\\". At the end of Chapter VIII, Cervantes states that the information from the archives ends in a particularly exciting cliffhanger, and in Chapter IX, he describes finding an Arabic manuscript called \\"The History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cide Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\\" In Part Two (published in 1615), the young scholar Carrasco informs Don Quixote that the story of his adventures is well-known, thanks to the publication of his history by Cide Hamete. Cide Hamete is Moorish, although this adjective is not explicitly applied to him. Cervantes says that he is \\"Arabian and Manchegan\\": in other words, a Spanish Muslim Arab-speaker, and not a North African or an Ottoman. However, in Part Two, Chapter XLIV, Benengeli writes, \\"I, though a Moor...\\" Parody of chivalric romances Cervantes' use of the supposed translation of a true record of events is a parody of an element commonly found in the books of chivalry. For example, in the Cristali√°n de Espa√±a, author Beatriz Bernal claims that she found a book in an ancient tomb, and explains his decision to copy it. Another example can be seen in Florisando by P√°ez de Ribera, who claims to have translated a work of Greek origin from the Tuscan. These adventures are never presented as inventions of the authors themselves, thus giving them greater credibility. The tweaking of this narrative convention gave Cervantes the opportunity to make humorous, ironic comments, and even play several fictional games. Etymology Many speculations have been made about the meaning of Benengeli's name. The first element, \\"Cide,\\" as Don Quixote states, means \\"sir\\" in Arabic: it is a corruption of ÿ≥ŸäÿØ sƒ´d. \\"Hamete\\" is also the Castilian form of a proper name of Hispanic Muslim origin. However, scholars do not agree on its exact equivalent in Arabic, as it could correspond to three very similar names. The Egyptian Hispanist Abd al-Aziz al-Ahwani makes it equivalent to ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿØÿ© HamƒÅda; Abd al- Rahman Badawi opts for ÿ≠ŸÖŸäÿØ HƒÅmid, while Mahmud Ali Makki affirms that is ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ A·∏•mad, a more common name than the others. The meaning of \\"Benengeli\\" has made more ink flow. The first to propose an interpretation was the Arabist Jos√© Antonio Conde, who interpreted it as a Spanish version of ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸäŸÑ Ibn al- ayyil, \\"son of the deer\\". This was a subtle allusion to Cervantes' own surname, as the word for deer in Spanish is \\"ciervo\\". The scholars Diego Clemenc√≠n and Abd al-Rahman Badawi agreed. The orientalist Leopoldo Egu√≠laz y Yanguas relates Benengeli to berenjena (\\"brinjal, aubergine, eggplant\\"), a relation mentioned by Sancho Panza in the novel. The Cervantists Saadeddine Bencheneb and Charles Marcilly proposed as an etymology ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ¨ŸäŸÑ Ibn al- In≈∑ƒ´l, that is, \\"son of the Gospel.\\" This would be an ironic pun highlighting the difference between the supposedly Muslim author and the Christian character of the real author, himself. For the Hispanicist Mahmud Ali Makki, none of the previous interpretations has consistency and is inclined to assume that the name is simply an invention, although he points out that it may be inspired by the surname of a well-known Andalusian family originally from Denia, the Beni Burungal or Berenguel (ÿ®ŸÜŸä ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿ¨ŸÑ, last name of Catalan origin -Berenguer-, arabized and then again romanized as Berenguel). The possible puns referenced above would rely on Cervantes' knowledge of the Arabic language, which is a feasible presumption. Cervantes spent five years captive in Algiers, and he was allowed to move around the city and interact with its inhabitants. On the other hand, Am√©rico Castro was the first to point out its possible converse origin, a hypothesis that has been sustained to a greater or lesser degree by later authors. And La Mancha, finally, as well as a good part of the southern half of the Peninsula, was densely populated by Moriscos. In any case, the Arab and the Islamic were not alien to Cervantes.

Description Painted sawtooth mud-puddling. The species it mimics, the common Jezebel, is never found mud-puddling. Upperside: White with a slight greenish tint. Forewings and hindwings: The markings of the underside faintly visible through the wing. Underside: Forewing: White, costa black and the apex suffuse with yellow. Hindwing: Rich chrome yellow up to a postdiscal band. Beyond this the ground color is white with a series of large terminal vermillion-red spots. These spots are rectangular or truncated cone shaped. The antennae is brownish black. Head and thorax are covered with long bluish- grey hairs. The abdomen is greyish white. Mud-puddling in Someshwara Wingspan: 86‚Äì90 mm (3.40-3.55 in). Mimicry Underside hindwing difference between Delias eucharis and Prioneris sita The painted sawtooth is a Batesian mimic of Delias eucharis, the common Jezebel. The two can be told apart from the shape of the hindwing. The painted sawtooth has a much broader hindwing. The orange- red spots on the margin of the hindwing, in the painted sawtooth, are more squarish in shape whereas in the common Jezebel they are arrowhead shaped. The painted sawtooth also flies faster and inhabits dense forests. Unlike the common Jezebel it can also be found mud-puddling. Life cycle Larva: Dull blue green. The head and all the segments are dotted with minute blue tubercles, those on the head and sides are black tipped. Dorsal surface pubescent with a lateral fringe of soft white hairs below the spiracles. Pupa: Bright green in color. Sharply pointed at the head, with two strong lateral points and keeled on the dorsal surface of the thoracic segments. There is an interrupted yellow dorsal line, and a short curved crimson line on each side below the thoracic segments bordering a small white irregular black speckled spot.

The club, formerly known as St Patrick's Old Boys, currently field six teams in the second division of the NSW Suburban competition, known as \\"Subbies\\". St Pats was formed in 1964 and since their elevation to first division had not been relegated until 2017. The club was formed by ex-students of St Patrick's College, Strathfield but now has members from various backgrounds including a number of international players.  History  The club was founded in 1964, but initially played rugby league. After St Patrick's College changed to being a rugby union school in 1965, St Pats Rugby Club fielded an under 20s rugby union side in the Western Sydney Junior competition in 1966. The club had expanded to field three teams by 1969, with two sides playing in the NSW Subbies second division. John O‚ÄôRourke was the coach. Because Knox Rugby Club also played in black, St Pats made a jersey change to include gold hoops. The club added a fourth team in 1971 as the competition expanded, but was still training at St Patrick's College during those years. St Pats won the Club division two championship in 1973 (as well as the C.W. Blunt Cup for the second grade premiership) and gained promotion to play in Subbies division one for the following season. The club's training location was moved to Ashfield Centenary Sports Ground in 1974 and the Illinois Hotel was the de facto clubhouse. The black jersey with a gold collar (as used by St Patrick's College) was adopted in 1979. In 1980, the club moved home ground again, this time to Hudson Park and a new clubhouse was built and opened the following year. Field lighting was installed in the 1990s and upgraded in 2005 to allow night matches to be played. The St Pats club currently fields six teams in the NSW Subbies competition .

The approach was usually residential, with the clients and therapists living together, but increasingly residential units have been superseded by day units. It is based on milieu therapy principles, and includes group psychotherapy as well as practical activities. Therapeutic communities have gained some reputation for success in rehabilitation and patient satisfaction in Britain and abroad. In Britain, 'democratic analytic' therapeutic communities have tended to specialise in the treatment of moderate to severe personality disorders and complex emotional and interpersonal problems. The evolution of therapeutic communities in the United States has followed a different path with hierarchically arranged communities (or concept houses) specialising in the treatment of drug and alcohol dependence. History =UK= The work conducted at Northfield Military Hospital during World War II is considered by many psychiatrists to have been the first example of an intentional therapeutic community. The principles developed at Northfield were also developed and adapted at Civil Resettlement Units established at the end of the war to help returning prisoners of war to adapt back to civilian society and for civilians to adapt to having these men back amongst them. The term was coined by Thomas Main in his 1946 paper, \\"The hospital as a therapeutic institution\\",Reproduced in and subsequently developed by others including Maxwell Jones, R. D. Laing at the Philadelphia Association, David Cooper at Villa 21, and Joshua Bierer. Under the influence of Maxwell Jones, Main, Wilmer and others (Caudill 1958; Rapoport 1960), combined with the publications of critiques of the existing mental health system (Greenblatt et al. 1957, Stanton and Schwartz 1954) and the sociopolitical influences that permeated the psychiatric world towards the end of and following the Second World War, the concept of the therapeutic community and its attenuated form ‚Äì the therapeutic milieu ‚Äì caught on and dominated the field of inpatient psychiatry throughout the 1960s. The first development of therapeutic community in a large institution took place at Claybury Hospital under the guidance of Denis Martin and John Pippard. Beginning in 1955 it involved over 2,000 patients and hundreds of staff. The aim of therapeutic communities was a more democratic, user-led form of therapeutic environment, avoiding the authoritarian and demeaning practices of many psychiatric establishments of the time. The central philosophy is that clients are active participants in their own and each other's mental health treatment and that responsibility for the daily running of the community is shared among the clients and the staff. 'TC's have sometimes eschewed or limited medication in favor of group-based therapies. The availability of the treatment on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom has recently been threatened because of changes in funding systems. Researchers at the University of Oxford and King's College London studied a national democratic therapeutic community service over four years and found external policy 'steering' by officials eroded the community's democratic model of care, which in turn destabilised its well established approach to clinical risk management (this had been jointly developed by clients and staff). Fischer (2012), who studied this community's development at first hand, described how an 'intractable conflict' between embedded and externally imposed management models led to escalating organizational 'turbulence', producing an interorganizational crisis which led to the unit's forced closure. However, development of 'mini' therapeutic communities, meeting for three or fewer days each week and supported out of hours by various forms of 'service user led informal networks of care' (for example telephone, texting and physical support), now offers a more resource and cost effective alternative to traditional inpatient therapeutic communities. The most recent exponent, the North Cumbria model, uses a dedicated out of hours website moderated by service users according to therapeutic community principles. This extends the community beyond the face to face 'therapeutic days'. The website guarantees a safe group-based response not always possible with other systems. The use of 'starter' groups as a preparation for entry into therapeutic communities has lowered attrition rates and they now represent a cost-effective model still aimed at producing durable personal and intergenerational effects; this is at odds with the current trend towards the defensive needs of service providers, rather than service users, for less intensive treatments and management of pathways to control risk. =US= In the late 1960s within the US correctional system, the Asklepion Foundation initiated therapeutic communities in the Marion Federal Penitentiary and other institutions that included clinical intervention based upon Transactional Analysis, the Synanon Game, internal twelve-step programs and other therapeutic modalities. Some of these programs lasted into the mid 1980s, such as the House of Thought in the Virginia Correctional system, and were able to demonstrate a reduction of 17% in recidivism in a matched-pair study of drug- abusing felons and sex offenders who participated in the program for one year or more. Modified therapeutic communities are currently used for substance abuse treatment in correctional facilities of several U.S. states including Pennsylvania,Pennsylvania Department of CorrectionsWashington, Colorado,Stout Street Foundation Texas,Texas Department of Criminal Justice Delaware,Therapeutic Community In a Correctional Setting and New York.Therapeutic Communities Association of New York State In New York City, a program for men is located in the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island and the women's program is part of the Bayview Correctional Facility in Manhattan.Stay'n Out: In-prison Treatment Programs for Men & Women  Effectiveness  As in intervention model for drug-using offenders with co- occurring mental health disorders, therapeutic communities may help people reduce drug use and subsequent criminal activity.

It forms the core of Lochore Meadows Country Park. It is used mainly for leisure purposes, especially yachting, although the uneven depth can make the likes of speed boating problematic. The Roman General Agricola held winter quarters in A.D.83 on the edge of Loch Ore, soon after his invasion of Britain and before proceeding to meet Galgacus at the battle of Mons Graupius.The Centenary Memorial to Sir Walter Scott by C S M Lockhart 1871 p.63 The original loch was drained in the 1790s when the landowner, Captain Park, attempted to improve the estate and extend cultivation. The project was not a success and the land formerly occupied by the loch remained boggy and difficult to exploit commercially. The loch gradually returned in the mid 20th century, during the period when Lochore Meadows was a coal mine, and the mineral railway serving the pithead became an embankment surrounded by water. The return of the loch was due to subsidence caused by mining, and the 'new' loch occupies a different site from the original one. The loch is now stabilised but its depth still fluctuates. The islands in the loch are the remains of the former railway embankment. The loch is the training site of many sports teams, including the University of St Andrews Boat Club. The loch holds many events, such as the annual Scottish Open Water Championships where the swimmers compete in a 5 km, 2 km and 4√ó1 km relay swim, and Saints Regatta in September, run by the students of the University of St Andrews Boat Club.

Situated at Lebong and locally known as Hermitage, the Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre (TRSHC) came into existence on 2 October 1959. In 1959, funds raised from local charity led to the starting of this centre by Zhu Dan (wife of Gyalo Thondup). The place initially provided emergency relief to Tibetan refugees who had come through a hazardous trek over the Himalayas into India. The Hill-side had a special significance for Tibetans, because of the fact that Thirteenth Dalai Lama had spent his exile in India from 1910 to 1912 following the Chinese invasion of Tibet at that time.\\"Organizing for Exile!

The U.S. government alleges the man they have in custody is Abdul Hadi al Iraqi, but he claims his name is Nashwan al-Tamir. It is expected that this will be explored in the current Military Commissions proceedings. Early life Al-Iraqi was born in Mosul in 1961 and is ethnically Kurdish. He speaks Arabic, Urdu, the Waziri tribal dialect of Pashtu and a courtly form of Persian. He served in the Iraqi Army, and fought for Iraq, during the Iran- Iraq War.https://ctc.usma.edu/app/uploads/2017/09/CTC-Sentinel_Vol10Iss8-9.pdf Then he travelled to Afghanistan to repel the Soviet invasion. Alleged terrorism activities According to information about him provided by the Pentagon, Hadi was a key paramilitary commander in Afghanistan during the late 1990s, before taking charge of cross-border attacks against US and coalition troops from 2002 to 2004. He was accused of commanding attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan, and of involvement in plots to assassinate Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Following the American invasion in 2001, he clashed with Ahmed Khadr arguing that front line battle would prove more useful than guerilla tactics around Shagai, Pakistan. Al-Iraqi was alleged to have managed the Ashara guest house, in Kabul's diplomatic district, from where he was alleged to command Al-Qaeda's army, and to have served as al- Qaeda's accountant. He had been wanted in Iraq since at least February 2005.Press release , United States Central Command, 11 February 2005 The most recent U.S. State Department wanted poster said The Newsweek article claimed that al Iraqi brokered a 2005 reconciliation between Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Newsweek asserted that bin Laden had failed to anticipate the strength of the Iraqi's anti-occupation resistance, and that he dispatched al Iraqi to take charge of establishing an Al-Qaeda presence in the resistance. Newsweek asserted that Zarqawi had left a bad impression on his fellow veterans of the struggle to evict the Soviet invaders, and that bin Laden didn't trust him. However, al Iraqi recommended that Al-Qaeda would be better served by naming Zarqawi the head of Al-Qaeda in Iraq than by trying to compete with him for volunteers and establish a parallel effort‚Äîexplaining the reconciliation. It was reported in January 2002 that someone with the same pseudonyms Abdul-Hadi al-Iraqi and Abu Abdullah had been captured in Afghanistan.One of various reports of capture in 2002 That person was also described as a training camp commander. However, despite these coincidences, the two suspects are now known to be distinct people. Despite the report that Abdul-Hadi spoke several regional languages, several of the charges against Abdul Zahir stem from him serving as a translator for Abdul-Hadi.[ Summarized transcripts (.pdf)], from Abdul Zahir's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, pages 1‚Äì8 A captured letterAl-Adl letter to Mukhtar , English translation by United States Military Academy dated June 13, 2002, and thought to be from Saif al-Adel, mentions an Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi who is quite senior in al-Qaeda and is at large (probably in Afghanistan) at the time of that writing. The US DoD statement says that Abdul-Hadi \\"during 2002‚Äì04, was in charge of cross- border attacks in Afghanistan\\" and that prior to his capture he \\"was trying to return to his native country, Iraq, to manage al-Qai\`da's affairs and possibly focus on operations outside Iraq against Western targets\\". Capture On April 27, 2007, it was reported that Abdul Hadi Al-Iraqi was in custody in Guantanamo Bay. He was previously held by the CIA. The BBC reported that US sources told them Al-Iraqi was arrested \\"late last year\\". On September 6, 2006, US President George W. Bush officially confirmed that the CIA maintained a secret network of offshore interrogation camps, when he announced that fourteen \\"high value detainees\\" had been transferred to Guantanamo. Bush claimed that the transfer of these fourteen men had emptied the CIA's secret interrogation camps. Critics pointed out that Bush had not announced the closure of the camps. The date of Al-Iraqi's capture has not been made known. It is not clear whether Al-Iraqi entered the CIA's network of secret interrogation camps before or after Bush's announcement. Habeas corpus petition Al Iraqi has had a writ of habeas corpus filed on his behalf. Medical condition Abdul Hadi al Iraqi suffers from a spinal condition. Camp authorities flew in a neuro-surgical team for an emergency operation, hours before Cuba was struct by Hurricane Irma. According to Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, his lawyers blamed the severity of his spinal condition on a decade of medical mistreatment. Military spokesmen, on the other hand, pointed to him as an example of the high quality of the treatment provided to captives. According to his lawyers a CT scan performed in January 2017 pointed out the need for surgery. Camp authorities only scheduled his surgery after he lost all feeling in his legs, and became incontinent. On September 15, 2017, his lawyers announced that he needed another operation on his spine, in his neck.

The city is the municipal seat of El Mante municipality in extreme southern Tamaulipas, and lies in the northwestern portion of the municipality. It had a 2005 census population of 81,884 inhabitants, or about 73 percent of El Mante's total of 112,061. The city is the state's ninth-largest community in population. El Mante has an area of 1,699.98 km2 (656.37 sq mi), and includes smaller outlying communities such as El Lim√≥n, El Abra, Nueva Apolonia, and El Naranjo. Ciudad Mante is served by the Ciudad Mante National Airport. Mante's official slogan is Donde el Azucar es mas Dulce que la Miel. (\\"Where sugar is sweeter than honey.\\") History The region known today as Mante is taken from the Huastecan Indian name, \\"cinco potreros de Tamat√°n\\", or the five pasture grounds, and in the \\"Tenek\\" or Huastecan language a word that means, \\"the embarkation of canoes.\\" According to various documents, it was a very unsanitary place due to the flooding that the land suffered when the regional rivers overflowed, and more so due to the Mante River whose waters stagnated for months without any exit causing caused the formation of large lime deposits that afterwards became a breeding ground for mosquitos and horse- flies whose sting was very painful. Due to these insupportable and unsanitary conditions the Spanish could not colonize the region permanently, although due to the rich and fertile capability of the ground they did farm the area. According to several studies there were several Indian tribes of \\"collectors- hunters\\" that inhabited the area with the Parnes, Chichimecas and Janambres as the predominant tribes in the area. The Janambres represented a formidable danger to those who attempted colonization as they attacked all who tried to settle in the \\"Tamat√°n\\" area. There are many stories that the Janambres were constantly hostile towards the colonists and when these fought to repel the attacks, the Indians withdrew to the hills. On the other hand, there are indications that early in the conquest of Mexico the region of Mante was visited by several Augustinian missionaries, among them Friar Juan de Mesa, Friar Nicolas de San Paulo (last name Witte); Friar Comel de Bye and Friar Antonio de Roa, who ministered in several areas such as Tamezin (Tamesi, Tanchipa) and Tanguachin. These facts are taken from Doctor Patricia Osante in her book Or√≠genes del Nuevo Santander (The Origins of New Santander). However, according to the available evidence, neither of these Augustinian missionaries established a mission or any other colony, or at least, none of the evidence gives one reason to believe so. Therefore, the \\"Cinco Potreros de Tamat√°n\\" (Five Pastures of Tamatan), also known as \\"Frondoso Paraje de Canoas\\" (The Luxuriant Embarkation of Canoes) or (The Leafy Embarkation of Canoes), was not considered by the founding officials, including the Escand√≥n family. The poor quality of the lands of San Juan Bautista de Horcasitas (today Magiscatz√≠n, a township of Gonz√°lez, founded by Jos√© de Escand√≥n May 11, 1749), forced several of his fellow colonists to migrate towards the mountain range of Tanchipa, including the surrounding areas of the Mante River spring. In this area they began to cultivate the fertile lands that guaranteed them excellent harvests of corn, beans, sugar cane, peppers and fruit, which they used for their subsistence and commercial reasons. So it was that in November, 1750, when Escand√≥n was on an inspection visit in Horcasitas, that he found the area already populated. Finding it justifiable he proceeded to donate these lands to the Bishop of Manila, Don Manuel Antonio Rojo de la Fuente and Vieyra, who accepted them. After fulfilling all the legal requirements, Escand√≥n orders Captain Juan Antonio de Barberena to take possession or the lands known as \\"Cinco Potreros de Tamat√°n\\" (The Five Pastures of Tamat√°n), which according to the testimony of the same Barberena occurred March 8, 1764, at the same time taking an official census of the marketing colonists, and belongings of the Hustecan and Olive Indians that lived in the Horcasitas. Miguel Velazquez and Ausencio Hern√°ndez represented the colonists and Andr√©s (Andrew) G√≥mez the Indians. There were thirty five colonists living in the immediate vicinity of the Mante River spring and sixty six in the area from Abra to Tanchipa. On the basis of this historical data, some people consider this date and these colonists the founders of what was then known as \\"Frondoso Paraje de Canoas\\" (The Luxuriant Embarkation of Canoes) or (The Leafy Embarkation of Canoes), later known as \\"Rancho Canoas\\" (Canoe Ranch), and later still as Villa Ju√°rez (Juarez Village), and now as Ciudad Mante (Mante City). However, we should recognize that a dividing of the land among the inhabitants does not constitute the founding of a town or city, and in this sense, the Ciudad Mante (City of Mante) does not possess a precise founding date. =Origin of the name= Mr. Hipolito Aviles, a citizen and researcher living in Mante, submits that the word \\"mante\\" comes from the Nahuatl language and is composed of three syllables in that language: \\"man\\", \\"atl\\" and \\"tetl\\", which mean \\"place of\\", \\"water\\" and \\"rock\\". Taken together these words mean \\"the place of the water in the rock\\" or \\"where the water comes out of the rock\\", alluding to the Mante River spring, where the water surges forth from the rock in the \\"Sierra de Cucharas\\". However, this region was never inhabited by the Nahuatl Indians. The tribes that lived here were Huastecan, a branch of the Maya, and their language was \\"t√©nek\\" or \\"huasteco\\" (Huastecan), and not Nahuatl. According to the research of educators who have studied the Tenek language, the word \\"mante\\" is of T√©nek origin and is formed from two roots which are: \\"man\\" meaning \\"yellow\\", and \\"te\\" meaning \\"stick\\" or \\"tree\\". Therefore, the word \\"mante\\" refers to the tree of that name, and whose fruit, upon ripening is of such an intense yellow color that it gives the same yellow appearance to the leaves of this tree when seen from a distance. At the same time this tree gives the River Mante its name, later to the sugar mill and to the City of Mante. If the version of Mr. Aviles were true, then only the river would have this name but not the tree because the tree does not \\"surge forth from the water in the rock.\\" On this basis, the name \\"Mante\\" came from the tree in the family of the sapota tree with the same name. \\"Mante\\" therefore means \\"yellow stick (or tree).\\" Tourism El Nacimiento The city of Mante has many beautiful and attractive sights. Many of these tourist attractions are located in the immediate area surrounding Mante. Several of these places are briefly described in the following details. \\"La difusora\\" is a main irrigation channel that over the past 20 years has been a local swimming area, the name is a reference point due to a previous radio station that was immediately west. \\"La difusora\\" received a 9 million pesos investment that beautified it and removed the previous dangers of the manmade channel that it used to be. Local food vendors are available in the afternoons. \\"El Nacimiento\\" Or the \\"Birthplace\\" is only 7 miles by graveled road from the city and accessible in all seasons. To see this magnificent spring with water flowing from the rocks in the \\"sierra de Cucharas\\" (Spoon Ridge Mountains) is a new and marvelous experience. It is the tourist site where the entire family can enjoy a satisfying day in the country along with a picnic. One may also go swimming or simply relax on a boat ride. One would be encouraged to swim to the mouth of the cave in order to view and enjoy the view of the light entering into the cave (above) the crystal clear waters with an emerald tint. \\"La Aguja\\" \\"The Needle\\" is another popular swimming place in excellent condition approximately 4 miles from Mante. It was (constructed) along with the construction of a dam on the Mante River which is used to irrigate the large sugar cane plantations of the region. This dam was constructed between 1927 and 1929 and inaugurated August 9, 1929. From here one can navigate upstream until arriving at the \\"Nacimiento\\". The Beaches of Limon are to the North 7.5 miles away where the township of Limon with a population that is closely knit with Cd. Mante. The Sabinas and Frio (Cold River) join flowing into the Guayalejo River. This lovely attraction is visited by a large number of tourists that enjoy the tranquil, shallow and uncontaminated waters from the river. The cave at \\"El Abra\\" and the natural cave of Quintero are two of the caverns in the Cuchara Sierra, and are without doubt the best known and more frequently visited in our region because of the close proximity to Cd. Mante. In the cave at El Abra it is worthwhile to view the \\"basement\\" located at the bottom of its interior 380 feet from the entrance. It was partially explored by cave explorers from San Antonio, Texas in 1956. In the natural cavern of Quintero one may observe the thousands of bats at eventide as they emerge from the cave to search for food in the surrounding areas. A castle-like building was constructed during the last century that belonged to the large hacienda \\"El Naranjo\\" (The Orange Tree). It was famous during its time, having received distinguished guests such as General Porfirio Diaz. It is located to the south of the village called Nueva Apolonia. El Cielo (The Heaven) a protected cloud forest covers a land mass of 144,530 hectares (~357,129 acres) and is a paradise for the great quantity of species that inhabit it. There are 175 distinct species of migratory birds and 225 local fowl, various amphibious and mammals, as well as white tail deer, jaguar and black bear. This is due to the unique climatological, biological and topographical conditions in El Cielo. To find out more about this paradise take a look at the photos of this ecological reserve of our region. This located away from mante other beautiful sights as the Servilleta Canyon in the Mante's zone.

The concept refers to ignorance or misconceptions about the nature of metaphysical reality, in particular about the impermanence and anatta doctrines about reality. It is the root cause of Dukkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness), and asserted as the first link, in Buddhist phenomenology, of a process that leads to repeated birth. AvidyƒÅ is mentioned within the Buddhist teachings as ignorance or misunderstanding in various contexts: * Four Noble Truths * The first link in the twelve links of dependent origination * One of the three poisons within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition * One of the six root kleshas within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings * One of the ten fetters in the Theravada tradition * Equivalent to moha within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings Within the context of the twelve links of dependent origination, avidya is typically symbolized by a person who is blind or wearing a blindfold. Etymology AvidyƒÅ is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of a and vidya, meaning \\"not vidya\\". The word vidya is derived from the Sanskrit root vid, which means \\"to know, to perceive, to see, to understand\\". Therefore, avidya means to \\"not know\\". The vid*-related terms appear extensively in the Rigveda and other Vedas. In Vedic literature, avidya refers to \\"ignorance, spiritual ignorance, illusion\\"; in early Buddhist texts, states Monier- Williams, it means \\"ignorance with non-existence\\". The word is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *weid-, meaning \\"to see\\" or \\"to know\\". It is a cognate with the Latin verb vidƒìre (\\"to see\\") and English wit. Overview Avidya is explained in different ways or on different levels within different Buddhist teachings or traditions. On the most fundamental level, it is ignorance or misunderstanding of the nature of reality; more specifically about the nature of not-Self and dependent origination doctrines. Avidya is not lack of information, states Peter Harvey, but a \\"more deep seated misperception of reality\\". Gethin calls Avidya as 'positive misconception', not mere absence of knowledge. It is a key concept in Buddhism, wherein Avidya about the nature of reality, rather than sin, is considered the basic root of Dukkha. Removal of this Avidya leads to overcoming of Dukkha. While AvidyƒÅ found in Buddhism and other Indian philosophies is often translated as \\"ignorance\\", states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because it means more than ignorance. He suggests the term \\"unwisdom\\" to be a better rendition. The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions). Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman. In other contexts, avidya includes not knowing or not understanding the nature of phenomena as impermanent, the Four Noble Truths, other Buddhist doctrines, or the path to end suffering.Johannes Bronkhorst (2009), Buddhist Teaching in India, Simon & Schuster, , pages 40-43 Sonam Rinchen states Avidya in the context of the twelve links, that \\"[Ignorance] is the opposite of the understanding that the person or other phenomena lack intrinsic existence. Those who are affected by this ignorance create actions which precipitate them into further worldly existence.\\"Sonam Rinchen (2006), p. 51. Not understanding the Four Noble Truths, or its implications, is also Avidya.Ajahn Sucitto (2010), Kindle Locations 1125-1132. In Buddhist traditions Avidya appears as a major item of discussion in two doctrines about the nature of reality, in various Buddhist traditions., Quote: Suffering describes the condition of samsaric (this worldly) existence that arises from actions generated by ignorance of anatta and anicca. The doctrines of no-self and impermanence are thus the keystones of dhammic order.\\" One relates to the Anatta (Anatman) doctrine, that is ignorance or misconceptions about \\"Self\\", when in reality there is only non-Self according to Buddhism. The second relates to Anicca doctrine, that is ignorance or misconceptions about \\"permanence\\", when the nature of reality is impermanence. =Theravada= Bhikkhu Bodhi states that Avidya is an important part of the Theravada Abhidharma teachings about dependent arising about conditions that sustain the wheel of birth and death. One such condition is the karmic formations that arise from ignorance. In other words, states Bodhi, ignorance (avijja) obscures \\"perception of the true nature of things just as a cataract obscures perception of visible objects\\". In the Suttanta literature, this ignorance refers to the non-knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. In the Abhidharma literature, in addition to the Four Noble Truths, it is the non-knowledge of one's 'past pre-natal lives' and 'post- mortem future lives' and of dependent arising.A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma: The Abhidhammattha Sangaha, Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), p. 295 =Mahayana= The Mahayana tradition considers ignorance about the nature of reality and immemorial past lives to be a primordial force, which can only be broken through the insight of Emptiness (sunyata). However, compared to other Buddhist traditions, states Jens Braarvig, AvidyƒÅ is not so much emphasized, instead the emphasis on \\"construing an illusory reality\\" based on conceptualization when the ultimate reality is Emptiness. Avidya is the greatest impurity and the primary cause of suffering, rebirth. The insight into Emptiness, state Garfield and Edelglass, that is the \\"lack of inherent nature of all phenomena, including the self, cuts the impurities\\", an insight into Emptiness yields full awakening. =Vajrayana= The Vajrayana tradition considers ignorance as fetters of bondage into samsara, and its teachings have focussed on a Tantric path under the guidance of a teacher, to remove Avidya and achieve liberation in a single lifetime. AvidyƒÅ is identified as the first of the twelve links of dependent origination (twelve nidanas)‚Äîa sequence of links that describe why a being reincarnates and remains bound within the samsara, a cycle of repeated births and deaths in six realms of existence. The twelve nidanas are an application of the Buddhist concept of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda (dependent origination). This theory, presented in Samyutta Nikaya II.2‚Äì4 and Digha Nikaya II.55‚Äì63, asserts that rebirth, re-aging and re-death ultimately arise through a series of twelve links or nidanas ultimately rooted in AvidyƒÅ, and the twelfth step JarƒÅmara·πáa triggers the dependent origination of AvidyƒÅ, recreating an unending cycle of dukkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).  Removing avidya  Avidya or ignorance can be eliminated directly by cultivating its opposite viz. Knowledge, wisdom and perception, where the above refer to the true knowledge and perception of reality. The various ways to remove Avidya is by learning from Guru/teacher who knows or from books and scriptures. Also Avidya can be removed through Meditation or more precisely practice of Dhyana and Yoga. Through practice of Dharma and righteousness Avidya gets removed. Unrighteous karma increases Ignorance while Ignorance perpetuates Adharma.

Description Delias hyparete hierta This species closely resembles Delias eucharis but can be distinguished as follows: Male upper forewing has the black margins to the veins more diffuse; the transverse postdiscal band diffuse, ill-defined, oblique, not parallel to termen in its lower portion but terminated at apex of vein 2; the apical portion of the wing beyond the fascia more or less so thickly shaded with black scales as to leave the white lanceolate (lance- shaped) spaces between the veins (so prominent in D. eucharis) ill-defined and obscure. Hindwing white, the black venation and terminal narrow black border as well as the sub-terminal vermilion-red spots between the veins on the underside show through by transparency. Underside: forewing as in D. eucharis, but the black margins to the veins much broader and the postdiscal transverse fascia as on the upperside oblique but broader. Hindwing differs from that of D. eucharis in the much deeper chrome-yellow tint of the ground colour, the postdiscal black curved band that in D. eucharis separates the yellow from the subterminal vermilion-red spots entirely wanting, the red spots themselves pointed inwardly, not subcordate, they conspicuously increase in size posteriorly. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of D. eucharis. Female differs from the female of D. eucharis on the upperside by the very much darker shading, especially on the forewing, and by the postdiscal transverse band which is as in the D. eucharis oblique but broader. Hindwing also more darkly shaded, the postdiscal transverse curved black baud entirely absent. Underside as in the female but darker, the forewing especially more thickly shaded with black scaling, the preapical interspaces tinged with yellow. Antennae, thorax and abdomen similar to those in D. eucharis. Delias hyparete metarete female, upperside Subspecies D. h. metarete, Butler (Southern Myanmar; extending to Java and Sumatra) differs from D. h. hierta as follows: Male upperside has the ground colour a much purer white; apical half of forewing in contrast with the white on basal half densely shaded with black scales. Underside: the colours clearer and purer, the chrome yellow on the hindwing confined to the base and posterior half of the wing, the apical half of the cell and the anterior interspaces within the line of the vermilion-red spots pure white; the anterior two or three subterminal red spots margined interiorly with diffuse black scaling. Female differs less from the 2 of D. h. hierta, but on the underside of the hindwing the yellow colour is as restricted as it is in the male; the subterminal red spots are of a richer vermilion than in D. h. hierta, and the anterior two or three as in the d have an interior narrow margin of diffuse black scales. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in D. h. hierta, but the thorax and abdomen shaded slightly darker with a bluish-grey appearance. Subspecies D. h. ethire, Doherty (Madras; Orissa; Lower Bengal) differs from typical D. h. hierta as follows: Male upperside very pure white. Forewing has the black margins to the veins very narrow, the oblique postdiscal band ill-defined, scarcely any irroration of black scales on the apical half of the wing. Hindwing pure white, the colours of the underside seen through by transparency as in D. h. hierta. Underside differs from D. h. hierta principally in the brighter tint of the yellow on the hindwing, and in the more clearly defined, less diffuse black margins of the veins. Female differs less from female D. h. hierta than does the male from the corresponding sex of the same insect. Upperside has the interspaces beyond the postdiscal oblique band on forewing and the cell and basal halves of the interspaces beyond the cell on the hindwing distinctly tinged with yellow. Underside: all the markings more neatly and clearly defined than in D. h. hierta, the interspaces beyond the oblique postdiscal band on the forewing bright lemon-yellow. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen in both sexes as in D. h. hierta.

T. Kunjumon, and directed by Praveen Gandhi. It stars Nagarjuna and Sushmita Sen, alongside Raghuvaran, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Vadivelu and Girish Karnad in supporting roles. It was the most expensive Indian film at the time of release. Plot  Ajay (Nagarjuna) is an unemployed youth who always gets into trouble because of his temper. He gets heated up when he encounters anyone committing a crime; he takes the law into his own hands, beats them up and then gives them some free advice. Ajay‚Äôs father Padmanabhan (S. P. Balasubrahmanyam), who works for an insurance firm, is very unhappy with his son‚Äôs attitude, and tries his best to change his attitude through a meditation expert, but fails in this matter as the expert suggests that Ajay's anguish is reasonable. Ajay meets Sonia (Sushmita Sen) through his father, and she falls in love with him. What Sonia likes about Ajay is his temper and anger when he encounters anything, which is against the law. Sonia gets Padmanabhan's help to get Ajay to love her. Still, Ajay is not interested in her and seriously rejects her at first; but he later changes his mind after going through some unusual situations, and love blossoms between them. Sonia‚Äôs father Sriram (Girish Karnad) is an industrialist who owns the Daewoo automotive manufacturing facility. He has no objection to his daughter‚Äôs relationship with Ajay, but has one condition: Ajay must become employed in his factory, control his temper for three months, and not get into any fight whatsoever, even if he encounters a crime happening in front of his eyes. If Ajay cannot do this, he will not be allowed to marry Sonia. With a heavy heart, Ajay agrees to the condition; Sonia's love for Ajay deepens and Sriram offers Ajay a job in his factory. Sriram actually has his own problems with his factory in a loss; ten of his workers are working with his rival and younger stepbrother Gnaneswar (Raghuvaran), and they hamper the progress of his factory with frequent, pre-planned mishaps. This leads to the factory's property loss. Gnaneswar is the son of Sriram's stepmother, who gets deceived by Sriram and loses his share of his father's common business empire. Further, in unusual circumstances, Gnaneswar spends some years in jail and returns with a planned conspiracy and vengeance on his stepbrother Sriram. Gnaneswar is now trying to put Sriram out of business, so his ten men create havoc in the factory by killing old workers and raging new workers. So when Ajay comes to work in Sriram‚Äôs factory, these ten men do the same to Ajay. Ajay keeps cool, trying to keep his promise to Sriram. But Sriram hopes otherwise; he wants Ajay to break the promise and beat up the ten men and throw them out of the factory. At the same time, Sriram hopes the imminent marriage between Ajay and Sonia will be canceled, since he does not want his daughter to marry an angry street0fighter like Ajay. So Sriram keeps hoping Ajay will somehow burst out. Gnaneswar's men damage an important machine to make the international Korean experts attend the problem. The plan is to kill those Korean experts so that it would become an international issue and Sriram's company would be locked out permanently, but Ajay saves those experts, and Sriram publicizes this to create a fight between Gnaneswar's men and Ajay, but it happens otherwise that Ajay still keeps cool in spite of them beating him black and blue, and Sriram's hopes are devastated. As a last trigger, Sriram uses his father's name in publicizing the issue in factory to media so that Gnaneswar's men may think that it was Ajay's father who brought this to the media. As expected by Sriram, those ten men brutally murder Ajay's father for this. After this, Ajay becomes furious and breaks his promise and banishes the ten men from the factory. But Gnaneswar holds Ajay and blackmails Sonia that he would kill Ajay unless Sonia kills herself by destroying Sriram's factory by bombarding it with a truck armed with a powerful Russian explosive. In the climax, Gnaneswar kills Sriram by throwing him off the helicopter; Gnaneswar gets killed when his helicopter hits the mountains; and Sonia gets saved and unites with Ajay.

Despite signing on established crew including A. R. Rahman along with Miss Universe pageant winner Sushmita Sen, producer Kunjumon signed debutant Praveen Gandhi to be the director and Nagarjuna, a Telugu star as the lead actor. The producer revealed that in the director he saw \\"a young man who is very talented and full of ideas who was willing to work hard.\\" The period in between was spent with pre-production works with art director Thotta Tharani constructing a huge set in Mahabalipuram with an elaborate bungalow and swimming pool as a part of the heroine's home, as well as a huge five star hotel where the villains lived and a landing area for helicopters. Furthermore, Tharani created 8 sets for the song \\"Love Attack\\" with Nagarjuna and Sushmita dancing alongside 50 other dancers. The song \\"Mercury Pookkal Model Nilakkal\\" was picturised in the midst of many small airplanes in Bangalore. The film was shot all over India including locations in Manali, Mumbai, Goa, Ooty, Rajasthan and Delhi, with Kunjumon making a claim during filming stages that the film would become India's most costly production. However, this record was broken when Shankar's Jeans released the very next year. Nagarjuna's voice was dubbed by actor Suresh. Release The film was initially slated to be released on 31 July 1997 but the strikes in the Tamil film industry delayed such plans. The film was released in Tamil Nadu, along with the Telugu dubbed version in Andhra Pradesh on 30 October 1997 to mixed reviews. http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/3FAC79AFA4381E8665256940004D0DEA The film was dubbed into Telugu as Rakshakudu.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcxM0FC3AaI Soundtrack The soundtrack featured eight songs and a theme song composed by A.

It is centered just south of the Martian equator at and covers 2600 km at its widest extent. The area reveals \\"chaos terrain\\", outflow channels, and alluvial plains that are indicative of massive flooding. Wind erosion patterns are also in evidence. A region within the terra shows some of the highest valley network densities on the planet. Ares Vallis is another notable feature, where the flood and flow patterns are in evidence; it was the landing site of the Soviet Mars 6 lander and NASA's Mars Pathfinder. It is also one of several proposed landing sites for the Mars 2020 Rover. Holden and Eberswalde, craters in Margaritifer Terra, are thought to have formerly held lakes because they contain deltas and iron/magnesium smectite minerals which need water to form.Murchie, S. et al. 2009.

The Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM) system of paths for water flow is found in Margaritifer Terra. Researchers think that great flood channels in this region were carved quickly in just weeks or months by catastrophic outflows of groundwater.https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_054753_1825 Because forming hematite requires liquid water, which could not long exist without a thick atmosphere, Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere at some time in the past. http://themis.asu.edu/discoveries-aramchaos Margaritifer Terra was named in 1979, after the Pearl Coast, south India. Part of it is found in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle and part in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. Wikimolaargyre.jpgMOLA map showing boundaries for Margaritifer Terra and other regions. Color indicates elevation. Layers Some of the images from this region display layers. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together.

Both cities are politically and economically interrelated with Ciudad Valles. Tourism Ciudad Valles is one of Mexico's most popular destinations for tourists. =Micos waterfall= These waterfalls are known for their steep falls in the middle of hills surrounded by vegetation. These waterfalls are located from Ciudad Valles and are part of Tampaon river, best known as the Micos River. This name was given due to the abundance of spider monkeys that inhabited this area. This river goes down through a large series of falls with a vertiginous acceleration. Rafting through the rapids of this river is a common activity. At the top of the waterfall there is a scenic viewpoint. =Tamasopo= View of the Tamasopo Falls in San Luis Potos√≠ Another destination for adventure tourism for the Verastegui Sierra, where the spectacle of the Espinazo del Diablo (Backbone of the Devil) and its ravines which are up to deep can be seen. In this place, access is difficult due to the rough terrain. Tamasopo waterfalls are nearby, a group of three waterfalls that form a waterfall that falls violently into a 5 meter deep well, in whose banks there are beaches. =Tamul waterfall= From the town of Tanchach√≠n, the Tamul waterfall is about two hours by boat. With a drop, it is the highest waterfall in the state of San Luis Potos√≠. It is known its height and its crystalline turquoise water. Formed by the waters of the Gallinas River at its confluence with the Tampaon, Tamul Falls cascade into the Tampaon River. Twenty five miles downstream from the falls, the Tampaon meanders past the ancient pyramid site of Tamtoc. Archaeologists believe that Tamtoc is the northernmost pre-Columbian city with pyramids in Mexico, and some speculate that it could be the place of origin of the Aztecs from which they launched their migration to the Valley of Mexico. The best time to visit the waterfall is during the low water season from July to October, when it is easily accessible. =Tancanhuitz de Santos= This town is located from Ciudad Valles. The Huehuetlan Sierra creek is located here, which is a natural frontier that divides the huastecas to the south and the nahuatlacos native groups. These two indigenous groups nowadays still preserve their languages, dress and customs from their ancestors. When going down from their communities towards the \\"tianguis\\" (street market) every Sunday, women wear their quetzquemaletls (v.-shaped ponchos) that they knit and embroider. The languages spoken here mix Nahuatl, Huasteco and Spanish.

The company works using masks and visual, puppet, physical, music-based forms rather than text. It works internationally as well as from The Boo in Waterfoot, Rossendale, Lancashire, UK. Since 2012 the emphasis of its work has been increasingly in serving its local community, and much of its work is now under 'The Boo' name.  Origins  'Boma' from 'Harvest of Ghosts' 1998 by Sam Ukala/Bob Frith Frith taught in the early 1970s at Manchester School of Art (later Manchester Metropolitan University). Unhappy with the prevailing abstraction of the period he experimented with extending purely visual forms to include live performance and music, influenced by Allan Kaprow, Red Grooms and Claes Oldenburg, and working with groups of his students. At the Bede Gallery, Jarrow, he worked on a large-scale project with his friend Dave Pearson, filmmakers and artists, and including the musician Alan Price, as well as engineers from the local shipbuilding industry.Palmers Yard, V Rea, pub. The Bede Gallery, Jarrow, 1975. In the mid 70s he met Welfare State and worked with that company for two years.Engineers of the Imagination, Coult/Kershaw, Methuen 1983, He formed Horse + Bamboo Theatre in 1978, with a group of ex-students, musicians and members of Matrogoth Theatre from Leiden, Netherlands. After 2000 Frith worked closely with Alison Duddle, originally of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre from Minneapolis on the majority of the company's productions.Horse + Bamboo Theatre 2002, Neville, pub. Horse and Bamboo Theatre In late 2016 Duddle left the company, and Frith retired in March 2018, although continuing to work with Apna Rossendale (see Different Moons, below).  Name  The name derives from the use of horses to pull a caravan of vehicles when touring, which was a central feature of the company's work from 1979 to 1999. This grew from their commitment to taking their work to rural communities, and using the horses and horse-drawn wagons to attract an audience. Bamboo, due to its lightness and strength, was the main structural timber used in the early horse-drawn touring sets, and was also used to make puppets and music instruments. Horse + Bamboo now tours in a more conventional manner, but its roots in rural touring are maintained through tours with small, flexible shows that lend themselves to community venues, and the development of the Boo, that serves as a centre and venue for the company's local community in Pennine Lancashire. In this regard Horse + Bamboo has much in common with Kneehigh Theatre, who maintain a locally based presence in Cornwall in addition to their wider touring work. The company is based in a building in Waterfoot, Rossendale, Lancashire, originally the Liberal Club, but which is now called 'The Boo'. This was the name, a diminutive form of 'Horse and Bamboo', by which the company was commonly known locally.  Productions  Horse + Bamboo Theatre creates its own material, occasionally in collaboration with other artists and writers, with the majority of its productions made by the core team of artists. Its hallmark is in creating sustained theatrical narratives without the use of dialogue, as well as the use of full-head masks and puppetry. Film, music and dance are often integrated within the company's productions. > The work that they create is uncompromising in terms of artistry and subject > matter. The artistic directors Bob Frith and Alison Duddle create work to > which they bring the passion of great artists - emotionally powerful, > beautiful to look at, laced with humour and pathos that reaches out to > audiences, and one more thing that is quite difficult to describe.

These productions started as outdoor shows, and moved into a marquee after four years. Eventually the company began to create shows that played in village halls and other community centres. The performers walked about 400 miles each season, living in tents and cooking on open fires. Horse-drawn touring took place in England, Scotland, Ireland, Hungary and Slovakia. Now the company tours its productions throughout the UK, and has also toured in Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium.

Blurb 2008. In The Shadow of Trees was written and designed by Bob Frith for the Royal Exchange Theatre Studio in Manchester. Directed by Associate Director, Alison Duddle, it won the Best New Play at the M.E.N. Awards in 2006 and subsequently toured, despite being created especially for the Royal Exchange. Duddle has since adapted and directed a number of other productions aimed at young audiences, including Red Riding Hood and The Nightingale. In 2009 the company created Little Leap Forward, a production in collaboration with Barefoot Books adapted by Alison Duddle from the book by Guo Yue and Clare Farrow which opened at the Manchester Royal Exchange. Guo Yue created new music for the production that was integrated into the score by Musical Director, Loz Kaye. They also devised Deep Time Cabaret, part of the 'Valley of Stone' project inspired by the landscape of Rossendale, its geology and industry. The production was unusual for the company in hardly using masks at all, and complex use of projected images and video. In 2012 and again in 2013 the company toured Angus - Weaver of Grass about the Scottish Outsider Artist Angus MacPhee throughout the Hebrides and Highland Regions of Scotland (image to right). From 2012 onwards the touring programme diminished as a result of changes to arts funding. The emphasis for the company changed to working within the local East Lancashire community, and centred at The Boo. Some touring continued, notably Theatre Ballads which combines live folk music with puppetry and video, and Suffrajitsu, both directed by Esther Ferry-Kennington. The Moonwatcher in 2018 was a collaboration between Bob Frith and the poet Shamshad Khan, that grew out of work with the local South Asian heritage communities, and was the last production involving Bob Frith before he retired from the company.Bob Frith - personal website https://bobfrith.co.uk = The Boo = Horse + Bamboo is based at a building known as The Boo, in Waterfoot, Rossendale which is used as centre and venue for regular arts events and the development of visual theatre. Since 2018, most of the work of the company is under the banner of 'The Boo', rather than 'Horse and Bamboo'. In 2015 the building was renovated and improved, and now has a 110-seat theatre, a studio space, and better facilities for public events. The building is the base for a programme of projects working closely with the local community. The Boo hosts 'Waterfoot Wakes', an annual community festival. The building is also used by other artists and theatre companies both as a place to research and develop new visual theatre work, sometimes in a mentoring partnership with Horse + Bamboo, and as a centre for running their own events and workshops. The Boo has a regular programme of family puppet-based theatre shows, bringing in touring companies. It also hosts live music, film and comedy events. Horse + Bamboo Theatre has a long history of producing community projects both in its home community of Rossendale, and beyond - for example the Good Friday Parade and Service at Westminster Abbey in 1994 and 1996.Bob Frith - personal website https://bobfrith.co.uk = Guided Imagery = Immersive Fairground set for a Guided Imagery productionHorse + Bamboo has also been influential in its work with people who have special needs through its Guided Imagery programme. This programme, started in 1982, uses a large-scale built environment and performance space through which small and intimate groups journey, and interact with, a highly sensory environment. These 'performances' last several hours, and are notable in blurring the gap between performer and audience. These productions were precursors to the immersive theatre developed by Punchdrunk and others. Since 2014 the company has utilised many of the techniques developed for this work on a new strand of theatre work for very young children, frequently pre-toddlers.Bob Frith - personal website https://bobfrith.co.uk = Different Moons = In 2013 Horse + Bamboo started a project working with the South Asian community in Rpssendale, particularly Haslingden. Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Different Moons initiated a series of interviews with first-generation immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh. These were transcribed and the stories told were used as a basis for workshops with the second and third generation South Asian heritage community, particularly young people and women. The project has been led mainly by South Asia artists, particularly Shamshad Khan, the Manchester-based poet. In addition to creative writing the project has created exhibitions, installations, melas, and mushairas with workshops in mehndi, calligraphy and paper-cut arts. In 2015 the company helped open a small meeting place and gallery in Haslingden, called 'Apna' (meaning 'ours' or 'mine' in Urdu), that provides various opportunities for women mainly from Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage.'Different Moons: Poems, Letters & Stories' pub. 2016 Horse + BambooDifferent Moons: Poems The writing groups, at differentmoons.org Accessed 17 September 2017 Apna has become an independent organisation largely supporting South Asian heritage women, based in Haslingden and managed by Arry Nessa and others, although it still retains links with The Boo.Bob Frith - personal website https://bobfrith.co.uk See also * Bread & Puppet Theater * Thingumajig Theatre External links * Bob Frith Detailed history of the company on the website of its founder. * Horse + Bamboo Theatre website * pPod images - Italiano * pPod images - English  References  Theatre companies in England Puppet troupes Touring theatre ","title":"Horse and Bamboo Theatre"},{"id":"4966608","text":"Delias descombesi, the redspot Jezebel is a medium-sized butterfly of the family Pieridae, that is, the yellows and whites.

DGHC had three subdivisions under its authority: Darjeeling, Kalimpong, and Kurseong and some areas of Siliguri subdivision. Background Gorkha National Liberation Front led by Subhash Ghisingh raised the demand for the creation of a state called Gorkhaland within India to be carved out of the hills of Darjeeling and areas of Dooars and Siliguri terai contiguous to Darjeeling. A violent agitation erupted in the Darjeeling hills from 1986 to 1988 in which 1200 people lost their lives. Formation The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council was the result of the signing of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Agreement between the Central Government of India, the West Bengal Government and the Gorkha National Liberation Front in Kolkata on 22 August 1988. The ceremony took place at the Banquet Hall, Raj Bhavan (The Governor's Palace) at 10 A.M. The signatories to this tripartite agreement were: C.G. Somaih, Union Home Secretary (on the behalf of the Central Government of India), R.N. Sengupta, the State Chief Secretary (on the behalf of the Government of West Bengal) and Subhash Ghisingh (on the behalf of Gorkha National Liberation Front as the representative of the people of Darjeeling District). The Union Home Minister, Buta Singh, and the West Bengal Chief Minister, Jyoti Basu, also put their signatures on the agreement. The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act, 1988 (West Bengal Act XIII of 1988) was enacted by the West Bengal legislature which was assented to by the President of India and was first published in the Calcutta Gazette, Extraordinary of 15 October 1988. DGHC terms The DGHC was administered from 1988 to 2005 for three successive terms by the GNLF with Subhash Ghisingh as the Chairman. The fourth DGHC elections were due in 2005. However, the government decided not to hold elections and instead made Subhash Ghisingh the sole caretaker administrator of the DGHC. Ghisingh signed a Memorandum of Settlement with the government on 6 December 2005 to set up a Sixth Schedule tribal council called the Gorkha Hill Council in place of the DGHC. Opposition from various political parties, social organizations and the people prevented the implementation of this agreement. In March 2008, Ghisingh was forced to resign as caretaker after losing public support in the Darjeeling hills to Bimal Gurung-led Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. From March 2008 to August 2012, the West Bengal government appointed IAS officers as administrators of DGHC and no election to the council was held in that period. Gorkhaland Territorial Administration The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha signed a tripartite agreement with the state and central governments on 18 July 2011 for the formation of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) in the Darjeeling hills. Till the GTA body was formed, the DGHC continued in the Darjeeling hills with a Board of Administrators composed of the three MLAs from Darjeeling constituency, Kurseong constituency and Kalimpong constituency, the Darjeeling District Magistrate, and the DGHC Administrator. The GTA replaced the DGHC after the GTA body was formed in August 2012 through a West Bengal state act.

It has an ethnographic museum, an art gallery and a number of churches and chapels (24 in the village and the vicinity), the most famous of which is the SS. Constantine and Helen Church built in 1836. The houses, mostly large 2 or 3-storey buildings, are amphitheatrically set at 1,352 m above sea level. The village also has a kindergarten and a school. Local children can attend classes until the 8th grade, after which most of them continue their education in the nearby town Smolyan. A number of educational activities and concerts are organized by the local culture centre - 'chitalishte Svetlina' - on a regular basis. Thracian and Roman artifacts have been discovered close to the village. It is thought that it was founded by exiles from Raykovo (now part of Smolyan) that sought to escape forcible conversion to Islam by the Ottomans. The present village is named after Momchil Voyvoda, a medieval fighter against the Ottoman invasion that had a fortress in the area. Momchilvotsi is a large village compared to others in the Rhodopes, with 1,456 inhabitants and 550 houses, and has completely preserved its Christian character unlike many other villages in this mountainous part of the country. In the 2000s Momchilvotsi began to establish itself as a centre of tourism, more specifically snowboarding and village tourism, with small family hotels and sports facilities being established. The village's dairy production was the inspiration for the Chinese drinkable yogurt brand Momchilovtsi.

The species is found in parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia. There has been some dispute for which species the specific name aglaja (or aglaia), used twice by Linnaeus in 1758, applies - the redbase Jezebel, or the dark green fritillary (Speyeria aglaja), a brush-footed butterfly. Here, Delias pasithoe is used for the redbase Jezebel, based on the replacement name proposed by Linnaeus himself. Description =Male= Delias pasithoe from Taiwan Upperside: black. Forewing with more or less distinct, somewhat diffuse, broad streaks from base, in the discoidal cell and interspaces 1 and 2, the streak in the last the most produced; a white oval spot at lower apex of cell traversed by the lower discocellular, followed by a subterminal series of greyish-white hastate (spear-shaped) markings with their points turned inwards, the markings opposite the apex of the wing elongate and shifted a little inwards. Hindwing: a broad subbasal transverse greyish-white band merged posteriorly in a large bright yellow dorsal patch that fills the apical two-thirds, the extreme apex excepted, of interspaces 1a, 1, and of 2; a white transversely elongate spot along the middle discocellular, and beyond it a postdiscal curved series of greyish- white elongate hastate spots in interspaces 3 to 7. Underside: black. Forewing: somewhat elongate greyish-white markings in interspaces 1, 2, 3 and in cell, formed into a conspicuous oblique broad bar across the middle of the wing; a white spot at lower apex of cell and a postdiscal series of hastate spots as on the upperside. Hindwing: black, a rich dark crimson patch at base, a yellow dorsal patch as on the upperside but darker; the apical two-thirds of the cell, three spots above it and one below at bases of interspaces 3, 6 and 7 respectively and a curved discal series of elongate spots beyond apex of cell, rich chrome-yellow; of these latter spots the spot in interspace 5 is much the longest. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen above black, abdomen on the sides and below grey. =Female= Upperside of Delias pasithoe - mounted specimen Upperside: brownish black. Forewing: markings as in the male, but the cellular streak and the streaks in interspaces 1 and 2 below the cell short and formed into a broken oblique broad greyish-white band across the wing. Hindwing: markings similar to those in the male, but the basal crimson patch of the underside seen through by transparency, the transverse broad subbasal band and dorsal patch both pale yellow and much broader than in the male, and the postdiscal curved series of hastate spots obscure and ill-defined.

A manga adaptation was published in Comic Blade in 2005.  Plot  The story is divided in two story arcs. The \\"Heian Chapter\\" takes place in Kyoto during the Heian period and follows Minamoto no Hikaru, the younger sister of Minamoto no Raik≈ç, on a quest to save Japan. The \\"Tokyo Chapter\\" follows the reincarnations of Hikaru and her comrades as the ancient evils of days past manifest themselves in present-day Tokyo. = Heian Chapter = The \\"Heian Chapter\\" is set in the middle of the Heian period, where the people of the capital of Kyoto are in deep agony, focusing their last hopes on the retrieval of the five magatama that represent the five elements (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth). Legend has it that when the magatama are laid together, their circle of Affinity will save the capital from suffering and whoever places the last stone is to become the emperor. Three of the Magatamas are scattered throughout Japan. The Emperor, relying on the prophecies of Abe no Seimei, delegates the task of recovering the three lost Magatamas to Minamoto no Raik≈ç of the Minamoto clan. However, Raik≈ç is struck by an epidemic and barely able to move. Instead his younger sister, Hikaru, secretly takes his place. Hikaru is joined by Watanabe no Tsuna, Usui Sadamitsu, Urabe no Suetake and Kintar≈ç and manages to collect all but one magatama: the Magatama of Fire. Hikaru returns to the capital with news that Shutendouji, who possesses the missing magatama, has plans to attack. The court does not believe her, but Hikaru and her party decide to stop Shutendouji and recover the last magatama. With the five magatama in hand, Seimei's true intent is revealed. The onmyoji plans to create a circle of Enmity and bring about the destruction of the capital in order to save it. Hikaru confronts Abe no Seimei, only to find out that he is none other than Mansairaku, her love. She tries to shoot him with an arrow but she is constantly held back by her feelings. Hikaru keeps demanding that Mansairaku stop his destructive spell, but he does not listen. She charges towards him with her dagger, but fails to pierce his heart, and he continues with the spell. Just after the final pillar of light appears and the destruction of the capital begins, Hikaru starts to play her flute, a sound that Mansairaku always loved. Hikaru then tries to remove one of the Magatamas and stops the spell. When she tries, her flute falls on the Magatama of Fire and breaks it, causing the spell to end. As a result, Hikaru's and Mansairaku's souls fly to heaven. As the capital settles from its near destruction, Sadamitsu and Kintaro, the only surviving heroes of Hikaru's group, lay to rest the souls of Hikaru, Tsuna and Urabe. Kintaro asks Sadamitsu, \\" Where did they go?\\" To which Sadamitsu answers, \\"They went off to this place full of flowers, some place far away.\\" = Tokyo Chapter = The \\"Tokyo Chapter\\" follows the reincarnations of Hikaru and her comrades in present-day Tokyo. Hikaru is a high school student and the landlady of an apartment housing called Minamoto Heights. While her tenants include the freelance writer Tsuna, the fortuneteller Urabe, Sadamitsu and a little boy named Kintaro. Hikaru's brother, Raiko, has been missing for a year when she sees him for the first time amidst a crowd of people in Tokyo. While the story evolves, Hikaru is confronted with even stranger events, like the appearance of a ghost train on the Yamanote-Line and the recurring encounters with Mansairaku. Eventually, Hikaru finds out the locations where paranormal phenomena are occurring are related and interacting because of their affinity with the five elements. The Japanese capital is, once again, threatened with destruction. Hikaru, Hikaru's party and Mansairaku join forces to restore the circle of Affinity and save Tokyo. Having put right the ancient wrongs, Mansairaku vanishes and Hikaru's brother returns.

Political Creation Recent investigations suggest that its political creation happened on 12 February 1821 when General San Mart√≠n, while staying in Huaura (village north of Lima), founded four departments including Huaylas, which had Caraz as its capital. In 1857 it was split in two, giving birth to the new province of Huaraz. The District of Caraz was created by the Administration of Liberation of Don Sim√≥n Bolivar, legitimized by law on December 29, 1857, and sanctioned a year later. The city of Caraz became the capital of the Province of Huaylas on July 25, 1857. Etymology The origin of the name Caraz is uncertain. One possibility is that it derives from the quechua word QARA-PUNKu, meaning \\"leather door\\", as the doors in Caraz were once covered with leather. Don Celso V. Torres maintains that the name comes from the quechua word KALLASH meaning sterile and without vegetation. Another possibility is that it comes from the quechua word QARAS, referring to the mag√ºey plants found in the area. Location The town is located at an elevation of about 2250 m in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range. It keeps the traditional architecture and life style of an Andean village, as the remaining cities in the valley were destroyed after the 1970 Ancash earthquake. Communications Caraz is 460 km NE from Lima (Peru's capital) via the Panamerican Highway (Route 1N) until km 202, then turn to the East via Route 3N through Huaraz. From Chimbote via the Canyon del Pato (184 km), the first 64 km until Chiquicara are paved, then a dirt road, and finally the last 22 km before Caraz again paved. There are daily flights from Lima Jorge Chavez International, via LC Busre, flying with Fairchild 19-seat Metroliner III, the Anta airport (ATA) is about 45 km S from Caraz. Tourist attractions Caraz is a popular destination for trekking and day walks into the Huascaran National Park, and offers a much quieter and safer option when compared with Huaraz. The weather (due to the altitude) is gentle and provides a comfortable stay. Paron Lake, the largest lake on the Cordillera Blanca, is 32 km East from the city, at 4200m, and is surrounded by 15 snow peaks. Canyon del Pato, a rock formation, resulting from the approach of Cordilleras Blanca and Negra, 22 km north from the city. Puya Raimondii, the largest flower in the world, it grows at 4200m at Huashta Punta pass, on the Cordillera Negra, 45 km West from the city. Tumshukayko, a pre inca remain dating about 3000 years old. Fine stone work on what it seems to be a place for worship, 1 km north from the Plaza de Armas. Santa Cruz valley, 28 km NE from the city, it's the famous 4-day trek Santa Cruz - Llankanuku, that leads to visit the not less famous mounts Alpamayo 5947m (World's Most Beautiful Mountain) and Artesonraju 6025m (Paramount's live logo).

It is similar to those of the other cities of the Callej√≥n de Huaylas. Its name derives from qarwash which means yellow, that is to say, the color of the retama flowers (broom flowers) that covers the hills that are contiguous to the city. From its main square, the snow-capped mountain Wallqan (6,126 m) can be seen. This mountain is known as the second Waskaran. The city displays a Hispanic and colonial style, keeping its old casonas. The zone, located in the right margin of the Santa river, has a moderate and agreeable climate. It also has abundant agricultural products, especially fragrant fruits. In the surroundings, there are propitious places for hunting tarukas, partridges and viscachas, as well as for fishing trout.

The church is a Co-cathedral to the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, a diocese which includes the Italo-Albanian (Arb√´resh√´) communities in Sicily who officiate the liturgy according to the Byzantine Rite in the ancient Greek language and Albanian languageThe liturgical languages of the parish are ancient Greek (as is the tradition for Eastern churches) and Albanian (the language of the Italo-Albanian faithful, the Arb√´resh√´ people). The Church bears witness to the Eastern religious and artistic culture still present in Italy today, further contributed by the Albanian exiles who took refuge in southern Italy and Sicily from the 15th century under the pressure of Turkish-Ottoman persecutions in Albania and the Balkans. The latter influence has left considerable traces in the painting of icons, in the religious rite, in the language of the parish, in the traditional customs of some Albanian colonies in the province of Palermo. The community is part of the Catholic Church, but follows the ritual and spiritual traditions that largely share it with the Orthodox Church. The church is characterized by the multiplicity of styles that meet, because, with the succession of centuries, it was enriched by various other tastes in art, architecture and culture. Today, it is, in fact, as a church-historical monument, the result of multiple transformations, also subject to protection. Since 3 July 2015 it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site within the Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal√π and Monreale itinerary. History The divine coronation of Roger II of Sicily The interior of the Martorana, before restoration (19th-century paintings). The name Ammiraglio (\\"admiral\\") derives from the founder of the church, the Syrian christian admiral and principal minister of King Roger II of Sicily, George of Antioch. The foundation charter of the church (which was initially Eastern Orthodox), in ancient Greek and Arabic, is preserved and dates to 1143; construction may already have begun at this point. The church had certainly been completed by the death of George in 1151, and he and his wife were interred in the narthex. In 1184 the Arab traveller Ibn Jubayr visited the church, and later devoted a significant portion of his description of Palermo to its praise, describing it as \\"the most beautiful monument in the world.\\" After the Sicilian Vespers of 1282 the island's nobility gathered in the church for a meeting that resulted in the Sicilian crown being offered to Peter III of Aragon.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 15-21. In 1193-94, a convent of Benedictine nuns was founded on adjacent property by Eloisa Martorana. In 1433-34, under the rule of King Alfonso of Aragon, this convent absorbed the church, which has since then been commonly known as La Martorana. The nuns extensively modified the church between the 16th century and the 18th century, making major changes to the structure and the interior decoration.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 21. The nuns of the Martorana were famous for their moulded marzipan, which they made in the form of various fruits. Although the convent no longer exists, frutta di Martorana are still one of Palermo's most famous and distinctive foodstuffs. In 1937 the church returned to the Byzantine rite with the Albanian community present in Palermo. Today, it is used by the Italo- Albanian Catholic Church for their services and shares cathedral status with the church cathedral of San Demetrio Megalomartire in Piana degli Albanesi. The church assumed and inherited the title of seat of the parish of the Italo- Albanians residing in San Nicol√≤ dei Greci (for \\"Greeks\\" those Albanian populations were exchanged which, from the fifteenth century in Italy and Sicily, kept \\"Greek rite\\" or Byzantine, language, customs, identity) in 1945, after the homonymous church adjacent to the Italo-Albanian Seminary of Palermo was destroyed in the Second World War. The church was recently restored and reopened for community worship in 2013; at that juncture clergy and the community was momentarily welcomed in the church of the Santa Macrina of the Italian-Albanian nuns in Palermo. The parish of San Nicol√≤ dei Greci does not have a real parish territory, but is the reference point for 15,000 faithful Arb√´resh√´ (the Albanian community of Sicily historically settled in the province of Palermo) residing in the city and who professes the Byzantine rite. Since 2015, the airport of the \\"Arab-Norman Itinerary of Palermo, Cefal√π and Monreale\\" as a World Heritage Site is one of the monuments proposed by UNESCO. = The name of the Parish = Marble plaque in memory of the Albanian hero Scanderbeg (1968) By tradition it continues to be called \\"of the Greeks\\", an improper definition, since the parish belongs ecclesiastically to the Albanians of Sicily (Albanesi di Sicilia in Italian). Greek was defined - by to the not Arb√´resh√´ people, the Latins - the Byzantine rite for the liturgical language used. There is, however, the increasingly used variant today of \\"Parrocchia San Nicol√≤ or Nicola degli Italo-Albanesi\\". It is called by its faithful albanophones \\"Klisha Arb√´reshe Palerm√´\\" or simply \\"Marturan√´\\" and in the non-colloquial version \\"Famullia / Klisha e Sh√´n Kollit i Arb√´resh√´vet n√´ Palerm√´\\". You can also often read the title \\"Parrocchia San Nicol√≤ dei Greci alla Martorana\\", this to mean that the parish is now based in the \\"Martorana\\" and not in the initial location in Via Seminario Italo- Albanese.  Liturgy and rite  Women in traditional Albanian costume from Piana degli Albanesi The liturgical rites, the wedding ceremonies, the baptism and the festivities religious of the parish of San Nicol√≤ dei Greci follow the Byzantine calendar and the Albanian tradition of the communities of the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi.N¬∞ 1 PALERMO, DOMENICA DELL'ORTODOSSIA PRESSO LA CHIESA DELLA MARTORANA, 13 Febbraio 2013N¬∞4 DOMENICA DELL'ORTODOSSIA A PALERMO CHIESA DELLA MARTORANA, 13 Febbraio 2013III¬∞ Domenica di Quaresima Venerazione della Santa Croce, Parrocchia S.

It is not uncommon here to hear the priest and the faithful speaking habitually in Albanian, in fact the language is the main element that identifies them in a specific belonging ethnic.

The three apses in the east adjoin directly on the naos, instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in contemporary Byzantine architecture in the Balkans and Asia Minor.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 29-30. In the first century of its existence the church was expanded in three distinct phases; first through the addition of a narthex to house the tombs of George of Antioch and his wife; next through the addition of a forehall; and finally through the construction of a centrally- aligned campanile at the west. The campanile, which is richly decorated with three orders of arches and lodges with mullioned windows, still serves as the main entrance to the church. Significant later additions to the church include the Baroque fa√ßade which today faces onto the piazza. In the late 19th century, historically-minded restorers attempted to return the church to its original state, although many elements of the Baroque modifications remain.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 42ff. Certain elements of the original church, in particular its exterior decoration, show the influence of Islamic architecture on the culture of Norman Sicily. A frieze bearing a dedicatory inscription runs along the top of the exterior walls; although its text is in Greek, its architectural form references the Islamic architecture of north Africa.For the text of the inscription, see Lavagnini, \\"L'epigramma.\\" The recessed niches on the exterior walls are likewise derive from the Islamic architectural tradition. In the interior, a series of wooden beams at the base of the dome bear a painted inscription in Arabic; the text is derived from the Christian liturgy (the Epinikios Hymn and the Great Doxology). The church also boasted an elaborate pair of carved wooden doors, today installed in the south fa√ßade of the western extension, which relate strongly to the artistic traditions of Fatimid north Africa.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 35ff. On account of these \\"Arabic\\" elements, the Martorana has been compared with its Palermitan contemporary, the Cappella Palatina, which exhibits a similar hybrid of Byzantine and Islamic forms.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 66. Interior The church is renowned for its spectacular interior, which is dominated by a series of 12th century mosaics executed by Byzantine craftsmen. The mosaics show many iconographic and formal similarities to the roughly contemporary programs in the Cappella Palatina, in Monreale Cathedral and in Cefal√π Cathedral, although they were probably executed by a distinct atelier.Kitzinger, Mosaics, 261-62. The walls display two mosaics taken from the original Norman fa√ßade, depicting King Roger II, George of Antioch's lord, receiving the crown of Sicily from Jesus, and, on the northern side of the aisle, George himself, at the feet of the Virgin. The depiction of Roger was highly significant in terms of its iconography. In Western Christian tradition, kings were customarily crowned by the Pope or his representatives; however, Roger is shown in Byzantine dress being crowned by Jesus in the Byzantine fashion. Roger was renowned for presenting himself as an emperor during his reign, being addressed as basileus (\\"king\\" in ancient Greek). The mosaic of the crowning of Roger carries a Latin inscription written in ancient Greek characters (Rogerios Rex Œ°ŒüŒìŒïŒ°ŒôŒüŒ£ Œ°ŒóŒû \\"king Roger\\"). The nave dome is occupied by the traditional byzantine image of Christ Pantokrator surrounded by the archangels St Michael, St Gabriel, St Raphael and St Uriel. The register below depicts the eight prophets of the Old Testament and, in the pendentives, the four evangelists of the New Testament. The nave vault depicts the Nativity and the Death of the Virgin. The newer part of the church is decorated with later frescoes of comparatively little artistic significance. The frescoes in the middle part of the walls are from the 18th century, attributed to Guglielmo Borremans.

Characteristically simple groups are sometimes also termed elementary groups. Characteristically simple is a weaker condition than being a simple group, as simple groups must not have any proper nontrivial normal subgroups, which include characteristic subgroups. A finite group is characteristically simple if and only if it is the direct product of isomorphic simple groups. In particular, a finite solvable group is characteristically simple if and only if it is an elementary abelian group. This does not hold in general for infinite groups; for example, the rational numbers form a characteristically simple group that is not a direct product of simple groups. A minimal normal subgroup of a group G is a nontrivial normal subgroup N of G such that the only proper subgroup of N that is normal in G is the trivial subgroup.

The school was founded in 1989 as the successor of several other secondary (and one intermediate) schools the oldest of which was founded in 1871. Kavanagh is the only Catholic secondary school in Dunedin and is open to enrolments from throughout the entire city. The school's proprietor is the Bishop of Dunedin. Establishment Kavanagh College began operations in 1989 on the former sites and in the former buildings of St Paul's High School (formerly called Christian Brothers High School), the Christian Brothers Junior School and St Dominic's College, between Rattray and Tennyson streets, the three sites being adjacent to each other. The college is named after the fourth Catholic Bishop of Dunedin John Patrick Kavanagh (Bishop, 1957‚Äì1985). Due to a lack of space, the junior classes were accommodated at \\"south site\\" (formerly Moreau College) until 1993 when a new 18 classroom block was completed at a cost of $4 million. Further redevelopment in the 1990s saw the completion of a biology laboratory in an extended science block, the construction of a new auditorium accommodating 411 people and remodelled library, music studios and offices. In 2011, Kavanagh College expanded from its restricted main site by purchasing buildings and a carpark on the opposite side of Tennyson Street from Otago Polytechnic and thus increasing the area of the college by 25%. Two of the buildings were demolished, their sites becoming a green area used for school recreation. One of the buildings was kept and used for 6 classrooms. That building (on the corner of York Place) has a historic connection with the important New Zealand artist Colin McCahon as that was where he was trained. 25th anniversary On 25 October 2014, the College celebrated its silver jubilee (25 years) with a well-attended Mass at the Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin. This was also a celebration of the sesquicentennial of Catholic education in Dunedin (150 years), with all schools and parishes in the city taking part. At the end of the Mass, a plaque commemorating the three founding orders of Kavanagh College ‚Äì the Dominican Sisters, Sisters of Mercy and Christian Brothers was blessed and was later placed at the college.Vaughan Elder, \\"Mass on Grand scale as Catholics Combine\\", Otago Daily Times, 27 October, 2014. (Retrieved 8 January 2015) Character Kavanagh college is a large central city co-educational school which serves the entire city of Dunedin as the only Catholic secondary school in that city. It is an integrated school with a \\"special character\\" in terms of the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975. This special character is broadly the connection of the school with the Catholic faith. Preference of enrolment is given to students who have established a link with the Catholic Church through baptism or membership of a parish. Preference is decided by the appropriate parish priest in each case. A preference certificate from the student's parish is required for each student with their application for enrolment at the school. Under the Act, the school may enrol \\"non-preference\\" students but the enrolment of such students is restricted to 5% of the total roll. The College does not have an enrollment scheme which means that there is no restriction on enrollment because of a student's location of residence. The main contributing schools to the college are the Catholic parish schools of Dunedin. Enrolments come from both urban schools and rural schools. Roll of Honour Kavanagh honours former students who died in war. Many former Christian Brothers students died on war service during the First World War. For example, there were at least 83 war deaths from an average school attendance in 1893‚Äì1895 of 256 boys meaning that 32.42 percent of boys enrolled at that time died overseas in action. 49 ex-students of the Christian Brothers died in World War II . Culture Kavanagh college emphasises cultural accomplishment including drama group and a Television Network (or K.T.V.N, which stands for Kavanagh Television and Video Network). A Cultural Awards ceremony is held annually to celebrate cultural achievement. Each year all Kavanagh College students are given the opportunity to participate in the annual musical. The students can participate in the cast, band, or technical crew. The annual musicals are as follows: * West Side Story (2002); * Fame (2003); * Godspell (2004); * Les Mis√©rables (2005); * The Wiz (2006); * The Boy Friend (2007); * Footloose (2008); * Disco Inferno (2009); * Jesus Christ Superstar (2010); * Grease (2011); * Chicago (2012); * Cabaret (2013); * A Dream To Share (a montage of songs from a variety of past musicals, celebrating 25 years of Kavanagh musicals) (2014); * Oliver!

There were very few Catholics there. However, in March 1861 gold was discovered at the Lindis Pass and Gabriel Read made public his successful discovery of gold at Tuapeka in June. The situation dramatically changed. Every steamer reaching Port Chalmers or Bluff was packed with would-be miners, many of whom were Catholics. Accordingly, Bishop Viard (Bishop of the Catholic diocese of Wellington in which Dunedin was located at that time) appointed Father Delphin Moreau SM, who had visited Otago in April 1859, to be its first resident priest. Mass was said in the courthouse until St Joseph's Church was completed in July 1862. In 1864 the Catholic population of Otago was estimated at over 15,000; chapels (many of them rough and ready) sprang up in the diggings and main towns, and schools came into existence. A school was opened in 1863 and was called St Joseph's School (it still exists as a primary school). \\"When the old wooden Provincial Government buildings were replaced by new brick ones, the former were sold. Father Moreau secured some of them for his school. One large room was put on the side of the Rattrey Street gully, below the church. It was divided into two parts ‚Äì one for the boys and one for the girls. Other parts of the buildings were used as a coach house and stables.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy, O.P. Star in the South: The Centennial History of the New Zealand Dominican Sisters, St Dominic's Priory, Dunedin, 1970, p. 31. In 1864, the boys at the school were taught by Mr Shepherd and the girls were taught by Miss Campion.A G Butchers, Young New Zealand, Dunedin, Coulls Somerville Wilkie Ltd., Dunedin, 1929, p. 154. In 1870 Mr Shepherd still taught the boys and the girls were taught by Miss Conway. \\"Father Moreau took a great interest in the schools and was constantly among the children in the playground, always wearing his cassock which was green with age; he knew every child and was loved by them all. His hope was to obtain brothers and nuns to staff his schools.\\"Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy, O.P., p. 31. =St Dominic's College (1871‚Äì1976)= On Monday 20 February 1871, the Dominican Sisters who had arrived with the first Catholic Bishop of Dunedin, Patrick Moran, on 11 February, took charge of the girls' school. On 27 February a High School, St Dominic's College, for day pupils was opened. This school also took a small number of boarders. There were 27 boarders in a total role of approximately 200 in 1971, the centennial year of the college.Dominican Star: Centennial Year 1971, St Dominic's College, 1971, pp. 7 and 25.Sister Mary Augustine McCarthy, O.P., pp. 37 and 38.

A school for boys was built on Rattray Street. In 1915 a new brick building fronting Tennyson Street replaced the original school. The name of the school changed to Christian Brothers High School in 1928. Rapidly rising rolls in the 1950s led to the diocese purchasing properties in both Rattray and Tennyson Streets and converting them to classrooms.\\" It was clear that the rebuilding of Christian Brothers High School was not sufficient and that a more permanent solution was called for. This occurred in 1964, when a fine new building was erected fronting Rattray St, and Christian Brothers High School became St Pauls High School. The school celebrated its centennial in 1976. The older school building, housing the primary department, became a separate entity and was known as Christian Brothers' Junior School.J.C. O'Neill, The History of the Work of the Christian Brothers in New Zealand, unpublished Dip. Ed. thesis, University of Auckland, 1968. p. 66; Graeme Donaldson, p. 6. The Christian Brothers lived opposite the school. The school closed in 1989. =St Philomena's College (1897‚Äì1976)= On the morning of Sunday, 17 January 1897, the Sisters of Mercy arrived in Dunedin from Ireland at the invitation of Michael Verdon the second Catholic Bishop of Dunedin. The sisters established themselves in South Dunedin and in April 1897 opened a high school for girls. It was opened \\" ... with the very small roll of four pupils.\\" This was the beginning of St Philomena's College.Sister M Stephanie, Divide and Share: The Story of Mercy in the South 1897‚Äì1997, The Sisters of Mercy, Dunedin 1996, pp. 13 and 18; Sister M Regis (ed), The Philomenian; Celebrating 100 years, St Philomena's College Centenary Committee, 1997. =St Edmund's School (1949‚Äì1989)= To help relieve the pressure on the Christian Brother's Rattray Street school roll a second school, St Edmund's, was opened in South Dunedin in 1949. This was a primary school for boys from about 9 years of age to 12 years of age (Standard 3 (Year 5) to Form 2 (Year 8)). The school closed as part of the reorganising of the Catholic schools in Dunedin in 1989.Graeme Donaldson, pp. 7 and 8. =Moreau College (1976‚Äì1989)= Early in the 1970s the roll numbers at both of Dunedin's Catholic girls' colleges, St Dominic's and St Philomena's, showed a slight reduction. At the same time, the demand for a greater variety of options for girls, particularly in the upper secondary classes, was gradually increasing so that it was becoming more difficult to maintain a full secondary school with a roll of less than 500. \\"It also had to be taken into account that the buildings at St Dominic's in Rattray Street were deteriorating and the cost of repair or renewal was considerable.\\" The buildings at St Philomena's were newer and in a much better condition. It was therefore decided to merge the two schools on the St Philomena's site in 1976. The new college was called Moreau College after the first resident priest of Dunedin.Sister M. Stephanie, pp. 103 and 104. Moreau College was closed in 1989 and its students transferred to the new Kavanagh College. =Confluence (1989)= In 1989 the new Catholic co-educational school, Kavanagh College, resulting from the amalgamation of Moreau College for girls and St Paul's High School (i.e. the Christian Brothers School) for boys, commenced. The senior classes of St Edmund's School (i.e. years 7 and 8) transferred to the new college. The junior classes (Years 5 and 6) were accommodated in Dunedin Catholic primary schools and St Edmund's closed. The religious orders of Dominican Sisters, Christian Brothers, and the Sisters of Mercy were the teaching foundation of the amalgamation. Vincent Jury was appointed as the first principal of the new college. He was the last of the 23 Christian Brother Principals to exercise authority in Rattray Street in the 115 years from 1876 to 1991.Graeme Donaldson, p. 8. The decision to end the tradition of Catholic single-sex education in Dunedin (especially the closing of Moreau College) and to combine the Catholic secondary schools into a co- educational college was controversial especially in relation to senior staff appointments at the new college.Articles \\"Shock that Moreau thought expendable\\" and \\"True equality for women the task\\" in the New Zealand Tablet 4 December 1985 page 6  Notable alumni  The following persons were educated at Kavanagh College or any of its predecessor schools. = The Arts = * Winifred Kathleen Joan Davin (1909‚Äì1995) ‚Äì Teacher, community worker, editor (St Dominic's) * Kylie Price ‚Äì New Zealand singer-songwriter. * Jordan Mullin ‚Äì Ballerina, Staatsballet BerlinNigel Benson, \\"Dunedin teen to dance in London\\", Otago Daily Times, 14 December 2010.

Castle Wemyss was a large mansion in Wemyss Bay, Scotland. It stood on the southern shore of the Firth of Clyde at Wemyss Point, where the firth turns southwards. History It was built around 1850 for Charles Wilsone Brown, a property developer who had plans to develop the land around Wemyss Bay, and who by 1855 had increased the number of villas from four to thirty-six. These villas earned the nickname 'Little Glasgow' because they were let to wealthy Glasgow merchants.Smart, Walter (1968) Skelmorlie, Sklemorlie and Wemyss Bay Community Centre Wilsone Brown sold the mansion to Sir John Burns (later Baron Inverclyde) in 1860. Burns commissioned the architect Robert William Billings to remodel the house in the Scottish baronial style, expanding the original structure by adding a new floor, new wings and a clock tower to the south-east corner. Castle Wemyss became a fashionable destination for many well-known visitors, including Lord Shaftesbury, Anthony Trollope, General Sherman, Henry Morton Stanley, Peter II of Yugoslavia, Emperor Haile Selassie and members of the British royal family. It is reputed that Trollope wrote part of Barchester Towers whilst at Wemyss Bay, and that 'Portray Castle' in The Eustace Diamonds was based on Castle Wemyss.Trollope, Anthony, The Eustace Diamonds, Chapter XXI: Ianthe's Soul Whether this is true or not, Trollope places Portray in a similar geographical location, with a description which is very like that of the castle and its grounds. Trollope did however include the real Castle Wemyss in his travelogue How the 'Mastiffs' Went to Iceland, a record of a trip from the Clyde to Iceland in June and July 1878.Digitized version of How the 'Mastiffs' Went to Iceland at The Internet Archive The house remained in the Burns family until the death of Alan, 4th Baron Inverclyde, in 1957. None of his family was able to afford the cost of maintaining such a large property and it was sold to a developer. Inverkip Power Station was built on the northern part of the estate grounds. Subsequent Use Castle Wemyss Place, built on the site of Castle Wemyss Greenfield legislation meant that whilst much of the larger estate was developed as Wemyss Bay grew in the 1960s and 1970s, the house itself was left untouched. Gradually falling into decay (and subsequently de-roofed to avoid payment of housing rates) it was not until 1984 that it was finally demolished. In the 1990s the grounds themselves were finally redeveloped, and all that now remains of the house is a broken flight of stone steps and a flagpole. An established monkey puzzle tree marking the entrance to the drive had to be removed for safety reasons. However, the locally formed Woodlands Trust have started to reclaim the Victorian fernery from the rhododendrons. Formal paths have now been established in the woods which are immediately adjacent to the site of the former castle.

Parabiago (Milanese: ; ) is a town located in the north-western part of the Metropolitan City of Milan, Lombardy, northern Italy. The Maggi-Corvini Villa. The town is crossed by the road to Sempione (S.S.33) and MilanGallarate Railway; nearby flow the Olona river and the Canale Villoresi. History =Ancient history and Middle Ages= Starting from the first Celtic-insubrian settlement (4th century BC), it developed during the Roman Empire rule, as documented by various archaeological discoveries of little objects, including the Parabiago Plate, a silver plate probably used to cover an ashes urn. In the Early Middle Ages, Parabiago was the centre of a parish (pieve) and of an autonomous county, named Comitatus Parabiagi and sometimes Burgaria, governed by the Sanbonifacio family, of Frankish descent, coming from Verona; in the 7th century, it received by the Lombard queen Theodelinda the permission for a little artificial stream, named Riale or R√∂ngia, which took water from the Olona river and travelled through the village: that stream lasted until the 1928, when it was definitively stilted up. The Truce of Parabiago (2829 August 1257) led to the Pace di Sant'Ambrogio (Saint Ambrose's Peace), so called because it was signed in the homonymous Basilica in Milan). It put an end to the risk of a civil war between nobles and people in the free commune of Milan. On 21 February 1339, it was the location of the Battle of Parabiago between Lodrisio Visconti and Luchino Visconti with his nephew Azzone, for the dominion over the Duchy of Milan; the battle was won by the Milanese regular army; according to tradition, this happened thanks to the miraculous apparition of Saint Ambrose. During this time, the Crivelli family inherited from the Sanbonifacio family the County of Parabiago, perhaps still corresponding with the Burgaria County. In the following centuries Parabiago had a slow decline; it suffered two pillages, in 1449 by Francesco Sforza and in 1527 by Bourbons of Spain, as well as two epidemics (1529 and 1540). =Modern Age= The Castelli Palace, called la Torre (the Tower) During Spanish rule in the Duchy of Milan, the Marquis Camillo Castelli bought the Fief of Parabiago for 8800 lire (26 September 1658); the family extinguished in 1783, with the death of Cardinal Giuseppe Castelli. Parabiago developed in the 18th century, during the Austrian rule. Between the 19th and 20th centuries the Industrial Revolution reached Parabiago. The most active industrialists were Felice Gajo, who established the Unione Manifatture di Parabiago (United Manufacturing of Parabiago) (textiles), and Paolo Castelnuovo, who founded in 1899 the first shoe factory in the town. Since then, Parabiago is known as the Citt√† della Calzatura (Shoes City). =20th century= In the 1960s Parabiago like other cities and towns in Northern Italy experienced an economic boom followed by a demographic one. Industrialization caught on, the little traditional shoemakers established middle and big shoe factories; chemical and mechanical industries were born, and attracted immigration from Southern Italy. On 27 November 27, 1985 the town took the title of City. In the early 1990s the majority of the Town Council, formed by D.C. (Christian Democracy), P.S.I. (Italian Socialist Party) and P.R.I. (Italian Republican Party), was forced to resign by the Tangentopoli scandal about the new urbanistic plan, and some important local politicians were arrested. Transport In the district there is one stop of Metro Line S5, even if there is a project of the construction of another stop near the border with Nerviano Bourough. One Regional Railway station operated by Trenord is present in the city. Some Movibus (local bus lines) link the town with other boroughs.

It lies approximately west of Le≈ºajsk and north-east of the regional capital Rzesz√≥w. In 2006 the village had a population of 3,200. Brz√≥za Kr√≥lewska is divided into the following parts: Podb√≥r, Stƒôpnie, Bednarze, Kmiecie, Zagrody, ≈Åoiny, Flisy, Piaski, Podso≈õnina, Chiny. History Brz√≥za Kr√≥lewska was first mentioned in 1565. Its current location was not inhabited then and was only a hunting area known as over the birch (za brzozƒÖ). It was first settled in the mid-17th century. The area was originally a temporary shelter against Tatars raids for the people of Giedlarowa. Life was not easy for early occupants as the soil was not fertile. It was difficult to earn a living and have sufficient food provisions. However, over time, the population of Brz√≥za increased as a result of wolnizna (settlers did not have to pay rent for land in the beginning) granted to inhabitants by the starost from Le≈ºajsk - ≈Åukasz Opali≈Ñski. After first partition of Poland Brz√≥za Kr√≥lewska was a part of the Austrian Empire. At the end of the 18th century there were approximately 1,500 occupants. In 1830, a Roman Catholic parish was created (earlier Brz√≥za Kr√≥lewska was under supervision of Giedlarowa parish). In 1914, the original wooden church was rebuilt in brick temple. During World War II, the village remained relatively free from German persecution. Only one Polish family was executed for hiding Jews. Overview The village is located between forests which are remains of the \\"Sandomierska Wilderness\\". It was included in the \\"Brz√≥≈∫nia≈Ñski Obszar Chronionego Krajobrazu\\" (nature preserve) formed in 1992 (which contains an area of 118 square kilometres - of which 75% are woods). It is the most precious site there, and is especially known for its peat bog reserve called Suchy ≈Åug. A water reservoir was created where Tartaczny stream connects with Tarlaka river. It is mainly used for firefighting purposes but is also a well-known tourist attraction. There are many beaver lodges on Tarlaka river. The beaver activity in this area has created many ponds and backwaters, making the landscape suitable for many rare birds and other forms of wildlife. Other sites worth seeing include the former Potocki Park, which has larch alleus. In the same place, a memorial shrine was consecrated in 1923 for Dear Dziula, from Stecki's family. There is also a memorial stone with the epitaphy In memory of Adam Zamojski, for eternity Alfred Potocki and Jerzy Potocki, 1933. Brz√≥za Kr√≥lewska is typical agricultural village with some tourism. There are such educational posts like: kindergarten, elementary school and gymnasium. There is also a bakery and tourist resort. A large number of its inhabitants work in nearby Le≈ºajsk. As a cultural enterprise: Brzozoki - folk band, was created and brass band which is part of Voluntary Fire Service. There is also football and cycling club: Azalia.

The city is the centre of a district, made up of 11 comuni, which form the Venezia Orientale with the San Don√† di Piave district. History Portogruaro was officially founded in 1140, when the Archbishop of Concordia, Gervinus, gave a group of fishermen (Giovanni Venerio, Arpone, Bertaldo, Borigoio, Enrico Mosca, Giovanni Salimbene) the right to settle there and build a river port. A castle had existed on the site as early as the 10th century. In 1420, after centuries under Patria del Friuli, was conquered by the Republic of Venice. According to Bertolini the town's foundation could be coeval to the Concordia Sagittaria's one. Under the Venetians the town retained some autonomy and was able to expand economically up until the economic decline of Venice from the 17th century onwards. Following the upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars, Portogruaro was incorporated into the Austrian Empire in 1815. Apart from a brief uprising in 1848 Portogruaro remained under Austrian control until 1866 when it entered the newly unified Kingdom of Italy. Since that time the population of Portogruaro has grown from under 10,000 to around 25,000. Main sights * Romanesque Abbey of Summaga (11th century).

The book covers the experiences of Ruby Lennox, a girl from a working-class English family living in York. The museum of the title is York Castle Museum, which includes among its exhibits the fa√ßades of old houses from the city, similar to the one in which Ruby's family lives. By interspersing flashbacks with the narrative of Ruby's own life, the book chronicles the lives of six generations of women from Ruby's great-grandmother Alice to Ruby's mother's failed dreams. Ruby's own life is told in thirteen chapters, written in the first person, documenting key periods in Ruby's life from 1951 (\\"Conception\\" beginning with the words \\"I exist!\\") to 1992. Between each chapter are (non-consecutive) flashbacks that tell the story from the point of view of one of the other members of Ruby's family‚Äîincluding her great-grandmother Alice, her grandmother Nell and her mother Bunty. While mostly telling the story of the family's women, several of the flashbacks vividly depict the wartime experiences of their male relatives and lovers in both World Wars. One of the these depicts the crew of a Halifax bomber on a doomed last mission over Nazi Germany - which would become a major plot element in Atkinson's 2015 novel, A God in Ruins.

The fate of Ruby's family is revealed gradually. A number of revelations, such as the fact that Ruby's sister Gillian dies in a road accident aged 11, are revealed to the reader long before they occur. However, other revelations relating to the fate of various characters are withheld and revealed gradually throughout the novel, including: *The fact that Ruby had a twin sister, Pearl, who drowned shortly before their fourth birthday, for which Ruby was falsely blamed (Gillian lied to shift the blame from herself). Ruby has lost all memory of Pearl, and it is not until she is given hypnotherapy at the age of 18 that she remembers Pearl at all. We are given subtle hints of Pearl's existence earlier in the novel (e.g. the doctor looking surprised when Ruby was born as if he wasn't expecting it, the midwife inexplicably saying \\"Snap,\\" Ruby's mother seeming to possess twice as many pictures of Ruby as of her other children), but because everything is told from Ruby's point of view, their significance is not made narratively explicit. *That Ruby's great-grandmother Alice, who was believed to have died giving birth to Ruby's grandmother Nell, actually ran away with a travelling French photographer in an effort to escape her unhappy life. She spent her final years back in York, vainly searching for her children. *The whereabouts of characters who \\"disappeared\\" from family life is not explained until nearer the end of the book: these include Nell's brother Lawrence, her sister Lillian, and Ruby's sister Patricia. *The interconnections between Ruby's family, and Doreen O'Doherty, the Irish nurse. When Doreen is first mentioned, she is introduced as the person with whom Ruby's father George is having an affair. In a later flashback, we discover that Doreen had become pregnant by Edmund, Bunty's Canadian cousin (son of Nell's sister Lillian), who was in the UK on a tour of duty with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War In the final chapter, clues allow us to surmise that the nurse who is present at Bunty's 1992 death is the daughter of Doreen and Edmund, whom Doreen gave up for adoption. *The father of Edmund, whom the unmarried Lillian had steadfastly refused to name, is revealed on the final page of the footnote ahead of Chapter 11.

The formula was derived by Samuel Jefferson Mason, whom it is also named after. MGF is an alternate method to finding the transfer function algebraically by labeling each signal, writing down the equation for how that signal depends on other signals, and then solving the multiple equations for the output signal in terms of the input signal. MGF provides a step by step method to obtain the transfer function from a SFG. Often, MGF can be determined by inspection of the SFG. The method can easily handle SFGs with many variables and loops including loops with inner loops. MGF comes up often in the context of control systems and digital filters because control systems and digital filters are often represented by SFGs.  Formula  The gain formula is as follows: : G = \\\\frac{y_\\\\text{out}}{y_\\\\text{in}} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_{k=1}^N {G_k \\\\Delta _k} }{ \\\\Delta\\\\ } : \\\\Delta = 1 - \\\\sum L_i + \\\\sum L_iL_j- \\\\sum L_iL_jL_k + \\\\cdots + (-1)^m \\\\sum \\\\cdots +\\\\cdots where: *Œî = the determinant of the graph. *yin = input-node variable *yout = output-node variable *G = complete gain between yin and yout *N = total number of forward paths between yin and yout *Gk = path gain of the kth forward path between yin and yout *Li = loop gain of each closed loop in the system *LiLj = product of the loop gains of any two non- touching loops (no common nodes) *LiLjLk = product of the loop gains of any three pairwise nontouching loops *Œîk = the cofactor value of Œî for the kth forward path, with the loops touching the kth forward path removed. * =Definitions= *Path: a continuous set of branches traversed in the direction that they indicate. *Forward path: A path from an input node to an output node in which no node is touched more than once. *Loop: A path that originates and ends on the same node in which no node is touched more than once. *Path gain: the product of the gains of all the branches in the path. *Loop gain: the product of the gains of all the branches in the loop. = Procedure to find the solution = # Make a list of all forward paths, and their gains, and label these Gk. # Make a list of all the loops and their gains, and label these Li (for i loops). Make a list of all pairs of non- touching loops, and the products of their gains (LiLj). Make a list of all pairwise non-touching loops taken three at a time (LiLjLk), then four at a time, and so forth, until there are no more. # Compute the determinant Œî and cofactors Œîk. # Apply the formula. Examples =Circuit containing two- port= Signal flow graph of a circuit containing a two port. The forward path from input to output is shown in a different color.

There is one forward path (shown in a different color) and six feedback loops. The drive shaft assumed to be stiff enough to not treat as a spring.

Assume \\\\mathbf{T} is the transient matrix of the graph where t_{nm} = \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{T}\\\\right]_{nm} is the sum transmittance of branches from node m toward node n. Then, the gain from node m to node n of the graph is equal to u_{nm} = \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{U}\\\\right]_{nm}, where : \\\\mathbf{U} = \\\\left ( \\\\mathbf{I} - \\\\mathbf{T} \\\\right ) ^ {-1} , and \\\\mathbf{I} is the identity matrix. Mason's Rule is also particularly useful for deriving the z-domain transfer function of discrete networks that have inner feedback loops embedded within outer feedback loops (nested loops). If the discrete network can be drawn as a signal flow graph, then the application of Mason's Rule will give that network's z-domain H(z) transfer function. Complexity and computational applications Mason's Rule can grow factorially, because the enumeration of paths in a directed graph grows dramatically. To see this consider the complete directed graph on n vertices, having an edge between every pair of vertices. There is a path form y_\\\\text{in} to y_\\\\text{out} for each of the (n-2)! permutations of the intermediate vertices. Thus Gaussian elimination is more efficient in the general case. Yet Mason's rule characterizes the transfer functions of interconnected systems in a way which is simultaneously algebraic and combinatorial, allowing for general statements and other computations in algebraic systems theory. While numerous inverses occur during Gaussian elimination, Mason's rule naturally collects these into a single quasi-inverse. General form is ::\\\\frac{p}{1-q}, Where as described above, q is a sum of cycle products, each of which typically falls into an ideal (for example, the strictly causal operators). Fractions of this form make a subring R(1+\\\\langle L_i\\\\rangle)^{-1} of the rational function field. This observation carries over to the noncommutative case, even though Mason's rule itself must then be replaced by Riegle's rule.

Supersolvability is stronger than the notion of solvability. Definition Let G be a group. G is supersolvable if there exists a normal series :\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\} = H_0 \\\\triangleleft H_1 \\\\triangleleft \\\\cdots \\\\triangleleft H_{s-1} \\\\triangleleft H_s = G such that each quotient group H_{i+1}/H_i \\\\; is cyclic and each H_i is normal in G. By contrast, for a solvable group the definition requires each quotient to be abelian. In another direction, a polycyclic group must have a subnormal series with each quotient cyclic, but there is no requirement that each H_i be normal in G. As every finite solvable group is polycyclic, this can be seen as one of the key differences between the definitions. For a concrete example, the alternating group on four points, A_4, is solvable but not supersolvable. Basic Properties Some facts about supersolvable groups: * Supersolvable groups are always polycyclic, and hence solvable. * Every finitely generated nilpotent group is supersolvable. * Every metacyclic group is supersolvable. * The commutator subgroup of a supersolvable group is nilpotent. * Subgroups and quotient groups of supersolvable groups are supersolvable. * A finite supersolvable group has an invariant normal series with each factor cyclic of prime order. * In fact, the primes can be chosen in a nice order: For every prime p, and for œÄ the set of primes greater than p, a finite supersolvable group has a unique Hall œÄ-subgroup. Such groups are sometimes called ordered Sylow tower groups. * Every group of square-free order, and every group with cyclic Sylow subgroups (a Z-group), is supersolvable. * Every irreducible complex representation of a finite supersolvable group is monomial, that is, induced from a linear character of a subgroup. In other words, every finite supersolvable group is a monomial group. *Every maximal subgroup in a supersolvable group has prime index. *A finite group is supersolvable if and only if every maximal subgroup has prime index. *A finite group is supersolvable if and only if every maximal chain of subgroups has the same length. This is important to those interested in the lattice of subgroups of a group, and is sometimes called the Jordan‚ÄìDedekind chain condition. * By Baum's theorem, every supersolvable finite group has a DFT algorithm running in time O(n log n).

Life Born at 'Glandenys', Silian, near Lampeter, where he also died, Cayo-Evans was educated at the independent, co-educational Millfield School in the village of Street in Somerset, England. His father was John Cayo Evans, a professor of Mathematics at St David's College, Lampeter and High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in the year 1941-42. In 1955, he was conscripted for National Service, serving with the South Wales Borderers and saw active service, fighting Communist guerrillas in Malaya during the bitter Malayan emergency. On his return, he attended the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, before returning to Lampeter to breed palomino and appaloosa horses on his stud farm. He married Gillianne Mary Davies in 1965. They had three children and divorced in 1975. Political activism Best known as a leader of the Free Wales Army, Cayo-Evans appears to have become inspired during the early 1960s, especially during the building of the Tryweryn reservoir. He was 'active' in the FWA during the 1960s and along with two other members of the FWA, Dennis Coslett and Gethyn Ap Iestyn (aka Gethin ap Gruffydd), was convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions and other public order offences following a 53-day trial in 1969. He was subsequently sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment (n.b. some sources suggest thirteen months). Security services' files from the UK National Archives described Cayo-Evans having \\"a mental age of 12\\", and Coslett, his second-in-command, as \\"unbalanced\\". The documents said that authorities did not regard the Free Wales Army as a serious threat at the time.  In popular culture  In 2000, the brewery Tomos Watkin renamed the Apollo Hotel, Cardiff to \\"The Cayo Arms\\".

Black Love was preceded by the single \\"Honky's Ladder\\" and followed by the single \\"Going to Town\\" (also released as the Bonnie & Clyde EP in the US). Prior to this album's release, lead singer Greg Dulli seriously explored producing a movie in the film noir genre, but despite his optioning at least one book, the movie was never made. Dulli's ideas for a soundtrack led to the songs recorded on this album. The album was reissued on November 25, 2016 on Rhino Records, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of its initial release. The 20th anniversary reissue was released as a double CD and triple LP, and includes nine previously-unreleased tracks. Critical reception Upon its initial release, Black Love received mixed reviews from critics, who generally considered it inferior to its predecessor Gentlemen.

The comune also has city () status, thus also known as Citt√† di Giulianova. Geography The town lies in the north of the Abruzzo region, between the Salinello and the Tordino rivers. Giulianova is split between the Paese, the historic town up in the hills, and the lido, the more recent development down by the beach. Tourism plays a big part in the town's economy. The town, characterized by several beaches, is a summer retreat for people from large cities like Rome and Milan, as well as German and French tourists. History In pre-Roman times, the Praetutii tribe had a settlement there. In 3rd century BCE Romans established a colony called Castrum Novum in the vicinity of Giulianova. In the Middle Ages, the old Castrum Novum was called Castrum divi Flaviani, and remained an important trade and travel hub, until it was destroyed in 1460, during the Tordino Battle. The local baron Giulio Antonio Acquaviva, founded, in 1471, a new city up on the hill, not far from the older one, calling its Giulia. It was an interesting example of renaissance ideal city, applying the theory of the most important architects of the time, as Leon Battista Alberti and Francesco Di Giorgio Martini, with the cultural environment of whom, he was in contact. Main sights Santa Maria a Mare, the oldest church of the city. The renaissance dome of Giulianova. * Church of Santa Maria a Mare, belonging to the former city of San Flaviano. Founded before the 11th century, it is a brickwork building with a sail-like bell tower. The portal is from the late 13th century, and has a relief with \\"Madonna with Child and Animals\\", while two lions guard the sides, one holding a book and the other fighting with a snake. Under the arch are 18 stone tiles depicting enigmatic figures, described by some a representation of the Zodiac and the seasons * The octagonal Cathedral of San Flaviano, built from 1472.

He worked on the notion of identity, ethnicity, freedom, and the individual's relationship to communities and the environment. Lee's most iconic work is his performance series titled The Journey of a Yellow Man, which started as a critique of racial and ethnic identities in 1992 and has evolved into a meditation on freedom, humility, and religious practices over more than a decade. Painting his own body with bright yellow poster paint, he expresses an exaggerated symbol of his ethnic identity as a citizen of Singapore. He was also active in artist-run initiatives, especially as part of The Artists Village (TAV) in Singapore, the performance artist collective Black Market International, as well as the festivals Future of Imagination and Rooted in the Ephemeral Speak (R.I.T.E.S.). On 3 March 2019, he died due to a lung infection, at the age of 61. Education Lee Wen studied in the now defunct Kim Keat Primary School and Raffles Institution. After finishing his A levels, he worked as a logistics officer, a computer operator and a bank officer. In 1988, he left behind his banking career to enroll at the Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts at the age of 30. Lee Wen expressed himself with both painting and various non-traditional media, having influenced by performance artist Tang Da Wu and other experimental artists Amanda Heng and Vincent Leow from The Artists Village. In 1990, Lee went on to study at the City of London Polytechnic, and it was then that Lee had found his true calling as a performance artist. He went on to develop the Yellow Man persona which gained him his first recognition in the arts community. The Journey of a Yellow Man, his most iconic performance series, has included performances, mixed-media installation, and paintings.  Exhibitions and festivals  Lee Wen's work quickly gained international recognition since 1993, having performed and showcasing his artistic expressions in many international locations such as Gwangju Biennale and the 3rd Asia-Pacific Triennial in Australia in 1999. His solo exhibitions include Journey of a Yellow Man No.3: DESIRE, The Substation, Singapore (1993); Neo-Baba, VA- Nishiogi Gallery, Tokyo (1995); Handmade Tales, The Black Box, Theatreworks, Singapore (1996); Everybody Should Be Happy, Utterly Art, Singapore (2002); Strange Fruit, The Substation, Singapore (2003); Unframed 7, P-10, Singapore (2004); Freedom of Daydreams, Mothers of Imagination, Your MOTHER Gallery, Singapore (2007); and Anthropometry Revision, Soo Bin Art Gallery, Singapore (2008). In 2012, Singapore Art Museum organized a mid-career retrospective titled Lucid Dreams in the Reverie of the Real, featuring more than forty installations, photographs, and videos. In 2019, Hong Kong-based nonprofit Asia Art Archive organized an exhibition with his sketchbooks and notebooks, highlighting these as \\"sites of performance.\\" In 2003, Lee spearheaded The Future of Imagination, international performance art festival at The Substation and at the Sculpture Square in 2004, featuring international performance artists such as Alastair MacLennan from Northern Ireland, Irma Optimist from Finland, and Marilyn Arsem from USA. Lee saw the value of having an annual gathering of international artists in Singapore, to share a continuing interest in the cultural constructs of identity in the global situation and current trends of contemporary art practice, through live performances and discussion forms.  Recognition and archive  Lee taught art at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and at his alma-mater back home in Singapore. He had also taught workshops at Hanoi University of Fine Arts, University of Ulster, UK, Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana, Mexico City, and Musashino Art University, Tokyo. In 2005, Lee Wen was presented with the Cultural Medallion, the highest cultural award in Singapore, for his contributions to the development of local contemporary art scene. In 2015, Lee Wen was shortlisted for the Joseph Balestier Award for the Freedom of Art, which honors a Southeast Asian artist or curator whose work is actively committed to advocating freedom. He won the award in 2016.

History The town of Montevarchi sprang up around 1100, near to a fortified Benedictine monastery, founded by bishop Elempert (986‚Äì1010)Robert Black (2007) Education and Society in Florentine Tuscany: Teachers, Pupils and Schools, c. 1250-1500 Volume 1, Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands of Arezzo. At first the castle belonged to the Marquis Bourbon del Monte di Santa Maria, then to the Count Guidi family. In 1273 ownership passed to the Signoria of Florence. One of the town's first podest√† (mayor) was Brunetto Latini. During the rule of the Medici, the town expanded considerably due to its flourishing agricultural trade and its wool and silk industries, controlled by the Woolmaker's Guild. Montevarchi remained under Florentine control until the end of the first half of the 18th century; then the town became part of the territory of Arezzo. After the unification of Italy, it became an important centre for manufacture of felt hats and, during the post World War II period, of shoes, hats, ladies' and children's wear. Today it is still a clothes production hub, while also important in the production of electricity (one hydroelectric and one thermoelectric plant). Montevarchi at the beginning of the 20th century. Main sights =Churches= * Collegiata di San Lorenzo. The foundation of the Collegiate Church of San Lorenzo dates back to the 13th century. This so-called \\"collegiate church\\" was erected in 1561 by Pope Pius IV and the Grand Duke Cosimo de' Medici appointed Benedetto Varchi as the first magistrate of this church. Originally built in Romanesque style, the church was totally refurbished by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi in 1709 which gave it a decisive, but delicate, Baroque touch. San Lorenzo's main treasure is the Relic of the Holy Milk which, according to tradition, was given to Count Guido Guerra, Lord of Montevarchi, by Charles I of Naples on 26 February 1266 after the victorious Battle of Benevento, when Guido Guerra successfully led a Guelph formation of heavy cavalry against an onslaught. * Church of Santa Maria al Giglio. The construction was begun in 1589 after a series of miracles attributed to the fresco that now is above the main altar. These so-called miracles were, in fact, part of an elaborate hoax organized by the Fraternita del Sacro Latte, a powerful local religious brotherhood, in order to increase the value of their properties in the area. * Chiostro di Cennano. The Cloister of Cennano was formerly part of the Franciscan convent of San Ludovico suppressed in 1808. Typically Tuscan, it has the date 1471 carved in one of the capitals. The door of the cloister is dated 1522. * The Holy Milk Relic Chapel or Della Robbia Temple was reconstructed in 1973 in the Museum of Collegiata to house the recovered original 15th-century ceramic sculptures by Andrea della Robbia, removed from the church in 1709 and walled up for two centuries in the sacristy. =Museums= * Accademia Valdarnese del Poggio Library. The Library of the Academy, founded in 1805, contains 20,000 volumes, various incunabula and manuscripts including a valuable 15th century copy of The Decameron. The cassero, barracks of granducal Montevarchi's garrison. 14th-century fresco in La Ginestra Monastery. * Museo Paleontologico. The Paleontology Museum is housed in the ex-Franciscan convent of San Ludovico. The museum hosts about 1,600 fossils with samples of flora and fauna. Nearly all the fossils come from the Upper Valdarno area and date back to a period of time between upper Pliocene and lower Pleistocene. The poster for the exhibition is the original one made in 1819 by Georges Cuvier. * Museo d'Arte Sacra. The Museum of Sacred Arts of the Collegiate Church of San Lorenzo houses sculptures, frescoes, crafted gold objects, ornaments, relics and manuscripts. Of particular interest are the liturgical objects commissioned by the local Holy Milk Brotherhood and notably the ceramic sculpture by Andrea della Robbia. * Museo Ernesto Galeffi. This museum is dedicated to the artist for whom it is named who died in 1986 and hosts a huge collection of Galeffi's works donated to the community, housed in a villa donated by the Galeffi-Benini family. Ernesto Galeffi started as a graphic designer, then moved to painting and finally turned to sculpture. The museum, opened in 2001, holds 60 sculptures, 10 paintings and more than 2,000 drawings. =Shopping= * SPACE. Is Prada's outlet store that is adjacent to the Prada factory.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 9, 2011 tributary to the Klamath River in western Siskiyou County, California. Course The river has its origins in the high mountains of the Trinity Alps, Russian Mountains, and Marble Mountains (all sub-ranges of the larger Klamath Mountains). The Salmon River comprises two forks, the North Fork and the South Fork, which join at the hamlet of Forks of Salmon, California to form the 19.6-mile (31.5 km) long mainstem Salmon River. A large tributary stream, Wooley Creek, joins the mainstem Salmon River about from its mouth at Somes Bar, and is nearly as large as the North Fork. The lower portion of the Salmon River's southwestern divide defines the boundary of Siskiyou County and Humboldt County. Watershed The river's watershed is entirely within the Klamath National Forest, and less than two percent of the land area is privately owned. Nearly half of the watershed is federally protected wilderness area, including portions of the Trinity Alps Wilderness on the south, the Russian Wilderness on the east, and the Marble Mountain Wilderness on the north. Another twenty-five percent of the watershed is designated as Late Successional Reserve under the Northwest Forest Plan and is managed to enhance and retain old-growth forest characteristics and habitat. Ecology Unlike most other large California rivers, the Salmon is completely free flowing, with no dams or significant flow diversions of any kind. It is one of the most pristine areas in the Klamath River system and one of California's most pristine rivers. It retains the only viable population of wild spring Chinook salmon in the Klamath watershed and offers some of the best West Coast habitat for salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, rainbow trout, Pacific lamprey, and other fish. The mainstem Salmon River, its North Fork, South Fork, and Wooley Creek are part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, having been designated by Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus in January 1981, who was acting on California governor Jerry Brown's petition to add the rivers to the federal Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Wildfires are the most significant mechanism of ecological change and one of the greatest threats to the river and its watershed. Fires are a natural part of this ecosystem, but are now often fueled by logging slash and fuels accumulated through decades of fire suppression efforts and therefore burn much hotter, more intensely, and more frequently than they would otherwise naturally burn. Large fires in 1977, 1987, 1994, 2006, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2017 have contributed to increased erosion, causing increases in sediment in the river and its tributaries. The excessive sediment degrades the habitat of aquatic organisms, particularly for coho salmon, Chinook salmon, sturgeon and steelhead.

The Inca Empire, which lasted from 1438 to 1533 AD, represented the height of this civilization. The Inca state was known as the Kingdom of Cusco before 1438. Over the course of the empire, the rulers used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centred on the Andean mountain ranges. The empire proved relatively short-lived, however: by 1533, Atahualpa, the last Sapa Inca (emperor) of the Inca Empire, was killed on the orders of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, marking the beginning of Spanish rule. The last Inca stronghold, the Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba was conquered by the Spanish in 1572. Population Population estimates for the Tawantinsuyu society range from as few as 4.1 million people to more than 36 million. Most estimates are between 6 and 14 million people. The reason for these various estimates is that, despite that the Inca kept excellent census records using their quipus, knowledge of how to read them has been lost. Almost all of them were destroyed by the Spanish in the course of their conquest and rule. There is some debate about the size of the population. Marriage Women and men had paralleled roles, but were separate in Inca society. They were equally valued for the part they played in their society despite their differing roles. Marriage was no different. Incan women were typically married at the age of sixteen, while men married at the age of twenty. Age, however, was not as important as keeping track of the stage of life that a person was at, such as whether or not they were able to work or be married. Ranks played a role in a person's marriage status as well. Men of lower rank could only have one wife; people of ranks higher than the kuraka were allowed more. If a man had more than one wife, one served as the principal wife while the other(s) were considered secondary. Having more wives showed that the man had more labour showing that the household was wealthy. The death of the principal wife was sometimes met with suspicion that the husband played a role in her death. The man had to find a new principal wife before he was able to recover from the previous wife's death. To prevent such suspicion and to increase the likelihood of a successful marriage, there were situations in which the couple could test how well the marriage would work out. Trial marriages were typical of Inca culture. In this type of marriage, the man and woman would agree to try out being married to one another for a few years. At the end of this time, the woman could go home to her parents if she wished, and her husband could also send her home if he did not think it would work out. However, once the marriage was made final, they could only divorce if the woman was childless. To make the marriage final, the provincial governor had to approve the union. In the Inca society, a wedding was a simple event. Instead, it was looked at more as a business-like agreement. Therefore, marriage was an economic agreement between two families. Parents on either side had to come to an agreement before the marriage took place and the couple could not be directly related to one another. Women would almost always marry men in the same social class as themselves. However, while it was very rare for them to marry a man with a higher social ranking, it was still possible for some young women. The only way for a young woman to alter her social ranking would be if a man of higher ranking took notice of her. Once a woman was married, she was expected to collect food and cook, watch over the animals and the children, and to supply cloth to the government. Women of higher ranking also weaved, like those of lower ranks, but their work was used in special clothing for the higher ranks. A man's role sometimes resembled those of a woman, but acted in conjunction with one another. A woman‚Äôs household obligations would not change after she became pregnant. When she did find out she was pregnant she prayed and made offerings to an Inca god, Kanopa.Using marriage as an alliance strategy was also common among the Inca. Even before the Spaniards' arrival, the Inca used marriage as a way to claim themselves to power. After the Spaniards arrival the Inca allowed marriages between the Inca and Spaniards in order to gain power during a time of civil war. Arts The Inca were a conquering society, and their expansionist assimilation of other cultures is evident in their artistic style. The artistic style of the Inca utilized the vocabulary of many regions and cultures, but incorporated these themes into a standardized imperial style that could easily be replicated and spread throughout the empire. The simple abstract geometric forms and highly stylised animal representation in ceramics, wood carvings, textiles and metalwork were all part of the Inca culture. The motifs were not as revivalist as previous empires. No motifs of other societies were directly used with the exception of Huari and Tiwanaku arts. =Shipbuilding= For fishing, trade, construction, transport and military purposes, the Inca built seagoing vessels called balsas by weaving together totora reeds. The largest of these vessels were 20 to 30 meters long, making them comparable in length to the Spanish caravel . This method of constructing ships from woven reeds is an ancient Peruvian tradition which long predates the Inca. There are depictions of such vessels in Moche pottery dating back to 100 A.D. =Clothing= Inca tunic Inca officials wore stylized tunics that indicated their status. It contains an amalgamation of motifs used in the tunics of particular officeholders. For instance, the black and white checkerboard pattern topped with a pink triangle is believed to have been worn by soldiers of the army. Some of the motifs make reference to earlier cultures, such as the stepped diamonds of the Huari and the three-step stairstep motif of the Moche. Cloth was divided into three classes. Awaska was used for household use, and usually made from llama wool. Finer cloth, qunpi, was divided into two classes: The first, woven by male qunpikamayuq (keepers of fine cloth) from alpaca wool, was collected as tribute from throughout the country and was used for trade. The other class of qunpi ranked highest. It was woven in the Acllawasi (acllahuasi) by \\"aclla\\" (female virgins of the sun god temple) from vicu√±a wool and used solely for royal and religious use. These had thread counts of 300 or more per inch, unsurpassed anywhere in the world, until the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. Aside from the tunic, a person of importance wore a llawt'u, a series of cords wrapped around the head. To establish his importance, the Inca Atahualpa commissioned a llawt'u woven from vampire bat hair. The leader of each ayllu, or extended family, had its own headdress. In conquered regions, traditional clothing continued to be worn, but the finest weavers, such as those of Chan Chan, were transferred to Cusco and kept there to weave qunpi. (The Chim√∫ had previously transferred these same weavers to Chan Chan from Sican.) The Incan government controlled all clothing of their society. One would receive two outfits of clothing, one formal and one casual pair, and they would then proceed to wear those same outfits until they could literally be worn no longer. Since the government was in such strict control on their clothing, the Incas could not alter their clothing without the permission of the government. =Jewelry= The wearing of jewellery was not uniform throughout Peru. Chim√∫ artisans, for example, continued to wear earrings after their integration into the empire, but in many other regions, usually, only local leaders wore them. Jewelry may have been common among the Inca people, however it did not hold as much value to them because labor was the main way people paid each other. =Ceramics and metalwork= Chim√∫-Inca ceramic from the Late Horizon. Ceramics were for the most part utilitarian in nature, but also incorporated the imperialist style that was prevalent in the Inca textiles and metalwork. In addition, the Inca played drums and on woodwind instruments including flutes, pan-pipes and trumpets made of shell and ceramics. The Inca made beautiful objects of gold, silver, copper, bronze and tumbaga . But precious metals were in shorter supply than in earlier Peruvian cultures. The Inca metalworking style draws much of its inspiration from Chim√∫ art and in fact the best metal workers of Chan Chan were transferred to Cusco when the Kingdom of Chimor was incorporated into the empire. Unlike the Chim√∫, the Inca do not seem to have regarded metals to be as precious as fine cloth. Nonetheless, the metalworks of the Incas were perhaps the most advanced in America. When the Spanish first encountered the Inca they were offered gifts of qunpi cloth. Incan ceramics are usually very distinct and easy to recognize. The shapes of the vessels are highly standardized. The most typical Incan pottery would have a spherical body with a cone shaped base. This spherical body usually includes two vertical side handles with a tall neck and flaring rim. The Incans often would place animal heads on their pottery as well usually near the top of the vessel. There were also several other popular styles for Incan ceramics which included a shallow dish with a single bird head and handle, a pedestal beaker, and a single or double handled bottle. Incans often decorated their ceramics with a multitude of images and colors. They usually decorated their pottery with bright colors of red, yellow, orange, black and white. Much like all other forms of Incan art, the pottery was often decorated with geometric shapes. The Incans would put diamonds, squares, checkers, triangles, circles and dots on almost all of their ceramic work. Other common themes were animals and insects like llamas, birds, jaguars, alpacas, bees, butterflies as well as block-like humans. As part of a tax obligation to the commoners, mining was required in all the provinces. Even though the Inca Empire contained a lot of precious metals, the Incans did not value their metal as much as fine cloth. The Incans adopted much of their metal-working characteristics from the metalwork of Chimu. Because of their expertise in metalworking, after the fall of Chimu many metalworkers were taken back to the capital city of Cuzco to continue their metalworking for the emperor. Copper, tin, gold, and silver were all obtained from mines or washed from the river gravels. These metals would then be handed over to metallurgists. Because the Inca had a system that emphasized political and religious organization, there were many specialized artisans like metallurgists. There were also specialized weavers, cloth makers, pottery makers, and many more. Both copper and bronze would be used for basic farming tools or weapons. Some of the common bronze and copper pieces found in the Incan empire included sharp sticks for digging, club-heads, knives with curved blades, axes, chisels, needles and pins. All of these items would be forged by a metallurgist and then spread throughout the empire. The Incans reserved their more precious metals for ornaments and decorations. Gold and silver were common themes throughout the palaces of Incan emperors. It was said that the walls and thrones were covered with gold and that the emperor dined on gold and silver service. These golden plated services would often be inlaid with llamas, butterflies or other creatures. Even beyond the gold and decoration of the emperor‚Äôs palace were the ornaments that decorated all of the temples throughout the empire. The temples of the Incans were strewn with sacred and highly precious objects. Headdresses, crowns, ceremonial knives, cups, and a lot of ceremonial clothing were all inlaid with gold or silver. Many historians believe that the choice of gold was to distinguish the more ‚Äúsacred‚Äù or ‚Äúholy‚Äù pieces from others. The commonality of gold has much to do with the Incan religion surrounding the sun. Because of the beautiful reflection that gold casts, it gave the appearance of containing the sun, making the precious metal even more valued in a sun-obsessed society. Gold was reserved for the highest class of Incan society which consisted of priests, lords and of course the Sapa Inca or emperor. Politics Inca government is generally seen as an omnipotent emperor that ruled over a bureaucracy made up of local elites who had been recruited to serve in the state. This style of rule is often credited to Cuzco's success. The Inca empire was adamant about expansion and did so through two imperialism strategies: territorial administration and indirect-hegemonic control. Territorial administration consisted of a complete take over of provinces by reorganizing the economy through increased agricultural production and control of exchange routes via the Incan road system. The territorial administration allowed the Inca empire to put in a great deal of effort to control a new territory in hopes to strengthen the empire by a flow of surplus goods back to the empire core from the overtaken province. Indirect-hegemonic control enabled the Incas to gain control over a province but would allow the local leaders to govern the province. The reason behind this strategy was to gain land and flow of surplus goods back to the empire core without spending a great deal of effort to overtake and govern.Distant Provinces in the Inka Empire : Toward a Deeper Understanding of Inka Imperialism, edited by Michael A. Malpass, and Sonia Alconini, University of Iowa Press, 2010. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral-.proquest.com/lib/umr-ebooks/detail.action?docID=843228. Imperial rule was sustained through enforcement by Incan rulers and military troops on a random basis, as well as education of the provincial elite youth of the Incan way of life. Temples and shrines were also constructed in overtaken provinces to inflict Incan religion upon provincial peoples. Education Representation of an Incan quipu The Inca used quipu or bunches of knotted strings, for accounting and census purposes. Much of the information on the surviving quipus has been shown to be numeric data; some numbers seem to have been used as mnemonic labels, and the colour, spacing, and structure of the quipu carried information as well. Since it isn't known how to interpret the coded or non-numeric data, the associated information is considered lost. Religion The belief system of the Incas was polytheistic. Viracocha, the creator of the universe and Inti, the Sun God, were the most important gods. Viracocha was believed to have created humanity on an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca. Inti was devoutly loved so much that the Inca people called themselves \\"Intip Churin\\" which in the Inca language means \\"the children of the sun.\\" The Inca took part in spiritual human sacrifices known as the Capacocha. These sacrifices were taken out onto mountains all throughout the Andes and placed alive into burial tombs where they were left with items such as figurines, coca leaves, food, alcoholic beverages, and pottery. These offerings were carried out on large mountains where ceremonial sites were constructed, and were believed to have been made for numerous events such as: important festivals, natural phenomenon, and efforts to please the mountain deities. The vilca camayos were the overseers of the offerings, in which they had decision on where the sacrifices were made and the amount of sacrifices made on each mountain. Mountain deities were worshiped because it was believed that they controlled things like rainfall, water flow and therefore, the abundance and fertility of crops.,Reinhard, Johan and Constanza Ceruti. \\"Sacred Mountains, Ceremonial Sites, and Human Sacrifice among the Incas.\\" Archaeoastronomy, vol. 19, June 2005, pp. 1-43. Other practices The Inca practiced cranial deformation. They achieved this by wrapping tight cloth straps around the heads of newborns in order to alter the shape of their still-soft skulls. These deformations did not result in brain damage. Researchers at the Field Museum believe that the practice was used to mark different ethnicities across the Inca Empire. The Inca preserved bodies through mummification. Bodies were wrapped in the fetal position in cloth or leather. Rank determined how the Incas were buried. Common people were placed in an open cave or chullpa for possible visiting. Emperors organs were removed and placed in jars separate from their bodies. After preparation they were placed where they most occupied in life.  Agriculture  Around 200 varieties of Peruvian potatoes were cultivated by the Incas and their predecessors It is estimated that the Inca cultivated around seventy crop species. The main crops were potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, chili peppers, cotton, tomatoes, peanuts, an edible root called oca, and the pseudograins quinoa and amaranth. The crops developed by the Inca and preceding cultures makes South America one of the historic centers of crop diversity (along with the Middle East, India, Mesoamerica, Ethiopia, and the Far East). Many of these crops were widely distributed by the Spanish and are now important crops worldwide. Salsa was originated by the Inca people using tomatoes, chili peppers, and other spices. In the Incan settlement of Vitcos, pollen from maize and quinoa was found in several soil samples which date back as early as the Incan period. The Inca cultivated food crops on dry Pacific coastlines, high on the slopes of the Andes, and in the lowland Amazon rainforest. In mountainous Andean environments, they made extensive use of terraced fields which not only allowed them to put to use the mineral-rich mountain soil which other peoples left fallow, but also took advantage of micro-climates conducive to a variety of crops being cultivated throughout the year. A contributing factor for the ability of the Inca to expand their population and agriculture as quick as they did, was because of a small climate shift that allowed for slightly warmer temperatures and a small increase in annual precipitation. This contributed to the Inca's ability to use terraced and irrigated fields in higher elevations, opening up vast amount of the Andes Mountains for Inca agriculture. Agricultural tools consisted mostly of simple digging sticks. The Inca developed Qollqas, a building made of \\"adobe, field stone, clay mortar, plaster and pirca\\" used for food storage. These granaries stored \\"maize, quinoa, potatoes, potatoes, chica (maize beer), fruit, salt, fish, tubers, and grain\\". Qollqas allowed for the survival of food supplies in the cold climate of the Andes. Many varieties of Peruvian maize (corn) were well-known to the Incas for centuries The Inca also raised llamas and alpacas for their wool, meat, and to use them as pack animals and captured wild vicu√±as for their fine hair. The Inca road system was key to farming success as it allowed distribution of foods over long distances. The Inca also constructed vast storehouses, which allowed them to live through El Ni√±o years while some neighboring civilizations suffered. Inca leaders kept records of what each ayllu in the empire produced, but did not tax them on their production. They instead used the mita for the support of the empire. The Inca diet consisted primarily of fish and vegetables, supplemented less frequently with the meat of cuyes (guinea pigs) and camelids. In addition, they hunted various animals for meat, skins and feathers. Maize was malted and used to make chicha, a fermented alcoholic beverage.  Economy  According to Ferreira and Chamot: :\\"The social system of the Incas had an ancient Andean origin based on the ayllu, an extended family group with a common ancestor. The economic system was also based on ancient social structures and can be explained through several principles, namely reciprocity, redistribution, and vertical control.\\" These authors also add: :\\"Redistribution, a practice employed by the state, ensured that all agricultural goods not exchanged by reciprocity were to be distributed in the different areas of the empire in the case of bad crops.\\"Darget-Chamot, Ferreira '''Cultures and Customs of Peru; Greenwood Press; Westport Ct/London; 2003; pp 13 In essence, the government of the Inca functioned as a safeguard against mass starvation. Unlike the Europeans, gold and silver were not used as a form of currency. Instead, clothing and food were distributed by the rulers in exchange for labor. The Incan required tribute from those they conquered. Historical records show that agricultural production as well as cloth production increases after Incan conquest. Infrastructure The \\"Qhapaq √ëan\\" (Inca Road) was largely used and constructed across the Inca Empire. Uses were not only for nobility to spread information and expand the empire, but was also used for soldiers, for transportation of goods, and for private usage. Not only were Incan roads expansive, but they were also well planned and maintained. The Incans made a standard design for the roads and carried out the standard throughout the empire. Roads were built so that they were easily drained to prevent damage of the roads and flooding. The roads were cleaned often by designated maintenance workers. Lodges for traveling nobles were also constructed alongside the roads. Rest stops called tambos were built close to roads with water supplies leading to each so that travelers and messengers could have a place to rest and clean water to drink. Military store houses were also built near the roads and kept food for when troops were traveling. Bridges were built across rivers that were too deep to cross, and large flat stones were placed along the sides of roads as markers to distinguish different sections of the roads. The Inca relied on and worshiped water heavily. A temple was built, the Incamisana, to worship water and the deities granting them water. The temple, as well as many other buildings constructed by the Inca, incorporated aesthetics, underground water conduits, and hydraulic systems. The Inca understood water was needed for agricultural production (used in terraces) and for domestic purposes. The civil engineers of the time for the Inca were tasked with laying out diversion and canal routes to a designated spot, finding what water source would give the desired flow rate, and what elevation the water source would need to be tapped from for gravity to work effectively. Sanitation was also well known by the Inca. The Inca had their own wastewater treatment systems and it is documented that they would collect the human waste to perform land application to help ensure successful harvest seasons.

Usage in Ireland  Some Irish historians prefer to use this term instead of Anglo-Norman because many of the Anglo-Norman knights who invaded Ireland in 1170 originated in modern-day Wales. However, south Wales was under Plantagenet control at this point in history and the Anglo-Normans living in south Wales owed their allegiance to Henry II, not a native Welsh prince. Contemporary Irish accounts of this period erroneously called the incomers Saxain, which means \\"Saxon\\", i.e. \\"English\\". The term Cambro-Norman is rarely used even in Ireland. The Normans who invaded Ireland are commonly described as Anglo-Normans by modern historians or else simply as English. This latter term along with Saxain (\\"Saxons\\") was used by contemporary chroniclers in strong preference to Normans. Richard de Clare, better known as Strongbow, has been described by some Irish historians as a Cambro-Norman rather than an Anglo-Norman. The de Clares held lands in Pembrokeshire and Glamorgan, but their base was in Chepstow, which, although is now a border settlement in Wales, was part of the English county of Herefordshire at the time. Strongbow also held lands in Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Suffolk. Herefordshire is in the Welsh Marches, of which Strongbow was a Marcher Lord. He is believed to have retreated to his English holdings when the Welsh began to attack his territory in Netherwent. Strongbow was living in England when he was contacted by Diarmaid MacMurrough, the king of Leinster. In addition to such Cambro-Norman lords, some of Ireland's most common names, including Walsh and Griffith, came from indigenous Welsh families who came with the Norman invasion. (The surname \\"Walsh\\" itself, or in Irish Breathnach, \\"Briton\\", means \\"Welshman\\", and was applied by the Irish to Welsh who didn't have a surname, as well as to particular Cambro-Norman lords). Other indigenous Welsh surnames, such as Taaffe which came at this time, became very important families within the Pale. Probably the best known Cambro-Norman surname, also called Hiberno- Norman, is Costello (see also Gilbert de Angulo). Other Cambro-Norman families include the Butlers, the JoycesBishop, Alan.

Early years Slemmer was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and raised in Norristown. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1850, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He married Caroline Lane Reynolds in 1856.

In January 1861, he was in command of a body of troops at Fort Barrancas, Pensacola Harbor, Fla. On January 10, after the surrender of the Pensacola Navy Yard, he transferred his force to the Fort Pickens position in the same harbor. He held this fort against Confederate threat of attack and demands for surrender from Florida militia Colonel William Henry Chase, who had designed and constructed the fort as a captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The garrison was reinforced in April 1861 and Slemmer was relieved. Fort Pickens remained under Federal control for the duration of the war. Promoted to major in the new 16th U.S. Infantry Regiment in May 1861, he was attached to General Buell's command and took part in the Corinth campaign and the relief of Nashville. He led his battalion into the Battle of Stones River in December, receiving a wound that incapacitated him for the rest of the war. He was taken prisoner the following day but released during the Confederate retreat. In April 1863, backdated to November 29, 1862, he became brigadier general of volunteers.

It is primarily associated with the Archdiocese of Milan, and named after St. Ambrose much as Gregorian chant is named after Gregory the Great. It is the only surviving plainchant tradition besides the Gregorian to maintain the official sanction of the Roman Catholic Church. History The history of Milan as a centre for religious music goes back to St. Ambrose, who is not known to have composed any of the Ambrosian chant repertory, much as Gregory the Great is not known to have composed any Gregorian chant. However, during his 4th-century tenure as bishop of Milan, he is credited with introducing hymnody from the Eastern Church to the West. Ambrose composed original hymns as well, four of which still survive, along with music that may not have changed too much from the original melodies. Two methods of singing psalms or other chants are responsorial and antiphonal. In responsorial singing, the soloist (or choir) sings a series of verses, each one followed by a response from the choir (or congregation). In antiphonal singing, the verses are sung alternately by soloist and choir, or by choir and congregation. In the Western Church, formerly the responsorial method seems to have first been used alone, the antiphonal method was introduced by St. Ambrose. Over time, the Milanese liturgy developed into the Ambrosian rite, which shares more in common with the Gallican and Mozarabic rites than with the Roman. Ambrosian chant developed to meet the particular needs of the Ambrosian liturgy. Although the Ambrosian rite is liturgically related to other rites and Ambrosian chant is musically related to other plainchant traditions, different categories of chant, different chant texts, and different musical styles make Ambrosian chant a distinct musical repertory. By the 8th century, this chant was attested to be normative across northern Italy, perhaps reaching into southern Italy as well. Between the 8th and 13th centuries, however, the Carolingian chant commissioned by Charlemagne developed into what we now know as Gregorian chant, which began to influence and eventually replace most of the other Western plainchant traditions. By the 12th century, the Mozarabic, Gallican, Celtic, Old Roman, and Beneventan chant traditions had all been effectively superseded by Gregorian chant. Ambrosian chant alone survived, despite the efforts of several Popes over a period of several centuries to establish Gregorian hegemony. A chronicle by the Milanese historian Landolphus from around the year 1000 recounts a legend that two Sacramentaries, one Gregorian and one Ambrosian, were placed on an altar to see which chant had divine acceptance; miraculously, both books opened simultaneously, showing both were equally acceptable. Ambrosian chant did not wholly escape Gregorian influence. The earliest 8th-century fragments, and the more complete chantbooks from the 11th and 12th centuries that preserve the first recorded musical notation, show marked differences between the Gregorian and Ambrosian repertories. Later additions to the Ambrosian repertory, whose style differs from the earlier chants, may reflect Gregorian influence. Although St. Charles Borromeo fought to keep the Ambrosian rite intact during Spanish occupation, a contemporary edition of Ambrosian chant, published by Perego in 1622, attempts to categorize the Ambrosian chants into the eight Gregorian modes, which is not generally accepted as an accurate reflection of the actual musical practice of the time. Ambrosian chant has survived to the present day, although its use is now limited primarily to the greater part of the Archdiocese of Milan and environs, parts of Lombardy, and parts of the Swiss Diocese of Lugano. Most recently, it survived the changes to the liturgy established by Vatican II, in part due to the prior tenure of Pope Paul VI as Archbishop of Milan. General characteristics Ambrosian chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite, which is more closely related to the northern \\"Gallic\\" liturgies such as the Gallican rite and the Mozarabic rite than the Roman rite. Musically, however, Ambrosian chant is closely related to the Gregorian and Old Roman chant traditions. Many chants are common to all three, with musical variation. Like all plainchant, Ambrosian chant is monophonic and a cappella. In accordance with Roman Catholic tradition, it is primarily intended to be sung by males, and many Ambrosian chants specify who is to sing them, using phrases such as cum Pueris (by a boys' choir) and a Subdiaconis (by the subdeacons). Stylistically, the Ambrosian chant repertoire is not generally as musically uniform as the Gregorian. Ambrosian chants are more varied in length, ambitus, and structure. Even within individual categories of chant, Ambrosian chants vary from short and formulaic to prolix and melismatic, and may be freely composed or show significant internal melodic structure. Its most distinctive feature compared with other plainchant repertories is a significantly higher amount of stepwise motion, which gives Ambrosian melodies a smoother, almost undulating feel. In manuscripts with musical notation, the neume called the climacus dominates, contributing to the stepwise motion. More ornamental neumes such as the quilisma are nearly absent from the notated scores, although it is unclear whether this reflects actual performance practice, or is simply a consequence of the relatively late musical transcription. The Gregorian system of modes does not apply to Ambrosian chant. Although there are no b-flats indicated in the musical notation, it seems likely that they were understood, based on Guido d'Arezzo's description of the \\"more perdulcis Ambrosii.\\" Nearly all of the texts used in Ambrosian chant are biblical prose, not metrical poetry, despite Ambrose having introduced Eastern hymnody to the West. Ambrosian chant serves two main functions in the Ambrosian liturgy: to provide music for the chanting of the Psalms in the monastic Offices, and to cover various actions in the celebration of the Mass. Chants of the Office Sant'Ambrogio Basilica The Office chants of the Ambrosian repertoire are still largely unresearched, so only preliminary evaluations have been made. The minor hours have little of musical interest: some hymns, and the simplest of reciting tones only. The main chants of the Office are those of Matins, Vespers and the Vigils. The Psalms are sung at Matins and Vespers in a rotating schedule so that all 150 Psalms are chanted every two weeks. The Psalms are each sung to a psalm tone, with a simple antiphon between each verse. The system of psalm tones in Ambrosian chant differs in several respects from the Gregorian system of psalm tones. In the Gregorian system, psalm tones are based on the mode of the antiphon. Ambrosian chants, including psalm antiphons, do not conform to the Gregorian system of modes. Each Ambrosian psalm antiphon belongs to one of four different series depending on its final pitch. Within each series, there are several possible psalm tones corresponding to the predominant pitch of the antiphon, which may or may not correspond to the \\"dominant\\" pitch of Gregorian modes. Finally, each psalm tone is given a cadential formula that lets the tone segue smoothly back into the antiphon. This system results in a much larger number of possible psalm tones in Ambrosian chant than exists in Gregorian chant. Structurally, psalm tones in Ambrosian chant consist of an incipit, a recitation formula, and a cadence, lacking the mediant flex found in Gregorian psalm tones. Other Vespers chants include the Psallendae and the Antiphonae in choro. Psallendae comprise the largest category of Ambrosian Office chants. Two Psallendae, similar to the Marian antiphons of Gregorian chant, are performed on the more solemn Vespers, to cover processions. They conclude with one of several recitation tones that segue into the Gloria Patri. Antiphonae in choro are similar in style, but have no psalm or verse. Responsoria occur in both Matins and Vespers. Their names often identify who is to sing them: the boys' choir, the deacon, the subdeacons, and so on. A Responsorium usually consists of a refrain called a respond, a verse, and a repetition of an expanded part of the respond. These expansions contain some of the longest melismas of the Ambrosian chant repertoire, which often contain complex repeat structures. Vespers begin with a chant called the Lucernarium and end with the Completorium. The word Lucernarium hearkens back to the original function of Vespers as a time of lighting lamps, and the texts of Lucernaria usually contain some reference to light, such as Quoniam tu illuminas, Paravi lucernam, and Dominus illuminatio. Stylistically, Lucernaria and Completaria vary. Some are proper, specific to certain feasts, while others are ordinary and can be used throughout the year. They range from highly elaborate chants to simple reciting tones. There are relatively few Lucernaria and Completaria; four Completaria are used for all but three days of the year. Chants of the Mass The Mass is the Christian celebration of the Eucharist. Plainchant occurs prominently in the Mass for several reasons: to communally affirm the faith, to expand on the scriptural lessons, and to accompany certain actions. The chants of the Mass divide into the ordinary, whose texts are invariable, and the proper, whose texts change depending on the feast. There are several differences between the Ambrosian rite and the Roman rite, which are reflected in the Ambrosian and Gregorian chant traditions. =Ordinary chants of the Mass= The ordinary chants consist of the Laus Missa or Gloria, the Symbolum, and the Sanctus. The Symbolum corresponds to the Credo in the Roman rite. Unlike Gregorian chant, there is no Agnus Dei nor Ite missa est, and the Kyrie does not exist as a separate category of chant. Only a small number of each of these ordinary chants exist: four Gloria melodies, four Sanctus melodies, and just one melody for the Symbolum. The Symbolum melody is quite simple, just a slightly ornamented reciting tone. Of the four Gloria melodies, one is simple like the Symbolum melody, one is an expanded version of the simple melody, and one is a freely composed syllabic and neumatic melody consisting of only one or just a few pitches per syllable. The fourth melody is elaborately melismatic. All four melodies segue into a very simple threefold Kyrie chant. Only two of the few Sanctus melodies are regularly used, both fairly simple. =Proper chants of the Mass= The Ingressa corresponds to the Introit in the Roman rite. Unlike the Introit, the Ingressa has no psalm verse or doxology. While the Introit fills in the time that the celebrant processes to the altar, the Ingressa is sung during the censing of the altar. The next three proper chants follow and amplify three readings from Scripture. The Psalmellus follows the Prophecy, the Old Testament reading, and corresponds to the Gregorian Gradual. The Post Epistolam or Alleluia follows the reading of the Epistle, and corresponds to the Gregorian Alleluia. Ambrosian Alleluias show an even higher degree of adaptation, reusing melodies for the texts of different feasts, than do the Gregorian Alleluias. Unlike the Gregorian Alleluia, the Ambrosian Alleluia kept an extended repeat called the jubilus. During penitential periods, the Post Epistolam is replaced by the Cantus, which corresponds to the Gregorian Tract. The Cantus melodies belong to a common type, related to the Old Roman and Beneventan chant traditions. The chant following the final lesson, from the Gospel, is the Post Evangelium, which has no counterpart in the Roman Rite. The Offertorium is sung during the bringing of gifts to the altar, corresponding to the Gregorian Offertory. While the Gregorian Offertories had lost their verses by the 12th century, some Ambrosian Offertoria retained their verses, every bit as complex as their defunct Gregorian counterparts. The Confractorium is sung during the breaking of the bread, which has no counterpart in Gregorian chant. Finally, the Transitorium, so called because it originally involved the transfer of a book to the opposite side of the altar, corresponds to the Gregorian Communion. Many Transitorium texts are direct translations of Greek originals, although the melodies are not demonstrably Byzantine. The Ingressa, Post Evangelium, Confractorium, and Transitorium never have verses, while the other chants may have responds and verses, up to three verses for some Cantus melodies. The Psalmellus, Post Evangelium, Offertoria, and Transitoria sometimes show complex repeat structures. References Sources * Jesson, Roy (1990). Ambrosian Chant.

Biography From approximately 500 AD Slavonic tribes poured in. By about 600, they had complete possession of the land. The chief god was Radegast Zuarasici, whose sanctuary at Rethra was the centre of his worship for the whole of Mecklenburg. Charlemagne's conquests in this region were lost soon after his death. Henry I of Germany (916-36) was the first to force the Slavonic territory again to pay tribute (circa 928); he also placed it under the jurisdiction of Saxon counts. With the dominion of the Germans, Christianity found ingress into the land. However, antagonism to the tribute to the empire and the Saxon dukes led to a heathen reaction.Lins, Joseph. \\"Mecklenburg.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10.

It was established in 1948 by RAI ‚Äì Radiotelevisione Italiana (in 1948, RAI had the denomination RAI ‚Äì Radio Audizioni Italiane) in Capri. Eighty seven public and private radio and television organizations representing 46 countries from the five continents form and outline the community of the Prix Italia which is in continuous evolution. Unique in the world, among International festivals and prizes, it is the organizational and decision-making body of the Prix. The delegates decide and resolve the editorial outline and elect the President. RAI is in charge and responsible of the organization of the manifestation, and the General Secretariat has its headquarters in Rome. Prix Italia is held in an Italian city of art and culture annually every September for a week, in collaboration with local authorities. The event is an authentic and unique moment of congregation and professional comparison on the quality of the programmes. It is the right venue where one can collaborate and define agreements and exchange points of view. The public participates in the concerts, films, shows, previews, round tables, \\"all night out\\", master classes, and radio and web events. Thanks to the \\"on demand\\" position everyone can listen and watch all the best worldwide programmes in competition. The drive for quality and responsibility of the Prix Italia resulted in Unda (The International Catholic organisation for Radio and Television) having its own jury for the first time in Ravenna where the Prix Italia in 1997 was held. The three-member jury consisted of Victor Sunderaj, Secretary General of Unda, John McDonald, producer for Scottish Television, and Rita Lefevere, producer for Belgian Radio and Television (BRTN). The goal of this jury was the rewardion of a television programme that supported human dignity. The first award of Unda was given to the producers of Child Molesters: On the Trail of Sex Offenders. \\"The producers achieved more than the mere promotion of human dignity: they fought for it\\", explained the Unda jury in its motivation.

It is mostly famous for its live chess event and for the local cherry variety. History Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the locality was greatly influenced by several members of the important medieval family from the Veneto, known as the Ezzelini. They were finally defeated in 1260. Marostica was a Venetian city until Venice joined Italy. During the 19th century it was mainly a relatively poor town; a great number of inhabitants went to look for fortune in Brazil and many other places in the world. The wealth of the town grew greatly after the second world war. Marostica is famous for the human chess game it carries out every 2 years (in the even- numbered years), with living chess pieces, in the city public square. FESTIVAL FACTS According to legend the original match took place on September 12, 1454, so during the 2nd weekend in September of even-numbered years, this reenacted game of chess using live pieces is played; but this has not always been the case. After the First World War, members of the local chess club began playing chess in the main square with 10 cm gilded pieces which caught the attention of then mayor Bonomo and the architect Mirko Vucetich. They became inspired and set about reviving the biennial reenactment of the life-sized human chess match that had been interrupted due to the wartime events. After the Second World War, some 20 years later, the artist who authored the work entitled ‚ÄúThe Chess Game,‚Äù in which the original legend is memorialized, designed the new elements of the festival. The renovated chess board measured 16 meters per side, framed by a large band of black tarchite, which contains the 64 square squares obtained from 4 slabs of pink Conco marble and Asiago biancone. In addition to the newly renovated chessboard, the medieval costumes and sets of the era were also redesigned. Unfortunately, the original game was played so long ago that the original moves by the knights have been lost to time so ‚Äòa group‚Äô of designated chess players choose one of the more famous chess matches in recent history to use at the formal presentation. During the presentation once one of the two knights/suitors have made a move, a crier calls out the movement for the living chess piece; these orders are still given out in the \\"Serenissima Republic of Venice\\" dialect. THE LEGEND The two noblemen, Rinaldo D'Angarano and Vieri da Vallanora, fell in love with Lionora, the daughter of the local lord, Taddeo Parisio. As was the custom at that time, they challenged each other to a duel to win her hand. The Lord of Marostica, not wanting to make an enemy of either suitor nor lose them in a duel, forbade the encounter. *He decreed instead that the two rivals would play a chess game and the winner would have the hand of Lionora. The loser of the chess game would also join the family, by marrying her younger sister, Oldrada. The chess match took place on September 12 in the year 1454. The reenactment of the legendary chess match takes place on the square in front of the Lower Castle with supporters carrying the noble ensigns of Whites and Blacks, in the presence of the Lord, his noble daughter, the Lords of Angarano and Leoncavallo, the court and the entire town population. The Lord also decides the challenge would be honoured by an exhibition of armed men, foot-soldiers and knights, with fireworks and dances and music, which makes the approximately 20 minute chess game the anchor of a festival of epic proportions. Marostica is also home to the Diesel Farm, a wine, grappa, and olive oil-producing establishment, founded by Diesel founder Renzo Rosso. Nonetheless, Marostica is also very famous for the production of cherries, used in the preparation of a typical cake, served in all cafes and restaurants in the area.

To help with the housework, including washing up, Graeme has built a robot he calls EB-GB (Electronic Brain of Great Britain). Graeme asks: \\"EB-GB, how do you speak to aliens?\\" to which EB-GB replies in a Dalek voice: \\"Exterminate!\\" Away from the restaurant, Bill is watching when musicians suddenly and unexpectedly disappear during performances. Graeme tries to determine a common link between the series of recent disappearances, even writing up all the information that he has about the missing persons on the blackboard. Graeme has no idea what could be the common link, and it takes Bill to point out that all the missing persons are trombone players. In contemplation of this fact, Bill plays the trombone in the park to see if he can find the answer to the riddle and also get taken, but nothing happens to him. Bill rushes back to the restaurant when he sees a weird noisy light approaching, but the weird light turns out to be Graeme who is out doing some UFO spotting with an electronic gadget box.

Rider Haggard. It was directed by Robert Day and stars Ursula Andress, Peter Cushing, Bernard Cribbins, John Richardson, Rosenda Monteros, and Christopher Lee. The film was an international success and led to a 1968 sequel, The Vengeance of She, with Olinka Berova in the title role. Plot After receiving honourable discharges from the British Army in Palestine in 1918, Professor Holly (Peter Cushing), young Leo Vincey (John Richardson) and their orderly Job (Bernard Cribbins) embark on an expedition into a previously unexplored region of north-east Africa. They discover the lost city of Kuma after Leo receives a mysterious map revealing the city's whereabouts. This lost realm is ruled by Ayesha (Ursula Andress), who is also known as \\"She-Who-Waits\\" and \\"She-Who- Must-Be-Obeyed.\\" Ayesha is an immortal queen and high priestess who believes Leo is the reincarnation of her former lover, the priest Kallikrates (whom she killed when she found him in an intimate embrace with another woman about two thousand years before). Ayesha tries to convince Leo to walk into a ceremonial fire after it has turned blue, which happens once certain astronomical events coincide. These conditions are met for only a short period and only occur rarely. By entering the fire, Leo himself will become immortal. As this is happening, Ayesha's army is attacked by her enslaved tribesmen, the Amahagger. Although Ayesha had oppressed the Amahagger for 2,000 years, the uprising was triggered by the queen's executing Ustane (Rosenda Monteros), an Amahagger woman who had developed a relationship with Leo, in a fit of jealousy. Ustane's father, Haumeid (Andr√© Morell), who like his daughter had befriended Leo, Holly and Job, is outraged at his daughter's execution and incites the Amahagger into the uprising. Ayesha's army is overwhelmed during the fierce battle against the poorly equipped yet numerous Amahagger. Whilst the uprising is taking place, Leo battles Billali (Christopher Lee), Ayesha's fanatical priest, who wants immortality for himself, believing it is his due after his years of selfless service. After dueling with Leo and finally gaining the upper hand, Billali, giving Leo up for dead, attempts to enter the blue flames himself and become immortal but is killed by Ayesha before he can enter the fire. Ayesha takes Leo's hand and leads him into the fire. Upon entering, Leo becomes immortal, but Ayesha's second exposure to the fire destroys her immortality and she dies almost instantly as the centuries catch up with her and she ages millennia in a few seconds. The film ends with a despondent Leo stating that he doesn't care when the fire will next burn blue but it will find him waiting for it.

Rider Haggard novel - which had been filmed previously in 1908, 1911, 1916, 1917, 1925 and 1935 - was the idea of Kenneth Hyman of Seven Arts Productions, who had a long-running relationship with Hammer Film Productions. Anthony Hinds commissioned a script from John Temple-Smith, and the lead role was assigned to Ursula Andress - known at that time for her role in the James Bond film Dr. No - who signed a two-picture deal with Seven Arts as a guarantee for her husband John Derek. She would thus become the first Hammer film to be built around a female star. Hammer pitched the project to Universal, who turned it down. Hinds then arranged for Berkley Mather to write a script, but the project was turned down again by Universal, and then by Joseph E. Levine and American International Pictures. Hinds passed it over to Michael Carreras who got David T. Chantler to rewrite the script. Carreras succeeded in getting the film financed through MGM, with triple the usual budget for a Hammer film.Doll, Susan. \\"She (1965)\\" on TCM.com The film was announced in May 1964. Although Seven Arts had helped finance several Hammer films, this was the first one they had produced together. John Richardson was cast after being spotted by Ray Stark of Seven Arts. Principal photography commenced in southern Israel's Negev Desert on 24 August 1964, with scenes also shot at MGM's Elstree Studios in London when Hammer's Bray Studios proved to be too small for the project. It was the most expensive film Hammer had made up until that time, but on release it was a hit both in North America and in Europe. Although the studio was pleased with the look of Ursula Andress in the film - as lit by Harry Waxman and costumed by Carl Toms and Roy Ashton - they found her Swiss German accent to be offputting, and had her entire part re-dubbed by actress Nikki van der Zyl, who had dubbed her in Dr. No. Critical reception The New York Times wrote of the film \\"It lacks style, sophistication, humor, sense, and above all, a reason for being, since it isn't even as good (excepting that it is in color) as the last remake of \\"She\\" done with Helen Gahagan in 1935\\"; while more recently, the Radio Times gave the film three out of a possible five stars, writing that Ursula Andress \\"acquits herself better than you might expect\\", and concluding that \\"The African backdrops are easily matched by Swiss-born Andress's own brand of exotic beauty and, while there's plenty to criticise, there's also much to enjoy.\\" See also * She (novel) * She (1935 film) * She (1984 film) * The Vengeance of She References External links  1965 films 1960s fantasy adventure films English-language films British films British fantasy adventure films Films directed by Robert Day Films shot at Elstree Studios Films based on She Films based on fantasy novels Films set in Africa Foreign films shot in Israel Hammer Film Productions films Films set in 1918 Films set in deserts Films produced by Aida Young ","title":"She (1965 film)"},{"id":"4967072","text":"William Terry (1798 - ??) was an innkeeper and political figure in Upper Canada.

Some devices cover only a part of the face. Oxygen tents are sometimes confused with altitude tents as used by athletes and those looking to acclimatize to a higher altitude, but those contain a reduced oxygen content. This form of treatment is often prescribed in conditions where people have difficulty in breathing. An oxygen tent can be used in either a hospital setting or outside a health-care facility, and can be recommended for short- or long-term therapy. Typically the tent is made of transparent plastic material. It can envelop the patient‚Äôs bed with the end sections held in place by a mattress to ensure that the tent is airtight. The enclosure often has a side opening with a zipper. Benefits Oxygen therapy often benefits patients by providing more oxygen to their lungs and consequently to their tissues. Typically, the treatment raises the amount of oxygen in the blood, decreases load on the heart, and facilitates breathing. It can ease symptoms such as cough and dried up secretions that occur in respiratory conditions. Oxygen therapy might be advised for lung diseases, heart conditions, carbon monoxide poisoning, and could be administered to patients in case of surgery. A person with viral or bacterial meningitis who develops breathing difficulty might be kept in an oxygen tent. Hazards Raised levels of oxygen increase fire risk, both of ignition and of spreading rate and damage. Many materials will ignite and burn in a high oxygen atmosphere that will not burn in air. Extinguishing a fire is more difficult in a high oxygen environment. Precautions Certain precautions are usually recommended when using an oxygen tent. One of the measures is to avoid opening the tent very often. If the tent is opened to attend to the patient, the edges need to be tucked back to prevent oxygen from seeping out. In general, it is advisable not to smoke or have any inflammable material within the vicinity of any oxygen apparatus. Using an electrical device inside an oxygen tent also could be hazardous.

History  Villa Guicciardini Corsi Salviati in Sesto Fiorentino. The oldest known human settlement in the area dates from the Mesolithic (c. 9,000 years ago). The Etruscan presence is known from the 7th century BC, but the town proper was created by the Romans as Sextus ab urbe lapis (\\"Sixth mile from the Town Milestone\\"). The first churches were built in the early Middle Ages, among which the most important became the Pieve of San Martino. Sesto Fiorentino was subject to the Archbishop of Florence. Later it was under the Florentine Republic, which dried the plain and boosted the area's economy starting from the Renaissance age. In 1735, Marquis Carlo Ginori founded one of the first porcelain plants in Europe, the Manifattura di Doccia. Now under the name Richard-Ginori, the company is still located in Sesto, and is the largest porcelain manufacturer in Italy. Toward the end of the 19th century, craftsmen who had been trained at Richard-Ginori began to start their own pottery studios, some of which also grew into factories. There are currently over one hundred producers of pottery in Sesto Fiorentino, and a state school for teaching pottery, now called L'Istituto Statale d'Arte.Ceramica Toscana.it, The ceramics tradition in Sesto Fiorentino Ceramica Toscana.it, L'Istituto Statale d'Arte Sesto Fiorentino was annexed by plebiscite to the newly unified Kingdom of Italy in 1860.

History The feature started with the Toronto Sun, which was launched in 1971, and was adapted from British tabloids with similar featured women. While the British tabloids started publishing photos of topless models in 1970, the Sunshine Girls have never been photographed in this manner. The photos usually feature a clothed or swim-suited female model, actress, athlete. Although primarily published in color since the 1990s, prior to this the feature alternated between color and black and white and was exclusively black and white in the 1970s and early 1980s. Typically featured on page 3 of the Sun in through the 1990s, the Sunshine Girl moved to the back page of the sports section in the early 2000s. In 2011, the Sunshine Girl was restored to page 3 in some, not all, versions of the Sun, in addition to keeping her place at the back of the sports section; two different photos of the same Sunshine Girl are now run each day. Famous former SUNshine girls include: Amanda Coetzer, Ann Rohmer, Trish Stratus , Stacy Keibler, and Krista Erickson (Sun News Network anchor, who appeared on the date of that network's 2011 launch). Additional images of the day's Sunshine Girl are posted each day to the Sun newspapers' websites, along with behind-the-scenes videos of select models. At least twice a year, the Sun Group produces and sells a calendar featuring a selection of Sunshine Girls.

He was the longest-serving member of the Tennessee legislature. He was a member of the Tennessee Senate, representing the 21st district (part of Davidson County). He served as a state senator beginning with his election to the 87th General Assembly, prior to which he was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives during the 79th General Assembly. Early life Henry was born on May 14, 1926 in Nashville, Tennessee to Kathryn Craig Henry and Douglas Selph Henry, Sr. He grew up in Belle Meade, Tennessee, where he was raised as a Presbyterian. His grandfather, Cornelius Abernathy (C.A.) Craig. was the founder of the National Life and Accident Insurance Co., and his father, Douglas Selph Henry Sr., served in the Tennessee Senate. Robert Selph Henry, his uncle, was an attorney and a historian who authored history books, such as The Story of the Confederacy (1931) and The Story of Reconstruction (1938). Henry was educated at The Parmer School, Wallace School, and The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and graduated from the Montgomery Bell Academy in 1941. Henry served as a member of the United States Army in the Philippines for over two years during World War II. He received the Philippine Independence Medal. Henry graduated with a BA in French, Greek, and Latin from College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt University. He subsequently earned an LL.B from the Vanderbilt Law School. Career Henry began his career a practising attorney and legal counsel to the family business, the National Life and Accident Insurance Co. Henry made an initial and unsuccessful bid for election into the Tennessee House of Representatives during 1952. Henry was first elected into the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1954. Henry was absent from politics during the 1960s, working as a corporate attorney for National Life Insurance Company. Returning to the political arena in 1970, Henry was elected 11 consecutive times to the Tennessee State Senate, most recently narrowly defeating challenger Jeff Yarbro in the 2010 primary by just 17 votes. In the 1970s, Henry smoked marijuana outside the state of Tennessee to experience it before he could vote on a decriminalization bill in the senate. Henry was opposed to legal abortion in all cases, even if the female had been raped. A state legislative staffer once hired as a employee of a Tennessee Senate committee chaired by Henry, Brian L. Harris, would later become the long- serving president of the anti-legal abortion group Tennessee Right To Life. Henry stated that he legislatively supported \\"education, children's welfare, and voting rights\\". In 1978, Henry helped pass a law in Tennessee for the mandatory use of child seat belts. Sons of Confederate Veterans member Henry was a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and pursued legislation and legislative action in the Tennessee General Assembly to advance the agenda of that organization.http://saveourflags.org/index.php/news Save Our Flags Tennessee 14th Infantry, \\"The Latest News\\". Retrieved March 5, 2020. During 1973 Henry directed the creation of a bust of Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest to be installed within the Tennessee State Capitol. Forrest was a Memphis resident and a noted Confederate cavalry commander during the American Civil War who would become notorious for his role, and the role of his troops, in the massacre of hundreds of U.S. Colored Troops and White Union soldiers from East Tennessee following their surrender at the Battle of Fort Pillow, and later, after the end of the Civil War, for his accepting the position of Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The Nathan Bedford Forrest Bust was installed in the Tennessee State Capitol during 1978 and was still on public display there by the time of Henry's death. In 1987, Henry demanded the removal of a portrait of Tennessee's former Reconstruction-era and Radical Republican Governor William G. Brownlow from the state capitol, because Brownlow had withheld voting rights to Confederate high officials and military leaders that Brownlow and other Radical Republicans in the Tennessee Reconstruction era referred to as \\"traitors\\", while at the same time, enfranchising freed African-American males and extending other civil rights to African-Americans across Tennessee during the Reconstruction era. Henry's request was honored, and the Brownlow portrait was quickly removed from the Tennessee State Capitol. In 1998, Henry made sure the new Nathan Bedford Forrest Statue would be visible to travelers from Interstate 65 by requesting that the Tennessee Department of Transportation remove brush and trees from adjacent right-of-way at taxpayer expense. The fiberglass statue was created by lawyer and sculptor Jack Kershaw, who was one of many lawyers hired to defend James Earl Ray, the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King Jr. The New York Times identified Kershaw in a 2010 obituary article as a founder of the League of the South, a group known for its secessionist messages and anti- immigration rallies.https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/06/worst- confederate-statue-ever-nashville-nathan-bedford-forrest/ This Is the Worst Confederate Statue We‚Äôve Ever Seen. End of legislative service When the Republicans became the majority in the state Senate in 2007, they called Henry the ‚Äúchairman emeritus‚Äù of the body's Finance Committee out of respect. Despite being from the minority party, his views within the committee were given disproportionate weight. After his district was drastically altered by the Republican Legislative majority, Henry announced he would not seek re- election in 2014, instead opting to retire. Yarbro, Henry's challenger in 2010, defeated current Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini in the 2014 primary and is the current Senator from the 21st District. By the time he retired, he was the longest-serving member of the Tennessee legislature, with a 23-year record. On his retirement, the State Comptroller of the Treasury, Justin P. Wilson, called him \\"a true gentleman.\\" Personal life With his wife, Loiette Hume \\"Lolly\\" Henry, Henry had two sons named Robert Selph Henry and Douglas Cornelius Hume Henry, and four daughters named Loiette Henry Thompson, Kathryn Henry-Choisser, Mary Leland Henry Wehner, and the late Emily McMahon. Lolly died in December 2016. Death Henry died on March 5, 2017, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly after his death, former Vice President Al Gore called him \\"a dear friend\\". Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam called him \\"a powerhouse intellect, courteous, kind, genuine and a statesman\\" and added \\"I will miss knowing that his wisdom and perspective are only a phone call away\\". The mayor of Nashville, Megan Barry, praised his \\"high standard for decorum and decency in public life\\" while Vanderbilt University's chancellor Nicholas Zeppos called him \\"a distinguished public servant, esteemed Vanderbilt alumnus, generous benefactor and dear friend.\\" Henry's body was to lie in state in the Tennessee State Capitol on March 9, 2017, which has not happened since Governor Austin Peay in 1927. His funeral was planned to be held at the Downtown Presbyterian Church on March 10, 2017.

Often, the buildings most dramatic and easily recognizable as creations of the Maya peoples, are the step pyramids of the Terminal Preclassic Maya period and beyond. Based in general Mesoamerican architectural traditions, the Maya utilized geometric proportions and intricate carving to build everything from simple houses to ornate temples.Powell, Christopher. \\"The Shapes of Sacred Space: A Proposed System of Geometry Used to Lay Out and Design Maya Art and Architecture and Some Implications Concerning Maya Cosmology\\" Dissertation. 2010. University of Texas. https://www.mayaexploration.org/pdf/PowellDissertation2010_MayaGeometry.pdf This article focuses on the more well-known pre-classic and classic examples of Maya architecture. The temples like the ones at Palenque, Tikal, and Uxmal represent a zenith of Maya art and architecture. Through the observation of numerous elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of Maya architecture have become an important key to understanding their religious beliefs and culture as a whole. Urban design As Maya cities spread throughout the varied geography of Mesoamerica, the extent of site planning appears to have been minimal, their cities having been built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. Maya architecture tends to integrate a great degree of natural features. For instance, some cities existing on the flat limestone plains of the northern Yucat√°n grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of Usumacinta utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed. At the onset of large-scale construction, a predetermined axis was typically established in congruence with the cardinal directions. Depending upon the location and availability of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or cenotes, the city grew by connecting great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all Maya buildings, by means of sacbeob causeways. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great Maya cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasts sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as Teotihuacan and its rigid grid-like construction. Archaeological site at Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico At the heart of the Maya city existed the large plazas surrounded by their most valued governmental and religious buildings such as the royal acropolis, great pyramid temples, and occasionally ballcourts. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with Maya interpretation of the orbits of the stars. Immediately outside this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines: the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people. Classic Era Maya urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. In this case, the open public plazas were the gathering places for the people and the focus of the urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great Maya cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic. In the Postclassic in Peten, Guatemala, smaller protected settlements emerged in defensible locations, for example on peninsulas and islands in the Pet√©n Basin. These sites had diminutive plazas, and smaller ceremonials structures, and the canons of architectural design were modified from the previous Classic period, but were recognizable designs shifts from the Classic patterning https://www.academia.edu/41736857/Architecture_of_the_Maya_Schwarz_proof. Building process All evidence suggests that most stone buildings existed on top of a platform that varied in height from less than a meter to 45 meters depending on importance of the building. A flight of stone steps often split the large platforms on one side, contributing to the common bi-symmetrical appearance of Maya architecture. Depending on the prevalent stylistic tendencies of an area, these platforms most often were built of a stucco and cut stone exterior filled with densely packed gravel. As is the case with many other Maya reliefs, those on the platforms often were related to the intended purpose of the residing structure. Thus, as the sub-structural platforms were completed, the grand residences and temples of the Maya were constructed on the solid foundations of the platforms. As all structures were built, little attention seems to have been given to their utilitarian functionality and much to external aesthetics; however, a certain repeated aspect, the corbelled arch, was often utilized to mimic the appearance and feel of the simple Maya hut. Temple of the Cross, Palenque Though not an effective tool to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct what the Maya referred to as pibnal, or sweatbath, such as those in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque. As structures were completed, typically extensive relief work was added to the layer of stucco. However, many lintel carvings have been discovered, as well as actual stone carvings used as a facade. Commonly, these would continue uninterrupted around an entire structure and contain a variety of artwork pertaining to the inhabitants or purpose of a building. Though not the case in all Maya locations, broad use of painted stucco has been discovered as well. Though the Maya did not use a specific measuring unit, their buildings were still proportioned according to the golden mean. For their homes, the Maya would begin with a square then use a cord or vine to measure the square corner to corner. Then by arcing the cord down, a new base length could be established based on the previous square. The new rectangle's length would be the square root of three, which is a proportion found in nature. Since the Maya had religious connotations for which proportions they used and when, their form of measurement is called sacred geometry. It was also practiced by the Egyptians. The Maya played with different proportions in their temples and homes to yield symmetrical and harmonious designs all without the use of actual units. It has been suggested that, in conjunction to the Maya Long Count Calendar, every fifty-two years, or cycle, temples and pyramids were remodeled and rebuilt. It appears now that the rebuilding process was often instigated by a new ruler or for political matters, as opposed to matching the calendar cycle. However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the North Acropolis at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications. Building materials The Mayan civilization used very simple tools for building their structures. The most common tools use were made of stone found in surrounding areas. Limestone was a huge part of the Mayan tool making, as limestone was geographically very abundant in most settlements. Locations of the Mayan cities were chosen with the access to necessary stones in mind. This allowed most quarries to be right outside the city for easy access to blocks needed for construction. Top limestone quarries used were Palenque and Tikal. Though limestone was the most important material, they still collected sandstone from Quirigu√° and volcanic tuff from Copan. The Mayan people had taken advantage of mortar on most structural projects. The Mayans used a very difficult process of limestone under large amounts of heat to create their mortar. The mortar was so widely used, the Mayans even used it for sculptures, facades, and floor layers. Their mortar was very effective on a large building lifetime, but humid climates can have a negative effect on the mortar. For more important construction projects the Mayans would cover the entire structures exterior with stucco, followed by bright paintings, prioritizing red, yellow, green, and blue. Notable constructions =Ceremonial platforms= These were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps tzompantli, a stake used to display the heads to the victims or defeated Mesoamerican ballgame opponents. =Palaces= Remains of the Palace of Sayil, Yucat√°n Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite. Every exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature. Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs. At Cop√°n (one of the most powerful and important cities), beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the North Acropolis at Tikal appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the Terminal Pre- classic and Early Classic periods.Price, T. D., Burton, J. H., Sharer, R. J., Buikstra, J. E., Wright, L. E., Traxler, L. P., & Miller, K. A. (2010). Kings and commoners at Copan: Isotopic evidence for origins and movement in the Classic Maya period. Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, 29(1), 15-32. ISO 690 =E-groups= \\"E-Group\\" is a classification given by Mayanists to certain structure complexes present at a number of Maya sites located in the central and southern Maya lowlands (e.g., the Pet√©n region). Complexes of this type consist of a stepped pyramid main structure, situated on the western side of a quadrilateral plaza or platform. A raised but rather elongated structure appears along the eastern side of the plaza, running north‚Äìsouth; a variation has three smaller temple mounds on top of or replacing this platform, the middle of these substructures placed directly opposite the main structure. Often, two other subsidiary structures appear on the north and south sides of the plaza, respectively. The main western structure is typically terraced (i.e. has several levels), with inset stairways on each of its four sides, with only the eastern stairway, leading from the plaza, providing access to the summit. The stairways have large balustrades which protrude from the pyramid, which were decorated with large stucco masks and panels of architectural art. In other examples, believed to be of a later date, this quadripartite stairway configuration is lacking. E-group complexes are named after their prototypical example, Structure E-VII-sub at the site of Uaxactun. They were first identified as a meaningful complex by archaeologist Frans Blom in 1924, who excavated the site under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. It has been theorized that these E-groups are observatories, because the eponymous group at Uaxactun contains alignments corresponding approximately to sunrises on the solstices and equinoxes. However, all other E-groups have different orientations, which pertain to widespread groups of astronomical alignments that are also embedded in a number of buildings of other types; hence the term \\"observatory\\" applied to these assemblages is hardly warranted. Other ideas seem to stem from the possible creation story told by the relief and artwork that adorns these structures. =Triadic Groups= They consist of an elevated platform (either an extensive acropolis or a steep pyramid) with a monumental stairway, with a central building facing the stairs, and two lateral structures facing each other on both sides of the platform. This formal complex has been attributed to the earthly re-creation of the Celestial Hearth (modern-day constellation of Orion), or a stage for enthronement rituals.Hansen 1998 Most recently Triadic Groups have been interpreted as sanctuaries commemorating Maize God's resurrection upon the Flowery Mountain.Szymanski 2013 Such complexes appear during the Late Preclassic times and gradually decrease in number until their disappearance in the Early Postclassic. =Pyramids and temples= Tikal, temple pyramid with prominent roof comb Often the most important sanctuaries sat atop towering Maya pyramids, some of over two hundred feet, such as that at El Mirador. The sanctuary on top commonly was heightened by a crest or roof comb. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. At Chich√©n Itz√° there is a pyramid called El Castillo ('the castle'). With four stairways, each with 91 steps (with the upper platform they sum up to 365), and having other architectural elements appearing in astronomically significant numbers, it is a good example of Maya myth and astronomical cycles joined in architecture. Also referred to as the Pyramid of Kukulc√°n, the structure provides a remarkable display, observed by thousands of modern visitors at the equinoxes. The setting sun's rays are projected on the northern balustrade, create the illusion of a snake winding its way down the steps of the pyramid. The snake is composed of several triangle shapes giving it the appearance of a diamond back snake. At the base of the northern stairway there are massive snake head sculptures, making this effect even more persuasive. While it is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone. Maya architecture is vastly different from the others in Meso-American cultures. The blend of mythology and astronomical events can be found in nearly all Maya palace or pyramid structures. One will also notice the heavy influence of the Toltecs in the architecture at Chich√©n Itz√°. The Toltecs invaded the Maya and merged their cultural traditions around the year 1000. =Observatories= El Caracol, the Observatory, Chichen Itza, Mexico The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the Sun, Venus and the Moon. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to Kukulcan, are perhaps those most often described as \\"observatories\\" by modern ruin tour-guides. It is now known, however, that many buildings of different types and uses were oriented on astronomical grounds, mostly to sunrises and sunsets on specific dates. The dates recorded are concentrated in four agriculturally significant seasons and tend to be separated by multiples of elementary periods of the calendrical system (13 and 20 days), suggesting that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and associated ceremonial activities. Although most of the important Maya buildings were oriented on the basis of astronomical criteria, their primary functions were religious, residential or administrative; the label \\"observatory\\" applied to any structural type is thus hardly warranted. =Ballcourts= Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ballgame were constructed throughout the Maya realm, often on a grand scale. The playing alleys of ballcourts were defined by two long walls. Courts built earlier in Maya history (as at Cob√°) had sloped sides, while ones built later (as at Chich√©n Itz√°) had vertical sides. Frequently, the ends were enclosed so as to create an 10px-shaped court when viewed from above. When the Maya played games in the Ballcourts, the ball was made of solid rubber and was sometimes as much as a foot in diameter. It was passed between teams ranged on opposite ends of the court. The players could hit it only with their knees or hips, much like football or soccer today. Points could be scored when the opponents failed to return the ball correctly. In central Mexico, and in late times in Yucat√°n, rings of stone were set high up in the side walls of the court. It was considered a particular triumph for a player to knock the ball through the ring.Proskouriakoff, Tatiana. (2002). An Album of Maya Architecture. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. p.38. Cave sites There are also cave sites that are important to the Maya. Maya cave sites include Jolja Cave, the cave site at Naj Tunich, the Candelaria Caves, and the Cave of the Witch. There are also cave creation myths among the Maya. Some cave sites are still used by the modern Maya in the Chiapas highlands in Mexico. Some of these caves were completely or partially artificial.Brady, J. E., & Ashmore, W. (1999).

As one of the protagonists of this media franchise, he has made appearances in the several manga, the original anime adaptation, OVAs, films and video games. He has also inspired a large number of collectibles. Considered the most mature and wisest of the five heroes, Shiry≈´ is the Bronze Saint of the Dragon constellation, whose Cloth possesses legendary defensive and offensive properties. Shiry≈´ is one of the ten surviving orphans trained to become Athena's Saints by Mitsumasa Kido. With Kido dead, Shiry≈´ and his allies become the protectors of his adopted granddaughter, Saori, Athena's reincarnation. Critical reception to Shiryu has been mixed, with praise on his fight scenes in the series but criticism focused on the abuse of his training as a plot device to come up with new techniques to defeat enemies. Character outline Out of the five main characters from Saint Seiya, Shiry≈´ is the calmest and most collected. He greatly respects his master Libra Dohko, from whom he learned not only how to use his Cosmo to fight, but also fundamental wisdom for life. He trained at Lushan for six years under his tutelage, during which time he befriended the old master's prot√©g√© Shunrei. In addition to possessing great physical strength, Shiry≈´ owns one of the most durable Bronze Cloths. Having spent the last two and a half centuries under the mineral-rich waterfall of Lushan, it is harder than diamonds. It is also legendary for the shield on its left arm and its right gauntlet, endowed with powerful piercing capabilities, which have earned the Cloth its nickname as \\"the strongest fist and shield\\". In times of extreme need, the five main Bronze Saints are also allowed to temporarily wear Gold Cloths. In the Sanctuary arc, Shiry≈´ used the weapons of the Libra Gold Cloth to free Cygnus Hy≈çga from Aquarius Camus's ice coffin. In the two battles against Poseidon and Thanatos, he wore the Libra Cloth. Shiry≈´ sports the image of a green and white dragon on his back which is connected to his guardian constellation and only appears as his Cosmo is rising. Whenever his life is in danger, the image begins to fade. Once it completely vanishes, it is a sign that Shiry≈´'s Cosmo has reached zero and he is dead. Appearances =Saint Seiya= Six years after the Graude Foundation sends Shiry≈´ to train at in China, he obtains the Bronze Cloth of the Dragon constellation from Libra Dohko. He then returns to Japan to participate in the Galaxian Wars tournament, wherein he is narrowly defeated by Seiya. When Phoenix Ikki steals the Gold Cloth, Shiry≈´ becomes involved in the battles to recover it from the Black Saints and eventually discovers that Saori Kido is the Goddess Athena whom he swore to protect. In the following battles against the Silver Saints, Shiry≈´ is forced to blind himself to achieve victory against Perseus Algol. His injury does not keep him from battle and he joins his fellow Bronze Saints as they go to Sanctuary to depose the false Pope, Gemini Saga. He recovers his sight upon awakening his seventh sense in the fight against Cancer Deathmask. In the Poseidon arc, he confronts the General Chrysaor Krishna. Having been repaired with the blood of the Gold Saints after the battles of the Twelve Temples, the Dragon Cloth becomes golden whenever Shiry≈´ uses his Cosmo to the maximum and awakens his seventh sense. However, even that added protection is unable to keep Shiry≈´ from losing his eyesight a second time to Krishna's overwhelming attacks. In the end, he manages to cutting through the General's chakras and defeat him. He then destroys the Pillar guarded by Krishna and joins Seiya to free Athena and reseal Poseidon. Shiry≈´ defeats several Specters during the Hades arc. He awakens his eighth sense and his Cloth is endowed with the power of Athena's divine blood by Aries Shion, which enables him to travel to Elysion and deliver Athena's divine Cloth to her. After a confrontation with the twin gods Hypnos and Thanatos, he awakens the Dragon God Cloth and successfully helps Athena defeat Hades. =Saint Seiya: Next Dimension= In the official sequel of the manga of Saint Seiya, Shiryu and Shunrei have adopted a baby whom they named Shoryu. Then, he goes back in time with Hyoga, to the time of the previous Holy War against Hades in the eighteenth century, in order to help Saori / Athena save Seiya's life, who is cursed by the sword of the god of the underworld. Shiryu is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of Libra successor to Dohko, from the Gold Saint of the eighteenth century Libra Dohko (Young).Saint Seiya Next Dimension vol.7 cap.52 =Saint Seiya Omega= In the original series Saint Seiya Omega, Shiry≈´ is still alive well after the Hades arc events. According to the Saint Seiya Omega history, Shiry≈´ finally returned to Lushan, where he married his love interest Shunrei and fathered a boy called Ry≈´h≈ç. Due to an unspecified accident, however, Shiry≈´ has lost all of his five senses and was forced to step down as a Saint, bequeathing his armor, duties and obligations to his son.Saint Seiya: Omega, episode 4 Following the defeat of the God of Darkness Abzu, Shiry≈´'s senses are restored, but he insists that Ry≈´h≈ç must continue his duty as the next Dragon Saint. During the war against the Pallasites, Shiry≈´ joins the assault on the enemy stronghold donning the Libra Cloth, which he inherited from the previous Libra Golden Saint, Genbu. =Other appearances= Shiryu has also appeared in multiple spinoffs from the series including its films and novels such as the Gigantomachia. Reception In Japan, Shiry≈´ is the most popular of the Saint Seiya protagonists, ranking first in the main characters poll of the five Bronze Saints. The Journal of Popular Culture noted the use of Shiryu's techniques where a dragon is seen alongside his fists as one of Kurumada's most striking illustrations in the Saint Seiya manga due to the style the impact has. Additionally, when Shiryu faces Cancer Deathmask, the writer addressed that Kurumada's message as seen through this fight scene is that people should still embrace violence based on what the aggressor has done, with Deathmask having attacked the innocent Shunrei. Kenji Akabane considers the character both \\"cool\\" and \\"serious\\". DVDVisionJapan praised Hirotaka Suzuoki's work for making Shiryu sound like a \\"wise fighter\\". His fight against Seiya was also found enjoyable by the reviewer for the amount of violence that might be seen as fanservice and the dramatic considerations when the cast believe one of the two would die. Chris Beveridge from AnimeOnDVD liked the fight between Shiryu and Death Mask, calling it one of the most interesting showdowns from the DVD reviewed also finding a level of risk enjoyable due to Shiryu nearly falling to the Underworld. Mark Thomas of the Fandom Post criticized Shiryu's overuse of his Rising Dragon as he tends to repeat in all of his fights even when his enemies manage to block it. Similarly, in a review of the series, writer Jason Thompson notes Kurumada tend to make overuse of Shiryu's training so that in a latter fight, he remembers to use a more powerful technique in order to defeat his enemies. Thompson also felt that Shiryu healing Seiya through removing his blood too gruesome in that a similar action is repeated when Shiryu blinds himself to defeat a Silver Saint. IGN noted that Shiryu stands out for being able fight despite being disabled and is one of Seiya's closest friends despite initially clashing as enemies in the series' beginning. In regards to the Netflix series, HobbyConsolas warned long time fans not to expect the original violent battle between Shiryu and Seiya from the original series as a result of the demographic intended.

History  Formed in 1984, from the ashes of the (then) broken-up Sad Lovers & Giants, Tristan Garel-Funk and Nigel Pollard conceived the band, but Pollard left prior to recording the first album. Vocalist Marc Lewis responded to an advert in Melody Maker for a singer and shared a flat with Garel-Funk, the pair recruited Liam McGuinness on Bass and John Greville of Rudimentary Peni on drums. The music was an original fusion of post-punk, indie rock and a dynamic guitar and vocal soundscape. Not unlike Sad Lovers & Giants before them, they focused on creating dreamy rock anthems and at least partly, discarded the post-punk influences of many their contemporaries. Consequently, the band found that the European market was more aligned to their musical style and they toured abroad extensively. Distancing themselves from Britain and shunning UK dates meant that the regular indie labels were largely uninterested. However, Midnight Music, who had been the home of early SL&G;, signed the band. A new album was already recorded, but this did not surface for some years, eventually appearing on the small Ophidian label, an offshoot of Rotator Records, thanks to a friend of Garel-Funk. The word Ophidian can mean 'snake-like'. The Snake Corps reformed in 2010. Carl Jones joined on guitar, Liam McGuinness rejoined on Bass with a new drummer Richie Harris. The Snake Corps made a triumphant return to live performance with a gig in Salamandra Venue Barcelona, Spain on 18 September 2010. The reformed Snake Corps with Marc on lead vocals were busy in 2011, playing gigs in London and Berlin with Steve Williams on lead guitar. Now with 3 original members they also played several sell out gigs in Spain in the autumn of 2011 (including the Rock Kitchen in Madrid) these now featured Simon Meek on keyboards, with Liam McGuinness moving to guitar, and original bass player Jim Blanchard also rejoining the band, with Dave Vigay on drums. The band played London's 02 Academy in Islington on 21 April 2012 supporting Chameleons Vox and had their best gig since reforming 2 years before. Carl Jones joined again on guitar for gigs in Spain in 2014 (Valencia) and 2015 (Tarragona) and left the band in 2016. They released a new EP featuring four new songs in September 2016. Gigs followed in Berlin in October and Madrid in November. They played their first- ever gig in Italy in Salerno in 17 April and play with their old friends the Chameleons Vox in Brighton in 17 May.

UTET. is a town and comune of Arb√´resh origin in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy. Located in the heart of Sicania on the northern slopes of Monte delle Rose, almost equidistant from Palermo and Agrigento, it is a town of Arb√´resh√´ origin. Although the inhabitants have abandoned the use of the Arb√´resh language, the town's inhabitants preserve the Byzantine rite in their liturgy. Palazzo Adriano is best known internationally for being among the filming locations of the Oscar-winning film Cinema Paradiso. The local economy is primarily dedicated to agriculture. History The first mention of a casale Adrianum (farmstead of Adriano) dates from before 1060 under the reign of the Norman Roger I of Sicily. More reliable is information about the hamlet of Palazzo Adriano reported in a 1243 document. From 1282, the fiefs land holdings that now constitute the area of Palazzo Adriano saw more than thirty baronies granted leases by the abbots of the monastery of Santa Maria di Fossanova. In 1787, the Royal Court of Ferdinand IV of Naples captured all these land holdings, which fell under the control of Palermo. Ethnic groups Starting in the 15th century, a group of Albanians, the Arb√´resh√´, settled in the sparsely populated areas around Palazzo Adriano. The fall of the last Albanian resistance under Skanderbeg after the Ottoman invasion prompted many Albanians to flee Albania. The Arb√´resh√´ settled in small farmhouses built by shepherds and peasants. Throughout the ensuing centuries, the Arb√´resh√´ kept their culture intact and continued to speak Albanian. In the 19th century, the flow of immigrants from Albania dried up, such that the Albanians in Palazzo Adriano became cut off from those in their homeland. Although Palazzo Adriano is defined as an 'Albanian minority town' under the Law 482/99 ('Rules on the protection of historical linguistic minorities'), the Arb√´resh language is no longer the common language within the Albanian community, and is today lost. The Albanian language continues in the prayer and liturgy of churches that follow the Byzantine Rite. Main sights *Church of Maria SS.

History The history of Invacare can be traced back to 1885 when the Worthington Company began to produce a wide range of wheelchairs. The product lines were expanded several times, but its main focus remained in wheelchairs. In the 1970s, Invacare was owned by Technicare, a Cleveland medical device manufacturer. With Mal Mixon as its Vice President of Marketing, the company branched into the field of diagnostic imaging. Later in 1978, Technicare was acquired by Johnson & Johnson who subsequently put Invacare up for sale. Driven by the wish of running his own firm, Mal Mixon expressed interest in buying Invacare. Because of financial constraint, Mixon had to borrow $4.3 million and raise another $2.5 million in order to buy Invacare at $7.8 million. The transaction closed on December 28, 1979.

Kingdom, court, and royalty A Classic period Maya polity was a small kingdom (ajawil, ajawlel, ajawlil) headed by a hereditary ruler ‚Äì ajaw, later k ºuhul ajaw. Both terms appear in early Colonial texts including Papeles de Paxbol√≥n where they are used as synonyms for Aztec and Spanish terms for rulers and their domains. These are tlatoani and tlahtocayotl in Nahuatl, and the Spanish words rey, majestad, and reino and se√±or for ruler/leader/lord and se√±or√≠o or dominio of realm. Such kingdoms were usually no more than a capital city with its neighborhood and several dependent towns (similar to a city-state). There were also larger polities that controlled larger territories and subjugated smaller polities; the extensive systems controlled by Tikal and Caracol serve as examples of these. Each kingdom had its name that did not necessarily correspond to any locality within its territory. Its identity was that of a political unit associated with a particular ruling dynasty. For instance, the archaeological site of Naranjo was the capital of the kingdom of Saal. The land (chan ch ºe ºn) of the kingdom and its capital were called Wakab ºnal or Maxam and were part of a larger geographical entity known as Huk Tsuk. Despite constant warfare and eventual shifts in regional power, most kingdoms never disappeared from the political landscape until the collapse of the whole system in the 9th century. In this respect, Classic Maya kingdoms were similar to late Postclassic polities encountered by the Spanish in Yucat√°n and Central Mexico: some polities were subordinate to hegemonic centers or rulers through conquest and/or dynastic unions and yet even then they persisted as distinct entities. Presentation of captives to a Maya ruler Mayanists have been increasingly accepting the \\"court paradigm\\" of Classic Maya societies that puts the emphasis on the centrality of the royal household and especially the person of the king. This approach focuses on the totality of Maya monumental spaces as the embodiment of the diverse activities of the royal household. It considers the role of places and spaces (including dwellings of royalty and nobles, throne rooms, temples, halls and plazas for public ceremonies) in establishing and negotiating power and social hierarchy, but also in producing and projecting aesthetic and moral values that define the order of a wider social realm. Spanish sources invariably describe even the largest Maya settlements of Yucat√°n and Guatemala as dispersed agglomerations of dwellings grouped around the temples and palaces of the ruling dynasty and lesser nobles. Though there was economic specialization among Classic period Maya centers (see Chunchucmil, for example), it was not conducted at a scale similar to that of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Some argue that Maya cities were not urban centersSanders and Webster 1988:523-524. but were, instead, structured according to and conceptualized as enormous royal households, the locales of the administrative and ritual activities of the royal court. Within the theoretical framework of this model, they were the places where privileged nobles could approach the holy ruler, where aesthetical values of the high culture were formulated and disseminated, and where aesthetic items were consumed.Sanders and Webster 1988:524. They were the self-proclaimed centers and the sources of social, moral, and cosmic, order. The fall of a royal court as in the well-documented cases of Piedras Negras or Cop√°n would cause the inevitable 'death' of the associated settlement. Social classes =Kinship= Ancient Maya kinship and descent have alternatively been described as patrilineal, matrilineal, and bilateral. Maya political organization has been characterized as both segmentary (involving well-defined lineages and clan-like structures) and centralized. =Scribes= Scribes held a prominent position in Maya courts and had their own patron deities (see Howler monkey gods and Maya maize god). They are likely to have come from aristocratic families. It appears that some scribes were attached to the royal house, while others were serving at temples and were, perhaps, counted among the priests. It seems likely that they were organized hierarchically. Maya art often depicts rulers with trappings indicating they were scribes or at least able to write, such as having pen bundles in their headdresses. Additionally, many rulers have been found in conjunction with writing tools such as shell or clay ink pots. Body modifications To the ancient Maya, body modification was a reflection of a cultural, and individual identity.William N. Duncan and Charles Andrew Hofling (2011). WHY THE HEAD? CRANIAL MODIFICATION AS PROTECTION AND ENSOULMENT AMONG THE MAYA. Ancient Mesoamerica, 22, pp 199-210 Through different modifications, the body could be experienced individually, used as a symbol, or as a political statement. Beauty was also used to outwardly show and perform social and moral values. Physical remains of the Maya help piece together the motivation and significance for enduring vast amounts of pain, and using great amounts of their wealth to make themselves beautiful. Ancient Maya placed a high value on certain extreme body modifications, often undergoing tedious and painful procedures as a rite of passage, an homage to their gods, and as a permanently visible status symbol of their place in society that would last a lifetime, and into their afterlife. Therefore, there was aesthetic, religious, and social reasoning behind the modification.Romero-Vargas S, Ruiz-Sandoval JL, Sotomayor-Gonz√°lez A, Revuelta-Guti√©rrez R, Celis-L√≥pez MA, G√≥mez-Amador JL, Garc√≠a-Gonz√°lez U, et al. 2010. ‚ÄúA Look at Mayan Artificial Cranial Deformation Practices: Morphological and Cultural Aspects.‚Äù Neurosurgical Focus 29 (6): 2. = Cranium modification = The origin of cranial modification among the Maya is unknown, but it possibly was inherited from the Olmecs, predecessors of the Maya, who were located near the Tuxtla Mountains. Cranial modification was one of the most important practices of the Olmec culture. Individuals enduring cranial modification could be of any status, but many more elite individuals were depicted with cranial modifications. Intentional deformation practices were used as a way to differentiate between members of the society. All members of an elite family were expected to go through cranial modification, starting shortly after birth. The procedure occurred while the skull of the child was not fully grown and still soft, making it easily shaped.  Evidence  Most evidence of cranial deformation is found through osteological remains discovered through archaeological excavation of Maya sites. Through analysis of the different forms of the skulls, osteologists are able to differentiate between subtle differences in deformation styles to understand what these differences may mean. Interpretation of these different cranium types has been debated, but it is clear the shapes differed based on time and region. Spanish and other European records also provided detailed descriptions of cranium modification within their historical records. Some of the Spanish documentation included the different methods and materials used for cranium modification. Archaeological remains including artistic depictions or figurines exhibiting modified skull shape help to illuminate the importance of distinguishing one's self through the various types of modification.  Shapes  There are as many as 14 different cranial shapes caused by several different types of purposeful modification or deformation techniques used by members of the Maya society. Neonatal deformation was performed in two main ways: compression of the head with pads and adjusted bindings, or restraining the child on specially designed cradles. Often, a binding device was attached to the forehead so instead of growing naturally into a round or circular form, the child's cranium grew into a long, and tapered form which indented above the brow line. These different modifications resulted in an abundant amount of stress on the new child's body, and often led to death. The two main head shapes of cranial modification for the Maya were erect deformation and oblique deformation. Erect deformation was modification through the use of cradle boards, which often left the occipital flattening asymmetrical, and affected a child's mobility. Oblique deformation was modification through the use of a paddle applied to the head and was sometimes in use with a frontal board and bandaging. This type of deformation did not cause problems with mobility. Practiced by all members of society, there were distinct differences of temporal and regional preferences. During the Preclassic period, 2000 BCE ‚Äì 250 CE, Maya skull modification imitated the head form of Olmec gods depicted throughout Olmec artwork. With the use of new and different techniques emerging in the Classic period, 250-900 CE, new cranial modification styles were endured, possibly as an indicator of membership within a kin group, or as a sign of a specific status. Additionally, in the Classic period, the general population used the erect deformation style of modification, while children expected to have high-status positions were given oblique deformation. Around 900 CE, the modification style standardized, and most human remains were found with tall skulls and flattened foreheads, the same modifications documented by the Spaniards when they arrived in Mesoamerica. Regional differences in cranial modification styles were also evident. Within the Western Maya lowlands, the popular style of modification imitated the shape of the Maize God's head, and therefore, more people were discovered to have slanted skulls. Across the Guatemala highlands, erect deformation shapes were more likely to be used, and sometimes a band was placed vertically down the head to separate the head into two distinct sections. Cranial modification was able to draw lines between different ethnic groups, as well as represent social status/hierarchy within an individual culture.  Significance  Members of the community were expected to go through cranium modification as a part of a child's integration into the society. Maya men aspired to look like their ruler, Pakal, who was meant to represent incarnations of the deities. Pakal's body was shaped to resemble motifs and images of what the Sun and Maize gods were expected to look like. Evidence of the social hierarchy of the Maya was shown in pottery, figurines, drawings, monuments, and architecture picturing high-status elites with the oblique cranium modification. The oblique style cranuml modification, the style endured by Pakal, may have also meant to shape the head like a jaguar, a figure extremely important to Maya religion, sacred to their culture, and a status of power. Additionally, Maya women standards of beauty were also based on the Maize God. Overall, cranial modifications are significant because of their relation with deities and power symbols of the Maya and the outwardly performative aspect displaying specific characteristics of a member within the Maya culture and society.  Motivation  Due to a lack of written records on the reasons or motivation for cranial modification, the reason the head was the center of this modification is still not clear. One reason is possibly the need for children to be protected when they are born. The Maya believed when children were born, they were vulnerable and thus needed to be protected from soul loss and evil winds. The soul was encased within the head, and therefore these newly souled infants needed to be guarded; cranium modification was one of the ways to protect the soul from being snatched from the newborn. The head was understood to be a portal into a person's true essence or essential entity, which could be harmed, stolen, or manipulated. Performing cranial modification as soon as the child was born ensured the soul, or essence, of the child was fully protected. Additionally, hair was seen as a way to preserve the essence of the soul, tonalli, from leaving the head of the body. Cutting the hair of a boy too soon was thought to diminish that individual's knowledge and reason. Lastly, Tzompantli, or skull racks, were associated with passage to the celestial world, and the heads on the rack were believed to contain the essence of the individual spirits. Therefore, by killing an enemy and removing their skulls from their bodies, the essence of the individual was violated. = Dental modification = An example of inlay dental modification Dental modification may have been a way to identify with a lineage, polity, ruler, or region. The modification of teeth was dependent on social status, as well as location.Williams, Jocelyn S, and Christine D White. 2006. ‚ÄúDental Modification in the Postclassic Population from Lamanai, Belize.‚Äù Ancient Mesoamerica 17 (01): 139‚Äì51. The Maya practiced two different types of tooth modification, filing and inlay. Filing was altering the tooth shape to create notches, grooves, or points. This type of dental modification appeared during the Early Preclassic period (1400-1000 BCE) and was completed with stone abraders and water. Inlay was drilling holes to insert different materials, and was popular throughout the Middle Preclassic period (900-600 BCE). In the remainder of the time periods the two were used simultaneously, but filing was much more common overall. Most likely teeth were modified as a part of ritual or for aesthetic purposes, and younger children usually did not have modified teeth. Once their permanent teeth had arrived, adolescent warriors had their teeth filed to sharp points to give them a fierce appearance, and as a further mark of status.[4] Maya women filed their teeth, or had holes drilled into them where precious stones or luxury materials, such as jade, pyrite, hematite, or turquoise could be inlaid into the teeth. High-status women often had their teeth filed, in different patterns, and would have jadeite, hematite, pyrite, turquoise, or other decorations inset into holes drilled in their teeth.[4] Depending on the material, the meaning of the inlay varied. For example, jade symbolized pure breath or the ability to express elegant speech.  Evidence  Overall, little evidence for the relationship between socioeconomic status and types of dental modification exists. Most evidence comes from documentation of Europeans in the 16th century who viewed the processes of dental modification. However, these accounts can be problematic as they are filled with bias, and much of the process may be recorded incorrectly, or emphasized in a way to villainize the Maya. More concrete evidence is found through archaeological of ceramics or iconography, and osteological remains of Maya people themselves. Iconographic or images of dental modification, including filling and inlay, are pictured on ceramics or within paintings found at Maya or other Mesoamerican sites. Additionally, teeth of Maya individuals have been excavated from Maya sites and analyzed by dendrologists and other dental specialists recognized dental disease associated with excess filling or drilling of the teeth. This means dental modification was occurring on living subjects. Dental diseases found on the remains of the teeth of Maya individuals shows evidence for excessive dental modifications. Additionally, some of the dental remains were inlaid with various stones, and were filed in a variety of ways.  Significance  Modification of the teeth was important as different teeth styles exhibited certain characteristics and motifs important to Maya religion, and social status. ‚ÄúModified dentition conveyed ideas about wealth, threat, and the nature of speech.‚Äù Incisors were filed in ‚ÄúT‚Äù shape to represent ‚Äúwind‚Äù motifs, as wind was especially important to the Maya embodying the ‚Äúlife force‚Äù and a way to honor the maize god. Pakal, the Maya King, had his teeth filed in the shape of a ‚ÄúT‚Äù as a way to change the structure of his facial features to make it look as though he were squinting, a direct reflection of the maize god. Teeth were an advertisement of status and as it was an abundant amount of pain, it was likely a rite of passage into adulthood, signifying the ability to tolerate pain. Overall, dental modification was meant to show a specific kind of status, despite being endured by both men and women of various classes. Enduring this type of pain exhibited traits about the overall character of an individual, and congratulated members for reaching a milestone of life. = Skin modification = Body paint, tattoos, and scarification were all used in different ways by the Mayan to signify important events in one's life, as well as to symbolize differing class distinctions.Geller, Pamela L. Transforming bodies, transforming identities: A consideration of pre-Columbian Maya corporeal beliefs and practices. (2004): 371. As evidence of skin modification from human remains can not be studied, the evidence for tattooing, scarification, and body paint among the Maya comes from iconographic images such as pottery and murals, artifacts such as tools and vessels used for storing pigment, as well as ethnohistoric accounts.Tremain, Cara G. \\"A Multidisciplinary Approach to Ancient Maya Adornment and Costume: Mobilizing the Body and the Senses.\\" Totem: The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology 19, no. 1 (2011): 76.  Body paint  Mural from Bonampak of elite man being painted red Body paint patterns were incredibly localized and color and design varied according to location. Two of the most widely used colors among the Maya were red, which was made of cinnabar or vermilion, with hematite and iron ore added.Miller, Mary. \\"Extreme Makeover.\\" Archaeology 62, no. 1 (2009): 5. Another popular culture, and one that was possibly the most valued among the Mayans was a blue or green pigment made with indigo and a mineral called Palygorskite. This blue/green color was highly valued because it was associated not only with jade, but with sacrifice to the gods as well. Spanish explorer Diego de Landa states in one of his accounts: > \\"...they had the custom of painting their faces and bodies red... they > thought it very pleasing...the victim....having smeared him with blue... > they brought him up to the round alter...\\" The evidence for body painting among the Mayan largely comes from various murals. One mural found in Bonampak, Chiapa shows a man being painted red from the neck down by a servant while a woman's face is painted red. Another mural found at Calakmul depicts merchants and non-elites wearing face paint of various colors and designs, suggesting that paint may have been used to differentiate class and gender.  Tattoos and scarification  While there is a physical difference between scarification and tattoos, the Mayans may not have differentiated between the two practices. Tattoos and scarification were used to mark significant events in a Mayan's life. Diego de Landa says: > \\"A thief from the highest class is punished by having his face tattooed on > both sides from the beard to the forehead. ‚Ä¶ the young men do not tattoo > except to a slight degree until marriage.‚Äù Scholar Cara Tremain argues that some tattoos and scars may have been associated with the elite, as ‚Äúkilling‚Äù and ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù of the skin through cutting creates an association with death and the rebirth of deities. Tremain also argues that some types of tattooing and scarification symbolized valor and bravery. This theory is supported by the accounts of Diego de Landa who said: > ‚ÄúThey tattooed their bodies, and the more they do this, the more brave and > valiant are they considered, as tattooing is accompanied with great > suffering, and is done in this way. Those who do the work first painted the > part which they wish with color and afterwards they delicately cut in the > paintings, and so with the blood and coloring matter the marks remained in > the body. This work is done a little at a time on account of the extreme > pain, an afterwards also they were quite sick with it, since the designs > festered and matter formed. In spite of all this they made fun of those who > were not tattooed.‚Äù = Piercings = The practice of piercing one's ears, lips, nose, or cheeks was shared by all Mayans, but it was the type of jewelry worn that was used to differentiate social status. Children would be pierced at a young age as well, with ear flares and spools getting increasingly bigger as the child aged, stretching the ear. The majority of evidence for Mayan piercings comes from archaeological remains of jewelry found in tombs, such as labrets and ear spools. Ethnohistorical accounts also provide us evidence for the amount and high quality of the piercings the Mayans wore. In an account of his travels the Spanish Bishop Diego Lopez de Cogolludiois stated: > ‚ÄúThe holes in the noses and ears [were filled with] nose and ear pieces of > cuzas and other stones of varied colors.‚Äù = Visual modification = In Relaci√≥n de las cosas de Yucat√°n, Diego de Landa reports that Mayan mothers would artificially induce cross-eyedness in infants. Cross-eyedness was seen as a valued characteristic and it has been suggested that the Mayan deity Kinich Ahau was depicted as cross-eyed as well.  Warfare  The Mayas employed warfare in each period of their development for the purposes of obtaining sacrificial victims, settling competitive rivalries, acquiring critical resources and gaining control of trade routes. Warfare was important to the Maya religion, because raids on surrounding areas provided the victims required for human sacrifice, as well as slaves for the construction of temples. Large-scale battles were also fought to determine and defend territories as well as secure economic power. The Mayas defended their cities with defensive structures such as palisades, gateways, and earthworks. Some cities had a wall within the outer wall, so advancing enemies would be trapped in a killing alley, where they could be slaughtered in great number. During the post-Classic period, the amount of internal warfare increased greatly as the region became more politically fragmented. Armies were enlarged, and in some cases mercenaries were hired. The resulting destruction of many urban centers contributed to the decline of the Maya. =Military organization= The ruler of a Maya city was the supreme war captain. Some only dictated military activity, while others participated in the battle. There was a core of warriors that served year-round as guards and obtained sacrificial victims, but most large Maya cities and religious centers had militias. These men were paid to fight for the duration of the battle. Then they would return to their fields or crafts. The militia units were headed by nacoms, hereditary war chiefs, that employed ritual as well as strategic methods in warfare. Some nacoms were only chief strategists, and the troops were led into battle by batabs, or officers. In a large war, even commoners who did not have weapons would fight using hunting tools and by hurling rocks. ‚ÄúIn the highlands, women occasionally fought in battles according to native chronicles‚Äù (Foster, 144). =Tactics= The jungle terrain of Mesoamerica made it difficult for large armies to reach their destination. The warriors who were familiar with the battle landscape could strategically retreat into familiar wilderness. Other war tactics included the siege of cities and the formation of alliances with lesser enemies to defeat more prominent ones. There is evidence that canoes were used to attack cities, located on lakes and rivers. In the late Classic period, destructive warfare methods, such as burning, became more prevalent. =Rituals= Warfare was a ritual process, which was believed to be sanctioned by the gods. Military leaders, in many instances, also had religious authority. Before going into battle, the armies would call upon the gods with dances and music of drums, whistles, conch shell horns and singing. The drumming and war cries would signify the start of the battle. The armies also carried religious idols into battle to inspire the warriors. They fought fiercely because they believed that death on the battle field secured them eternal bliss, whereas capture by the enemy was regarded as worse than any death. When an enemy was defeated, the victorious army exploited the religious icons and sometimes humiliated the defeated leader with prolonged captivity. The treatment of prisoners by the victorious was brutal and often ended in decapitation. The Maya also had a ritual of giving blood. The reason that they gave blood was to show respect to their gods. They gave blood from their genitals and tongue. Afterwards, they would drip their blood onto a piece of paper and burn it into the sky to show respect to their gods. =Weapons and uniform= Weapons used by the Maya included spear- throwers known as atlatls, blowguns, obsidian spiked clubs, spears, axes, lances and knives tipped with flint or obsidian blades. Bow and arrows were also used, but not as extensively. Though there were few helmets, they used decorated shields made from woven mats, wood and animal skins for protection. The Maya war leaders dressed to inspire their warriors and terrify their enemies. They usually wore padded cotton armor, a mantle with religious insignia, and elaborate wooden and cloth headdresses, that represented the animal spirit or ‚Äúway‚Äù of the warrior. Metal was not used in battle because of the limited supply.

He was born in Tenosique, Tabasco \\"almost by accident\\", since his family was among the most notable of M√©rida, Yucat√°n; he was the great-grandson of Pedro S√°inz de Baranda, the founder of the Mexican Navy and a former Governor of Yucat√°n.https://www.letraslibres.com/mexico- espana/jose-maria-pino-suarez-la-errada-lealtad At a very young age, Pino moved to M√©rida to study under the Jesuits, later obtaining a Law degree from Instituto Literario de Yucat√°n in 1894. Two years later he married Mar√≠a C√°mara Vales, born into one of the most conspicuous families of the Yucatecan aristocracy. After his marriage, Pino practiced law both in M√©rida and in Mexico City and also participated in several business ventures with his father in law, Raymundo C√°mara Luj√°n, a wealthy hacienda owner. By 1904, with the financial backing of the C√°mara family, he ventured into journalism, becoming a newspaper proprietor after founding El Peninsular, an evening daily. He was a political outsider when he met Francisco Madero in Puerto Progreso in Yucat√°n in 1909. Madero, the scion of one of the wealthiest families in Mexico, had published the \\"Presidential Succession in 1910\\", a bestselling book that argued for the need to transition from the D√≠az regime toward a liberal democracy. Pino became an early adherent of Madero's ideals, and the two developed a very close personal relationship. Madero declared his candidacy in the 1910 presidential elections but was imprisoned by the regime. Managing to escape, he sought political asylum in San Antonio, Texas. While this happened, Pino, himself under threat from the regime, joined Madero in the United States. It was from San Antonio, with the tacit acquiescence of the Taft administrationJohn Womack, Jr. \\"The Mexican Revolution\\" in Mexico Since Independence, ed. Leslie Bethell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 131., that Madero declared the 1910 presidential elections to have been fraudulent, effectively launching the Mexican Revolution. Forming a provisional government until such time as fresh presidential elections could be organised, Madero appointed Pino as a Secretary of State for Justice (1910‚Äì1911)https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/7/3364/19.pdf. In 1911, after the Revolution had succeeded, forcing General D√≠az to resign, Pino was elected as Governor of Yucat√°n. At the same time, the Constitutional Progressist Party designated Madero as presidential candidate and Pino as the vice-presidential candidate in a ticket which would win the 1911 presidential elections. Resigning from the governorship, Pino moved to Mexico City to swear the oath of office as Vice-President, in the first democratically elected government in Mexico's history. Concurrent with the vice-presidency, Pino also served as President of the Senate (1911‚Äì12) and then as Secretary of State for Education and Fine Arts (1912‚Äì13). His period in the vice-presidency was turbulent. He faced acerbic attacks from a press that had transitioned from absolute censorship to complete freedom. Having been a leading figure in the Revolution that toppled D√≠az, his figure was unpopular with the oligarchy that had formed under the prior regime. On the other hand, he was considered to be too moderate by many revolutionarieshttps://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/7/3103/8.pdf. In 1913, army officers loyal to the old regime launched a putsch against the government. The coup was originally unsuccessful in taking over the seat of the executive, National Palace (Mexico). Contained in La Ciudadela, the coup had all but failed until Victoriano Huerta, Commander in Chief of the Army, entered into talks with the putschist officers. With the support of Henry Lane Wilson, the U.S. Ambassador in Mexico, Huerta betrayed the government, arresting the entire cabinet. Madero and Pino were forced to resign at gunpoint and subsequently assassinated, provoking a national and international outcry. Outrage for their deaths was a main catalyst behind President Woodrow Wilson's decision to order the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914, and in causing the fall of the unpopular Huerta Dictatorship, the last military dictatorship in Mexican history. Their sacrifice paved the way for the establishment of democracy in Mexico and for the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution. In 1969, his widow, Mar√≠a C√°mara Vales, was awarded the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor by the Senate of the Republic (Mexico), recognizing their sacrifice.Medalla Belisario Dom√≠nguez otorgada por el Senado de la Rep√∫blica Early years Pino Su√°rez visits the Aerial Exhibition accompanied by the journalist Gerald Brandon Progressive Constitutionalist Party (PCP) host an banquet in honor of Pino Su√°rez, who was seen as the leader, together with Gustavo A. Madero (sitting to his right), of the more liberal and socially progressive politicians who formed a slim majority in the Chamber of Deputies between 1912 and 1913. He was the son of Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Salvatiel, a prosperous businessman of Cantabrian origin and Josefa Su√°rez Abreu. Both his parents had been born in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, of Spanish origin. He was born into a well-known family in the Yucat√°n peninsula. His great- grandfather was Pedro Sainz de Baranda y Borreiro (1787‚Äì1845), a former Governor of Yucat√°n who, having fought in the Battle of Trafalgar and in the Mexican War of Independence, is acknowledged as the founder of the Mexican Navy.. Two of his sons, Joaqu√≠n Baranda y Quijano and General Pedro Baranda y Quijano, also had distinguished political careers on their own right. The former was a lawyer, politician, writer and Mexican historian who served as Secretary of State for Justice (1882‚Äì1901) for almost two decades under President Porfirio D√≠az. The latter, was a deputy in the constituent assembly of 1857, and promoted the creation of the states of Campeche and Morelos, serving as Governor of both states.Diccionario Porr√∫a de Historia, Biograf√≠a y Geograf√≠a de M√©xico. Ed. Porr√∫a 1995 (6.¬™. Ed) Shortly after the birth of Jos√© Mar√≠a, his mother died. His father entrusted his education to a private tutor. When Pino Su√°rez reached adolescence, it was decided that he would carry out his studies in the city of M√©rida (Yucat√°n). There he entered the Colegio de San Ildefonso, a Jesuit school that had a curriculum inspired by that of the French Lyceum. Pino Su√°rez would become fluent in French, English and Spanish. Upon finishing his preparatory studies, he studied Law at Escuela de Jurisprudencia de Yucat√°n, from which he graduated on 12 September 1894.Martha Poblett Miranda, Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez, Semblanza, Instituto Nacional de Estudios de la Revoluci√≥n Mexicana, Ciudad de M√©xico, M√©xico, 1986, After graduating, he devoted himself to the private practice of the law. In 1896, he married Mar√≠a C√°mara Vales (1877‚Äì1970), born into one of the most aristocratic families in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Through the C√°mara family, she could claim direct-line descent from Juan de la C√°mara (1525‚Äì1602), a Spanish conquistador and nobleman. Through the Vales family, she was the niece and goddaughter of Agust√≠n Vales, a wealthy industrialist and politician who made a considerable fortune exporting henequen (used for making ropes) to Europe and the United States.https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/7/3364/19.pdf The marriage had six children: * Mar√≠a Pino C√°mara * Emilio Pino C√°mara * Hortensia Pino C√°mara * Alfredo Pino C√°mara * A√≠da Pino C√°mara * Cordelia Pino C√°mara Recently married, the couple moved to Mexico City, where Pino partnered with his uncle, Joaqu√≠n Casas√∫s, a well-connected lawyer, to form a law firm. In 1899, Pino decided to return to M√©rida, partnering with his father-in-law, Raymundo C√°mara Luj√°n in several business projects. At the turn of the century, he launched El Peninsular, a newspaper that focused on opposing the government and the poor treatment of the indigenous Mayan population by the oligarchy of Spanish descent. In his spare time, he was an accomplished poet, having published two volumes: Melancolias (1896) and Procelarias (1903). He also wrote the prologue to Memorias de un alf√©rez (Memoires of an Ensign), written by his close friend, Eligio Ancona (1904).  Political life  Having avoided public life for most of his life, Pino was drawn into politics after meeting Francisco Madero in Puerto Progreso in 1909. Madero, who had been born in into one of the wealthiest families of industrialists and landowners in the country, had been educated in France and the United States and returned to Mexico with liberal and progressive ideals. In his book, \\"The Presidential Succession in 1910\\" (1908), he argued in favor of a transition from the military dictatorship of Porfirio D√≠az toward a liberal democracy. Madero also proposed an amendment to the Constitution to prohibit the President and Vice- President from seeking re- electionhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/effective-suffrage-no-reelection. Pino soon became a member of the National Anti-Reelectionist Party that was formed, and supported Madero as he campaigned through the Yucat√°n Peninsula and other southern states.  Governor of Yucat√°n  With the support of the National Anti- Reelectionist Party, he was a candidate for the governorship of Yucat√°n in the 1910 election. The election was a contest between Enrique Mu√±oz Ar√≠stegui, the official candidate backed by the government, and Delio Moreno Cant√≥n, a rabid socialist. Through an evident electoral fraud, the triumph was granted to Mu√±oz, who almost immediately initiated a political persecution against the two losing candidates, forcing them to flee from the State. Pino exiled himself in British Honduras before joining Madero in San Antonio, Texas. Madero, meanwhile, had also launched his own bid for the presidency, but had been imprisoned before the election even took place. Escaping prison, he fled to San Antonio, where he was granted asylum by the Taft Administration. Through the years, the Madero family had developed close connections in Washington and Wall Street. Therefore, when Francisco Madero launched the Mexican Revolution in San Antonio, no attempts were made by the U.S. Government to stop himJohn Womack, Jr. \\"The Mexican Revolution\\" in Mexico Since Independence, ed. Leslie Bethell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 131.. When Madero declared the 1910 presidential election to have been fraudulent and assumed the provisional presidency according to the Plan of San Luis Potos√≠, he appointed Pino to his cabinet as Secretary of State for Justice. Under the San Luis Plan, he also called on his countrymen to revolt against the D√≠az Government. Soon, Madero's Revolution managed to temporarily unify various disparate forces around his cause. Pino Su√°rez, standing behind Madero, attends a ceremony to commemorate Benito Ju√°rez, it would be the last public event he would attend before the events of the Ten Tragic Days and his assassination. By May 1911, the revolutionaries had already captured Ciudad Ju√°rez. Under intense domestic and U.S. pressure, General D√≠az agreed to negotiate with Madero, who named Pino one of the principal negotiators representing the revolutionary side. According to the deal struck by the parties, D√≠az would resign and would be allowed to seek exile in Europe. He would be succeeded by Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra, the Foreign Secretary and a career diplomat, as interim president. Le√≥n de la Barra immediately organized fresh elections both at the Federal level, as well as in several States. While such elections were held, he appointed Pino as interim Governor of Yucat√°n. After the State Elections were held in Yucat√°n, Pino won a full four-year term as Governor for the period 1911 and 1915.name=\\"Yucat√°n en el tiempo\\"/> However, as these developments were occurring at the State level, at the Federal level, the National Anti-Reelectionist Party was disbanded and reorganized into the Progressive Constitutionalist Party (PCP). During the first party congress, the PCP decided to select a Madero-Pino ticket to contest the 1911 presidential elections. Vice-President of Mexico Having been elected to the Vice-presidency, Pino resigned as Governor of Yucat√°n, where he was succeeded by Nicol√°s Cam√°ra Vales,Franco Savarino.

Between 1912 and 1913, he was also appointed as Secretary of State for Education and the Fine Arts. The new federal government faced several difficulties. Madero immediately ended all forms of censorship and introduced immediate reforms for democratization and increased political freedom. The new agenda was unpopular with the old oligarchy that had grown wealthy during thirty years of military dictatorship. It was also considered to be insufficiently radical by his former supporters who were more interested in social revolution than liberal reform. During the fifteen months that the Madero administration governed Mexico it faced no fewer than four putsch attempts from both sides of the political spectrum. In February 1913, a putsch lead by army officers loyal to the old regime managed to arrest the Cabinet of Madero after Victoriano Huerta, the Commander-in- Chief of the Army, turned against the government. Huerta had the tacit support of Henry Lane Wilson, the U.S. Ambassador, who was himself acting against the instructions of his government. The outgoing Taft administration had refused to intervene in Mexican politics, until the Wilson Administration was inaugurated in March. Woodrow Wilson closely sympathized with Madero who had similar political ideas to his own, and would later investigate the action of Henry Lane Wilson, having him sackedhttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/48597355.pdf. After arresting the cabinet, Huerta forced Madero and Pino to resign at gunpoint, allowing him to usurp power. Once Huerta was interim president, he ordered the assassination of Madero and Pino on 22 February 1913. Legacy This Statue was erected in 1927 on the site where Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez was assassinated during the events of the Ten Tragic Days. On the plaque of the statue, Pino Su√°rez is praised as the Martyr of Democracy. Pino's widow, Maria C√°mara, fearing persecution from the new military dictatorship, fled Mexico City. Returning initially to her native M√©rida, she later fled through Havana to Europe, where she lived for a time in France and Switzerland, settling in Lausanne with her six children. She would later return to Mexico, where she died in 1970 at the age of 93. In 1969, before her death, she was granted the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor by the Mexican Senate, the highest award Mexico can award to her own citizenshttps://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/7/3364/19.pdf. In 1986, President Miguel de la Madrid ordered the remains of Jos√© Pino to be transferred with full military honors to The Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres (Rotunda of Illustrious Persons), a site that honors those who are considered to have exalted the civic and national values of Mexico. The Pino family was represented by his grandson, Ismael Moreno Pino, then the Ambassador of Mexico in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1915, the Congress of the State of Tabasco ordered that the birthplace of Pino was to be renamed as Tenosique de Pino Su√°rez. In Villahermosa, the state capital of Tabasco, a similar statue was erected. Later, his name was written in golden letters in the assembly hall of the Congress of the State of Tabasco. Throughout the country, several cities have streets named in his honour near the city center. Mexico City is no exception, having named one of the main avenues running out of the Zocalo (where the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation building is located) in his honor. Metro Pino Su√°rez, one of the most important stations of the Mexico City Metro also bears his name. His tomb at the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres.

It is around north-west of Belfast. Originally the site of a 13th-century fortified priory of the Knights of St John, the present building was constructed around 1610 by the Norton family who settled here during the Plantation of Ulster. Soon after, it was bought by the Upton family, later the Viscounts Templetown, who remained in possession until the 20th century. The castle was remodelled in the 1780s to designs by Robert Adam, who also designed the stable block now known as 'Adam Yard'. Upton was purchased in 1963 by Sir Robin Kinahan and Coralie de Burgh, by which time it was in a poor state of repair. Following restoration the Adam Yard was converted to housing, and the castle later opened as a wedding venue. In 2016 the property was placed on the market by Kinahan's son Danny Kinahan MP. The property is now owned by the Hughes family. History It is sometimes stated that Castle Upton contains parts of the earlier priory buildings, but other sources conclude that no part of the building predates the work of the Norton family. Even the existence of a house of the Knights of St John at this site has been questioned, due to lack of evidence. (Including PDF document linked to the record). Sir Robert Norton, an officer under Sir Arthur Chichester, Governor of Carrickfergus, obtained lands along the Six Mile Water, and started work on the castle in the late 16th century, building what is now the east wing. This work was completed by Sir Humphrey Norton in the first part of the 17th century, and like many castles of the Plantation period was surrounded by a bawn wall. The castle was purchased in 1625 by Captain Henry Upton, who had served under the Earl of Essex, and was renamed for his own family. Upton became Member of Parliament for Carrickfergus in 1634, and several of his descendants served as Members for Carrickfergus and for Antrim County. The family supported the protestant William III in the war against the Catholic James II. In 1776, Clotworthy Upton (1721‚Äì1785) was created Baron Templetown after serving in the household of Princess Augusta, dowager Princess of Wales. Lord Templetown commissioned Scottish architect Robert Adam to remodel Castle Upton in a castellated style. Although Adam never visited Ireland his scheme was mostly carried out, including alterations to the roof line and the addition of the north wing. Adam also designed a mausoleum and a stable block, comprising a double courtyard to the north-east of the house. This was completed in 1789, after John Upton had succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Templetown. He sat in the British House of Commons from 1802 to 1812 as one of two representatives for Bury St Edmunds, and in 1806 he was created Viscount Templetown. His successor Henry Montagu Upton, 2nd Viscount Templetown (1799‚Äì1863), commissioned Edward Blore to remodel the house in 1837. During the first half of the 20th century, Castle Upton was sold by the Upton family. The Adam alterations to the roof were removed, and the Adam wing fell into disrepair. In 1963 the semi-ruined house was purchased by Sir Robin Kinahan, a prominent businessman and former Lord Mayor of Belfast, for ¬£53,000. His wife, the artist Coralie de Burgh, guided the restoration of Castle Upton over the succeeding years. Improvements were continued by their son, Danny Kinahan and his wife Anna, who later opened the castle as a wedding venue. In 2016 the Kinahans placed Castle Upton on the market for ¬£1.35m. Architecture One side of the main street in the village of Templepatrick consists of the 18th Century demesne wall of Castle Upton. An impressive fortified gateway in the wall at the centre of the village leads up to the castle. The core of the main house is a tower house, originally thought to be part of a Commanderie of the Knights of Saint John (Hospitallers) with walls up to five feet thick, and the main bulk of the building was created in 1611 by Sir Robert Norton and originally known as Castle Norton. One of the notable achievements of this castle is the reconstruction of the wrecked Adam wing. This wing, now contains a ballroom in which an Italian, marble chimney has been added. The owners of this castle obtained this chimney from Downhill Castle in County Londonderry. The stable block was built from exact architectural copies of the now demolished old Fish Market of Leith, near Edinburgh, Scotland. The Templeton and Upton family mausoleum is in the care of the National Trust and is open to visitors. Many Templetown viscounts and barons are buried there. The mausoleum was built in the form of a triumphal arch by Robert Adam, who also extended the house in 1783. The surrounding graveyard contains the graves of such notables as William Orr (United Irishmens' Rebellion), and Josias Walsh, grandson of John Knox, the Scottish Reformer.

The river's headwaters are in the steep Mendocino Range, but downstream the river flows through gently sloping marine terraces before draining into the Pacific Ocean. The watershed extends east to the small city of Willits and the river's mouth is at Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg, which uses the river for drinking water; it is neighbored on the south by the Big River, on the east by the South Fork Eel River, and on the north by Ten Mile River, named for its distance from the Noyo River. The average annual rainfall is between and . In the language of the Pomo people the Noyo River was called tee'mli-bida or Chemli-bida; the name \\"Noyo\\" referred to a village several miles north, on Pudding Creek, and by extension to the creek itself. European settlers transferred the name from Pudding Creek to the larger river to the south.. The name Pudding Creek is thought to be a corruption of put-in creek - a term used by sailors to identify the uniquely sheltered mouth of the Noyo River. The two names were switched in the 1855 Coast Survey report. The watershed has been logged for timber since the 19th century. Historical logging practices, particularly widespread clear-cutting, caused severe erosion, which led to excessive sediment buildup in the river and its tributaries. In addition, large woody debris that trapped sediment was removed from the streambed to improve flows. Noyo River estuary is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California (1974) State of California In 1998, the river was listed as sediment impaired by the State of California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. The watershed is slowly improving, but it is far from full recovery. Timber production continues to be the primary land use in the watershed. About half of the land is owned by Mendocino Redwood Company and Hawthorne Timber Company, which bought its land from Georgia Pacific in 1999. Jackson Demonstration State Forest, owned by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, makes up about one fifth of the watershed. The rest of the land is split into smaller parcels, such as ranches and private residences. Public land is largely limited to the state forest. Ecology Aside from use for navigation, recreation and municipal and industrial water supply for the city of Fort Bragg, the river provides groundwater recharge and wildlife habitat including cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning.State of California Water Quality Control Plan North Coastal Basin 1B July 1975 p.13 Three anadromous fish species inhabit the Noyo River: steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), which are all listed under the Endangered Species Act. Steelhead and chinook are listed as threatened (2011), and coho listed as endangered (2011). Non-salmonid species in the watershed include the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), and sculpin (Cottus spp.). Birds of special concern include the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) and northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) because of their close association with old- growth and mature redwood forest, which has been heavily impacted by timber harvest since the late 19th century. Eighty-two mammal species are predicted to be found in the Noyo River watershed including several rodents, bats, and squirrels, beaver (Castor canadensis), black bear (Ursus americanus), ring-tailed cat (Bassariscus astutus), American marten (Martes americana), fisher (Martes pennanti), weasels, American badger (Taxidea taxus), western spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), mountain lion (Puma concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), seals and sea lions, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and elk (Cervus elaphus). However, recent surveys have found no fishers or martens. Bridges At least six bridges span the river, including: * Noyo River Bridge at Noyo Cove, carrying the concurrence of State Route 1 and Main Street in Fort Bragg, a prestressed concrete bridge built in 2005 * on the or \\"A&W; Logging Road\\" named after the A&W; drive-in restaurant that used to be located at its intersection with Main Street * on Park Road 320 near Road 300, a wooden bridge built in 1948 * on Park Road 360 north of Road 300, a wooden bridge built in 1958 * on a forest road just west of Jet Road 360, a wooden bridge * on Forest Road 350 south of Road 300, a metal culvert built in 1987 * at Camp Noyo (a Boy Scout Resident Camp operated by the Redwood Empire Council), a wooden suspension bridge spans the river There are at least 20 California Western Railroad crossings of the river visible in aerial photos. The Noyo River Bridge, which opened in 2005, replaced a steel deck truss bridge that was built in 1948. State Route 1 is known as the Shoreline Highway or Pacific Coast Highway but within the Fort Bragg city limits it is concurrent with that town's Main Street and signed as such. Originally proposed in 1998, the bridge was redesigned with railings that allow scenic views to be seen from the bridge after local protest.

Thick fog covered the ground close to an hour before kick off and despite talks to delay or postpone the game, the final went ahead as scheduled. Many fans in the ground and watching on television were unable to see much of the game and also hampered the calling of the game by the commentators. While the fog overshadowed the game itself, the Crusaders completely dominated territory and possession throughout the match. Much of the game was decided on penalties before Casey Laulala dived over late in the second half for the first try of the match and gave the Crusaders a seven point advantage and secured their sixth Super Rugby title.

Steven Gerrard scores the equaliser in the 53rd minute, then defender Paul Konchesky puts West Ham back in the lead ten minutes later, with a cross-come-shot.

He was at the heart of the \\"Ratty\\" for thirty four years. A pupil at the local St. Bees School, on leaving, Ferreira joined the Harrison Shipping Line as a cadet. After some years with the Line, he went to work in Preston and there he was salesman for the Company that made Bond Minicars, (Sharp's Commercials Ltd). It was during his time there that he drove Bond 3 wheel cars from Lands End to John o Groats, over the Semmering Pass through the snow, and became the first person to drive on a British motorway. He was first to set off on the opening of the Preston by-pass which became the first section of the new M6, in a Bond Minicar. When the Ratty was put up for sale by auction in 1960, Doug brought his friend Guy Moser into the short but intensive campaign to secure the future of the line. Moser did all the legal work when it was bought by the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway Preservation Society supported by Colin Gilbert and Sir Wavell Wakefield, who then appointed Ferreira as the new General Manager, because of his experience gained as a volunteer on the newly reopened Festiniog Railway. During Ferreira's era, many changes occurred on the railway including the arrival of new locomotives - River Mite, Northern Rock, Royal Anchor, Shelagh of Eskdale, Lady Wakefield and Bonnie Dundee. Many saloon coaches appeared, and two locomotives based on 'Northern Rock', 'Northern Rock II' and 'Cumbria' were constructed for export to Japan. Ferreira was able to think laterally, and he came up with many pioneering ideas, able to solve problems. Many other railways benefited from his work on the Ratty and his efforts to turn the Minor Railways Association into the heritage railways movement. High among many things was the complete relaying of the R&ER; track, using hardwood sleepers and rail of a uniform heavy weight. In 1975, the Ratty faced a problem - there was need to operate one train in section, as opposed to a time interval system. As conventional train staff and ticket was not practical, Uwe Jens Jansen a friend of Ferreira helped him introduce a new radio control and train order system based on European practice, which Jansen had taken from Hamburg to the Zillertalbahn in Austria. In 1994, Ferreira retired as General Manager, and the following year was awarded an O.B.E. for his services to tourism. In his retirement, he continued with his interest in the Ratty, and also worked as a consultant on railway projects worldwide from the Darjeeling Himalaya to Syria. He died on 24 May 2003 shortly after laying out a Lakeland rally route for the Bond Minicar Club. It is thought that few people have left such an enduring legacy on the Ratty as he did. A new memorial diesel-hydraulic locomotive, built in 2005 and owned by the railway's preservation society was named Douglas Ferreira in his honour. 1929 births 2003 deaths People educated at St. Bees School Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway ","title":"Douglas Ferreira"},{"id":"4967559","title":"Kosovo Albanians"},{"id":"4967561","text":"Martin Brennan may refer to: * Martin Brennan (Irish politician) (1903‚Äì1967), Irish medical practitioner and Fianna F√°il politician, TD from 1938 to 1948 * Martin Brennan (engineer), computer engineer who worked for Sinclair Research and Atari * Martin A.

She was built by Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, launched on 15 September 1915 and completed in November 1915. She was based in Port Said at the beginning of World War I, served in Romania and then the China Station until 1940. All of her fighting service was in the Mediterranean, taking part in the invasion of Pantelleria and landings in the south of France, returning briefly to the Pacific in 1945. She was scrapped at Singapore in 1947. Her class was intended for shallow, fast flowing rivers and they also proved suitable for inshore operations when her relatively heavy weaponry could be used to support Army operations. In February 1942 after a successful Warship Week National Savings campaign, Aphis was adopted by the civil communities of Warminster and Westbury in Wiltshire. Service During 1917 Aphis was operated on the Danube, in support of military operations, based at Bucharest. She remained there until 1919. In 1927 she transferred to the China Squadron for service in the Yangtze Flotilla to support British shipping and nationals in China. The situation in China remained volatile and Aphis remained with the Yangtze Flotilla until June 1940 when she was redeployed to the Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria. For the next three years, Aphis provided artillery support for the Army. For example, in early December 1940, she bombarded Italian positions at Tobruk in company with her sister ships and and the monitor , and later that month, she bombarded harbour installations at Tobruk (three merchant ships were sunk). This continued into February 1941, when she was joined by three Australian destroyers (, and ). Army support operations continued into April when Aphis bombarded enemy positions at Bomba and Gazala during the 8th Army's withdrawal. Aphis remained based at Alexandria until Malta became available for use as a naval base in March 1943. Based at Malta, nearer to the landings on the Italian islands and mainland Europe, she provided artillery support for the attack on Pantelleria in June (deployed with headquarters ship and destroyers and . Her planned deployment in support of the Sicily landings was cancelled in view of the class' vulnerability to air attack. Instead, after a period at Malta, Aphis supported British landings in Calabria in early September. She was deployed with her sister and monitors , and , to bombard enemy positions on the coast between Reggio Calabria and Pessaro before the Operation Baytown landings by the British XIII Corps. After another period at Malta, she participated in the support of the landings in the south of France, this time operating under United States command under Lt Commander Douglas Fairbanks Jr. She joined the Western Task Force, in June 1944, attached to the Special Operations Group at Ajaccio. The group was to mis-direct German resources by simulating large Allied landings and in mid-August they carried out bombardments between Antibes and the Var river. The operation was a complete success. A second diversionary operation took place off La Ciotat; Aphis and Scarab and the US destroyer bombarded the area. During the action, the allied ships were engaged by two German warships, the corvette UJ6082 and armed yacht UJ6083. Both German ships were sunk. In mid-August 1944, Aphis resumed duty with the Mediterranean Fleet and in September she was deployed in the Adriatic to support of Army operations, based at Ancona. She returned to Malta in January 1945. In July 1945, she left the Mediterranean to join the British Pacific Fleet at their forward base at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. By the time she arrived, Japan had surrendered and she did not join the fleet until after VJ Day. Subsequently, she was paid-off on arrival at Singapore and placed on the disposal list in 1946. She was sold for scrapping in May.

This is associated with the first European production of cast iron in furnaces such as Lapphyttan in Sweden.N. Bj√∂rkenstam, \\"The Blast Furnace in Europe during the Medieval Times: part of a new system for producing wrought iron\\" in G. Magnusson (ed.), The importance of Ironmaking: Technical Innovation and Social Change, 143‚Äì53: papers presented at the Norberg conference 1995 I, Jernkontoret, Stockholm 1995. Osmonds appear in some of the earliest English Customs accounts, for example in 1325.N. S. B. Gras, The early English Customs System, 379. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1918. The kappe a Swedish iron weight used for osmond occurs in a commercial treaty in Novgorod in 1203, and this implies the production of osmond iron.Bj√∂rkenstam, 150. Osmond iron was made by melting pig iron in a hearth that is narrower and deeper than a typical finery in an English finery forge. The hearth had a charcoal fire blown with bellows through a tuyere. As the iron melted, the drops fell through the blast and congealed. They were then lifted with an iron bar into the blast. As they melted they were caught on the end of a large staff, held in the fire and turned rapidly so that the drops spread out, forming a ball.H. R. Schubert, History of the British iron and steel industry ... to 1775, 300‚Äì1. Routledge, London 1957. Osmonds reached England during the later Middle Ages through the port of Gda≈Ñsk. However, there were hammer mills in its hinterland and that of L√ºbeck, which made the osmonds into bar iron. In the 1620s, Gustav II Adolf of Sweden prohibited his subjects from exporting unfinished iron, and all trade in osmonds ceased.S-E √Östr√∂m, \\"From Cloth to Iron: the Anglo-Baltic trade in the late seventeenth century: I The growth, structure, and organisation of the trade\\", 33. Societas Scientarum Fennica: Commentationes Humanarum Littarum 33(1), Helsingfors 1963. The osmond process was also used in the county of Mark in Westphalia, in southern Germany and Switzerland.M. Kempa and √ú. Yal√ßin, \\"Medieval Iron Smelting in southern Germany: early evidence of pig iron\\" in G. Magnusson, The importance of Ironmaking I, 154‚Äì65; and other papers in the same volume. The process was introduced to Wales in connection with the establishment by William Humfrey and others of wireworks at Tintern in 1566, an enterprise that was shortly afterwards taken over by the Company of Mineral and Battery Works.M. B. Donald, Elizabethan Monopolies: the history of the Company of Mineral and Battery Works 1568-1604. Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh 1961. Humfrey arranged to bring an expert maker of Osmond iron, Corslett Tinkhaus, from southwest Westphalia, where the production had reached a high level of technical proficiency. Tinkhaus arrived in Wales in 1567 and began working at Rhydygwern in the Glamorgan part of the lordship of Machen. This was where the first Machen Forge was, and he was evidently making osmond iron there. The iron was apparently forged with a tilt hammer, rather than the helve hammer, usual in finery forges. This was the raw material for the wireworks at Tintern. Osmond iron was made at Pontypool in the 18th century to supply wireworks there, and one of the forges there was still called the 'Osborn Forge' in the 19th century.Schubert, 297‚Äì302.

It initially took the format of an hour-long programme combining magazine and narrative elements, but was subsequently reformed into a series of 20-minute, all-narrative programmes. Original format The Mysti Show was broadcast on Saturday mornings on BBC One or BBC Two at 10am, with subsequent repeat broadcasts on the CBBC Channel. The hour-long shows were a mix of drama and entertainment, featuring 40 minutes of magazine and feature content wrapped around two 10-minute segments of narrative drama. The feature content included a gameshow element, titled The Battle of Elbubb. The characters within the narrative segments included Mysti (Laura Aikman) who is half-human and half- fairy, and her friends Rick (Oliver Mason), Ella (Eva Alexander), Ollie (Ashley Campbell) and Abby (Yasmin Paige). Other characters also appeared frequently, such as Professor Dust (David Sterne) and Tatiana (Tricia George), fairies Snowdrop (Amy Pemberton) and Peaceblossom (Danielle Tabor), and diner owner Mr. K (Richard James). Mysti, Rick, Ella and Ollie would also appear, in character, as the presenters of the magazine segments of the show. Professor Dust hosted The Battle of Elbubb. Many well known faces appeared as guests on the show, including Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan, Kirsten Dunst, McFly and Jamelia. The hour-long episodes were repeated on CBBC Channel for a time; following the broadcast of the second series (see below), the first-series episodes were reedited into a similar format, 20-minute narrative drama episodes; the magazine content from the hour-long episodes has not been rebroadcast since the re-edit. Second series In series two, the show was renamed to just Mysti, ditching the entertainment section and running just as a 20-minute drama. In the story, the characters have grown up and are in the 6th form. Mysti is banished from the heath, and her previous fairy magic is taken away; however, she gets new powers that the Fairies have not seen before. Ollie is not featured in the second series, and the only Fairies are Dust, Saber, Tatiana and Peri. The other Fairies from series one are not seen. Mysti As a fairy, Mysti will live to be hundreds of years old, and an inch long. When she takes human form she is a teenager. She likes fashion, magic, interviewing pop stars, rap, dancing, handsome human and fairy boys; and dislikes bullies, fairy choir, being on litter duty, people who tells lies and tidying her mushroom. She is occasionally mischievous, and has an ambition to succeed her mother as Queen of the Fairies.

Usually an ALMO is set up by the authority to manage and improve all or part of its housing stock. Ownership of the housing stock itself normally stays with the local authority. , seventy ALMOs were managing over half of all UK council housing, consisting of more than a million properties.National Federation of ALMOs: ALMO Factsheet This number has since reduced as local authorities have taken services back in-house or stock has been transferred, of 2016 there are 37 ALMOs who manage nearly a third of local authority housing, approximately half a million council and ALMO homes.http://www.almos.org.uk/almos Ownership ALMOs are owned by local authorities and operate under the terms of a management agreement between the authority and the organisation. An ALMO is managed by an (often unpaid) board of directors which includes tenants, local authority nominees, and independent members. At least a third of an ALMO board is normally made up of tenants. The work of an ALMO may touch and overlap with that of a tenant management organisation (TMO). Purpose Establishment of an ALMO separates the day to day housing management role of the landlord from the wider strategic housing role of the local authority. However, the local authority normally retains ownership of the housing and tenants remain secure tenants of the local authority. Ministers do not give consent to the establishment of a new ALMO without clear evidence that the council has consulted its tenants and leaseholders and can demonstrate a balance of support from them for the ALMO proposal. Unlike a stock transfer to a housing association, councils can transfer management of their housing to an ALMO without holding a ballot, although many councils undertake a ballot in any case. Through the ALMO Programme, Communities and Local Government (CLG) offer additional resources towards the cost of achieving the Decent Homes Standard to councils which set up ALMOs that were assessed as 2* (good) or 3* (excellent) on inspection by the Housing Inspectorate (which was part of the Audit Commission). A number of ALMOs are considering whether to proceed with the construction of new housing which would be owned and managed by the ALMO. The ability of ALMOs to undertake new build projects is considered by the Government to be a way for ALMOs to develop and be financially viable post 2010, i.e. after the Decent Homes target date. Criticisms Since ALMOs are non-profit organisations which can receive extra funding from the government, dependent on performance, it can be argued that cost cuts are inevitable. Some say that as a result, the conditions and pay for their staff (except the management) is much lower than in the private sector, leading to a high level of staff turnover. However, the only inevitable additional cost of an ALMO is for its governance arrangements, which are typically less than 1% of management costs. Critics of the ALMO system, such as Defend Council Housing (DCH), have characterised ALMOs as a stepping stone to stock transfer, in areas where this would have previously been politically unacceptable.Arguments against going ALMO , DCH Level of success The National Federation of ALMOs stated that as at March 2008, 77% of tenants reported satisfaction with ALMO housing management. They also stated that 90% of ALMOs which have been inspected achieved a 2 or 3 star rating, therefore being eligible for extra funding. They also report significant efficiency savings and an enhanced timetable for reaching the Decent Homes Standard for much of the country's housing stock.Key Facts about ALMOs In 2009 the government diverted money from ALMOs to building new homes. Councils that had promoted ALMOs in order to access the extra funding, and the tenants who had got involved, felt betrayed at the decision.Decent homes target 'impossible', BBC, 4 October 2009 Tax status An ALMO cannot benefit from the same tax exemptions as a local authority. As a result, after discussions with KPMG, HM Revenue & Customs have published guidance which states that provided certain conditions are met they will view activities between the ALMO and the local authority as a non-trading activity and so any profit arising will not be taxable.BIM58210, HMRC List of ALMOs A list of ALMOs can be found on the website for the National Federation of ALMOs, together with copies of inspection reports and the number of stars achieved upon inspection.

The \\"sea eagle\\" name is to be preferred, to distinguish the species of Haliaeetus from the closely related Ichthyophaga true fish eagles. The species was described in 1935 by Ernst Mayr who noticed that earlier observers had overlooked it, thinking it was a juvenile of the white-bellied sea eagle.  Description  The Sanford's sea eagle was discovered by and named after Dr Leonard C. Sanford, a trustee for the American Museum of Natural History. The first description was by Ernst Mayr in 1935. It can reach a length between and a weight between . The wingspan is between . It is the only large predator on the Solomon Islands. The eagles inhabit coastal forests and lakes up to an altitude of about 1500 m asl. The plumage is whitish brown to bright brown on the head and the neck. The underparts are brown to reddish brown and dark brown. The upperparts are darkish brown to gray-black. The eyes are bright brown. Uniquely among sea eagles, this species has an entirely dark tail throughout its life. The breeding season is from August to October. The nest consists of two eggs. The diet consists of mainly of tideline carrion, fish, molluscs, crabs, tortoises, and sea snakes, and more rarely birds and megabats snatched from the rainforest canopy.Mikula, P., Morelli, F., Luƒçan, R. K., Jones, D. N., & Tryjanowski, P. (2016). Bats as prey of diurnal birds: a global perspective. Mammal Review. It has also been reported to feed opportunistically on the northern common cuscus. It forms a superspecies with the white-bellied sea eagle. As in other sea eagle species pairs, the other taxon is white-headed. These two are genetically very close, it seems; their lineages separated not longer ago than 1 mya, probably only in the Middle Pleistocene, a few 100,000 years ago. Both share a dark bill, talons, and eyes with the other Gondwanan sea eagles. This eagle is often illustrated on postage stamps of the Solomon Islands.

Makhnovia was established with the capture of Huliaipole by Makhno's forces on 27 November 1918. An Insurrectionary Staff was set up in the city, which became the territory's de facto capital.Malet, Michael, Nestor Makhno in the Russian Civil War. The Macmillan Press, 1982, p. 19 Russian forces of the White movement under Anton Denikin occupied part of the region and formed a temporary government of Southern Russia in March 1920, resulting in the de facto capital being momentarily moved to Katerynoslav (modern-day Dnipro). In late March 1920, Denikin's forces retreated from the area, being driven out by the Red Army in cooperation with Makhno's forces, whose units conducted guerrilla warfare behind Denikin's lines. Makhnovia was disestablished on 28 August 1921 when a badly-wounded Makhno and 77 of his men escaped through Romania after several high-ranking officials were executed by Bolshevik forces. Remnants of the Black Army would continue to fight until late 1922. As Makhnovia self-organized along anarchist principles, references to \\"control\\" and \\"government\\" are highly contentious. For example, the Makhnovists, often cited as a form of government (with Nestor Makhno as their \\"leader\\"), played a purely military role, with Makhno himself functioning as little more than a military strategist and advisor.Skirda, Alexandre, Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack. AK Press, 2004, p. 34  History  =The emergence of the Makhnovist movement and Makhnovia= Black Army combat group, headed by Fedir Shchus (center) Following his liberation from prison during the February Revolution, Nestor Makhno returned to his hometown of Huliaipole and organized a peasants' union. It gave him a \\"Robin Hood\\" image and he expropriated large estates from landowners and distributed the land among the peasants. Makhno joined an anarchist group called the Black Guards (headed by sailor-deserter Fedir Shchus) and eventually became its commander. In March 1918 the new Bolshevik government in Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk concluding peace with the Central Powers, but ceding large amounts of territory, including Ukraine. As the Central Rada of the new Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) proved unable to maintain order, a coup by Pavlo Skoropadsky in April 1918 resulted in the establishment of the Hetmanate. Already dissatisfied by the UNR's failure to resolve the question of land ownership, much of the peasantry refused to support a conservative government administered by former imperial officials and supported by the Austro-Hungarian and German occupiers. The Hetman lost the support of the Central Powers (Germany and Austro-Hungary, which had armed his forces and installed him in power) after the collapse of the German western front. Unpopular among most southern Ukrainians, he saw his best forces evaporate, and was driven out of Kyiv by the Directorate of Ukraine.Magocsi 1996, p. 499. Peasant bands under various self-appointed otamany which had once been counted on the rolls of the UNR's army now attacked the Germans.Magocsi 1996, pp. 498‚Äì99; Subtelny 1988, p. 360. These warlords finally came to dominate the countryside; some defected to the Directory or the Bolsheviks, but the largest portion would follow either Socialist Revolutionary Matviy Hryhoriyiv or the anarchist flag of Makhno. At this point, the emphasis on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted in the previous year shifted to political concerns. The first Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups, under the name of Nabat (\\"the Alarm Bell Toll\\"), issued five main principles: rejection of all political parties, rejection of all forms of dictatorships, negation of any concept of a central state, rejection of a so-called \\"transitional period\\" necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, and self-management of all workers through free local workers' councils (soviets). After recruiting large numbers of Ukrainian peasants, as well as numbers of Jews, anarchists, naletchki, and recruits arriving from other countries, Makhno formed the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, otherwise known as the Anarchist Black Army. At its formation, the Black Army consisted of about 15,000 armed troops, including infantry and cavalry (both regular and irregular) brigades; artillery detachments were incorporated into each regiment. The RIAU battled against the White Army, Ukrainian nationalists, and various independent paramilitary formations that conducted anti-semitic pogroms. The November Revolution of 1918 led to Germany's defeat in the First World War. By this time, Makhno was leading a rebel movement of 6,000 people against the German Empire in the Yekaterinoslav province,Komin V.V. Nestor Makhno. Myths and reality. Chapter \\"The birth of the father.\\" M., 1990 while the German troops themselves were demoralized and did not want to fight, leading them to withdraw swiftly. On November 27, Makhno occupied Huliaipole, declared it in a state of siege, and formed the ‚ÄúHuliaipole Revolutionary Headquarters‚Äù. The rebels by this time represented considerable strength, controlling most of the territory of the Yekaterinoslav province. According to Makhno: \\"The agricultural majority of these villages was composed of peasants, one would understand at the same time both peasants and workers. They were founded first of all on equality and solidarity of its members. Everyone, men and women, worked together with a perfect conscience that they should work on fields or that they should be used in housework... The work program was established in meetings in which everyone participated. Then they knew exactly what they had to do\\". (Makhno, Russian Revolution in Ukraine, 1936). Society was reorganized according to anarchist values, which led Makhnovists to formalize the policy of free communities as the highest form of social justice. Education followed the principles of Francesc Ferrer, and the economy was based on free exchange between rural and urban communities, from crops and cattle to manufactured products, according to the theories of Peter Kropotkin. The Makhnovists said they supported \\"free worker-peasant soviets\\"Declaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist).

Makhno called the Bolsheviks \\"dictators\\" and opposed the \\"Cheka (secret police)... and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions\\". He called for \\"freedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like\\". The Makhnovists called various congresses of soviets, in which all political parties and groups - including Bolsheviks - were permitted to participate, to the extent that members of these parties were elected delegates from worker, peasant or militia councils. By contrast, in Bolshevik territory after June 1918, no non-Bolsheviks were permitted to participate in any national soviets and most local ones,Simon Pirani, The Russian Revolution in Retreat, 1920‚Äì24: Soviet Workers and the New Communist Elite, Routledge, 2008, p. 96. the decisions of which were also all subject to Bolshevik party veto. A declaration stated that Makhnovist revolutionaries were forbidden to participate in the Cheka, and all party-run militias and party police forces (including Cheka-like secret police organizations) were to be outlawed in Makhnovist territory.Nestor Makhno--anarchy's CossackDeclaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist).

Civil War In Russia Frederick A.Praeger 1961, page 287 Meanwhile, the Petliurites, who formed their army from many conscripted rebel groups and seized power in a number of Ukrainian cities, considered the Makhnovist movement as an integral part of the all-Ukrainian national revolution and hoped to draw it into the sphere of their influence and leadership. However, when he received a proposal from the Directorate of Ukraine about joint actions against the Red Army, Makhno answered: \\"Petlyurovschina is a gamble that distracts the attention of the masses from the revolution.\\" According to Makhno and his comrades-in-arms, Petliurism was a movement of the Ukrainian national bourgeoisie, with which the people's revolutionary movement was completely out of step.The Fall of the Hetman. Petliurism. Bolshevism.. Peter Arshinov, History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921), 1923. Black & Red, 1974 On December 26, Makhno's detachments together with the armed detachments of the Yekaterinoslav Provincial Committee of the Bolshevik Party kicked the Petliurists out of Yekaterinoslav. However, taking advantage of the carelessness of the rebel command, the Petliurites returned, and after two or three days expelled the Makhnovists from the city. The Makhnovists retreated to the Synelnykove district. From that moment on the northwestern border of the territory controlled by Makhno, a front arose between the Makhnovists and Petliurists. However, due to the fact that Petliura's troops, consisting mostly of conscripted rebel peasants, began to quickly decompose on contact with the Makhnovists, the front was soon liquidated. After the Yekaterinoslav operation, the Makhnovists settled in Huliaipole, where Makhno planned to begin practical implementation of the anarchist ideal - the creation of a free, stateless communist society in the Huliaipole district. However, the position of the rebels was not yet secure: the Petliurites continued to exert pressure on Makhno, trying to lure him to their side, General Denikin was approaching from the south, from the north the Ukrainian Soviet army was approaching Makhnovist territory. Therefore, Makhno tried to bide time, strengthen his own force at the expense of potential allies and find a more profitable line of behavior.Komin V.V. Nestor Makhno. Myths and reality. Chapter ‚ÄúWalk the Field‚Äù. - M., 1990. On January 12, the White Army launched an attack on the Makhnovist district from Donbass. They took it on January 20, and attacked Huliaipole on January 21‚Äì22. In this situation, Makhno finally decided to make an alliance with the Reds, declaring the Petliurites and Denikinists as the most dangerous opponents. The agreement with the Red Army was considered by the Makhno as exclusively military, not affecting the social structure of the Makhnovist district. As part of the Ukrainian Front, Makhno's brigade participated in battles with the White Guards in Donbass and in the Sea of Azov. As a result of the Black Army's advance, the territory controlled by them increased to 72 volosts of the Yekaterinoslav province with a population of more than two million people. Makhno was just as rebellious towards the Red Command as he was to the White, constantly emphasizing independence. The Makhnovists set up detachments on the railroad and intercepted wagons with flour, bread, other food products, coal, and straw. Moreover, they themselves refused to sell bread from the surplus stock available in Berdyansk and Melitopol counties, instead demanding industrial goods in direct exchange for it. =Governing Bodies and Attitude to Government= Nestor Makhno and his Lieutenants To resolve issues relating to the territory as a whole, regional congresses of peasants, workers and rebels were convened. In total, during the period of the free existence of Makhnovia three such congresses were held. At the first district congress, held on January 23, 1919 in the village of Mikhailovka, the main attention of the participants was drawn to the danger of Petliurism and Denikinism. To combat Petliurism, the congress decided to launch propaganda work in areas controlled by the Directory in order to explain the essence of its policy to the population, to call for disobedience and boycott of the announced mobilization and for the continuation of the uprising in order to overthrow this power. The second district congress of peasants, workers and insurgents, which was attended by 245 delegates from 350 volosts and partisan detachments, gathered on February 12 in the village. Walk the Field. The congress comprehensively discussed the question of the danger looming from Denikin. It was decided to immediately take measures to strengthen self-defense. The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, according to Peter Arshinov, had about 20 thousand volunteer fighters in their ranks by this time, many of whom, however, were \\"extremely overworked and frayed\\", participating in continuous battles of five to six months. In view of this, a decision was made to organize voluntary mobilization. Despite the large number of people who wanted to join Makhno, there were not enough weapons in the area to form new rebel units in time. The congress adopted a resolution expressing an anarchist negative attitude towards all state power, including the Soviet one: > ‚ÄúThe Soviet government of Russia and Ukraine by its orders and decrees seeks > at all costs to take away the freedom and independence of local Soviets of > workers and peasants' deputies. Unelected committees, appointed by the > government, oversee every step of the local Soviets and mercilessly crack > down on those comrades from peasants and workers councils who defend their > popular freedom against the representatives of the central government. The > government of Russia and Ukraine, which calls itself a government of workers > and peasants, blindly follows the party of the Bolshevik Communists, who, in > the narrow interests of their party, are conducting the vile irreconcilable > persecution of other revolutionary organizations. Hiding behind the slogan > of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\", the Bolshevik Communists declared > a monopoly on revolution for their party, considering all dissenters to be > counter-revolutionaries... We urge our worker and peasant comrades not to > entrust the liberation of the workers to any party or central authority: the > liberation of the workers is the work of the working people > themselves...\\"Shubin A.V. The Makhnovist movement: the tragedy of the 19th// > Community, 1989, No. 34. For the general management of the struggle against the Petliurites and Denikinists, the implementation of congress decisions, as well as the organization of communication and propaganda work with the population, at the second congress, the Regional Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) of peasants, workers and rebels was formed. It included representatives of 32 volosts of Yekaterinoslav and Tauride provinces, as well as representatives of the rebel units. The MRC was in charge of all matters of a socio-political and military nature and represented the highest executive body of the Makhnovist movement. The main issues addressed by the Military Revolutionary Council were the military, food, and local self-government. The solution to the issue of providing food to the entire population of the region was postponed until the fourth district congress, scheduled for June 15, 1919, which was prohibited by the Soviet government. The local peasantry took over the maintenance of the black army. In Huliaipole, the central army supply department organized the delivery of food and ammo to the front line. On April 19, the Makhnovist headquarters, defying the Red Command's prohibition, convened the Third Huliaipole District Congress, which was attended by representatives of 72 volosts of the Aleksandrovsky, Mariupol, Berdyansk and Pavlograd districts of the Ekaterinoslav and Tauride provinces, as well as delegates from the Makhnovist military units. The congress proclaimed an anarchist platform, demanding ‚Äúthe immediate removal of all people appointed to military and civilian posts, the beginning of free and fair elections to these posts, the socialization of land and factories, the replacement of the policy of food requisitioning with a proper exchange system between city and country, full freedom of speech, press and assembly to all political leftist movements, inviolability of the workers of the left revolutionary organizations and the working people in general... We categorically do not recognize the dictatorship of any party‚Äù. The so-called Free Labor Councils of Peasants and Workers, fulfilling the will of local workers and their organizations, established the necessary connections among themselves, forming the highest bodies of public, social and economic self-government of the Makhnovist movement. The organization of such councils was never carried out in connection with the military situation. The general principles of the Free Council of Peasants and Workers were printed for the first time in 1920. =Anarchism and the ideas of social reorganization= Peter Kropotkin, the anarcho-communist theorist who lay the groundwork for the organization of Makhnovia Makhno, who called himself \\"an anarcho-communist of the Bakunin- Kropotkin school\\", addressing like-minded people in an early July 1918 letter, urged them: > ‚ÄúTogether we will destroy the slave system in order to bring ourselves and > our comrades onto the path of the new system.

At the beginning of 1919, the influence of anarchism on the rebel army of Makhno continued to grow due to the constant influx of ideological supporters of anarchy. These people enjoyed special privileges with Makhno, held leading positions in the rebel movement, contributed to the development of the Bat'ko‚Äôs views and behavior, and exalted him as a ‚Äúpeople's leader‚Äù, ‚Äúa great anarchist‚Äù, and ‚Äúsecond Bakunin‚Äù. Anarchist ideas predetermined the development of Makhnovism, which inevitably led it to conflict with Soviet power. In February - March 1919, Makhno invited the anarchist Pyotr Arshinov, with whom he served prison time in the same cell of the Butyrka prison, to join the Ukrainian rebellion and organize an anarchist newspaper for the rebels and workers and peasants. Arshinov arrived in April in Huliaipole, was elected chairman of the cultural and educational department of the Military Revolutionary Council, and editor of the newspaper ‚ÄúThe Way to Freedom‚Äù; since the spring of 1919 he became one of the main ideologists of the Makhnovist movement. =Conflict with the Soviet command= Red Army commander Pavel Dybenko and Nestor Makhno, 1919 Bolshevik hostility to Makhno and his anarchist army increased after Red Army defections. While the Soviet authorities chose not to pay attention to the frankly anti-Bolshevik nature of the resolutions of the February regional congress of Soviets, when the front stabilized in April, the authorities headed for the liquidation of Makhnovia's special status. In the Soviet press, the Makhnovist movement began to qualify as kulak, its slogans as counter- revolutionary, and its actions as harmful to the revolution. Arshinov in his memoirs accused the Soviet authorities of organizing a blockade of the district, during which all \\"revolutionary workers\\" were detained. Supply of the Black Army with shells and ammunition, according to him, decreased by 5-6 times. The Bolshevik press was not only silent on the subject of Moscow's continued refusal to send arms to the Black Army, but also failed to credit the Ukrainian anarchists' continued willingness to ship food supplies to the hungry urban residents of Bolshevik-held cities. After April 19 the executive committee of the Military Revolutionary Council of the Huliaipole region convened the 3rd district congress, which proclaimed the anarchist platform and declared categorically non-recognition of the dictatorship of any party, the division commander Pavel Dybenko announced: ‚ÄúAny congresses convened on behalf of the military revolutionary headquarters, which was dismissed in accordance with my order, are considered clearly counter-revolutionary, and the organizers of these will be subjected to the most repressive measures, up to and including their outlawing‚Äù. The commander of the Ukrainian Front Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, who personally arrived in Huliaipole on April 29, attempted to settle the conflict. During the negotiations, Makhno made concessions - he condemned the harshest provisions of the congresses' resolution and promised to impede the election of the command staff. At the same time, Makhno put forward a fundamentally new idea of the long-term coexistence of various political movements within the same power system: \\"Before a decisive victory over the whites, a revolutionary front must be established, and he (Makhno) seeks to prevent strife between various elements of this revolutionary front.\\" This idea, however, was not accepted by the Soviet leadership, and Lev Kamenev, the representative of the Republic's Defense Council, again demanded the liquidation of the political organs of the movement and, above all, the Military Revolutionary Council. A new reason for mutual distrust arose in connection with the rebellion of Ataman Grigoriev in Right-Bank Ukraine. On May 12 Kamenev sent a telegram to Makhno, kept in a clearly incredulous tone: ‚ÄúThe traitor Grigoriev betrayed the front. Not executing a combat order, he holstered his weapon. The decisive moment has come - either you will go with the workers and peasants throughout Russia, or open the front to the enemies. Oscillations have no place. Immediately inform me of the location of your troops and issue an appeal against Grigoryev. I will consider non-receipt of an answer as a declaration of war. I believe in honor of the revolutionaries - yours, Arshinov, Veretelnikov and others.\\" The Bat'ko gave a rather ambiguous answer: \\"The honor and dignity of the revolutionary force us to remain faithful to the revolution and the people, and Grigoryev‚Äôs feuds with the Bolsheviks over regional power cannot force us to leave the front.\\" After the scouts sent by Makhno to the area of Gregoriev's rebellion were intercepted by the authorities, the Makhnovists' final determination of their attitude towards Grigoryev dragged on until the end of May. In his appeal, ‚ÄúWho is Grigoryev?‚Äù Makhno questioned the rebels: ‚ÄúBrothers! Don't you hear in his words a grim call to the Jewish pogrom?! Don't you feel the desire of Ataman Grigoriev to break the living fraternal connection between the revolution of Ukraine and revolutionary Russia?‚Äù At the same time, Makhno blamed the events on the actions of the Bolshevik authorities:‚Äú We must say that the reasons that created the entire Grigoriev movement are not in Grigoriev himself... Anything that showed resistance, protest, and even independence were stifled by special committees... This created the climate of bitterness, protest, and a hostile mood towards the existing order. Grigoriev took advantage of this in his adventure... We demand that the Communist Party be held accountable for the Grigoriev movement ‚Äù. Panteleimon Belochub a soldier best known as one of the commanders of the Black Army Grigoriev openly disagreed with Makhno during negotiations at Sentovo on July 27, 1919. Grigoriev had been in contact with Denikin's emissaries, and was planning to join the White coalition. According to Peter Arshinov, Makhno and staff decided to execute Grigoriev. Chubenko, a member of Makhno's staff, accused Grigoriev of collaborating with Denikin and of inciting the pogroms.Alexandre Skirda, Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack, p 125. The accounts of Gregoriev's execution differ, and ascribe the final shot either to Chubenko, Karetnik, Kouzmenko or Makhno.Nestor Makhno, \\"The Makhnovshchina and Anti-Semitism,\\" Dyelo Truda, No.30-31, November-December 1927, pp.15-18Peter Arshinov \\"History of the Makhnovist Movement 1918-1921\\" Ch. 7 The Bolshevik government in Petrograd increasingly saw the Makhnovists as a threat to their power, both as an example and as a site of anarchist influence.Skirda, Alexandre, Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack. AK Press, 2004, p. 236 The Bolsheviks began their formal efforts to disempower Makhno on 4 June 1919 with Trotsky's Order No. 1824, which forbade electing a congress and attempted to discredit Makhno by stating: \\"The Makhno brigade has constantly retreated before the White Guards, owing to the incapacity, criminal tendencies, and the treachery of its leaders.\\"Daniel Cohn-Bendit and Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, The Makhno Movement and Opposition Within the Party The Bolsheviks restarted a propaganda campaign declaring Makhnovia to be a region of warlords, and eventually broke with it by launching surprise attacks on Makhnovist militiasSkirda, Alexandre, Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack. AK Press, 2004, p. 238 despite the pre-existing alliance between the factions.Skirda, Alexandre, Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack. AK Press, 2004, p. 237 The Bolshevik press alleged that leaders in the Makhnovist movement, rather than being democratically-elected, were appointed by Makhno's military clique. They also alleged that Makhno himself had refused to provide food for Soviet railwaymen and telegraph operators, that the \\"special section\\" of the Makhnovist constitution provided for secret executions and torture, that Makhno's forces had raided Red Army convoys for supplies, stolen an armored car from Bryansk when asked to repair it, and that the Nabat group was responsible for deadly acts of terrorism in Russian cities. Vladimir Lenin soon sent Lev Kamenev to Ukraine where he conducted a cordial interview with Makhno. After Kamenev's departure, Makhno claimed to have intercepted two Bolshevik messages, the first an order to the Red Army to attack the Makhnovists, the second ordering Makhno's assassination. Soon after the Fourth Congress, Trotsky sent an order to arrest every Nabat congress member. Pursued by White Army forces, Makhno and the Black Army responded by withdrawing further into the interior of Ukraine. In 1919, the Black Army suddenly turned eastwards in a full-scale offensive, surprising General Denikin's White forces and causing them to fall back. Within two weeks, Makhno and the Black Army had recaptured all of the southern Ukraine. Black Army commanders Simon Karetnik (3rd from the left), Nestor Makhno (center) and Fedor Shchus (1st right), 1919 When Makhno's troops were struck by a typhus epidemic, Trotsky resumed hostilities; the Cheka sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920, but they were captured and, after confessing, were executed. All through February 1920 Makhnovia was inundated with 20,000 Red troops.V. N. Litvinov, An Unsolved Mystery ‚Äì The \\"Diary of Makhno's Wife\\". Viktor Belash noted that even in the worst time for the revolutionary army, namely at the beginning of 1920, \\"In the majority of cases rank-and-file Red Army soldiers were set free, in all four directions\\". This is what happened at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in Huliaipole.A. Buysky, \\"The Red Army on the Internal Front\\", Gosizdat (1927), p. 52. The problem was further compounded by the alienation of the Estonians by Anton Denikin's inflexible Russian chauvinism and their refusal to fight with Nikolai Yudenich.Why did the Bolsheviks win the Russian Civil War? Peter Anderson compares the tactics and resources of the two sides. There was a new truce between Makhnovist forces and the Red Army in October 1920 in the face of a new advance by Wrangel's White army. While Makhno and the anarchists were willing to assist in ejecting Wrangel and White Army troops from southern Ukraine and Crimea, they distrusted the Bolshevist government in Moscow and its motives. However, after the Bolshevik government agreed to a pardon of all anarchist prisoners throughout Russia, a formal treaty of alliance was signed. By late 1920, Makhno had halted General Wrangel's White Army advance into Ukraine from the southwest, capturing 4,000 prisoners and stores of munitions, and preventing the White Army from gaining control of the all-important Ukrainian grain harvest. To the end, Makhno and the anarchists maintained their main political structures, refusing demands to join the Red Army, to hold Bolshevik-supervised elections, or accept Bolshevik-appointed political commissars.NESTOR MAKHNO Ukrainian anarchist general, fought both Reds & Whites (tyranny left to right). The Red Army temporarily accepted these conditions, but within a few days ceased to provide the Makhnovists with basic supplies, such as cereals and coal. When General Wrangel's White Army forces were decisively defeated in November 1920, the Bolsheviks immediately turned on Makhno and the anarchists once again. On November 26, 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Makhno escaped, but was soon forced into retreat as the full weight of the Red Army and the Cheka's Special Punitive Brigades was brought to bear against not only the Makhnovists, but all anarchists, even their admirers and sympathizers.Voline, The Unknown Revolution, pp. 693‚Äì97: Anyone in Ukraine who professed anarchist sympathies was marked for retribution. Voline recounts the example of M. Bogush, a Russian-born anarchist who had emigrated to America. He returned to Russia in 1921 after being expelled from the United States. Having heard a great deal about Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists, he left Kharkiv to see Makhno's birthplace at Huliaipole. After only a few hours, he returned to Kharkiv, where he was arrested by the order of the Cheka, and was shot in March 1921. In August 1921, after making raids all across Ukraine and constant battles with Red army forces many times larger and better equipped an exhausted Makhno was finally driven by Mikhail Frunze's Red forces into exile with 77 of his men.  Politics  Anarchist organizing villages in the Free Territory Makhnovia was a stateless and egalitarian society. Workers and peasants were organised into anarchist communities governed via a process of participatory democracy and were linked via an anarchist federation. When the Insurrectionary Army liberated a town from state control, it would post a notice clarifying they would not impose any authority on the town: > Workers, your city is for the present occupied by the Revolutionary > Insurrectionary (Makhnovist) Army. This army does not serve any political > party, any power, any dictatorship. On the contrary, it seeks to free the > region of all political power, of all dictatorship. It strives to protect > the freedom of action, the free life of the workers, against all > exploitation and domination. The Makhnovist Army does not, therefore, > represent any authority. It will not subject anyone to any obligation > whatsoever. Its role is confined to defending the freedom of the workers. > The freedom of the peasants and the workers belong to themselves, and should > not suffer any restriction.  Economy  Currency substitute stamps distributed by the Makhnovists Makhnovia was an effort to create an anarcho-communist economy. = Agriculture = Peasants who lived in Makhnovia began to self-organise into farming communes. The first one, called \\"Rosa Luxemburg\\" was highly successful. In these communes, land was held in common, and kitchen and dining rooms were also communal, though members who wished to cook separately or to take food from the kitchen and eat it in their own quarters were allowed to do so. Though only a few members actually considered themselves anarchists, the peasants operated the communes on the basis of full equality (\\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\") and accepted Kropotkin's principle of mutual aid as their fundamental tenet. = Industry = Railroad workers in Aleksandrovsk took the first steps in organising a self-managed economy in 1919. They formed a committee charged with organizing the railway network of the region, establishing a detailed plan for the movement of trains, the transport of passengers, etc. Soviets were soon formed to coordinate factories and other enterprises across Ukraine. = Art and entertainment = The Makhnovists paid a great amount of attention to theatre, and soldiers from the Black Army often practiced theatre to entertain themselves and keep up morale. In Gulyai-Polye, many workers and students began to write and perform in plays. = Money = The economy of Free Ukraine was a mixture of anarcho-communism and market socialism, with factories, farms and railways becoming cooperatives and many moneyless communities being created. The majority of territories continued to use money but planned to become anarcho-communist territories following the Russian Civil War. In 1920, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army declared that all types of money must be accepted within the territories, threatening \\"revolutionary punishment\\" to those who failed to follow this.  Education  As a result of the war, schools were abandoned and teachers received no wages, meaning education was nonexistent in the region for months. Upon the creation of soviets and assemblies in the region, the reconstruction of schools began. Inspired by the free schools of Francisco Ferrer, the soviets set up some of the first secular and democratic schools in Ukraine, having abolished compulsory education. Courses were set up for illiterate and semi-literate adults to help them read and courses for history, sociology and political theory were all offered free of charge to the general public. All of these efforts increased literacy in the region.  Flags  A photo showing a flag attributed to the Makhnovists Multiple variations of the black and red flags were used by the Makhnovists during the Russian Civil War. These banners were inscribed either with anarchist and socialist slogans or with the name of the unit using the flag. Ukrainian anarchist Viktor Belash said in his memoirs that flags with slogans such as \\"Power generates parasites, Long live Anarchy!\\" and \\"All power to the soviets right now!\\" were used at the Gulyai-Polye district soviet and Insurgent Army headquarters. A photo showing a flag with a death's head and the motto \\"Death to all those who stand in the way of the working people.\\" is often attributed to Makhnovists, first in the Soviet Russian book Jewish Pogroms 1917-1921 by Z.S. Ostrovsky, but this was denied by Nestor Makhno, who said the photo \\"does not show Makhnovists at all\\". The reverse side of this flag has words translating roughly to \\"Kish of the Dnieper\\". The word Kish, meaning a Cossack camp, at this time was used by the Ukrainian People's Republic to refer to battalions of the Ukrainian People's Army. –ú–∞—Ö–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞–º—è.svgOne of the flags described by Viktor Belash –ú–∞—Ö–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ–ª–∞–≥.jpgFlag used by the 2nd Insurgent Regiment of the RIAU Ostrovsky's Makhnovist banner, Obverse.svgObverse of the banner attributed to the Makhnovists by Ostrovsky Ostrovsky's Makhnovist banner, Reverse.svgReverse of the banner attributed to the Makhnovists by Ostrovsky  Human rights  Makhnovia lifted all restrictions on the press, speech, assembly and political organisations.

is pointed at its own playback video monitor. The loop delay from camera to display back to camera is at least one video frame time, due to the input and output scanning processes; it can be more if there is more processing in the loop. History Video feedback First discovered shortly after Charlie Ginsburg invented the first video recorder for Ampex in 1956, video feedback was considered a nuisance and unwanted noise. Technicians and studio camera people were chastised for allowing a video camera to see its own monitor as the overload of self-amplified video signal wreaked havoc with the 1950s video pickup, often ruining the pickup. It could also cause screen burn-in on a playback TV and/or monitors of the time as well, by generating static brightly illuminated display patterns. In the 1960s early examples of video feedback art become introduced into the psychedelic art scene in New York City. Nam June Paik is often cited as the first video artist, although this is disputed; he had clips of video feedback on display in New York City at the Greenwich Cafe in the mid 1960s. Early video feedback works were created by media artist/experimenters on the East and West Coasts in the late 1960s and early 70's. Video feedback artists Steina and Woody Vasulka, with Richard Lowenberg and others, formed The Kitchen, which was located in the kitchen of a broken- down hotel in lower Manhattan; while Skip Sweeney and others founded Video Free America in San Francisco, to nurture their video art and feedback experiments. David Sohn mentions video feedback in his 1970 book Film, the Creative Eye. This book was part of the base curriculum for Richard Lederer of St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, when he introduced making videofeedback as part of an English curriculum in his 1970s course Creative Eye in Film. Several students in this class participated regularly in the making and recording of videofeedback. Sony had released the VuMax series of recording video cameras and manually \\"hand-looped\\" video tape decks by this time which did two things: it increased the resolution of the video image, which made the picture more attractive, and it brought video tape recording technology within the general public's grasp for the first time and allowed for such video experimentation to take place by the general public. During the 1980s and into the 1990s video technology became enhanced and evolved into high quality, high definition video recording. Michael C. Andersen generated the first known mathematical formula of the videofeedback process, \\"Formula for Videofeedback\\" . videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28. and he has also generated a Mendeleev's square to show the gradual progressive formulaic change of the video image as certain parameters are adjusted.\\"Simulation of video feedback\\" . videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28. In the 1990s the rave scene and a social return to art of a more psychedelic nature brought back displays of video feedback on large disco dance floor video screens around the world. There are filters for Adobe Photoshop and non linear video editors that often have video feedback as the filter description, or as a setting on a filter. These filter types either mimic or directly utilize video feedback for its result effect and can be recognized by its vortex, phantasmagoric manipulation of the original recorded image. In entertainment Many artists have used optical feedback. An example is Queen's music video for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" (1975). The effect (in this simple case) can be compared to looking at oneself between two mirrors. Other videos that use variations of video feedback include: * Doctor Who ‚Äì An Unearthly Child (series, 1963-1973, opening title sequence.) * Earth, Wind & Fire ‚Äî \\"September\\" (1978) * The Jacksons ‚Äì \\"Blame It On the Boogie\\" (1978) * Kate Bush ‚Äì \\"Hammer Horror\\" (1978) * Amii Stewart ‚Äì \\"Knock on Wood\\" (1979) * Kool & the Gang ‚Äì \\"Get Down On It\\" (1981) * Todd Rundgren ‚Äì \\"Something to Fall Back On\\" (1985) * Smashing Pumpkins ‚Äì \\"Ava Adore\\" (1998) * Klaxons ‚Äì \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" (2008) * Boxcutter ‚Äì \\"TV Troubles\\" (2011) * Django Django ‚Äì \\"Life's A Beach\\" (2012) The opening titles sequence for the British science fiction series Doctor Who employed this technique from 1963 to 1973 (initially in black and white, redone in 1967 to showcase the show's new 625-line broadcast resolution and feature the Doctor's face (Patrick Troughton at that time), then redone again, in colour this time, in 1970. The next title sequence for the show, which debuted in 1973, abandoned this technique in favour of slit- scan photography.  In science  Droste effect recursion in VLC, a computer program. Optical feedback between mirrors. The optical feedback discussed so far‚Äîvideo feedback, created by a camera pointing at its own monitor‚Äîis actually just one particular example of optical feedback. Perhaps the most obvious example of optical feedback in science is the optical cavity found in almost every laser, which typically consists of two mirrors between which light is amplified. In the late 1990s it was found that so-called unstable- cavity lasers produce light beams whose cross-section present a fractal pattern. Optical feedback in science is often closely related to video feedback, so an understanding of video feedback can be useful for other applications of optical feedback. Video feedback has been used to explain the essence of fractal structure of unstable-cavity laser beams.\\"Fractal video feedback\\" . Optics Group (University of Glasgow). Retrieved 2010-12-28. The page discovery of fractal lasers gives an account of laser fractals, the developments of this work, links to further reading, and relates the laser context with video feedback systems. Video feedback is also useful as an experimental-mathematics tool. Examples of its use include the creation of Fractal patterns using multiple monitors or multiple images created using mirrors. The page video feedback in science provides an overview. Softology's Video Feedback page provides links and information about real and simulated video feedback. Optical feedback is also found in the image intensifier tube and its variants. Here the feedback is usually an undesirable phenomenon, where the light generated by the phosphor screen \\"feeds back\\" to the photocathode, causing the tube to oscillate, and ruining the image. This is typically suppressed by an aluminum reflective screen deposited on the back of the phosphor screen, or by incorporating a microchannel plate detector. Optical feedback has been used experimentally in these tubes to amplify an image, in the manner of the cavity laser, but this technique has had limited use. Optical feedback has also been experimented with as an electron source, since a photocathode-phosphor cell will 'latch' when triggered, providing a steady stream of electrons. See US Patent 4,531,122 for a typical application.  In philosophy  Douglas Hofstadter discusses video feedback in his book I Am a Strange Loop about the human mind and consciousness. He devotes a chapter to describing his experiments with video feedback. > At some point during the session, I accidentally stuck my hand momentarily > in front of the camera's lens. Of course the screen went all dark, but when > I removed my hand, the previous pattern did not just pop right back onto the > screen, as expected. Instead I saw a different pattern on the screen, but > this pattern, unlike anything I'd seen before, was not stationary.

The club was founded in 1990 after the merger of two clubs: APEAN (Athlitiki Podosfairiki Enosis Ayias Napas; \\"Athletic Football Union of Ayia Napa\\") and ENAN (Enosis Neon Ayias Napas; \\"Youth Union Ayia Napa\\"). History The club started in the Third Division (199091). They were promoted to Second Division in season 200001 after finishing 2nd in Third division. The team once played against Omonia Nicosia in Cup tournament. It lost 4‚Äì0 in the first match but came 2‚Äì2 in the second match. =Promotion to First Division= The biggest achievement of Ayia Napa FC's history was in the 200506 season after the team finished 3rd in Cypriot Second Division and was promoted to the Cypriot First Division. Despite it being their maiden appearance in the First Division, Ayia Napa proved a formidable force for other First Division sides in the 200607 season. In their first match in the division, they achieved a surprise away draw against Anorthosis Famagusta, which were followed by two more draws, including one against First Division Heavyweights Omonia Nicosia. In their first 12 matches overall they achieved several draws, including another home draw against APOEL. However, they had to wait until the 13th matchday for their first victory, when the team beat Aris Limassol 4‚Äì1. By the midway point of the season, the team had lost just 5 times. On January 14, 2007, in the reverse fixture of their earlier draw, Ayia Napa beat Omonia Nicosia 2‚Äì1, arguably the most impressive result in the clubs' history. After that victory there were a few more successful results and the club looked like they may avoid relegation. However, the team lost their last seven First Division matches of the season and ended up relegated. =Cup qualification to the Quarter-finals= Another big achievement of Ayia Napa FC is the qualification to the cup's quarter-finals group stage in the 200708 season while the team was in the Cypriot Second Division. That season was the only team from Cypriot Second Division that qualified to quarter- finals. The club finished third in the group stages with wins against APOEL and Aris Limassol. Stadium The team's stadium is Municipal Stadium of Ayia Napa, which is a multi-use stadium in Ayia Napa. It is currently used mostly for football matches and holds 2,000 people. However the stadium was not suitable for first division matches, so for the season 200607, when Ayia Napa plays in First Division, the team is using for home the Tasos Markou Stadium in Paralimni. The UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship was hosted in Cyprus in 1998 and the UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship in 1992 and the Ayia Napa Stadium was used for two matches of Republic of Ireland in each competition; on June 19, 1998 their 5‚Äì2 victory against Croatia and four days later, their 3‚Äì0 Cyprus U-19 national team and qualified to the final where they went on to win the trophy. In 1992, the Irish were beaten by the Netherlands U-16 0‚Äì2 and tied by Spain 1‚Äì1. Current squad For recent transfers, see List of Cypriot football transfers summer 2019.

In Europe, mugwort most often refers to the species Artemisia vulgaris, or common mugwort. While other species are sometimes referred to by more specific common names, they may be called simply \\"mugwort\\" in many contexts. Etymology The Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm mentions . A folk etymology, based on coincidental sounds, derives ' from the word \\"mug\\"; more certainly, it has been used in flavoring drinks at least since the early Iron Age. Other sources say mugwort is derived from the Old Norse muggi (meaning \\"marsh\\") and German wuertz (wort in English, originally meaning \\"root\\"), which refers to its use since ancient times to repel insects, especially moths.Lust, J. (2005) The Herb Book 604. The Old English word for mugwort is where , could be a variation of the Old English word for \\"midge\\": . Wort comes from the Old English (root/herb/plant), which is related to the Old High German wurz (root) and the Old Norse urt (plant).Merriam Webster Dictionary Species Species in the genus Artemisia called mugwort include: * Artemisia absinthium ‚Äì wormwood, traditionally used in the production of Absinthe. * Artemisia argyi ‚Äì Chinese mugwort, used in traditional Chinese medicine * Artemisia douglasiana ‚Äì Douglas mugwort or California mugwort, native to western North America * Artemisia glacialis ‚Äì alpine mugwort * Artemisia indica ‚Äì Oriental mugwort * Artemisia japonica ‚Äì Japanese mugwort * Artemisia lactiflora - White mugwort * Artemisia norvegica ‚Äì Norwegian mugwort * Artemisia princeps ‚Äì Korean mugwort (ssuk), Japanese mugwort (yomogi), used as a culinary herb and in traditional Chinese medicine. * Artemisia stelleriana ‚Äì hoary mugwort * Artemisia verlotiorum ‚Äì Chinese mugwort * Artemisia vulgaris ‚Äì common mugwort, used as a culinary herb and medicinally throughout the world Uses Mugwort oil contains thujone, which is toxic in large amounts or under prolonged intake. Thujone is also present in Thuja plicata (western red cedar), from which the name is derived. The downy hairs on the underside of the leaves can be scraped off and used as effective tinder.Johnson.

Mugwort has also been used to flavor beer before the introduction of hops.Llewellyn's 2010 Herbal Almanac by Llewellyn =Essential oil= The composition of mugwort essential oil can vary depending on the genus of plant selected, its habitat, as well as the part of the plant extracted and the season of its harvest. Its main components can include camphor, cineole, Œ±- and Œ≤-thujone, artemisia ketone (CAS: 546-49-6), borneol and bornyl acetate as well as a wide variety of other phenols, terpenes and aliphatic compounds. =Medieval Europe= In the European Middle Ages, mugwort was used as a magical protective herb. Mugwort was used to repel insects ‚Äì especially moths ‚Äì from gardens. Mugwort has also been used from ancient times as a remedy against fatigue and to protect travelers against evil spirits and wild animals. Roman soldiers put mugwort in their sandals to protect their feet against fatigue. Mugwort is one of the nine herbs invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th century in the Lacnunga.Stephen Pollington \\"Leechcraft: Early English Charms, Plantlore and Healing\\" Grieve's Modern Herbal (1931) states that \\"in the Middle Ages, the plant was known as , it being believed that John the Baptist wore a girdle of it in the wilderness...a crown made from its sprays was worn on St. John's Eve to gain security from evil possession, and in Holland and Germany one of its names is 'St. John's plant', because of the belief that ‚Äì if gathered on St. John's Eve ‚Äì it gave protection against diseases and misfortunes.\\" In the Isle of Man, mugwort is known as bollan bane, and is still worn on the lapel at the Tynwald Day celebrations, which also have strong associations with St John. =China= There are several references to the Chinese using mugwort in cuisine. The famous Chinese poet S≈´ Sh√¨ in the 11th century mentioned it in one of his poems. There are even older poems and songs that can be tracked back to 3 BC. It was often called () or () in Mandarin. Mugwort can be prepared as a cold dish or can be stir-fried with fresh or smoked meat. The Hakka Taiwanese also use it to make chh√∫-khak-k√© (), doughy sweet dumplings. Mugwort is also used as a flavoring and colorant for a seasonal rice dish. In traditional Chinese medicine, mugwort is used in a pulverized and aged form ‚Äì called ' in English (from Japanese mogusa) ‚Äì to perform moxibustion, that is, to burn on specific acupuncture points on the patient's body to achieve therapeutic effects. =Germany= In Germany, known as , it is mainly used to season goose, especially the roast goose traditionally eaten for Christmas. =Japan= Mugwort ‚Äì or ‚Äì is used in a number of Japanese dishes, including y≈çkan, a dessert, or kusa mochi, also known as yomogi mochi. Mugwort rice cakes, or kusa mochi are used for Japanese sweets called daifuku (literally 'great luck'). To make these, take a small amount of mochi and stuff it or wrap it round a filling of fruit or sweetened adzuki (red bean) paste. Traditional daifuku can be pale green, white or pale pink and are covered in a fine layer of potato starch to prevent sticking. Mugwort is a vital ingredient of kusa mochi (rice cake with mugwort) and hishi mochi (lozenge rice cake), which is served at the Doll Festival in March. In addition, the fuzz on the underside of the mugwort leaves is gathered and used in moxibustion. In some regions in Japan, there is an ancient custom of hanging yomogi and iris leaves together outside homes in order to keep evil spirits away. It is said that evil spirits dislike their smell. The juice is said to be effective at stopping bleeding, lowering fevers and purging the stomach of impurities. It can also be boiled and taken to relieve colds and coughs. =Korea= In both North and South Korea, mugwort ‚Äì () ‚Äì is used in soups and salads. A traditional soup containing mugwort and clams is (), made in spring from the young plants just before they bloom. Another dish is named (), in which the mugwort is mixed with rice flour, sugar, salt and water and is then steamed. It is a common ingredient in rice cakes, teas, soups, and pancakes. Known as a blood cleanser, it is believed to have different medicinal properties depending on the region it is collected in. In some regions, mugwort thins the blood, while in another region, it is claimed to have hallucinogenic properties, causing some to pass out from direct skin contact (dermal absorption) with the active chemicals. For this reason, some Koreans also wear a silk sleeve when picking mugwort plants. Its primary use, however, is in moxibustion. Mugwort is burned on pressure points of the body, much like acupuncture. Allergen Mugwort pollen is one of the main sources of hay fever and allergic asthma in North Europe, North America and parts of Asia. Mugwort pollen generally travels less than 2,000 meters. The highest concentration of mugwort pollen is generally found between 9 and 11 am. The Finnish allergy association recommends tearing as a method of eradicating mugwort. Tearing mugwort is known to lessen the effect of the allergy, since the pollen flies only a short distance. =Medicinal= A mugwort leaf with the pointed leaves characteristic of a mature plant The mugwort plant has been used as an anthelminthic, so it is sometimes confused with wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). The plant, called nƒÅgadamanƒ´ in Sanskrit, is used in Ayurveda for cardiac complaints as well as feelings of unease, unwellness, and general malaise.Ramawat, K. G., Ed. (2004). Biotechnology of Medicinal Plants: Vitalizer and Therapeutic Enfield, New Hampshire: Science Publishers, Inc. 5. In traditional Chinese medicine, there is a belief that moxibustion of mugwort is effective at increasing the cephalic positioning of fetuses who were in a breech position before the intervention. A Cochrane review in 2012 found that moxibustion may be beneficial in reducing the need for ECV, but stressed a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate this usage. Mugworts are used medicinally, especially in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean traditional medicine. One species, Artemisia argyi, is often called \\"mugwort\\" in the context of traditional Chinese medicine, or more specifically \\"Chinese mugwort\\", or () in Mandarin. Artemisia princeps is Korean mugwort, known locally as (). It is also found in Japan, where it is known as (). Indigenous peoples of North America used mugwort for a number of medicinal purposes. Strong, bitter-tasting pasture sagewort tea was taken to treat colds, and fevers. Mugwort was used in washes and salves to treat bruises, itching, sores, poison ivy, eczema and underarm or foot odour. The leaves were dried, crushed and used as a snuff to relieve congestion, nosebleeds and headaches. Tarragon plants were boiled to make washes and poultices for treating swollen feet and legs and snow blindness. Some tribes called western mugwort 'women's sage' because the leaf tea was taken to correct menstrual irregularity. It was taken to relieve indigestion, coughs, and chest infections. Western mugwort smoke was used to disinfect contaminated areas and revive patients from comas. Northern wormwood tea was taken to relieve difficulties with urination or bowel movements, to ease delivery of babies and to cause abortions.https://www.amazon.ca/Edible-Medicinal-Plants-Canada- MacKinnon/dp/1551055724 See also *List of plants known as mugwort *Epazote, a plant with a similar flavour profile used in North and South American cuisines.

It covers latitudes 10 to 70 South and longitudes 110 to 180 W.http://www.itouchmap.com/?r=marsfeatures&z;=7238 Terra Sirenum is an upland area notable for massive cratering including the large Newton Crater. Terra Sirenum is in the Phaethontis quadrangle and the Memnonia quadrangle of Mars. A low area in Terra Sirenum is believed to have once held a lake that eventually drained through Ma'adim Vallis.Irwin, R, et al. 2002. Geomorphology of Ma'adim Vallis, Mars and associated paleolake basins. J. Geophys. Res. 109(E12): https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_050948_1430 Terra Sirenum is named after the Sirens, who were birds with the heads of girls. In the Odyssey these girls captured passing seamen and killed them.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y.  Chloride deposits  Evidence of deposits of chloride based minerals in Terra Sirenum was discovered by the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter's Thermal Emission Imaging System in March 2008. The deposits are approximately 3.5 to 3.9 billion years old. This suggests that near-surface water was widespread in early Martian history, which has implications for the possible existence of Martian life. Besides finding chlorides, MRO discovered iron/magnesium smectites which are formed from long exposure in water.Murchie, S. et al. 2009. A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Journal of Geophysical Research: 114. Based on chloride deposits and hydrated phyllosilicates, Alfonso Davila and others believe there is an ancient lakebed in Terra Sirenum that had an area of 30,000 km2 and was 200 meters deep. Other evidence that supports this lake are normal and inverted channels like ones found in the Atacama desert.Davila, A. et al. 2011. A large sedimentary basin in the Terra Sirenum region of the southern highlands of Mars. Icarus. 212: 579-589.  Inverted relief  Some areas of Mars show inverted relief, where features that were once depressions, like streams, are now above the surface. It is believed that materials like large rocks were deposited in low-lying areas. Later, erosion (perhaps wind which can't move large rocks) removed much of the surface layers, but left behind the more resistant deposits. Other ways of making inverted relief might be lava flowing down a stream bed or materials being cemented by minerals dissolved in water. On Earth, materials cemented by silica are highly resistant to all kinds of erosional forces. Examples of inverted channels on Earth are found in the Cedar Mountain Formation near Green River, Utah. Inverted relief in the shape of streams are further evidence of water flowing on the Martian surface in past times.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_006770_1760 Image:Ridge in crater in Terra Sirenum.JPGCTX image of craters with black box showing location of next image.

Possible pingos  The radial and concentric cracks visible here are common when forces penetrate a brittle layer, such as a rock thrown through a glass window. These particular fractures were probably created by something emerging from below the brittle Martian surface. Ice may have accumulated under the surface in a lens shape; thus making these cracked mounds. Ice being less dense than rock, pushed upwards on the surface and generated these spider web-like patterns. A similar process creates similar sized mounds in arctic tundra on Earth. Such features are called ‚Äúpingos,‚Äù, an Inuit word.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_046359_1250 Pingos would contain pure water ice; thus they could be sources of water for future colonists of Mars.

Concentric crater fill Concentric crater fill, like lobate debris aprons and lineated valley fill, is believed to be ice- rich.Levy, J. et al. 2009. Concentric crater fill in Utopia Planitia: History and interaction between glacial \\"brain terrain\\" and periglacial processes. Icarus: 202. 462-476. Based on accurate topography measures of height at different points in these craters and calculations of how deep the craters should be based on their diameters, it is thought that the craters are 80% filled with mostly ice.Levy, J., J.

Magnetic stripes and plate tectonics  The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) discovered magnetic stripes in the crust of Mars, especially in the Phaethontis and Eridania quadrangles (Terra Cimmeria and Terra Sirenum).Barlow, N. 2008. Mars: An Introduction to its Interior, Surface and Atmosphere. Cambridge University Press The magnetometer on MGS discovered 100 km wide stripes of magnetized crust running roughly parallel for up to 2000 km. These stripes alternate in polarity with the north magnetic pole of one pointing up from the surface and the north magnetic pole of the next pointing down. When similar stripes were discovered on Earth in the 1960s, they were taken as evidence of plate tectonics. Researchers believe these magnetic stripes on Mars are evidence for a short, early period of plate tectonic activity. When the rocks became solid they retained the magnetism that existed at the time. A magnetic field of a planet is believed to be caused by fluid motions under the surface.Connerney, J. et al. 1999. Magnetic lineations in the ancient crust of Mars. Science: 284. 794-798.Langlais, B. et al. 2004. Crustal magnetic field of Mars. Journal of Geophysical Research. 109: EO2008 However, there are some differences, between the magnetic stripes on Earth and those on Mars. The Martian stripes are wider, much more strongly magnetized, and do not appear to spread out from a middle crustal spreading zone. Because the area containing the magnetic stripes is about 4 billion years old, it is believed that the global magnetic field probably lasted for only the first few hundred million years of Mars' life, when the temperature of the molten iron in the planet's core might have been high enough to mix it into a magnetic dynamo. There are no magnetic fields near large impact basins like Hellas. The shock of the impact may have erased the remnant magnetization in the rock. So, magnetism produced by early fluid motion in the core would not have existed after the impacts. When molten rock containing magnetic material, such as hematite (Fe2O3), cools and solidifies in the presence of a magnetic field, it becomes magnetized and takes on the polarity of the background field. This magnetism is lost only if the rock is subsequently heated above a particular temperature (the Curie point which is 770 ¬∞C for iron). The magnetism left in rocks is a record of the magnetic field when the rock solidified.http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31028&fbodylongid;=645  Other features  ESP 050856 1445channels.jpgChannel, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Streamlined shapes are indicated with arrows.

He also distinguished himself as a Methodist Pastor, as a college and seminary professor and theologian, and as an author and editor. Birth and Family John was born in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, the son of the Rev. Heinrich and Rosalie (Mueller) Nuelsen. Heinrich, born in N√∂rten, Hanover, became an American citizen and was ordained into the Methodist Episcopal ministry. He spent time in Germany as a missionary, and later was sent to Switzerland to help establish Methodism there. He served churches in Europe for thirty-eight years. The family was originally from Holland. John was baptized by Bishop Calvin Kingsley. John married Luella Elizabeth Stroeter (daughter of Ernst Ferdinand & Caroline Str√∂ter) on 8 September 1896. They had the following children: Albert E., Henry E., John Louis, Jr., and Marie L. Education Being a Methodist Pastor's family, the Nuelsens moved a great deal. John attended Gymnasium in Karlsruhe, Germany and Bremen, Germany. He then went to Drew Theological Seminary, Madison, New Jersey (1887‚Äì89), earning the B.D. degree in 1890. He earned the A.M. degree at Central Wesleyan College in Warrenton, Missouri in 1893. He studied further at the University of Berlin and the University of Halle in Germany. Ordained and Academic Ministry John joined the West German Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in the U.S. in 1889. The Rev. J.L. Nuelsen served pastoral appointments in Sedalia, Missouri and Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. In 1890, the Rev. Nuelsen was appointed a Professor at St. Paul's College in St. Paul Park, Minnesota, serving until 1892. During 1892-93 he completed his Master's degree. In 1894 he was appointed a Professor at his alma mater, Central Wesleyan College, serving until 1899. In 1899 the Nast Theological Professorship in Exegetical Theology was established at German Wallace College, Berea, Ohio with a gift of $20,000 given by Franzeska Wilhelmina \\"Fanny\\" Nast Gamble, daughter of the Rev. William Nast (the first President of German-Wallace) and wife of William Gamble (son of Procter and Gamble co-founder James Gamble). The Rev. Dr. John L. Nuelsen was called to this new chair. After three years this department was expanded into the Nast Theological Seminary, which served well in the training of ministers and workers in Christian vocations from 1902 until 1933, especially those of German descent. Dr. Nuelsen served his Professorship until 1908. He was elected a delegate to the M.E. General Conferences in 1904 and 1908. He also attended the Ecumenical Conferences of 1901 and 1911. Episcopal Ministry Bishop Nuelsen was elected to the Episcopacy by the General Conference of 1908. His election came primarily as a result of a rather strong insistence upon the part of the German constituency of the M.E. Church that they should be represented in the Board of Bishops. This election was thus an early manifestation of the conviction, registered often in more recent years, that minority groups in the Church should furnish a part of the Episcopacy. Once elected, however, Bishop Nuelsen was assigned, not to preside over German Conferences, but to a regular Area of the Church in the United States. He was assigned to the Omaha episcopal area (Nebraska) until 1912. Then he was assigned all the work in Europe, with his residence in Z√ºrich. He was associated with the work of the Church in Europe for the rest of his active episcopacy (until 1940). At first his Episcopal Area covered all annual conferences in Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, France, Spain, Italy and Austro-Hungary. In 1920 the European work was divided into three Episcopal Areas: the Stockholm Area, the Paris Area, and the Z√ºrich Area (to which Bishop Nuelsen was assigned). Bishop Nuelsen also served as a trustee of Drew Theological Seminary. Honorary Degrees The Rev. John Louis Nuelsen was honored with the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1903 by the University of Denver. Nebraska University awarded him the LL.D. in 1907. Nuelsen, the man Bishop Nuelsen is remembered by fellow-Methodist Bishop Roy H. Short as: > an impressive man. He looked the scholar that he was. His library, which can > still be seen in the Methodist Publishing House in Zurich, bears silent > testimony to the wide range of his interests and the eagerness of his mind > for acquiring knowledge. He wrote constantly and was the author of a number > of books and of a multitude of articles. He was an indefatigable traveler, > and much of his study and writing was done on the road. Wartime World War I was especially difficult for Bishop Nuelsen. He loved the German Methodists and the German People, and hastened to defend them in the early years of the war. When the United States entered the war, however, matters became further complicated for him. The charge of being \\"pro-German\\" was a serious one at that time in the opinion of many Americans during the highly emotional days of 1917-18. Nuelsen was attacked in some American church papers. Even some of his Episcopal brethren were not too understanding of the situation in which he found himself. During the last period of the war he was in fact forbidden to travel, being immobilized in Switzerland for long months. A further complication was the fact that the conferences under his care were divided between nations on the side of Germany and nations on the side of the Allies.

The Marine Services Company Limited of Tanzania sails her, with numerous stops to pick up and set down passengers, between the ports of Kigoma, Tanzania and Mpulungu, Zambia. Graf von Goetzen was built in 1913 in Germany, and was one of three vessels the German Empire used to control Lake Tanganyika during the early part of the First World War. Her captain had her scuttled on 26 July 1916 in Katabe Bay during the German retreat from Kigoma. In 1924, a British Royal Navy salvage team raised her and in 1927 she returned to service as Liemba. Liemba is the last vessel of the German Imperial Navy still actively sailing anywhere in the world. Liemba is believed to be the inspiration for the German gunboat Luisa in C. S. Forester's 1935 novel The African Queen, and John Huston's subsequent film version. The ship featured in the 1992 BBC Television travel series Pole to Pole. Indican Pictures and Breadbox Productions released a documentary on the ship in 2010, Liemba. History =Early history= Model in Hamburg of Goetzen as originally built The Meyer-Werft Shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, built Goetzen in 1913 and named her after Count Gustav Adolf Graf von G√∂tzen, the former governor of German East Africa. Goetzen was designed to serve as a passenger and cargo ferry in conjunction with the Ostafrikanische Eisenbahngesellschaft (East African Railway Company). After preliminary assembly Goetzen was taken apart and shipped in 5000 boxes loaded on three cargo vessels to Dar es Salaam in German East Africa (modern day Burundi, Rwanda and Tanganyika (the mainland part of present Tanzania)).Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Zeitung v. 18. und 21. February 1914 (German) From there the trains of the Mittellandbahn (\\"Central Line\\") carried the boxes to Kigoma. She was rebuilt there in 1914 and launched on 5 February 1915. Originally the ship had seven first class cabins (single bed & sofa bed) and five second class cabins (double bed), as well as first and second class dining and smoking rooms.Passagier- und Frachtdampfer f√ºr den Tanganjika-See von Werftbesitzer Franz Jos. Meyer in: Werft, Reederei, Hafen 1922, 99(German) The machinery consisted at first of two round boilers for steam for the two triple expansion engines with a power rating of per engine. She also had a carbonic ice and cooling unit in an insulated cold storage with a capacity of of ice per hour, and a lighting and a ventilation system. The ship was designed for a crew of 64 men (60 men and four officers).Evaluation of Ship Plan in Werft, Reederei, Hafen 1922, 99 = First World War = SS Goetzen 1915 During World War I the Germans converted Goetzen to an auxiliary warship under the name SMS Goetzen. They gave her a gun from the light cruiser , a ship no longer operational and which her crew later scuttled in the mouth of the Rufiji River. She also received an gun, one of two that K√∂nigsberg had brought out from Germany to arm auxiliary cruisers should the opportunity arise. Lastly, the survey ship SMS M√∂we contributed two 37 mm Hotchkiss revolver guns to Goetzens armament.A√ümann: Der Krieg zur See 1914‚Äì1918, Bd. 7, P. 176 f.(German) The Germans appointed Oberleutnant zur See Siebel captain of Goetzen. Under his command Goetzen initially gave the Germans complete supremacy on Lake Tanganyika. She ferried cargo and personnel across the lake between Kigoma and Bismarckburg (now Kasanga, Tanzania), saving troops from a two-week overland march, and provided a base from which to launch surprise attacks on Allied troops. It therefore became essential for the Allied forces to gain control of the lake themselves. German gun crew manning Graf von Goetzens 105 mm gun HMS Fifi formerly Kingani A diagram of Hedwig von Wissmann Geoffrey Spicer-Simson and the Royal Navy succeeded in the monumental task of bringing two armed motor boats, and , from England and via the Belgian Congo to the lake by rail, road and river. The British then launched their two boats at Albertville (Kalemie) on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika. The two boats waited until December 1915, then mounted a surprise attack on the Germans, capturing the gunboat Kingani ‚Äì renamed HMS Fifi. They sank a second German vessel, , in February 1916; this left G√∂tzen as the only German vessel remaining on the lake. As a result of their strengthened position on the lake, the Allies advanced towards Kigoma by land, and the Belgians established an airbase on the western shore at Albertville. From there on 10 June 1916 they used Short Admiralty Type 827 planes for a bombing raid on Goetzen as she sat in the harbour of Kigoma.Aim√© Behaeghe First Pilot in Central Africa in Cross&Cocade; 2008 Vol. 39, Nr. 1 (PDF; 12.9 MB); The Times vom 16. Juni 1916, P. 8 These bombing raids didn't severely damage the Goetzen, but she remained in the harbour. The Germans had already removed most of her guns in the beginning of May as they needed them elsewhere. At the time of the air raid Goetzen had only one 37 mm Hotchkiss left, which she used as an anti-aircraft gun.A√ümann P. 258, 260 The war on the lake had reached a stalemate by this stage, with both sides declining to mount attacks. However, the war on land was progressing, largely to the advantage of the Allies, who cut off the railway link in July 1916 and threatened to isolate Kigoma completely. This led the German naval commander on the lake, Gustav Zimmer, to abandon the town and head south. In order to avoid the ship falling into Allied hands, General Lettow-Vorbeck ordered that Goetzen be scuttled. The task was given to the three engineers from Meyer Werft who had travelled with the disassembled ship to Lake Tanganyika in order to supervise its re-assembly. The engineers decided on their own that they would try to facilitate a later salvage; they loaded the ship with sand and covered all engines with a thick layer of grease before sinking her carefully on 26 July, in a depth of near the banks of the Katabe Bay (Belgian designation: Baie de l‚Äô√©l√©phant; British designation: Bangwe Bay) at the position .Leconte: Les anc√™tres de notre Force Navale. S. 331; Moulaert: La campagne du Tanganika. S. 119 = Salvage and recommissioning = Johann Ludwig Wall, a Swede working for the Belgians, salvaged the ship in 1918. He initially had divers remove large quantities of material. Then he filled the holds with empty barrels and passed cables under the ship to two 375 t barges that the \\"Compagnie des Chemins de fer du Congo Sup√©rieur aux Grands Lacs Africains\\" had purpose-built for the task and positioned on each side of the wreck.Tribune Congolese, 19 September 1919. p. 1; Chalux: Un an au Congo Belge S. 545 f. By the end of June 1919, the Belgians had succeeded in lifting the ship up to her gunwales by winding in the cables. Then in mid-September the Belgians floated the semi-submerged vessel to Kigoma. There she settled in water deep.Tribune Congolese, 19 September 1919, p. 1; Moulaert, p. 119, footnote 1. The water was shallow enough that her superstructure extended above the surface of the lake. Early in 1920, a stormPatrick Deville, Equatoria, p. 246. moved the vessel, sinking her at Point Lusana in . The photos of Kigoma Bay that Homer L. Shantz made in mid-February 1920 show no sign of the ship. In 1921 the British took control of Kigoma. They then took until 16 March 1924 to raise the ship again. The British found that the engines and boilers were still usable and so they decided to rehabilitate the ship. On 16 May 1927 the ship went back into service under the name Liemba. Mary Katherine Scott, the wife of the chief secretary and acting governor Sir John Scott, launched Liemba for the Tanganyika Railways and Port Service.Hill: Permanent Way vol. 2, p. 95. The pure conversion costs amounted to about ¬£30,000 sterling. Salvage had cost ¬£20,000, and infrastructure ¬£28,000.Cane p. 31. The Germans had spent the equivalent of just ¬£36,000 to construct her. =1927 to 1948= In 1941, following the death of Lord Baden-Powell on 7 January 1941, his widow, Olave, Lady Baden-Powell sailed in Liemba from Northern Rhodesia northwards.\\"Window on my Heart\\" by Olave Lady Baden-Powell with Mary Drewery; page 196 = 1948 to 1952 = Liemba returned to service in 1952 after a two-year break. = Since 1952 = Liemba was operating almost non-stop from 1927. In 1948 the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation (EAR&H;) took over running the ferry, allowing it to link services with the Central Line from Kigoma to Dar es Salaam. From 1976 till 1979 the ship was overhauled. At this time twin diesel engines replaced the original steam engines. The driving force behind this renovation was Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Dougherty. He was born on 18 March 1918 in Downpatrick and did an apprenticeship at Harland & Wolff in Belfast. Subsequently, he served during the Second World War in the Royal Navy and became a ship's engineer. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked for the EAR&H; in Kisumu, Kenya as first engineer, and later as chief engineer on the ferries of Lake Victoria. After the renovation of Liemba he left Tanzania.He went on to work for FAO in Bangladesh and Mozambique. He died on 12 January 2010 in Belfast and was buried in Downpatrick. (Information provided by his daughter, Barbara Dougherty.) In 1977 the EAR&H; was dissolved and the new Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) took over operation of Liemba. In 1993 the TRC gave Liemba an overhaul managed by the Danish shipyard OSK ShipTech A/S, sponsored by the Danish International Development Agency. The rebuild included the deck house, the electronic system, and the pipes, renovation of the cabins of the passengers and crew, new MAN engines of each, installation of a hydraulic crane on the foredeck, and conversion of the rear cargo hull into a passenger room (capacity increase to 600 passengers).Information from OSK Ship Tech from 4 January 2014). To improve safety Liemba received a double bottom in the area of the forward cargo compartment. The ship was re-measured and the Danish engineers found that Liemba was long and had a beam of .

In 1997 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees used Liemba and to repatriate more than 75,000 refugees who had fled Zaire during the First Congo War, following the overthrow of longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Liemba made a total of 22 trips between Kigoma and Uvira during this five month operation.Tanzania Daily News from 12 June 2011. In May 2015 she was hired by the United Nations to evacuate 50,000 refugees fleeing from the troubles in Burundi. In 2014, the BBC showed a film about the ship, as part of their series on \\"World War 1 - Beyond the Trenches\\". =Renovation or replacement? = In 2011, TRC wrote to the Federal Government of Germany, requesting assistance in either renovating or replacing the vessel. The German authorities undertook a study that it is thought concluded that it would be cheaper to build a new ship than renovate Liemba. The final request for financial help fell between the governments of Lower Saxony, where the ship was built, and the federal government in Berlin, with the then President of Germany Christian Wulff stating that the vessel had a \\"singular history\\" and performed an \\"indispensable service\\" to the people of East Africa. The Liemba was in 2017 in Kigoma for a major maintenance. It is sailing again since 9 August 2018 .  The African Queen  The original version of The African Queen, written by C. S. Forester and serialised in the News Chronicle in 1934, was very different from the one associated with the film. In this Rose and Allnut are planning to attack a German cruiser named Dortmund (loosely based on SMS K√∂nigsberg), with the launch sailing down the river to attack it in the river delta. In the book the German gunboat K√∂nigin Luise (referred to by hero Charlie Allnutt as Louisa) is based on Kingani, a German gunboat sunk on Lake Tanganyika and to a certain extent the events portrayed in the film are based on the dramatic naval operation carried out by the Royal Navy, but the events described in the book bear little resemblance to the true historical events. The book was subsequently made into the 1951 classic film The African Queen, starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. The steam-tug Buganda on Lake Victoria, which was used for the long shots, played the gunboat used in the filming. The film brought a certain notoriety to Goetzen or Liemba. Near the end of the film, like its real life counterpart, Luisa ended up at the bottom of Lake Tanganyika, in this case following a collision with the torpedo-rigged bow of the partially submerged African Queen.  Ferry operation  Liemba is running once a week in each direction again since August 2018, from Kigoma to Mpulungu Wednesday to Friday, and back again from Friday to Sunday.http://mscl.go.tz/liemba.html Accommodation ranges from 1st class (luxury cabin) to 3rd class (seating only). There are docks at Kigoma, Mpulungu and Kasanga but at all other stops passengers must travel between ship and shore by way of a smaller boat. Notable stops along the route include: Lagosa (for Mahale Mountains National Park), Karema (for Mpanda) and Kipili or Kasanga (for Sumbawanga).

Methods of single increasing (knitting) * Yarn-over increase or \\"eyelet increase\\" ‚Äì The simplest increase is to do a yarn-over between two existing stitches. On subsequent rows, the yarn-over will be knitted, making a new stitch. This disadvantage of this method is that a small hole (eyelet) is produced at the yarn-over. This can be improved by twisting the yarn-over stitch - similar to a \\"make one\\" (below). * Raised Increase ‚Äì Lift the strand connecting two knitted stitches in the row below onto the left needle (effectively producing a yarn-over) and knit it, either normally or twisted. This method (especially if twisted) leaves almost no hole, since forming the yarn-over stitch from the (presumably tight) connecting strand draws the two neighboring stitches together. * Bar increase ‚Äì Knit the stitch normally but without transferring the knitted stitch to the right needle; the same stitch is then knitted through the back loop. (Knitting through the front loop again is not feasible, since it would undo the first stitch.) This increase makes a bar or a nub on the fabric. * Moss increase ‚Äì Knit the stitch normally but without transferring the knitted stitch to the right needle; the same stitch is then purled. This increase makes a bar or nub on the fabric. * Lifted Increase ‚Äì For a right-side increase, knit into the right leg of the stitch of the row below the next stitch to be knit, then knit the next stitch. For a left-side increase, knit one stitch, then knit into the left leg of the stitch of the row below it. This kind of increase can be visually subtle. * \\"Make One\\" (M1) ‚Äì Place a half-hitch loop on the needle between two stitches, either before or after, and twisted either left or right, depending on desired effect. * Column of Increases ‚Äì A second strand of yarn or roving is passed up the piece. The second strand is used to make an extra stitch in each row by knitting a doubled stitch up from the lower row. The resulting piece has one more stitch in each row and each row is in the shape of an inverted V. The column of increases is used to make square sweater yokes. Finally, a large number of increases in a row is best done by casting on; examples include buttonholes, etc. Role in fabric shaping The typical use for increases and decreases is to taper a flat piece of knitted fabric, e.g., in widening the sleeve of a sweater from the wrist to the biceps. However, increases and decreases can also be used to produce curvature, i.e., to make the knitted fabric cup (positive curvature) or gather (negative curvature); in woven fabrics, this curvature is produced with darts, flares and gussets. A great advantage of knitted fabrics is that they can be shaped nearly invisibly without seams or cutting (as woven fabrics must) with increases, decreases, and/or short rows.

The stream's catchment is open heathland, deciduous woodland, silvicultural inclosures and, in its lower reaches, small scale pastoral farmland; as such there are no consistent sources of pollution and the stream's course and character has largely remained free from artificial modification. Historically, the greatest human impact on the brook was connected to the Schultze Gunpowder Factory which was established in the 1860s at Eyeworth Lodge near Fritham. The factory required large volumes of water and this demand was met by damming the brook to create a reservoir (which still survives as Eyeworth Pond).

A noted Jewish ascetic, he took a Nazirite vow at the outbreak of World War I. Education Cohen was born in Mai≈°iagala, near Vilna (in modern Lithuania), the scion of a distinguished rabbinic family. In his youth he studied at the Radu≈Ñ Yeshiva under Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, at the Volozhin yeshiva, and at the yeshiva in Slabodka. Even at that time, his restless and inquiring mind led him to extend his studies beyond the traditional subjects taught in the yeshivot. Thus he turned to Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and the early writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. He also studied Russian to prepare himself for entrance to the university. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 he was twice arrested but was not detained. His spiritual unrest and the desire to widen his intellectual horizon led him to enroll in the Academy for Jewish Studies established by Baron David Guenzburg, where one of his close fellow students was Zalman Shazar, later president of Israel. From there he proceeded to Germany to study at the University of Freiburg. At the outbreak of World War I he was interned as an enemy alien, but was released and made his way to Switzerland, studying philosophy, classical literature, and Roman law at University of Basel. He was for a time chairman of the Jewish Students' Society there and delivered lectures on Jewish philosophy. It was then that he took upon himself a lifelong Nazirite vow, which involves complete abstention from cutting one's hair and partaking of any products of the vine. However, his personal asceticism went further: he became vegetarian, eschewing not only meat but also any garment made of leather, and practiced a monthly self- imposed silence every Rosh Hodesh eve (Yom Kippur Katan), as well as for around ten days a year from Rosh Hodesh Elul to the morrow of Yom Kippur. In addition, he refused to speak anything but Hebrew, or to leave the Holy City of Jerusalem. However, he was not a recluse, and did not hesitate to express his views on important topical problems. Meeting Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook The turning point in his life came with his meeting, on 29 Av, with Rabbi Kook, who was then in St. Gallen in Switzerland (1915). \\"My life then stood in the balance,\\" he noted. \\"I listened to him and was turned into a new man. ... I had found a master.\\" He decided to abandon his secular studies and devote himself entirely to Jewish thought. In 1922 he received an invitation from Rabbi Kook, who had returned to the Land of Israel, to become a tutor in the yeshiva which he had established. He helped draw up the curriculum, which was also to include history, philosophy, ethics, Hebrew grammar, and Bible. He was appointed lecturer in Talmud, ethics, and philosophy. The two used to meet daily, and Rabbi Kook entrusted him with the editing of his philosophical works, to which, along with disseminating Kook's ideas, he dedicated his life, hardly publishing any of his own works, although he left over 30 works in manuscript. The principal exception was the Kol Nevu'ah, of which the first volume appeared shortly before his death. It is the fruit of his life's work and is in two parts, \\"The Foundations of Jewish Religious Philosophy\\" and \\"The Foundations of Inner Wisdom.\\" The work is based on the premise that there is an original Jewish philosophy and a spiritual Jewish system of logic which is not intuitive speculative but spiritual-acoustic: \\"Sound and light are the two angels of thought which accompany man everywhere\\" but \\"hearing is greater than seeing.\\" The prophetic power is the beginning of Jewish wisdom, and he was convinced that the renewal of Jewish life in Israel would produce a new generation to which would even be vouchsafed the return of the spirit of prophecy. A passionate adherent of Rabbi Kook's doctrine that the return to Zion and its various stages, of which the establishment of the State of Israel was the latest, was itself only a stage in the fulfillment of the Divine Promise that would bring about the complete Redemption and the Messianic Age, he did not hesitate to reprove those rabbis who did not accept this belief. He saw in Rabbi Moses Hayyim Luzzatto the harbinger of this redemption, pointing out that the three significant movements, Hasidism, Musar, and Haskalah, had each made certain of Luzzatto's works their classics, and he claimed that both Rabbi Kook and he himself followed his doctrines. Personal Cohen had a son and a daughter: She'ar Yashuv ‚Äì Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Haifa ‚Äì, and Tzipiah ‚Äì the wife of Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren. Cohen's Yahrzeit is on the 28th of Av. In 1977, a three-volume Festschrift entitled Nezir Ehav was published in his memory.

The family moved to Salt Lake City where Masaoka legally changed his first name to \\"Mike\\" and became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He became a champion debater and graduated in 1937 from the University of Utah in economics and political science. At the age of 25, Masaoka was named National Secretary and Field Executive of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) which was strictly a mainland organization with no connection to Hawaii just before the outbreak of World War II. Masaoka was a key player in JACL's decision to cooperate with the Japanese American internment during the war, seeing that resistance would be counterproductive and increase the tension between the Nisei and the FDR Administration. In his position as a national spokesman, he urged cooperation and opposed legal challenges to the government and advised the government on how to run the camps (thus to reduce friction between the internees and their captors). He also advocated the segregation of so‚Äëcalled \\"troublemakers,\\" though the War Relocation Authority cast the net more broadly than Masaoka had anticipated. The government used him as their liaison with the entire Japanese American population in the camps, although he himself was never imprisoned in a camp. Masaoka was involved in leading the call for the formation of a military unit from the mainland; however, different dynamics occurred in Hawaii which provided all of the men in the 100th Battalion in June 1942 http://encyclopedia.densho.org/100th%20Infantry%20Battalion/ and 2,686 men out of the 10,000 who answered the call in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team http://encyclopedia.densho.org/442nd%20Regimental%20Combat%20Team/ to join the 1,500 from the mainland. He later served as publicist for the highly decorated volunteer units, so that the contributions (and heavy price paid) of the Japanese Americans would be known nationwide. He later served as technical consultant for the 1951 film Go For Broke! which not only portrayed the heroics of the 442nd RCT and 100th Battalion, but also starred several veterans of the 442nd. Near the end of his life, Masaoka strongly implied (without directly stating) that the government had pressured him to make statements and \\"suggestions\\" to go along with their policies. In a PBS interview, he said \\"it was a kind of a shibai . . .We were pretty desperate.\\" Shibai (ËäùÂ±Ö) is Japanese for performance or show. In 1950, Masaoka was involved in successfully lobbying for the rights of the Issei (Japanese immigrants) to naturalize as citizens. In 1952 he worked with the ACLU to bring a case in his mother's name, Masaoka vs. the State of California, to the California State Supreme Court that was one of the two cases that overturned the Alien Land Law (Masaoka v. People, 39 Cal.2d 883). He represented the JACL as a founding member of the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, and joined Dr. Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington. With his own consulting firm, Mike Masaoka Associates, he also lobbied on behalf of American and Japanese commercial interests. In 1972 he left JACL to become a full‚Äëtime lobbyist. His autobiography, They Call Me Moses Masaoka, written with Bill Hosokawa, was published in 1987. Associates considered the title a sign of his ego, though the title was originally bestowed derisively by political opponents during the 1940s. Masaoka noted with ironic humor that, unlike Moses, he led his people on a journey from the promised land of California to desert internment camps. Masaoka was married to Etsu Mineta Masaoka, the elder sister of Secretary of Transportation and Congressman Norman Mineta. Masaoka died in Washington, DC in 1991.

It is the best preserved example of a type of town that was once widespread throughout northern Scandinavia. As Church Village of Gammelstad, Lule√•, it was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1996. The town is located about 10 kilometers upstream the Lule River. At its centre is the 15th-century Nederlule√• Church surrounded by 424 wood-built houses. The houses were only used on Sundays and during religious festivals to accommodate worshipers from the surrounding countryside who could not return home the same day because of the distance and difficult traveling conditions. Because the buildings are built from timber, regular maintenance is required to prevent rot; surveys have been carried out to document the extent of existing rotting, and snow is cleared regularly during the winter.  History  The Gammelstad Church Town began as a trading settlement, and became the focus of religious observances for farming communities in the region. Gammelstad is an exceptionally well preserved example of a Scandinavian church town. Such settlements are unique, because they were shaped by the religious and social needs of a regions inhabitants, rather than by economic and geographic forces. The numerous wooden houses constructed around the church were only used on Sundays, and in conjunction with religious festivals as overnight housing for worshippers from the surrounding countryside, whose journeys involved travelling long distances in a harsh natural environment. Gammelstad's development into a church town instead of a mercantile town is a direct result of natural land upheaval which rendered the town harbor unusable by the 17th century, forcing citizens to relocate the community‚Äôs commercial centre. The new settlement took the name of Lule√•, while the earlier church site was renamed Gammelstad (Old Town). The relocation of the commercial centre preserved the unique settlement of Gammelstad, leaving it untouched by the later 19th-century industrialization of the region. Gammelstad's layout has been preserved in its entirety. The town plan grew organically over several centuries, consisting of radial approaches to the church, and roads circling the town centre along the sides of the hill. A wall with gates was built around the church, however the wall currently in place is a reconstruction. Development halted after the middle of the 17th century. In the modern day, very few Scandinavian church town settlements remain, and Gammelstad is the best preserved example of this form of settlement, and is therefore protected by UNESCO.  Buildings  There are a total of 520 buildings within the Gammelstad Church Town UNESCO World Heritage Site. These buildings include 404 church cottages divided into about 552 separate chambers, and 116 other buildings. Church cottages which served as short-term housing for worshippers are juxtaposed with larger, more conventional houses for the officials and merchants who lived permanently in the settlement. Both types of housing surround the late 15th-century church, the district‚Äôs only stone building, whose size reflects the prosperity of the region. Other notable buildings include the Chapel of Bethel, the Cottage of the Separatists, the Parish House, the Tithe Barn, the Mayor‚Äôs Residence, the Captain‚Äôs Residence, and the Guest House.

Islam is frequently subject of his cartoons. Gregorius Nekschot publishes his cartoons and satire mostly on his own website. His cartoons are also available in print from one publisher. On May 13, 2008 the cartoonist was arrested and taken into custody for interrogation. He was released after 30 hours, but it was expected that he would be prosecuted for discriminatory speech, insulting certain groups in society on the basis of their race or beliefs and possibly also for the crime of inciting hatred. His arrest has caused much debate in the press and parliament in what has been coined The Affair by Trouw newspaper on May 24, 2008. Charges against him were eventually dropped in September 2010. In December 2011 he announced he would no longer publish cartoons. Pseudonym In an interview the cartoonist has given an explanation for his sombre name. With \\"Gregorius\\" he refers to Pope Gregory IX, who instituted the Papal Inquisition, and \\"Nekschot\\" means literally \\"shot in the neck,\\" a method used, according to the cartoonist, by \\"fascists and communists to get rid of their opponents.\\" Freedom of speech =Theo van Gogh= Gregorius Nekschot was an associate of filmmaker Theo van Gogh who was murdered in 2004 by a young, homegrown, Muslim fundamentalist by the name of Mohammed Bouyeri. Van Gogh supported Nekschot by including his cartoons on his website De Gezonde Roker (The Healthy Smoker). Both Van Gogh and Gregorius Nekschot criticized Islam's perceived unwillingness to adopt the Dutch value of tolerance. They defended their right to criticise, provoke and speak freely. Nekschot's two comic books Misselijke grappen (Sick jokes) are published by Uitgeverij Xtra in Amsterdam. The same company publishes Theo van Gogh's Allah weet het beter (Allah knows best). =Blasphemy= Following the murder of Theo van Gogh a debate arose in the Netherlands about the limits of freedom of speech. This debate became alive again with the Danish cartoon affair and the making of the controversial film Fitna in 2008 by Dutch MP Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom (PVV). Justice minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party wished to revitalize a law on blasphemy and expand it with protecting non-religious philosophies of life. Since writer Gerard Reve was acquitted in 1966 for writing about intercourse with God as a donkey, the government had no longer prosecuted blasphemy. Minister Ballin met with opposition in parliament however, which wanted to completely abolish laws on blasphemy. =L√®se majest√©= Another law which might affect cartoons by Gregorius Nekschot is that of 'L√®se majest√©.' The cartoonist has indeed drawn the majesty of queen Beatrix in compromising positions. The last time that such an offence, in an artistic expression, was prosecuted, was in 1969 when the majesty of queen Juliana was insulted by cartoonist Willem Holtrop who presented her as a red light district prostitute and was fined 200 guilders.De touwtjes strakker, by Syp Wynia in Elsevier magazine, May 24, 2008, pg 12. However, the cartoons for which Nekschot was investigated did not include those of the queen in sexual explicit positions with the prime minister. =Discrimination= Never have artists been prosecuted for discriminatory speech. Discriminatory speech was first brought within the penal code in the years preceding World War II. The present wording of the code follows a 1966 treaty to banish all forms of racial discrimination. In 1996 however, a Christian MP, and a few years later, a Muslim imam were prosecuted for derogatory comments about homosexuals. Both were acquitted, the judge giving priority to their freedom of religion..Het strafrecht als dreiging voor de vrijheid, column by Afshin Ellian in NRC Handelsblad, May 24, 2008. In a weekend special of Trouw newspaper on May 24, 2008 about the Nekschot 'affair' author Nahed Selim of Allah houdt niet van vrouwen (Allah doesn't like women, 2007) argues that discrimination laws have turned out to be discriminatory themselves, allowing only religious people to speak freely. She cites a case of a mosque in Amsterdam selling ancient books with paragraphs about homosexuals and of an imam in The Hague giving instructions for light corporal punishment of women, both of which were not prosecuted. She observes this to be a reversal of the intention of freedom of religion: to protect people from discrimination, not to provide a safe haven for it. Selim concludes that equality before the law in a rechtsstaat then demands abolishing the laws on discriminatory speech. Criticism Nekschot has met with strong resistance from elements in society he seeks to criticize. His early work appeared in the satirical Amsterdam student magazine Propria Cures. The mainstream newspapers were unwilling to publish his cartoons on a regular basis, with the exception of weekly magazine HP/De Tijd. Nekschot says he has been threatened by fundamentalist Muslims and Dutch anarchists. Dutch Jews, perceiving parallels with cartoons in Nazi publication Der St√ºrmer, and a member of parliament for the CDA party emailed him with strong objections to his cartoons. After his release Nekschot said he had never before received objections from authorities. Only a local initiative against discrimination of Muslims, supported by a city district of Amsterdam, once summoned him to remove cartoons from his website.Interview with Syp Wynia in Elsevier, May 24, 2008, pg 13. However, he deliberately seeks to criticize Islam because of the 'apartheid' it advocates between men and women, Muslims and non-Muslims and because he considers circumcision of children a crime.Ideologie leidt tot onheil, by Thieu Vaessen in HP/De Tijd, May 23, 2008. The cartoonist was nominated for a Clickies, a Dutch web-comic award in 2005. A review of his Misselijke grappen in de Volkskrant newspaper of March 31, 2006 considered his (quoting the artist himself) 'needlessly offensive' work was not mirrored by any form of idealism. The reviewer did not discuss who is to judge the need or cause to offend. Having no such judge, may in itself be an ideal. When asked where he himself believed freedom of speech should stop, Nekschot replied that a cartoon should never call for violence. Arrest On May 13, 2008 Gregorius Nekschot was arrested at his home in Amsterdam. The cartoonist was taken into custody for interrogation, but released after 30 hours. According to the press release by the prosecutor's office, the arrest was made in the presence of a judge, a public prosecutor, two assistants to the prosecutor and six civilian clothed police officers. According to the same release, the home of the cartoonist was traced by establishing who paid the monthly fees for the website and a search of the premises was necessary to confirm the identity of the cartoonist. After his release, Nekschot arrived at the editorial board of HP/De Tijd magazine with a new mobile phone, his previous one apparently confiscated by the police.Misselijke Grappen, editorial HP/DeTijd website 21 May 2008 In an interview with newspaper de Volkskrant, he commented that it was the first time in 800 years of satire history in the Netherlands that an artist was put in jail. Expanding on his arrest Nekschot said that police took much material like DVDs from his home. They also confiscated sketchbooks with never published drafts for his cartoons. He suspects that they were hoping to find material which would tie him to right-wing extremist views. Nekschot says that he remained silent during interrogation, but nerves and laughter once broke his silence when police were reading him in official jargon a description of one of his cartoons. 'It felt like being in a Monty Python'. Justice minister Hirsch Ballin informed Parliament on May 20, 2008 that the purpose of the police visit was the search itself and that it was only a co√Øncidence that the cartoonist had been present and was arrested.Zaak- Nekschot zint Kamer niet in Het Parool, May 21, 2008, pg 5. He also added that two uniformed police officers had stood guard in front of Nekschot's house.Voorlopig verslag Tweede Kamer Allegations Gregorius Nekschot's arrest was preceded by several reports to the police of discrimination, the first of which was made in April 2005. Many said the reports were made at the initiative of a controversial Dutch convert to Islam, but no source was given. The office of the public prosecutor alleged that after reviewing dozens of cartoons by Gregorius Nekschot, it considered that eight cartoons, by attributing negative qualities to certain groups of people, are insulting and constituted the crime of discrimination according to article 137c and possibly also the crime of inciting hate according to article 137d of the Dutch Penal Code. Anonymity In several reports the cartoonist's fear of losing his anonymity and becoming a target of physical attack have been mentioned. The editors of HP/De Tijd have reported that the cartoonist experienced that one police officer made fun of him losing his anonymity because of his arrest. Prosecution The public prosecutor in the case has been named as Paul Velleman. In an article in de Volkskrant Henny Sackers, from the law school of Radboud University in Nijmegen, is quoted to suggest that the prosecutor may use Nekschot as a case-study to explore the limits of the laws on free speech.Zoeken naar de grenzen van de grap by Luuk Esser in De Volkskrant of May 21, 2008, pg 4. In parliament, the evening before, the justice minister Hirsch Ballin had denied a similar suggestion by MP De Wit for the SP. Hirsch Ballin specified his own involvement with the arrest of Nekschot as follows. The prosecutor's office had been intensely and meticulously busy with the cartoons and had been in contact with the minister on several occasions. The prosecutor himself had done a very careful assessment, in which the LECD was of the utmost importance, but had by himself concluded for which cartoons he was going to prosecute. In December 2006 the prosecutor had informed the minister about his intention to press charges against Gregorius Nekschot. In this communication the prosecutor specified which cartoons he deemed liable to prosecution and which cartoons not. There followed, said the minister, more conversations, deliberations and further particulars. In the meantime an 'interdepartmental study group cartoon problems' (interdepartementale studiegroep cartoonproblematiek) had been established to anticipate situations as in Denmark. Never had the minister given the prosecutor an order to stop or continue prosecution. He had only reviewed the consistency of the prosecution: for which cartoons to prosecute and for which ones not. There followed, once more, deliberations. Those contacts were continued, also within the study group. All this time the identity of Gregorius Nekschot was not investigated. Until the beginning of 2008 it was thought he was in fact two people.Tweede Kamer, 85e vergadering, Dinsdag 20 Mei 2008 (ongecorrigeerd verslag op 25 mei 2008).] All charges against Nekschot in the case were eventually dropped in September 2010. The only caveat is that he is still not allowed to show the cartoons on his own website any more due to Dutch penal code's article 137c, which forbids incitement to hatred. The images can still be reprinted when it is for journalistic reasons. MDI (Racism Monitoring Centre) Marco Hughes, former activist director of MDI (Meldpunt Discriminatie op Internet), a centre that monitors racism on the internet, has also fallen victim to Gregorius Nekschot, when his organization incarnated as a rat copulating with would-be Dutch fundamentalist terrorists (Hofstadgroep) in one of Nekschots cartoons in Misselijke grappen 1(pag 138). In a Turkish journal Hughes complained in 2006 that Dutch authorities turned a blind eye to racist internet sites, naming both an apparently no longer existing site [on which visitors called] for setting fire to mosques and a site in support of Ayaan Hirsi Ali publishing online shirts poking fun at the prophet. Hughs said Dutch authorities failed to take action about Muslim complaints. In a news release on their website MDI said it would take a special interest in monitoring developments in the case. A surge of 80 reports about cartoons and text on the website of the cartoonist at the beginning of 2005 was passed on by them to the public prosecutor. It was denied that they had filed a complaint in the name of Dutch convert Van de Ven, as was reported by others. The timing of the surge of complaints follows shortly the murder of Theo van Gogh in November 2004, perhaps providing a foundation for suggestions by Opheffer and Sylvain Ephimenco in Trouw (see press reactions) that prosecution of Van Gogh smells of a posthumous reckoning with the murdered filmmaker. MDI is founder of international internet hate crime fighter INACH. INACH believes the Netherlands, 'once a liberal democracy where the rights of all were protected', should balance the fight against terrorism by enforcing and expanding anti-discrimination laws. INACH says that some members of parliament have the wrong priorities if they are worried more by infringement of free speech than protecting its citizens against a cartoonist 'who hates blacks and Muslims.' Niels van Tameren, the present day director of MDI would like the judge to decide whether this is a case of 'free speech or racism'. Discriminatory cartoons The office of the public prosecutor has seen to the removal of the eight allegedly discriminatory cartoons from the internet. It has not informed the public which cartoons it considered discriminatory and why. This lack of information has led to speculation in all media as to which cartoons were the 'forbidden' ones. There was no clear understanding among the public or press what constituted a crime in a cartoon. The prosecutor had also not specified which groups were discriminated against by Gregorius Nekschot. A large body of the cartoonist's work deals with Muslims. For example: one cartoon deals with an incident in which an imam refused to shake hands with a female minister and implies that the same hands do not object to receiving social security hand-outs from the government. The HP/De Tijd (May 23, 2008) Nekschot fires back issue became available in the shops on May 21 and included all eight cartoons, putting an end to speculation on which cartoons the justice officials deemed illegal. Press reactions =Newspapers initial reactions= After his arrest, many mainstream media supported Gregorius Nekschot by publishing his cartoons, as for example on the front page of Amsterdams Het Parool newspaper.Het Parool, 16 May 2008 p.1 All mainstream newspapers raised questions about at least the way the prosecutor handled the arrest and expressed doubts about the prosecutor's chances of winning a conviction.NRCHandelsblad editor Folkert Jensma in Veroordeling tekenaar Nekschot onwaarschijnlijk on p. 3 (May 19, 2008) Only the small, but influential with the government's Christian parties, Trouw newspaper has been somewhat supportive of the prosecution itself, stating in its chief editorial that only a judge can decide whether the cartoons constitute a crime. In an editorial, the newspaper most closely associated with the government PvdA party, de Volkskrant, immediately condemned the decision to police satire or other 'cultural candy'. Many cartoonists of newspapers made drawings in support of Gregorius Nekschot. The nation's largest newspaper De Telegraaf on its front page on May 22, 2008 focused its readers attention on a colourful painting of two rather abstract female nudes by artist Ellen Vroegh that the municipality of Huizen removed from public space at city hall at the request of a Muslim gentlemen. A sideshow. Other sideshows turned up bearing witness to tension within the social-democratic PvdA party which accommodates both traditional socialists and immigrants. In de Volkskrant (May 22, 2008) two University Law School professors advised the justice minister not to interfere with the case to conserve the prosecutors neutrality. MP Fred Teeven for the VVD, a former prosecutor, however denied the prosecutor's neutrality and declared it a political case. Paul de Beer, a labor relations professor at the University of Amsterdam, in the same de Volkskrant shared his concern that the freedom of the press was not in safe hands with the governments Christian CDA party. He cited several other muzzlings of the press, most importantly the prime- ministers continued legal action against weekly Opinio, which had published a fictional speech by the prime-minister challenging his official position on Islam. =Weekly magazines= Syp Wynia in Elsevier magazine argued that events pointed to a sudden and conspicuous change of policy within the prosecutor's office, and by its highest authority: the justice minister. Also he expressed surprise that cartoons insulting Christians did not receive police attention. Vrij Nederland May 24, 2008 issue in a short article Lange tenen (Long toes) attempted to downplay the media hype. Denying exaggerated talk on internet of a clash of civilizations and wanting to be evenhanded, the editors reminded readers of recent arrests of protestors against Wilders and concluded that the government is nervous about all trespassing. Crying Bwehhh! Scandalous the Opheffer column in De Groene Amsterdammer, was pissed off by the intellectual crowd that distanced itself first from the rudeness of the cartoons, before criticizing the arrest. Opheffer said the cartoons were excellent and a great comfort to him after Van Gogh's murder. =Newspapers continued= Cartoonist Ruben L. Oppenheimer in NRC Handelsblad (May 24‚Äì25, 2008, pg 14) presented a fictional, signed and stamped, document of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, headed (in translation): PLEDGE OF LOYALTY, SUPREME NATIONAL AUTHORITY FOR WISDOM OF THE PRESS AND HUMOUR EXPERIENCE, SUB- DEPARTMENT CARTOON ARTS. One of the stamps was from the 'Interdepartementale Werkgroep Cartoonproblematiek' or the 'Interdepartemental Studygroup Cartoonproblems' the existence of which and its discussion of the Nekschot cartoons was revealed in parliament by the minister of justice. On the same page, in a satirical column the paper's editor Marc Chavannes pretended to have received a document from the governments legal counsel, addressed to the PM, advising him to declare a state of limited emergency in order to win his lawsuit against Opinio magazine, which had published a secret speech under his name to his political advisors (obviously a pastiche), admitting that not extremist Islam was the problem, but Islam itself. Another and important contribution was made by Frenchman Sylvain Ephimenco, a regular columnist in Trouw, in the weekend special De Affaire (May 24, 2008), believing that the intimidating action against Gregorius Nekschot bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a posthumous reckoning with Theo van Gogh. Although he judged the cartoonist as merely provocative, he pointed to his obvious relationship in style and real life with the murdered filmmaker. While Europe celebrated its May 1968 heritage, he saw the Netherlands turning its head the other way. He documented the way in which Christian politicians within a few weeks after the murder of Van Gogh changed the issue from the filmmakers very real slit throat to the virtual wounds of the religious soul. He agreed that there should be a limit to free speech, but only when it incites hate or violence. He refrained from a personal opinion whether such was the case with Gregorius Nekschot, but said he had been informed by (unnamed) specialists that this was not the case. The Nekschot-affair thus became 'a serious incident, without precedent' in modern times, associating the Netherlands with regimes for which works of art are threatening. Following the weekend Trouw on Monday May 26, 2008 offered a third of a page to Thomas Mertens, a professor at both the Nijmegen and Leiden universities in 'theory and philosophy of the law' and 'human rights and obligations.' Mertens, reacting to both the Nekschot and Jonas Staal affairs, shared with his readers his surprise at so many defending some absolute right to speak freely. He said this belief in 'free speech' was legally undefendable and in this case very likely abused to serve a wish to discredit a certain minority in society. Defending justice minister Hirsch Ballin he said the government was held to protect 'the good standing and rights' of this minority. NRC Handelsblad the same day, in a twist, had one of its illustrators comment in words instead of pictures, actually writing that life for Dutch cartoonists was made too easy in a world with absolute freedom of speech. Also he believed they used too many words in their cartoons and should concentrate on the drawing, being less explicit. Cyprian Koscielniak, a Pole by birth, drew on his fifteen years of experience as an illustrator in a country with a communist regime. Naturally, he said, he was not in favor of censorship. de Volkskrant on May 28, 2008 informed us that the liberal VVD party would be turning its parliament offices into an art gallery for 'freethinkers'. Gregorius Nekschot had agreed to an exhibition. =Weekly magazines (2)= In Out of range, a supposedly new series about censorship, Rudi Kagie reveals a name that may be the real identity of Gregorius Nekschot. He considers the dilemma that this name had asked him not even to quote him as 'not being Gregorius Nekschot'. But Kagie points out his own freedom of speech to share with us the name, which is not repeated here. (Vrij Nederland, May 31, 2008). Becoming rich in Dubai is the cover story of HP/De Tijd of May 30, 2008 in which two articles deal with the arrested critic of Muslims trying their luck in the Netherlands. One is an interview with Esther Gasseling of Nekschots publisher Xtra telling us which bookshops are, and which are not selling his books. The other is an interview with influential philosofer Paul Cliteur. He thinks the cartoons ask legitimate questions. He objects to the 'blaming ourselves' habit of the Dutch, even quoting the queen's Christmas message after the Van Gogh murder in which she said on equal terms that 'extremism in both word and deed' was dividing the country. As long as people didn't call for violence you should allow them their speech. He agreed however with interviewer Boudewijn Geels that one could expect politicians to be a little more careful. Geert Wilders, he believed, was learning. The real problem was that the MP could not live without security measures. Political reactions Immediately after the arrest, justice minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin, a Christian-Democrat, was criticized by a large part of parliament for the arrest. He also found opposition from within his own Christian community.Dutch cartoonist arrested on suspicion of violating hate speech laws with artwork ; Furore over Cartoonist Arrested for Discrimination ; Nekschot beledigt geen gelovigen (\\"Nekschot does not insult believers\\"; a Christian view). In an emergency debate in parliament on May 20, 2008, Hirsch Ballin expressed his support for the prosecutor but criticized the lengthy detention of the cartoonist. A majority within parliament, including the parties supporting the government, considered the manner in which the arrest was made 'disproportionate'. The minister denied accusations made by members of the opposition that the arrest was politically motivated. The decision to prosecute was made by the prosecutor and not as the result of government policy, said the minister. The minister confirmed, however, that he had been in contact with the office of the prosecutor at whose initiative the investigation was started.Zaak-Nekschot zint Kamer niet in Het Parool May 21, 2008, pg 5. On May 21, 2008 the popular and largest Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf headed an article about parliament's condemnation of the arrest with a quote of a right wing member of parliament comparing it to practices in former East-Germany. De Volkskrant, the same morning, mentioned near disbelief within the left wing GroenLinks party that the prosecutor's office had needed three years to establish the identity of Nekschot. MP De Wit from the socialist SP party suggested that the justice minister was seeking retribution for parliament's recent opposition to new legislation on profanity. De minister denied any relation. Attacks on authorities In cartoons and satire that was published on his website one month before his arrest Gregorius Nekschot directed his creativity at the justice minister, the prime minister and the government chief terrorism official. Writing with another pseudonym, as Dolf Histler, he accused the justice minister of not being able to achieve much in the field of crime fighting and the cabinet of Christians and social democrats of prime minister Balkenende of religious mania. In a cartoon a naked prime minister is being depicted as 'in touch' with the darker side of public opinion through his 'mighty organ', being the government chief terrorism official as a tapeworm awaiting orders. In another cartoon, once more the prime minister is drawn as praying five times a week in front of a circumcised penis or lingam while wearing a fake beard and a djellaba. Cartoons described The following cartoon was immediately after the arrest published in newspapers as being part of the eight that the prosecutor considered to be a crime: * Now too a monument for the slavery of the white Dutch taxpayer, shows a chained white man, on a pedestal titled Kingdom of the Netherlands, carrying a very large black baby on his back. The cartoon appears to react to a debate about the meaning of a slavery monument for the descendants of slaves from Surinam and the Dutch Antilles. Another interpretation, is that the cartoon joins a recent debate in Parliament about the financial burden of the Dutch Caribbean islands.Aernout Nieuwenhuis as quoted in De Volkskrant 21 May 2008, p. 4. On May 21, 2008 the morning paper de Volkskrant confirmed the previous cartoon as being one of the eight cartoons liable to prosecution, and added two cartoons to the list on the authority of Nekschot himself: * Ali sits comfortably on his pouffe. An elderly gentleman wearing a tie and fez informs us that nowhere in the Koran it reads that one is supposed to give something in return for thirty years of disability benefits, child support and housing subsidies. Nekschot later commented that his intention had been to show that religion stands in the way of complete participation of immigrants in society.'Ideologie leidt tot onheil' by Thieu Vaessen in HP/De Tijd, May 23, 2008, pg 27-29. * Left wing Dutch unrelentingly optimistic, depicts a black youth wearing a baseball cap the wrong way round pointing two guns at the head of an elderly Dutch anarchist demanding cash money. The Dutchman looks at us and informs us: 'its only the second generation'. The cartoon comments on a general belief among many citizens that problems will evaporate with the generations. However, there has been a motion in parliament for special treatment of young people arriving from the island of Cura√ßao, by sending them back to the island when they embark on a criminal career. Some facts behind these ideas may be supported by government statistics that actually analyze much information for different groups in society. An issue in defending the cartoonist in an opinion in NRCHandelsblad (May 20, 2008) was that Nekschot was not judged to attribute purely fictional negative qualities to his antagonists and they did not represent the group but only certain types within that group. Publication of all eight cartoons in HP/De Tijd magazine in their May 23, 2008 issue titled 'Nekschot fires back' added the missing five: * Muslim Democratic Party presents logo. A Muslim presents not a T-shirt but a burqa with the letters MDP and the silouette of a bearded person copulating with a goat. The insult that Muslims, many of whom arrived in the Netherlands from provincial areas, had sexual intercourse with animals was frequently used by Theo van Gogh as a provocative image. Nekschot's Misselijke Grappen includes a cartoon of the Christian prime minister having intercourse with a cow in some provincial area of The Netherlands. * Ali el Wakkie performs Islamic charity. A bearded man in eskimo or perhaps father Christmas clothes is having intercourse with a polar bear and tells us it is his duty to help the bear with an obstipation problem. * Mrs Ouroubourou, born Klapstra. An elderly and very much beaten-up woman, using a crutch, finds that the Dutch too should adjust and that receiving a few hits is educational. The woman who is apparently married to a Muslim refers to a view sometimes expressed, and published by Joris Luyendijk, that a good Muslim sometimes beats his wife. * Why young Muslims identify with Palestinians. A young man with a baseball cap worn the wrong way round and with a Smiley on the front of his jacket explains with his hands in his pockets:'loitering..., no school..., no homework..., provoking police..., benefits...' * The Christmas-Imam wishes you a blessed holiday and.... A bearded man with father Christmas clothes, without pants, finishes the sentence while having sexual intercourse with a goat: 'a happy 1426', a reference to the Islamic calendar. Other cartoons stayed available on the cartoonists website and could thus be considered as not being part of the eight supposedly criminal ones. However, Nekschot reported that police had shown him older cartoons and that he felt they had acted for political reasons on a dossier they had prepared a while ago.

Background William McIntyre was the 5th son and 7th child of Duncan McIntyre and Catherine Kennedy, who were sheep farmers in the parish of Kilmonivaig, Scotland near Spean Bridge. He was proficient in Latin and Greek when he commenced at the University of Glasgow in 1823. He graduated MA in 1829, completed Divinity in 1832, and was licensed by the Presbytery of Dunoon. He taught in a Glasgow school conducted by his older brother Allan and was recruited for Australia by Dr John Dunmore Lang, who heard him preach in Greenock in 1837. He was ordained for Australia with his friend James Forbes on 29 June 1837 by the Church of Scotland Presbytery of Glasgow. He was appointed Chaplain to some 260 immigrants on the Midlothian, which left Portree, Skye on 7 August 1837 and arrived in Sydney 12 December 1837. Early Australian ministry McIntyre was the first Gaelic- speaking minister in Australia and the immigrants who came out on the Midlothian mainly spoke that language. Lang falsely represented to Governor Gipps that Lord Glenelg had given public assurances that they would be allowed to settle as a group, which was contrary to the usual policy. Most became occupiers of small but productive farms on Andrew Lang's estate on the Paterson River. Particularly from 1857 they began to move north as new lands were opened and formed the nucleus of most of the congregations that adhered to the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia minority which remained outside the general Presbyterian union of 1864/65. McIntyre joined Lang's Synod in January 1838, taught at Lang's Australian College, and acted as Lang's locum tenens while Lang was overseas from January 1839 to March 1841. He facilitated the union of Lang's Synod and the Presbytery which was accomplished in October 1840. McIntyre was called to Maitland in 1840, but was only settled there in September 1841 following a second call. On 3 April 1844 he was married to Mary McIntyre (1786-1872), the sister and heir of Peter McIntyre (1783-1842) by James Forbes. They made the Pitnacree Estate at east Maitland their home. Peter's estate exclusive of runs and licence for over of land was sworn at not less than ¬£25,000, so Mary was exceedingly wealthy. There were no children and most of the money found its way into church and charitable causes in due time. Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia McIntyre led those who protested and withdrew to form the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia in October 1846. He partly financed the first PCEA church in Sydney, the old Pitt Street Congregational Church purchased in 1846. A brick church still existing was opened in Free Church Street, Maitland in 1849. McIntyre was anxious to see a thoroughly orthodox and evangelistic Church but was hampered by the difficulty of securing recruits prior to the discovery of Gold in 1851 and the tensions between Highlanders and Lowlanders. In 1854 he recruited his brother Allan and James McCulloch, who had married McIntyre's niece, for the PCEA ministry. McIntyre removed to St George's Church, Castlereagh Street, Sydney and was inducted 20 February 1862. He served without stipend and saw the debt of ¬£12,000 reduced to ¬£5,000 by the time of his death. Literary and educational work McIntyre supervised the training of the first locally trained Presbyterian minister (J.S. White, ordained by the Synod of Australia in 1847). He edited Lang's newspaper The Colonist during the latter's absence overseas in 1839-40. He conducted a fortnightly paper, The Voice in the Wilderness (1846-1852). His major literary work was an Exposition of the Sermon on the Mount, published in Edinburgh in 1854. He established the high school of Maitland in 1855, took a number of classes, including classics, acted as headmaster without payment (1857‚Äì59) and made the school one of the best in New South Wales. As well as a number of booklets and pamphlets, McIntyre published The Testimony monthly (1865‚Äì70) until shortly before his death. Attitude to Church Union Scottish attitudes to colonial church union changed in 1857 and those of Free Church sympathy who stood apart from the union in Victoria in 1859 were refused recognition by the Free Church of Scotland in 1860 and 1861. McIntyre therefore contemplated union of New South Wales Presbyterians and thought he had secured a satisfactory basis in November 1863; it was certainly a better crafted basis than in Victoria. However, some of his natural Gaelic constituency would not contemplate union with those allied to the Established Church of Scotland. Those in Maclean seceded in December 1863. McIntyre ultimately became convinced that while in theory the basis was satisfactory the use which the unionists planned to make of it was not. By receiving ministers from the various Scottish churches on an equal footing, the church became complicit in practical involvement in the errors of the Established Church, he held, and therefore compromised the PCEA testimony against Erastianism. He considered that this signalled an approach to truth that seemed capable of extension to other doctrines of the Westminster Confession of Faith. Ultimately 5 of the 22 PCEA ministers continued outside the union accomplished 1864/65, and several united who were not really in favour. The still-maintained practice of a capella psalmody in the PCEA was not regarded as an issue of principle on the level of the Erastian issue by McIntyre and his colleagues. He was an able man, a solid if not winsome preacher. He was a man of firm principles of whom Sir Samuel Griffith, one time Premier of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, wrote: \\"On the whole he was a remarkable man, and his name deserves to be remembered as one of the foremost worthies of New South Wales.\\"Rev.

It is located in the Limar√≠ Province, Region of Coquimbo, at an elevation of 900 m (2,952 ft). It is known for the tourist astronomic observatory Cruz del Sur; the petroglyphs of Rincon las Chilcas; its typical handcraft made of the unique combarbalita stone; the classical basketball match at the end February; the Virgen de la Piedra catholic-pagan festivity, among other tourist attractions. Origin of the name There are two hypotheses that might to explain the origin of the name \\"Combarbal√°\\". Both hypothesis are rooted in the Spanish transliteration of the aborigine name of the area. The first hypothesis holds that the word Combarbal√° is derived from the Quechua word \\"Cumparpayay\\", which means \\"to break with a hammer\\", and designates the usual labor for obtaining minerals and stones from mines.Collao J. Historia de Combarbala. 1990 The second hypothesis holds that the origin of the word Combarbal√° comes from the Mapudungun word \\"Co Cam Bala\\", where \\"Co\\" means Water, \\"Cam\\" means Far, and \\"Bala\\" means Duck. Thus, Cocambala literally means \\"far away water with ducks\\", or Duck's pond. In fact, there is a place known as Duck's pond very near to the city. This pond was used as a resting place by the Inca army in their advance to the south, and then by the Spanish conquistadores Diego de Almagro first, and later by Pedro de Valdivia. People of Combarbal√° likes to make jokes about the name of the city: they hold that an aborigine of the area, who was named \\"La\\", left to travel with the Spaniards. \\"La\\" got used to shaving his face and returned with a dense beard, something unusual because South American aborigines don't grow beards. Because of this, people named the area as the place where \\"Con-Barba-La\\" ‚Äîliterally with-beard-La or bearded La‚Äîlived. This history is told for the amusement of children's during the celebration of the city foundation anniversary. History = Prehispanic= The geographical area where Combarbal√° is located was originally populated by Molle, Diaguita and Inca people. Molle people were the first to inhabit the area. The Molle people were hunter-gatherers, although they also practiced some primal forms of agriculture. They inhabited the area from c. 400 BCE to c. 900 CE Their origins are still unknown, although some hypothesis trace them back to the Amazon Rainforest, coming through what is now Bolivia to the Atacama and Coquimbo regions of Chile. The Diaguita people arrived to the area c. 700 CE, about three hundred years after the Molle people. They crossed from Argentina through one of the several summer passages in the Andes mountain range. They practiced advanced forms of agriculture, pottery, stone work, weaving and metallurgy, mainly based on copper and bronze). They also carved figures in stone known as petroglyphs. These petroglyphs are believed to represent the cosmology of the Diaguita people.Alvarez J. Combarbal√°. Astronom√≠a y Arqueolog√≠a. 2008 Nowadays, a number of these archeological treasures can be found in the area of Rinc√≥n las Chilcas. The Inca conquerors arrived c. 1450 CE. It is believed that the conquest was peaceful, and mainly affected cultural aspects. They extended the Inca roads in the area, and practiced advanced forms of mining and agriculture. =Spanish Conquest and Colony= The failed expedition of Diego de Almagro arrived in the area in c. 1536. As it is known, they returned shortly after to Peru, empty handed. After that, the expedition of Pedro de Valdivia arrived to the area c. 1541. They found the valley mostly uninhabited, because most of the indigenous people were hiding in the hills. The indigenous were already afraid of Spaniards, because of the deeds of Almagro and his people. The first Spanish chronologist recording the name of \\"Cocambala\\" valley was Jeronimo de Vivar. He wrote: \\"It rains more heavier and more in summer (than Copiap√≥)... there are good rivers in this area\\". He described the number of inhabitants as \\"Not too many people\\". Before the official foundation of the town, the life there was characterized for being extremely hard. The first census showed that the overall population of the area (Combarbal√°, Cogot√≠ and Pama) was 240 people, distributed across 60 families. Most of the activities were related to farming and shepherding. In 1757, the overall population was around 1,140 people. That same year, Bishop Manuel de Alday established the vice-Parish in the area. In 1774, this was advanced to parish status. Later, on March 3, 1789, neighbors of the area ask the Spanish governor, Ambrosio O'Higgins, to establish a church in the area. This finally happened on November 30, 1789. The original name of the city was \\"Villa de San Francisco de Borja de Combarbal√°\\". The foundation was done by Captain Juan Ignacio Flores, under the authority of governor and later viceroy, Ambrosio O'Higgins. At the beginning of the 18th century, mines of copper, gold and silver were discovered in the area. Thus, Combarbal√° became an important mining center. However, during the mid 80's, the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet dismantled the mineral processing plant that operated in the city, thus ending the era of mining wealth, and putting the city into an era of economic uncertainty. Lately on the 90's, and thanks to techniques of dry areas irrigation, growing of export- grade grapes have become the main economical activity, but only generating seasonal employment. Geography Combarbal√° commune is located in the geographical area known as transversal valleys of central Chile. These are valleys that run perpendicularly from the Andes mountain range to the Coastal mountain range. The city is located right next to Combarbal√° River, and the valley lies in between the Cogot√≠ River valley to the north and the Valle Hermoso (Beautiful Valley) to the south. Those three are the main transversal valleys found in the commune. Some important heights located in the commune of Combarbal√° are: * Pabell√≥n Hill: AMSL. * Chaguareche Hill: AMSL. * Ramadilla Hill: AMSL. * Movilo Hill: AMSL. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Combarbal√° spans an area of and has 13,483 inhabitants (6,695 men and 6,788 women). Of these, 5,494 (40.7%) lived in urban areas and 7,989 (59.3%) in rural areas. The population fell by 6.3% (899 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Combarbal√° is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Solercio Rojas Aguirre (PRI). The council has the following members: * Miguel O√±ate Collado (RN) * Gustavo Hern√°ndez V. (PPD) * Claudio Bravo Gallardo (PS) * Bernardita Cort√©s G√≥mez (PDC) * Miguel Viera Flores (PRI) * Hugo Galleguillos Cort√©s (Ind.) Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Combarbal√° is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mrs. Adriana Mu√±oz (PDC) and Mr. Luis Lemus (Ind.) as part of the 9th electoral district, (together with Punitaqui, Monte Patria, Illapel, Salamanca, Los Vilos, Canela). The commune is represented in the Senate by Evelyn Matthei Fornet (UDI) and Jorge Pizarro Soto (PDC) as part of the 4th senatorial constituency (Coquimbo Region). On January 2011, Evelyn Matthei abandoned its elected senatorial position and it was replaced by Gonzalo Uriarte. Climate Combarbal√°'s climate is semi-arid, with a relative humidity around 50%. Summer temperatures range from with the much cooler nights typical of desert climates. Winter temperatures are generally above freezing, the minimum being ~. Most of the year it is clear and sunny. Annual rainfall is about 200 mm, but long droughts and heavy rains are not rare in the region. The vegetation found in the commune is typical of the area climate, adapted to the dryness and low relative humidity of the climate. Predominating species are in most of the area are different types of cacti, hawthorns and carob trees. However, in the valleys, near the rivers, is possible to find more water-demanding species, like Eucalyptus and Weeping Willows. Cogoti Dam in the Commune of Combarbal√° Rivers in the area are fed by two main sources: rain and melting snow. Because of this, their levels rise at least twice a year: in winter due to rains, and in summer due to snow melting. In a normal year, rains can be up to 200 mm. But periods of drought or heavy raining are not uncommon. There are a number of small rivers that come down from the Andes mountain chain, which tribute their water to the three main rivers in the commune: Combarbal√°, Cogot√≠ and Pama. All of them end at the Cogot√≠ dam, which has a capacity of 150 million cubic meters (~39 billion gallons). From there, it flows into the Guatulame River and then to La Paloma dam in the commune of Monte Patria. Economic activities For almost two centuries, Combarbal√°'s main economic activity has been mining of copper, gold and silver. However, due to Pinochet dictatorship systematic dismantlement of small and medium mining, these activities have been greatly diminished not only in Combarbal√°, but also in the rest of Chile. Besides mining, other activities such as agriculture, goat shepherding, and craft work of Combarbalita stone have become important productive activities. There are a number of artisans in the area that work with the stone and produce a variety of decorative and utilitarian objects. Goat cheese is also a famous product of the zone, and export-grade grape production has become the main agricultural activity, with the only caveat that it produces seasonal work. Combarbal√° is served by La Pelicana Airport, an airstrip to the north. Tourism There are a variety of tourist attractions in the area. The main ones are: Southern Cross Astronomical Oservatory The tourist astronomical observatory is open to the general public. It has four main domes, each equipped with a potent telescope. Tours are held that gudie the tourist through the astronomy in Chile, ancient astronomical beliefs of other cultures, and an observation of planets and stars through any of the four main telescopes. La Isla religious festivals On the first Sunday in May, Catholics participate in the traditional religious celebration of the Virgin of the Stone, in the town of La Isla, located 22 kilometers from the city of Combarbal√°. Thousands of pilgrims demonstrate their devotion by climbing the hill were the stone virgin is located. various interesting aspects of the Inca-Catholic mixture are present in this festivity, as in others through the north of Chile. Among these, are: payment of \\"mandas\\". which are commitments between the virgin and the pilgrim, were the virgin grants some wish, and the pilgrim pays with physical, usually painful, acts (e.g. climbing the hill on the knees). Another interesting aspect of the festivity are the \\"religious dances\\", which are Inca in origin, but nowadays represent the mixture between indigenous and Catholic beliefs. In these dances, groups of men, women and children dance in columns, dressed in non-traditional outfits (e.g. gypsies. red skins), while are followed by a band composed of different types of drums, and sometimes different kinds of flutes. Petroglyphs Petroglyphs were ubiquitous in the area and remain as part of the Diaguita heritage. Unfortunately, most of them were stolen by unscrupulous \\"private collectionists\\". Nowadays, despite the lack of a defined protection policy, they can be found mainly in the areas of Rinc√≥n Las Chilcas, Ramadilla and Pama. The main motivations in these carved stones are cosmology of Diaguita people and their religious ceremonies. El Clasico In February, Combarbala lives a unique event: El Cl√°sico. Two of the city's sports, culture and social Clubs, \\"Los Loros\\" and \\"Union Juvenil\\", dispute the title of the city championship. Even there is no trophy or cash reward, during the whole summer, the people of Combarbal√° and the visitors are divided, belonging to one of the two clubs. Although club membership is determined by family and heritage, often young people challenge their parents' affiliation, and switch clubs. At the end of February, both clubs confront each other in sport and cultural activities that decide the triumph of one the clubs. This is decided after an exciting basketball game which usually starts after a theatrical play and a cheerleaders presentation by each club. It is not an unusual that the game can start at 1 am and ends around 4 am. After the match, both winners and losers celebrate until the dawn in their respective club houses. Because of this, it is also known as \\"The Night Combarbal√° doesn't sleep\\". Usually the score is only a few points difference.

After graduating from Maywood Avenue School, approximately 250 students in public school for ninth through twelfth grades had attended Hackensack High School in Hackensack, as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Hackensack Public Schools, together with students from Rochelle Park and South Hackensack. In the wake of rising tuition costs assessed by the Hackensack district, the district has considered a plan under which the relationship with Hackensack would be severed and a new sending relationship would be established with other neighboring districts. In March 2020, the district received approval from the New Jersey Department of Education to end the relationship it had established with Hackensack in 1969 and will begin transitioning incoming ninth graders to Henry P. Becton Regional High School, which serves students from Carlstadt and East Rutherford beginning in the 2020‚Äì21 school year. The transition would be complete after the final group of twelfth graders graduates from Hackensack High School at the end of the 2023‚Äì24 school year.

R√∂ssler was awarded his MD in 1966. After postdoctoral studies at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Bavaria, and a visiting appointment at the Center for Theoretical Biology at SUNY-Buffalo, in 1969 he became Professor for Theoretical Biochemistry at the University of T√ºbingen. In 1994, he became Professor of Chemistry by decree.Collaborator profile, ATOMOSYD research group, accessed 2012-04-21.. R√∂ssler has held visiting positions at the University of Guelph (Mathematics) in Canada, the Center for Nonlinear Studies of the University of California at Los Alamos, the University of Virginia (Chemical Engineering), the Technical University of Denmark (Theoretical Physics), and the Santa Fe Institute (Complexity Research) in New Mexico. Research R√∂ssler has authored hundreds of scientific papers in fields as wide-ranging as biogenesis, the origin of language, differentiable automata, chaotic attractors, endophysics, micro relativity, artificial universes, the hypertext encyclopedia, and world-changing technology. His most heavily cited publication is the 1976 paper. in which he studied what is now known as the R√∂ssler attractor, a system of three linked differential equations that exhibit chaotic dynamics... R√∂ssler discovered his system after a series of exchanges with Arthur Winfree as detailed by . Advocacy R√∂ssler and his wife Reimara have been involved with a long-running series of disputes with their employer, the University of T√ºbingen, which they accuse of discrimination and of violations of academic freedom.Wolf Schmidt: Der Prophet des Planetentods die tageszeitung, 8 September 2008 In 1988, Reimara R√∂ssler, a professor of medicine, was transferred to a different department within the university; in protest, she began working from home. The state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg sued her for failure to perform her assigned duties, as a result of which by 1996 she lost her job and was forced to give up a second home to refund her back pay. Meanwhile, in 1993 and 1994, Otto R√∂ssler had been assigned to teach an introductory chemistry course according to the prescribed curriculum for medical students, but insisted instead on teaching his own material. After he was replaced in the course by another lecturer, he continued trying to give the lectures himself, and was removed by police several times. Because of these incidents, in 1995 a state official tried to force R√∂ssler to undergo psychological tests, but after international protests by many academics this plan was dropped. R√∂ssler continued protesting against his and his wife's treatment by the university and in August 2001 he was caught defacing the university auditorium with spray paint in an attempt to draw attention to his protests..... In June 2008, R√∂ssler publicly criticized the Large Hadron Collider experiment supervised by CERN in Geneva and was involved in a failed lawsuit to halt it. He argued that the experiment could plausibly generate dangerous miniature black holes that could bring about the end of the world. Hermann Nicolai, director of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics' quantum gravity division, later described R√∂ssler's arguments as being \\"... based on an elementary misunderstanding of the theory of general relativity\\".. R√∂ssler has also been an honorary editor of the journal Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, which came under fire in 2009 for allegedly publishing papers without as strict peer review as would be expected for a scientific journal. In a subsequent libel suit brought by former journal editor Mohammed El Naschie in response to this criticism, R√∂ssler testified on behalf of El Naschie, stating in court about peer review that \\"if you have something new to offer, peer review is dangerous\\", adding that in such cases \\"peer review delays progress in science\\"..

He is most famous as a writer for the TV series The Avengers, but he also authored or co-authored eleven novels. He was a former medical doctor, pilot, engineer and computer designer.  Biography  Woodhouse was born in Romford and was educated at Salisbury Cathedral School and Oundle. He read Natural Sciences at Downing College, Cambridge from 1951, and Medicine at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, completing his postgraduate research at the Medical Research Council's applied psychology unit in Cambridge (where he built \\"Lettuce\\", a logical truth computer). In 1959 Woodhouse was called up for National Service and worked with the Royal Air Force at the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine, and then at the Farnborough Radar Research Establishment - RRE. After being discharged from military service Woodhouse worked as an author of novels and screen plays, a computer programmer and a stock trader.  Bibliography  = Writing style = Martin Woodhouse wrote in the techno-thriller style before the category had been well defined as a subgenre. The publication in 1966 of his first novel, Tree Frog, preceded that of Michael Crichton's breakthrough novel, The Andromeda Strain by several years. What epitomises Woodhouse's stories is that the hero is a Man of Science in the broadest sense, who thwarts his opponents using wits and expertise, applying craft of all kinds; rather than relying on brawn, skill at arms, or dogged detective work (cf. the portrayal of Leonardo da Vinci in his Medici trilogy). Woodhouse's writing is filled with very dry, humorous prose. Protagonists tend to be very intelligent, sarcastic, and unimpressed with authority figures. Many of his books are filled with details that reflect his background in engineering and medicine. = Books by publication date = * Tree Frog (1966) * Rock Baby (a.k.a. Bush Baby) (1968) * Phil and Me (1970) * Mama Doll (1972) * Blue Bone (1973) * Medici Guns (1974) * Medici Emerald (1976) * Moon Hill (1976) * The Remington Set (1976) * Medici Hawks (1978) * Traders (1980) = Books by series =  Giles Yeoman  Woodhouse wrote a series of techno-thriller novels about Giles Yeoman, an aeronautical engineer who is a reluctant participant in a variety of cloak-and-dagger exploits conducted by the British intelligence community. The plot of each book revolves around the military or intelligence applications of some new some form of technology, and Yeoman's efforts to make sure that this technology doesn't fall into the hands of his opponents. Woodhouse's descriptions show the sort of attention to technical detail that would be expected from his work as an engineer for the RAF. *Tree Frog (1966) ‚Äì This is a novel about the 1960s cold war arms race to develop long range reconnaissance drones. The action takes place in many locales, but much of it is set in Britain and Libya. The book's descriptions of aircraft control systems are clearly informed by Woodhouse's real life work on the target acquisition and guidance systems for early variants of the RAF's Bloodhound SAM *Bush Baby (1968) ‚Äì This novel focuses on seismographs that England has illegally deployed in east block nations to try and gain information on nuclear tests. Yeoman must track down some of this equipment in the mountains of Yugoslavia to see if it has been discovered and modified to send false data. Published in the United States as Rock Baby. *Mama Doll (1972) ‚Äì Contemporary with The Terminal Man, the novel explores advanced brain surgery, and how electronic implants might be used to influence behaviour. Yeoman, himself recovering from a head injury, uses his knowledge of electronics as he tries to track down a missing cache of weapons. *Blue Bone (1973) ‚Äì The plot revolves around a scientist who is being held against his will in East Germany because he will not reveal the details of a new high strength composite plastic he has created. Yeoman is sent in to rescue the scientist, and his engineering background allows him to devise a creative MacGyver-like method of escape. *Moon Hill (1976) ‚Äì A now wealthy Giles Yeoman tries to develop a technology to prevent a volcano from erupting and destroying a city. Again, Woodhouse ‚Äì who was living in Montserrat while writing the Medici books ‚Äì draws plot elements from his personal experience.  Leonardo da Vinci  Woodhouse and co-author Robert Ross wrote three novels about Leonardo da Vinci. They focus on his work as a military engineer in the service of the Duke of Milan. Leonardo is depicted as a clever, sarcastic Italian Renaissance engineer who doubts the supremacy of the Catholic Church. Many details in these books are historically based, but large portions of the stories depend upon ideas from Leonardo's sketch books being developed into functional machines. This places the novels in the alternate history or Steampunk genre. *The Medici Guns (1974) ‚Äì Leonardo develops and oversees the use of light artillery and geometry to help Lorenzo de' Medici's army of Florence end a siege at Castlemonte. *The Medici Emerald (1976) ‚Äì Leonardo da Vinci's mistress is captured by the Venetians. To save her ‚Äì and the city of Florence ‚Äì he must decipher a message inscribed on an emerald. *The Medici Hawks (1978) ‚Äì Muslim invaders try to conquer Italy. Leonardo helps to drive them away by building functional kite-gliders as seen in his sketch books. = Other novels = *Phil and Me (1970) *The Remington Set (1976) ‚Äì An English crime novel published under the pen name John Charlton. *Traders (1980) ‚Äì A novel about an Afghan prince who profits greatly as an arms trader  Screenwriter  Woodhouse wrote the screenplays of seven episodes of the TV series The Avengers. He also wrote for several British TV series such as The Protectors, Emerald Soup, The Hidden Truth, and The Man in Room 17. He also wrote most of the screenplays for the 1961 season of the marionette TV show Supercar in partnership with his younger brother Hugh, and in 1960 two episodes of a similar show for children Four Feather Falls. He is believed to have written in excess of seventy screenplays. = The Avengers episodes = * A Chorus of Frogs (1962) * Mr. Teddy Bear (1962) * The Golden Eggs (1962) * The Big Thinker (1962) * Second Sight (1963) * The Wringer (1964) * A Sense of History (1965) = The Hidden Truth episodes = * The Guinea Pig (1964) * Cause of Death (1964) = Supercar episodes = * Rescue * Amazonian Adventure * Talisman of Sargon * False Alarm * What Goes Up * Keep It Cool * Grounded * Jungle Hazard * High Tension * A Little Art * Ice Fall * Island Incident * The Tracking of Masterspy * Phantom Piper * Deep Seven * Pirate Plunder * Flight of Fancy * Hostage * The Sunken Temple * Trapped in the Depths * The Dragon of Ho Meng * Magic Carpet * The White Line  References  * Martin Woodhouse interview at Cinema Retro *Martin Woodhouse website Martin Woodhouse biography * List of books by Woodhouse * Leonardo's military inventions * Leonardo's resume * Woodhouse Filmography at MSN * Supercar Episode List * Obituary of Martin Woodhouse, The Daily Telegraph, 1 August, 2011 1932 births 2011 deaths Alumni of Downing College, Cambridge English screenwriters English male screenwriters Royal Air Force officers People educated at Oundle School People educated at Salisbury Cathedral School People from Romford English male novelists 20th-century English novelists 20th-century British male writers ","title":"Martin Woodhouse"},{"id":"4968144","text":"Robert and Virginia Manry aboard Curlew Robert and Virginia Manry aboard Curlew Curlew in 2017 Tinkerbelle at the Western Reserve Historical Museum in 2017 Robert Manry (June 2, 1918 ‚Äì February 21, 1971) was a copy editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer who in 1965 sailed from Falmouth, Massachusetts, to Falmouth, Cornwall, England, in a tiny sailboat (an Old Town \\"Whitecap\\" built by the Old Town Canoe Co. of Old Town, Maine, which he had extensively modified for the voyage) named Tinkerbelle. Beginning on June 1, 1965, and ending on August 17, the voyage lasted 78 days. At the time, Tinkerbelle was the shortest but not the smallest boat to make a non-stop trip across the Atlantic Ocean (till today the smallest is Lindemann's folding kayak). Manry later wrote about the voyage and its preparation in his book Tinkerbelle, in which the sailor expressed shock and surprise at the huge crowds and armada of small boats that greeted his arrival in Cornwall. After completing his voyage on Tinkerbelle, Robert purchased Curlew, a 1967 Tartan 27 Yawl. He then set out with his wife, son, daughter, German shepherd, and cat on a cruise from Cleveland, Ohio through the Great Lakes, down, the Mississippi river, through the Gulf to the Bahamas, up the east coast of the US and ultimately back to Cleveland.

It was founded in 1980 when the surrounding area was developed from fruit orchards into housing estates. The school services Wantirna and Wantirna South, as well as parts of Boronia, and Bayswater. Approximately 1250 students are enrolled at the college in addition to approximately 85 teaching and 30 non-teaching staff. The school offers a comprehensive curriculum for students studying years seven through to twelve, which includes the Victorian Certificate of Education for students in years ten to twelve and Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning for students in years 11 and 12. History The college was founded in 1980 when the surrounding area was developed from orchards to housing estates for potential middle class residents. The nearest high schools at the time were Vermont, Highvale and Bayswater. The establishment of Wantirna College catered for this urban growth. In 1980, only Year 7 was available; in 1981, both Year 7 and 8 were available, and in subsequent years another year level was added until the school finally reached its full strength with Year 12 commencing in 1985. Construction has been a frequent sight at the college with facilities for students being built or improved. 2001 additions include a new VCE Study/Common Room with kitchen and computer facilities which opened in May 2006, an expanded music area which opened in April 2004 along with new lockers, G block classrooms and a library a few years earlier. Recently, the college completed additional construction projects in a bid to make the college facilities similar to those available in United States public high schools. These facilities include the new Senior Year General Learning block and the refurbishment of the existing Year 7 Learning Centre. These buildings comprise classrooms, IT labs, collaborative learning spaces and staff-rooms. A new cafeteria includes indoor dining and substantial commercial kitchen facilities (now operated by an external party). Construction incorporated a new Theatre including rehearsal rooms, storage areas, control rooms and car parking. Extensive landscape, both hard and soft, was also completed, plus a pool was built in 2015. There works were carried out simultaneously on multiple sites within the school grounds. Transport The college is serviced by the public 738 bus route, which runs between Westfield Knox and Mitcham railway station runs every 30 minutes during peak and every hour off-peak. There are also public chartered school buses which service the college before and after school each day. There is also a small staff car park adjacent to the college. The majority of students travel to and from school by either walking or via private vehicles. Smaller numbers of students catch public buses or cycle.

Bill Drummond (alias King Boy D) and Jimmy Cauty (alias Rockman Rock) began by releasing hip hop-inspired and sample-heavy records as the JAMs. As the Timelords, they recorded the British number-one single \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" and documented the process of making a hit record in a book, The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way). As the KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered stadium house and ambient house. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world in 1991. From the outset, the KLF adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novels The Illuminatus! Trilogy, making anarchic situationist manifestations, including the defacement of billboard adverts, the posting of cryptic advertisements in NME magazine and the mainstream press, and unusual performances on Top of the Pops. In collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror at the BRIT Awards in February 1992, they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance pre-announced The KLF's departure from the music business and, in May of that year, they deleted their entire back catalogue. With the KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the K Foundation and sought to subvert the art world, staging an alternative art award for the Worst Artist of The Year and burning one million pounds sterling. Although Drummond and Cauty remained true to their word of May 1992 ‚Äì the KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the UK ‚Äì they have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, The One World Orchestra and most recently, in 1997, as 2K. The duo reappeared in 2017 as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, releasing a novel ‚Äì 2023 ‚Äì and rebooting an earlier campaign to build a \\"People's Pyramid\\". History =Background= Bill Drummond was an established figure within the British music industry, having co-founded Zoo Records, played guitar in the Liverpool band Big in Japan, and worked as manager of Echo & the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. Artist and musician Jimmy Cauty was the guitarist in the three-piece Brilliant ‚Äì an act that Drummond had signed to WEA Records and managed. In July 1986, Drummond resigned from his position as an A&R; man at record label WEA, citing that he was nearly 33‚Öì years old (33‚Öì revolutions per minute being the speed at which a vinyl LP revolves), and that it was \\"time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top\\". In the same year he released a solo LP, The Man. Drummond intended to focus on writing books once The Man had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, \\"That only lasted three months, until I had an[other] idea for a record and got dragged back into it all\\". Recalling that moment in a later interview, Drummond said that the plan came to him in an instant: he would form a hip-hop band with former colleague Cauty, and they would be called The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu: =The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu= Early in 1987, Drummond and Cauty's collaborations began. They assumed alter egos ‚Äì King Boy D and Rockman Rock respectively ‚Äì and adopted the name The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group \\"The Justified Ancients of Mummu\\" from The Illuminatus! Trilogy. The JAMs' primary instrument was the digital sampler with which they would plagiarise the history of popular music, cutting chunks from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, underpinned by rudimentary beatbox rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's raps, of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery. The JAMs' debut single \\"All You Need Is Love\\" dealt with the media coverage given to AIDS, sampling heavily from the Beatles' \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and Samantha Fox's \\"Touch Me (I Want Your Body)\\". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided white label 12\\" were sent to the music press; it received positive reviews and was made \\"single of the week\\" in Sounds. A later piece in the same magazine called The JAMs \\"the hottest, most exhilarating band this year .... It's hard to understand what it feels like to come across something you believe to be totally new; I have never been so wholeheartedly convinced that a band are so good and exciting.\\"\\"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\\", Sounds, 16 May 1987. The JAMs re-edited and re-released \\"All You Need Is Love\\" in May 1987, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples; lyrics from the song appeared as promotional graffiti, defacing selected billboards. The re-release rewarded the JAMs with praise (including NME¬¥s \\"single of the week\\") and the funds necessary to record their debut album. The album, 1987 (What the F**k Is Going On?), was released in June 1987. Included was a song called \\"The Queen and I\\", which sampled the ABBA single \\"Dancing Queen\\". After a legal showdown with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society,News item, Sounds, 12 September 1987 the 1987 album was forcibly withdrawn from sale. Drummond and Cauty travelled to Sweden in hope of meeting ABBA and coming to some agreement, taking an NME journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP. They failed to meet ABBA, so disposed of the copies by burning most of them in a field and throwing the rest overboard on the North Sea ferry trip home. In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they \\"felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified.\\" Two new singles followed on the JAMs' \\"KLF Communications\\" independent record label. Both reflected a shift towards house rhythms. According to NME, The JAMs' choice of samples for the first of these, \\"Whitney Joins The JAMs\\" saw them leaving behind their strategy of \\"collision course\\" to \\"move straight onto the art of super selective theft\\". The song uses samples of the Mission: Impossible and Shaft themes alongside Whitney Houston's \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\". Drummond has claimed that the KLF were later offered the job of producing or remixing a new Whitney Houston album as an inducement from her record label boss (Clive Davis of Arista Records) to sign with them. The second single in this sequence ‚Äì Drummond and Cauty's third and final single of 1987 ‚Äì was \\"Down Town\\", a dance record built around a gospel choir and \\"Downtown\\" by 1960s star Petula Clark.Reviewed by NME writer James Brown in the 28 November 1987 edition. These early works were later collected on the compilation album Shag Times. A second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, was released in early 1988. Who Killed The JAMs? earned the duo a five-star review from Sounds Magazine, who called it \\"a masterpiece of pathos\\". =The Timelords= In 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a 'novelty' pop single, \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" as The Timelords. The song is predominantly a mash-up of the Doctor Who theme music, \\"Block Buster!\\" by Sweet and Gary Glitter's \\"Rock and Roll (Part Two)\\". Credited on the record was \\"Ford Timelord\\", Cauty's 1968 Ford Galaxie American police car, and \\"Lord Rock\\" (Cauty) and \\"Time Boy\\" (Drummond). The Timelords claimed that Ford Timelord was the \\"Talent\\" in the band and had given them instructions on how to make the record; Ford fronted the promotional campaign for the single and was \\"interviewed\\" on TV. They later portrayed the song as the result of a deliberate effort to write a number one hit single.The KLF interview, Snub TV, 30 January 1989 In interviews with Snub TV and BBC Radio 1, Drummond said that they had intended to make a house record using the Doctor Who theme. After Cauty had laid down a basic track, Drummond observed that their house idea wasn't working and what they actually had was a Glitter beat. Sensing the opportunity to make a commercial pop record they went instead for the lowest common denominator. According to the British music press, the result was \\"rancid\\", \\"pure, unadulterated agony\\" and \\"excruciating\\" and from Sounds \\"a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny\\". A single of The Timelords' remixes of the song was released: \\"Gary Joins The JAMs\\" featured original vocal contributions from Glitter, who also appeared on Top of the Pops to promote the song with The Timelords. \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" sold over one million copies. The Timelords released one other product, a 1989 book called The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way), a step-by-step guide to achieving a number one hit single with little money or talent. =The KLF= By the time the JAMs' single \\"Whitney Joins The JAMs\\" was released in September 1987, their record label had been renamed \\"KLF Communications\\" (from the earlier \\"The Sound of Mu(sic)\\"). The duo's first release as the KLF was in March 1988, with the single \\"Burn the Bastards\\"/\\"Burn the Beat\\" (KLF 002). Although the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was not retired, most future Drummond and Cauty releases went under the name \\"The KLF\\". The name change accompanied a change in Drummond and Cauty's musical direction. As 'King Boy D', Drummond said in January 1988, \\"We might put out a couple of 12\\" records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers\\". King Boy D also said that he and Rockman Rock were \\"pissed off at [them]selves\\" for letting \\"people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling\\". In 1990 he recalled that \\"We wanted to make [as the KLF] something that was ... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod to the history of rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting me ... [although] we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88\\". The 12\\" records subsequently released in 1988 and 1989 by the KLF were indeed rap free and house-oriented; remixes of some of the JAMs tracks, and new singles, the largely instrumental acid house anthems \\"What Time Is Love?\\" and \\"3 a.m. Eternal\\", the first incarnations of later international chart successes. The KLF described these new tracks as \\"Pure Trance\\". In 1989, the KLF appeared at the Helter Skelter rave in Oxfordshire. \\"They wooed the crowd\\", wrote Scotland on Sunday some years later, \\"by pelting them with ... ¬£1,000 worth of Scottish pound notes, each of which bore the message 'Children we love you. The KLF's 'Trancentral' logo: speakers arranged in a 'T' shape. Also in 1989, the KLF embarked upon the creation of a road movie and soundtrack album, both titled The White Room, funded by the profits of \\"Doctorin' The Tardis\\". Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although bootleg copies exist. The soundtrack album contained pop- house versions of some of the \\"pure trance\\" singles, as well as new songs, most of which would appear (in radically reworked form) on the version of the album which was eventually released to mainstream success. A single from the original album was released: \\"Kylie Said to Jason\\", an electropop record featuring references to Todd Terry, Rolf Harris, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo and BBC comedy programme The Good Life. In reference to that song, Drummond and Cauty noted that they had worn \\"Pet Shop Boys infatuations brazenly on [their] sleeves\\". The film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. \\"Kylie Said to Jason\\", which Drummond and Cauty were hoping could \\"rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy\\", flopped commercially, failing even to make the UK top 100. In consequence, The White Room film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single. Meanwhile, \\"What Time Is Love?\\" was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, \\"The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs\\". This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series. A further Pure Trance release, \\"Last Train to Trancentral\\", followed. By this time, Cauty had co-founded the Orb as an ambient side-project with Alex Paterson. Cauty's ambient album Space and the KLF's \\"ambient house\\" LP Chill Out ambient video Waiting were released in 1990, as was a dance track, \\"It's Grim Up North\\", under The JAMs' moniker. The KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed \\"Stadium House\\". Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled \\"Additional Communicators\\"), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples. The first \\"Stadium House\\" single, \\"What Time Is Love? (Live from Trancentral)\\", released in October 1990, reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally. The follow-up, \\"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\\", was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 in the US Billboard Hot 100. The album The White Room followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK. A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a segued series of \\"Stadium House\\" songs followed by downtempo tracks. The KLF's chart success continued with the single \\"Last Train to Trancentral\\" hitting number two in the UK, and number three in the Eurochart Hot 100. In December 1991, a re-working of a song from 1987, \\"Justified & Ancient\\" was released, featuring Tammy Wynette. It was another international hit ‚Äì peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 ‚Äì as was \\"America: What Time Is Love?\\" a hard, guitar-laden reworking of \\"What Time Is Love?\\". In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode (\\"Policy of Truth\\"), the Moody Boys (\\"What Is Dub?\\"), and Pet Shop Boys (\\"So Hard\\" from the Behaviour album, and \\"It Must Be Obvious\\"). Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant described the process: \\"When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough.\\" After successive name changes and dance records, Drummond and Cauty ultimately became, as the KLF, the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991, still incorporating the work of other artists but in less gratuitous ways and predominantly without legal problems. =BRIT Awards and retirement from the music business= On 12 February 1992, the KLF and grindcore group Extreme Noise Terror performed a live version of \\"3 a.m. Eternal\\" at the BRIT Awards, the British Phonographic Industry's annual awards show. Drummond and Cauty had planned to throw buckets of blood over the audience, or to disembowel a dead sheep on stage, but were prevented from doing so due to opposition from BBC lawyers and vegetarians Extreme Noise Terror; Sheep were a symbol of the KLF, and Drummond conceded that the \\"sheep hacking\\" idea was akin to a suicide. Associates reasoned that the plan was to generate such revulsion towards the KLF that they would be ostracised from the music industry and a comeback would be impossible. The dead sheep purchased but the plan thwarted, Drummond considered chopping his hand off with an axe live on stage. The performance was instead concluded with a limping, kilted, cigar-chomping Drummond firing blanks from an automatic weapon over the heads of the crowd. As the band left the stage, the KLF's promoter and narrator Scott Piering proclaimed over the PA system that \\"The KLF have now left the music business\\". Later in the evening the band dumped the dead sheep, with the message \\"I died for you ‚Äì bon appetit\\" tied around its waist, at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties. Piering's PA announcement was largely not taken seriously at the time; even he and other close associates of the band thought the announcement was a joke. NME's detailed piece on the events at the BRIT Awards and the after-party, which included an interview with Drummond the day after, assured readers that the \\"tensions and contradictions\\" would continue to \\"push and spark\\" the KLF and that more \\"musical treasure\\" would be the result. In the weeks following the BRITs performance, the KLF continued working with Extreme Noise Terror on the album The Black Room, but it was never finished. On 14 May 1992, the KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the deletion of their back catalogue: In a comprehensive examination of the KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it \\"the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction in the history of pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt.\\" Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that \\"Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity\\". Scott Piering said that \\"They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines\\". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it \\"Conceptually and philosophically ... absolutely brilliant\\". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that \\"I [have] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A&R; men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over\\". \\"For the very last spectacularly insane time\\", the magazine concluded, \\"The KLF have done what was least expected of them\\". The final KLF Info sheet discussed the retirement in a typically offbeat fashion, and asked \\"What happens to 'Footnotes in rock legend'? Do they gather dust with Ashton Gardner and Dyke, the Vapors, and the Utah Saints, or does their influence live on in unseen ways, permeating future cultures? A passing general of a private army has the answer. 'No', he whispers 'but the dust they gather is of the rarest quality. Each speck a universe awaiting creation, Big Bang just a dawn away'.\\" There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the \\"abyss\\". The KLF's BRITs statuette for \\"Best British Group\\" of 1992 was later found buried in a field near Stonehenge. =K Foundation and other pre- millennium projects= The K Foundation was an arts foundation established by Drummond and Cauty in 1993 following their 'retirement' from the music industry. From 1993 to 1995 they engaged in art projects and media campaigns, including the high-profile K Foundation art award (for the \\"worst artist of the year\\"), and in 1993 released a limited edition single ‚Äì \\"K Cera Cera\\" ‚Äì in Israel and Palestine \\"to create awareness of peace in the world\\". They burnt what was left of their KLF earnings ‚Äì a million pounds in cash ‚Äì and filmed the performance. This article is a first-hand account by freelance journalist Jim Reid, the only independent witness to the burning. For Cauty's actual words ‚Äì a breakdown of The KLF's earnings and spending ‚Äì see K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. Cauty and Drummond announced a 23-year moratorium on all K Foundation activities in November 1995. The KLF come out of retirement for 23 minutes to make an appearance as 2K. Also in 1995, Drummond and Cauty contributed a song to The Help Album as The One World Orchestra (\\"featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards\\"). \\"The Magnificent\\" is a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven, with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92: \\"Humans against killing ... that sounds like a junkie against dope\\". On 17 September 1997, Drummond and Cauty re-emerged briefly as 2K. 2K made a one-off performance at London's Barbican Arts Centre with Mark Manning, Acid Brass, the Liverpool Dockers and Gimpo; a performance at which \\"Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of Dettol, caused havoc in their motorised wheelchairs. These old reprobates, bearing a grandfatherly resemblance to messrs Cauty and Drummond, claimed to have just been asked along.\\" The song performed at the Barbican ‚Äì \\"***k the Millennium\\" (a remix of \\"What Time Is Love?\\" featuring Acid Brass and incorporating elements of the hymn \\"Eternal Father, Strong to Save\\") ‚Äì was also released as a single. These activities were accompanied by the usual full page press adverts, this time asking readers \\"***k The Millennium: Yes/No?\\" with a telephone number provided for voting. At the same time, Drummond and Cauty were also K2 Plant Hire, with plans to build a \\"People's Pyramid\\" from used house bricks; this plan never reached fruition. K2 Plant Hire Ltd had been registered at Companies House since 1995; Cauty and Drummond are directors. The Directors' Report for the period ending 31 March 1996 listed the company's activities as \\"a music company\\" and the accompanying accounts noted a transaction with \\"KLF Communications Residual Royalties\\", a Cauty-Drummond partnership. =The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu return= On 23 August 2017, in Liverpool, 23 years after they burnt a million pounds, Drummond and Cauty returned as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. The duo launched a novel, 2023: A Trilogy, and staged a three day event, \\"Welcome to the Dark Ages\\". Ending their self- imposed moratorium, the festival included a debate asking \\"Why Did The K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?\\" The JAMs also announced new plans for a People‚Äôs Pyramid to be built from bricks each containing 23 grams of human ashes. New bricks will be layed at the annual \\"Toxteth Day Of The Dead\\". Cauty emphasised to the BBC in 2018 that the People‚Äôs Pyramid project, inspired by his brother's death, is serious: \\"It's easy to make it sound like a joke\\", he said, \\"but it isn't a joke, it's deadly serious and it's a long-term project.\\" He also confirmed that The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu are a going concern - \\"It's interesting to be in a band that doesn't make records but only makes pyramids of dead people. KLF Communications The Pyramid Blaster ‚Äì the logo of KLF Communications From their very earliest releases as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu until their retirement in 1992, the music of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty was independently released in their home country (the UK).KLF Communications profile at Discogs.com (link ) Their debut releases ‚Äì the single \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and the album 1987 ‚Äì were released under the label name \\"The Sound Of Mu(sic)\\". By the end of 1987 Drummond and Cauty had renamed their label to \\"KLF Communications\\" and, in October 1987, the first of many \\"information sheets\\" (self written missives from the KLF to fans and the media) was sent out by the label. KLF Communications releases were distributed by Rough Trade Distribution (a spinoff of Rough Trade Records) in the South East of England, and across the wider UK by the Cartel. As Drummond and Cauty explained, \\"The Cartel is, as the name implies, a group of independent distributors across the country who work in conjunction with each other providing a solid network of distribution without stepping on each other's toes. We are distributed by the Cartel.\\"Drummond, B. & Cauty, J. (1989) The Manual (How To Have a Number One The Easy Way), KLF Publications (KLF 009B), UK. . (Link to full text) When Rough Trade Distribution collapsed in 1991 it was reported that they owed KLF Communications ¬£500,000. Plugging (the promotion to TV and radio) was handled by longtime associate Scott Piering. Outside the UK, KLF releases were issued under licence by local labels. In the US, the licensees were Wax Trax (the Chill Out album), TVT (early releases including The History of The JAMs a.k.a. The Timelords), and Arista Records (The White Room and singles). The KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the United Kingdom. Themes Several threads and themes unify the many incarnations of Drummond and Cauty's creative partnership, many of these influenced by The Illuminatus! Trilogy; combined, these themes, threads and their activities over the years have been said to form a \\"mythology\\". Drummond and Cauty made heavy references to Discordianism, popularised by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson in the Illuminatus! books, Situationism, and tactics often interpreted by media commentators as \\"Situationist pranks. In a 2000 review of Drummond's book 45, and an appraisal of the duo's career to date, writer Steven Poole stated that Drummond and Cauty \\"are the only true conceptual artists of the [1990s]. And for all the eldritch beauty of their art, their most successful creation is the myth they have built around themselves.\\" This deep and perplexing mythology, he suggested, results in all their subsequent activities (as a partnership or otherwise) being absorbed into their mystique: Drummond and Cauty have also been compared to Stewart Home and the Neoists.Extract from a feature on Stewart Home. Cornwell, J. i-D Magazine, Nov 1993 (link ) Home himself said that the duo's work \\"has much more in common with the Neoist, Plagiarist and Art Strike movements of the nineteen-eighties than with the Situationist avant-garde of the fifties and sixties.\\" Drummond and Cauty \\"represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture\\", he added.Home, Stewart, \\"Doctorin' Our Culture\\", published on the website of The Stewart Home Society (link ) =Illuminatus!= Drummond was the set designer on Ken Campbell's 1976 stage production of The Illuminatus! Trilogy. In the first KLF Communications Info Sheet, Drummond explained that The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was \\"pinched\\" from Illuminatus! which he had been reading the year before. The number 23 is a theme of Illuminatus!, where instances of the number are both overtly and surreptitiously placed. * In lyrics to the song \\"Next\\" from the album 1987: \\"23 years is a mighty long time\\". * They announced they had signed a contract preventing either of them from publicly discussing the burning of a million pounds for a period of 23 years; * Their 1997 return as 2K was \\"for 23 minutes only\\". * In numbering schemes: for instance, the debut single \\"All You Need Is Love\\" took the catalogue number JAMS 23, while the final KLF Communications Information Sheet was numbered 23; and Cauty's Ford Galaxie police car had on its roof the identification mark 23. * In significant dates during their work: for instance, a rare public appearance by the KLF, at the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, was on 23 June 1991; they announced the winner of the K Foundation award on 23 November 1993; and they burned one million pounds on 23 August 1994. * The 2017 reunion happened at 00:23 on 23 August 23 years after the burning, with the release of a book entitled 2023: A Trilogy. The numerals of the date ‚Äì 23 August 2017 ‚Äì also sum to 23 (2+3+0+8+2+0+1+7=23). When questioned on the importance that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically \\"I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know.\\" The \\"Pyramid Blaster\\" is a logo and icon frequently and prominently depicted within the duo's collective work: a pyramid, in front of which is suspended a ghetto blaster displaying the word \\"Justified\\". This references the Eye of Providence icon, often depicted as an eye within a triangle or pyramid, a significant symbol of Illuminatus! The pyramid was also a theme of the duo's 1997 and 2017 reunions, with the proposed building by K2 Plant Hire of a \\"People's Pyramid\\" (in 1997, a pyramid built with as many bricks as there were births in the 20th century in the UK, and in 2017 a pyramid built from bricks containing the ashes of dead people). =Trancentral= Trancentral (a.k.a. the Benio) was their studios. Despite the grandiose lyrics of \\"Last Train to Trancentral\\", Trancentral was in fact Cauty's residence in Stockwell, South London (), \\"a large and rather grotty squat\\" according to Melody Maker's David Stubbs: \\"Jimmy has lived [there] for 12 years. ('I hate the place. I've no alternative but to live here.') There's little evidence of fame or fortune. The kitchen is heated by means of leaving the three functioning gas rings on at full blast until the fumes make us all feel stoned .... And, pinned just above a working top cluttered with chipped mugs is a letter from a five-year-old fan, featuring a crayon drawing of the band.\\" =Sheep= Following the February 1990 release of Chill Out (the press release for which credited sheep as guest vocalists), sheep had recurring roles in the duo's output until their 1992 retirement. Drummond has claimed that the use of sheep on the Chill Out cover was intended to evoke contemporary rural raves and the cover of the Pink Floyd album Atom Heart Mother. =Ceremonies and journeys= Drummond and Cauty's work often involved notions of ceremony and journey. Journeys are the subject of the KLF Communications recordings Chill Out, Space, \\"Last Train to Trancentral\\", \\"Justified & Ancient\\" and \\"America: What Time Is Love?\\", as well as the aborted film project The White Room. The Chill Out album depicts a journey across the U.S. Gulf Coast. In his book 45, Drummond expressed his admiration for the work of artist Richard Long, who incorporates physical journeys into his art. Fire and sacrifice were recurring ceremonial themes: Drummond and Cauty made fires to dispose of their illegal debut album and to sacrifice the KLF's profits; their dead sheep gesture of 1992 carried a sacrificial message. The KLF's short film The Rites of Mu depicts their celebration of the 1991 summer solstice on the Hebridean island of Jura: a tall wicker man was burnt at a ceremony in which journalists were asked to wear yellow and grey robes and join a chant; the journalists' money was also burnt. =Promotion= A K2 Plant Hire advertisement, exhibiting the stark quality of Drummond and Cauty's press adverts, and the characteristic typeface Drummond and Cauty were renowned for their distinctive and humorous public appearances (including several on Top of the Pops), at which they were often costumed. They granted few interviews, communicating instead via semi-regular newsletters, or cryptically phrased full-page adverts in UK national newspapers and the music press. Such adverts were typically stark, comprising large white lettering on black. From the outset of their collaborations, Drummond and Cauty practised the guerrilla communication tactic that they described as \\"illegal but effective use of graffiti on billboards and public buildings\\" in which \\"the original meaning of the advert would be totally subverted\\". Much as the JAMs' early recordings carried messages on the back of existing musical works, their promotional graffiti often derived its potency from the context in which it was placed. For instance, The JAMs' \\"SHAG SHAG SHAG\\" graffiti, coinciding with their release of \\"All You Need Is Love\\", was drawn over the \\"HALO HALO HALO\\" slogan of a Today billboard that depicted Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable James Anderton, who had decried homosexuals amidst the UK media's AIDS furore. Music press journalists were occasionally invited to witness the defacements. In December 1987, a Melody Maker reporter was in attendance to see Cauty reverse his car Ford Timelord alongside a billboard and stand on its roof to graffiti a Christmas message from the JAMs. In February 1991, another Melody Maker journalist watched the KLF deface a billboard advertising The Sunday Times, doctoring the slogan \\"THE GULF: the coverage, the analysis, the facts\\" by painting a 'K' over the 'GU'. Drummond and Cauty were, on this occasion, caught at the scene by police and arrested, later to be released without charge. In November 1991, the JAMs placed a photograph of graffiti with the slogan \\"It's Grim Up North\\" ‚Äì which had appeared on the junction of London's M25 orbital motorway with the M1 that runs to Northern England ‚Äì as an advert in the NME. The graffiti, for which the JAMs denied responsibility, had been the subject of an early day motion in the British House of Commons on 21 October 1991. In September 1997, on the day after Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti \\"1997: What The Fuck's Going On?\\" appeared on the outside wall of London's National Theatre, ten years after the slogan \\"1987: What The Fuck's Going On?\\" had been similarly placed to mark the release of the JAMs' debut album. =Reputation as \\"pranksters\\"= Cauty and Drummond's tactics have often been labelled by media commentators as \\"pranks\\" or \\"publicity stunts\\". In 1991 Drummond told an NME journalist that \\"we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct\\", whilst acknowledging that people would likely not believe him. On the morning after the BRITs performance, an impassioned Drummond told the NME that \\"I really hate it when people go on about us being 'schemers' and 'scammers'. We do all this stuff from the very depths of our soul and people make out its some sort of game. It depresses me.\\" Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, \\"I think it worked because we really meant it.\\" Legacy KLF Communications' advert for \\"Justified & Ancient\\", with a quote from the lyrics: \\"They travel the world in their ice cream van, they've voyaged to the bottom of time. They've been to the place where the Mu-Mu mate, and the children still cry 'Mine's a 99!'\\" Chill Out is cited by AllMusic as \\"one of the essential ambient albums\\". In 1996, Mixmag named Chill Out the fifth best \\"dance\\" album of all time, describing Cauty's DJ sets with the Orb's Alex Paterson as \\"seminal\\". The Guardian has credited the KLF with inventing \\"stadium house\\"; NME named the KLF's stadium house album The White Room the 81st best album of all time whilst Q listed it as the 89th best British album of all time, in 2000. =Opinions of contemporaries= In 1991, Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys said that he considered the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be the KLF. Neil Tennant added that \\"They have an incredibly recognisable sound. I liked it when they said EMF nicked the F from KLF. They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters.\\" At the time of the KLF's retirement announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague David Balfe said of Drummond's KLF career that \\"the path he's trod[den] is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down I like the idea of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff ... I think the very avoidance of clich√© has become their particular clich√©\\". In March 1994, members of the anarchist band Chumbawamba expressed their respect for the KLF. Vocalist and percussionist Alice Nutter referred to the KLF as \\"real situationists\\" categorising them as political musicians alongside the Sex Pistols and Public Enemy. Dunst Bruce lauded the K Foundation, concluding \\"I think the things the KLF do are fantastic. I'm a vegetarian but I wish they'd sawn an elephant's legs off at the BRIT Awards.\\" =Direct influence= The KLF have been imitated to some degree by German techno band Scooter, being sampled on virtually every album Scooter have released. A group called \\"1300 Drums featuring the Unjustified Ancients of M.U.\\" released a novelty single to cash-in on the popularity of Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona. The Timelords' book, The Manual, was used by the one-hit-wonders Edelweiss to secure their hit \\"Bring Me Edelweiss\\". The duo \\"The FLK\\" released two albums and several singles in the 2010s, appropriating the KLF's aesthetic and musical style and mixing it with samples and references from folk music. Their anonymity, along with details such as their use of a Ford Timelord which was very similar to the original in their videos and promotional material, led some to believe that the FLK actually were the KLF. However, it emerged in 2018 that they were two ex-members of the Leeds-based indie band The Hollow Men. =Career retrospectives= Drummond and Cauty have appeared frequently in British broadsheets and music papers since the KLF's retirement, most often in connection with the K Foundation and their burning of one million pounds. The NME called them \\"masters of manipulating media and perceptions of themselves\\". In 1992, NME referred to the KLF as \\"Britain's greatest pop group\\" and \\"the two most brilliant minds in pop today\\", and in 2002 listed the duo in their \\"Top 50 Icons\\" at number 48. The British music paper also listed the KLF's 1992 BRIT Awards appearance at number 4 in their \\"top 100 rock moments of all time\\". \\"What's unique about Drummond and Cauty\\", the paper said in 1993, \\"is the way that, under all the slogans and the sampling and the smart hits and the dead sheep and the costumes, they appear not only to care, but to have some idea of how to achieve what they want.\\" \\"[Of their many aliases,] it is as the KLF that they will go down in pop history,\\" wrote Alix Sharkey in 1994, \\"for a variety of reasons, the most important being the resolute purity of their self- abnegation, and their visionary understanding of pop.\\" He added: \\"By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts.\\" The same piece also quoted Sheryl Garratt, editor of The Face: \\"the music hasn't dated. I still get an adrenaline rush listening to it.\\" Garratt believes their influence on the British house and rap scene cannot be overestimated. \\"Their attitude was shaped by the rave scene, but they also love pop music. So many people who make pop actually despise it, and it shows.\\" Trouser Press reviewer Ira Robbins referred to the KLF's body of work as \\"a series of colorful sonic marketing experiments\\". The Face called them \\"the kings of cultural anarchy\\". Robert Sandall wrote in 1993 that one of the KLF's \\"maxims\\" was \\"making the unthinkable happen\\". In 2003, The Observer named the KLF's departure from the music business (and the BRITs performance in which the newspaper says \\"their legend was sealed\\") the fifth greatest \\"publicity stunt\\" in the history of popular music. A 2000 piece in The Daily Telegraph called the BRITs performance \\"violently antagonistic\\" and reported that the \\"music-business audience\\" was \\"stunned\\"; on the other hand, Piers Morgan writing shortly after the performance called the KLF \\"pop's biggest wallies\\". A 2004 listener poll by BBC 6 Music saw the KLF/K Foundation placed second in a list of \\"rock excesses\\", after The Who. A 2017 piece in The Guardian, pondering the rumoured return of The KLF, noted that \\"in the 25 years since their disappearance, nobody else has come up with anything that matches the duo‚Äôs extraordinary career\\"; another piece in the same newspaper in the same year, by a different author, called them \\"abstruse\\" and \\"pop‚Äôs greatest provocateurs\\", and their career \\"anarchic, anti-commercial and mostly ludicrous\\". Instrumentation Early releases by the JAMs, including the album 1987, were performed using an Apple II computer with a Greengate DS3 sampler peripheral card, and a Roland TR-808 drum machine. On later releases, the Greengate DS3 and Apple II were replaced with an Akai S900 sampler and Atari ST computers respectively. The KLF's 1990‚Äì1992 singles were mixed by Mark Stent, using a Solid State Logic automated mixing desk, and The White Room LP mixed by J. Gordon-Hastings using an analogue desk. The SSL is referenced in the subtitle of the KLF single \\"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\\". The house music of Space and the KLF involved much original instrumentation, for which the Oberheim OB-8 analogue synthesiser was prominently used. Drummond played a Gibson ES-330 semi-acoustic guitar on \\"America: What Time Is Love?\\", and Cauty played electric guitar on \\"Justified & Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)\\" and \\"America: What Time Is Love?\\". Graham Lee provided prominent pedal steel contributions to the KLF's Chill Out and \\"Build a Fire\\". Duy Khiem played clarinet on \\"3 a.m. Eternal\\" and \\"Make It Rain\\". The KLF track \\"America No More\\" features a pipe band. The Roland TB-303 bassline and Roland TR-909 drum machine feature on \\"What Time Is Love (Live at Trancentral)\\".

History The cornerstone of the old Carnegie Library, which was demolished in 1954 In 1899, the idea to create a free public library in Dallas was conceived by the Dallas Federation of Women's Clubs, led by president Mrs. Henry (May Dickson) Exall. She helped raise US$11,000 from gifts from public school teachers, local businessmen, and Alfred Horatio Belo of The Dallas Morning News. The library became a reality when Mrs. Exall requested and received a US$50,000 grant from philanthropist and steel giant Andrew Carnegie to construct the first library building in Dallas. On October 22, 1901,Elizabeth York Enstam, Women and the Creation of Urban Life: Dallas, Texas, 1843-1920 (Texas A&M; University Press, 1998) p102 the Carnegie library opened at the corner of Harwood and Commerce streets with a head librarian, three assistants, and 9,852 volumes. The first story held the entire collection; the second floor held the Carnegie Hall auditorium and an Art Room. The art room was the first public art gallery in Dallas and eventually became what is known today as the Dallas Museum of Art. Dallas Public Library building opened in 1954 and included controversial artwork. An Oak Cliff branch opened in 1914 to serve the citizens of the area, annexed into Dallas in 1903. Four more branches opened in the 1930s including the Paul Lawrence Dunbar Library, which was the first to serve the African American population of Dallas. This began under the director of Cleora Clanton. In World War II, the library was fully established as a War Information Center. By 1950, the library resources and facilities were stretched to the limit, so supporters formed an auxiliary organization called the Friends of the Dallas Public Library to lobby for better library services. By the 1950s, the Carnegie Library was badly deteriorating and overcrowded, and a new modern library was built on the same site. During construction, the Library was housed temporarily on the mezzanine of Union Station. The new building, now known as Old Dallas Central Library, had room for over 400,000 volumes and opened in 1954. =Growth: 1960 to 2000= The J. Erik Jonsson Central Library in the Government District of Downtown Dallas. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Dallas Public Library added 17 branches to the system. In 1962, Lillian M. Bradshaw was named Library Director, the first woman to head a department in the City of Dallas, marking a milestone in the civil rights and women's liberation movements of that era. Days after she was put into office, she faced a censorship push from a Dallas council-member, but the community and media rallied to her defense. The City Council, in response, overwhelmingly approved her appointment and passed a resolution not to censor books purchased by the library. By the 1970s, the Central Library had again become overloaded and was unequipped to handle emerging technology. (This was partly a result of the federal Library Services and Construction Act, which had enabled the addition of an unexpected number of volumes to the collection in a relatively short period of time.) In 1972, the City selected a site at Young and Ervay across from the Dallas City Hall for a new central library facility. In 1982, the technologically sophisticated structure opened its doors. It was one of the first libraries in the nation to include an Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) and state-of-the-art audiovisual capabilities. It was renamed the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library in 1986 in honor of the former mayor who played a large role in the library system's development. B By the 2000s, the system had 27 branch locations with over 2.5 million volumes, including books, magazines, videos, and cassettes. The system currently attracts 2.8 million visitors per year and has 540,000 cardholders who check out more than 3.8 million books and other materials per year.

It is located 5 km southwest of Moss Vale on the Illawarra Highway. Sutton Forest was originally granted, then owned by Navy Chief officer, Captain John Nicholson who recently immigrated from Scotland to Australia. This privately owned estate was originally 700 acres, this is where John Nicholson lived and died. Sutton Forest is located in an agrarian setting and is surrounded by farms, vineyards and is home to manor homes and estates. It is in one of the oldest areas settled by Europeans in Australia after Sydney and is somewhat reminiscent of an English village due to the temperate Southern Highlands climate and high rainfall. Sutton Forest comprises two churches, an inn, and two specialty shops. In 2004, a proposal to locate Sydney's second airport in Sutton Forest met with fierce opposition from locals. It was one of the first colonial settlements outside Sydney and thus has many heritage buildings such as the Hillview Heritage Hotel which was built in 1850s. Etymology In 1819 it was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie after Charles Manners-Sutton, 1st Viscount Canterbury, a speaker of the House of Commons. The surrounding area is part of the lands administrative unit of the Sutton Forest Parish. Population At the , Sutton Forest had a population of 477. 81.2% of people were born in Australia and 88.4% of people only spoke English at home.

Each ligamentum flavum connects two adjacent vertebrae, beginning with the junction of the axis and third cervical vertebra, continuing down to the junction of the fifth lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. They are best seen from the interior of the vertebral canal; when looked at from the outer surface they appear short, being overlapped by the lamina of the vertebral arch. Each ligament consists of two lateral portions which commence one on either side of the roots of the articular processes, and extend backward to the point where the laminae meet to form the spinous process; the posterior margins of the two portions are in contact and to a certain extent united, slight intervals being left for the passage of small vessels. Each consists of yellow elastic tissue, the fibers of which, almost perpendicular in direction, are attached to the anterior surface of the lamina above, some distance from its inferior margin, and to the posterior surface and upper margin of the lamina below. In the neck region the ligaments are thin, but broad and long; they are thicker in the thoracic region, and thickest in the lumbar region. H: Ligamenta flava Function Their marked elasticity serves to preserve the upright posture, and to assist the vertebral column in resuming it after flexion. The elastin prevents buckling of the ligament into the spinal canal during extension, which would cause canal compression. Clinical relevance Because these ligaments lie in the posterior part of the vertebral canal, their hypertrophy can cause spinal stenosis, particularly in patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Some studies indicate that the hypertrophy of these ligaments may be linked to a fibrotic process associated with increased collagen VI, which could represent an adaptive and reparative process in response to the rupture of elastic fibers.

It flows for in a roughly northwest direction through Trinity County and then Humboldt County, draining a watershed into the Pacific Ocean north of the town of Arcata near Arcata-Eureka Airport in McKinleyville. The river's headwaters are in the Coast Range near South Kelsey Ridge. History Before Euro-American settlers arrived in the mid-1800s, the native peoples occupying the lower Mad River watershed were the Wiyot (from approximately Blue Lake to its mouth, plus the greater Humboldt Bay region) who spoke a dialect affiliated with the Algonquian language family, with upriver reaches controlled by three different groups whose languages are related to the Athabascan family, the Whilkut, Nongatl and Lassik (Baumhoff 1958). Today, among these distinct groups, only the Wiyot-affiliated Blue Lake Rancheria and the Wiyot Tribe of the Table Bluff Reservation are federally recognized tribes and the United States holds lands in trust for their citizens. The Whilkut, Nongatl and Lassik were essentially annihilated during the Bald Hills War in the 1860s. The river was named in December, 1849 in memory of an incident when Dr. Josiah Gregg lost his temper when his exploration party did not wait for him at the river mouth. Watershed and river modifications The Mad River drains approximately of the Coast Range Geomorphic Province and empties into the Pacific Ocean north of Humboldt Bay in Humboldt County, California. The basin is about in length and averages six miles (10 km) wide. Elevations range from sea level at the mouth to along the western ridge to in the headwaters. Principal tributaries to the Mad River include South Fork Mad River, North Fork Mad River, Barry Creek, Pilot Creek, Deer Creek, Bug Creek, Graham Creek, Grace Flat, Blue Slide Creek, Boulder Creek, Maple Creek, Can√µn Creek, Lindsey Creek, and Mill (Hall) Creek. The river provides groundwater recharge for agricultural water supplies and is free-flowing for 85 percent of its length. Matthews Dam, about one third of the way down the river from its source, forms Ruth Reservoir. The dam is owned by Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District, which provides water from Ranney collectors near Essex for municipal and industrial use in Eureka, Arcata, Blue Lake and numerous unincorporated communities in the Humboldt Bay area.State of California Water Quality Control Plan North Coastal Basin 1B July 1975 p.13 The reservoir can hold of water; and releases power a two megawatt hydro-electric plant generating 5 million kwh during an average water year. In the 1960s, a dam for the Mad River in Humboldt County was proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The proposed blockage would have flooded the Maple Creek/Butler Valley area and adversely affected the health of the Mad River watershed. Gradually the opposition from the community, including the urban areas of the county, forced a suspension of the project schedule and finally the cancellation of the project. The dam was never built. The greatest problem of the Mad River drainage basin, as for many rivers in this area of the state, is erosion causing excessive sediment buildup in the river and its tributaries. The main causes of the erosion are excessive road building and logging, especially historical logging practices like clear- cutting. In addition, the removal of riparian vegetation (primarily due to conversion of natural lands to ranching purposes) increases erosion and urbanization causes decreased water quality. In 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency listed the Mad River under section 303(d) of the California Clean Water Act Section as sediment impaired, due to elevated erosion and siltation. In 2006, the river was additionally listed as temperature and turbidity-impaired. Land use The upper half of the river is inside the Six Rivers National Forest, but the vast majority of the river flows through private land, even in the national forest. About 64 percent of the land is used for timber production. Green Diamond is by far the largest landowner in the watershed, with about 42 percent of all land. The next largest landowners are R. Emmerson and Humboldt Redwood Company (formerly the Pacific Lumber Company), with 3 and 2 percent respectively. There are quite a few ranchers and lumber companies that own smaller, but still sizable, parcels. Private residences, open space and parks make up most of the rest. Ecology The river provides recreational opportunities and important habitat to fish and wildlife. Flora of the area includes the Mad River fleabane (Erigeron maniopotamicus), a wildflower which was named for the river. Key fish species include coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and steelhead (O. mykiss), which were federally-listed as threatened in the Mad River in 1997, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Two threatened osmerid species - longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthy) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) - are also listed as present in the estuarine portion of the Mad River, but have not been observed in recent years. Before entering the ocean, the river turns abruptly north near the triple junction of the Gorda, North American, and Pacific plates. This bend denotes the usual upper limit of the estuary, although brackish waters can extend as far upstream as Highway 101 during king tides. Although small, this estuary provides nursery habitat for juvenile rockfish (Sebastes melanops, S. rastrelliger) and several species of flatfish, including starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus), English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus), and speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus). The estuary also serves as a migration corridor for salmonids and Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), and as a summer feeding ground for several marine species, including topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) and surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosis). Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) prickly sculpin (Cottus asper), coast range sculpin (C. aleuticus), and Three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteous aculeatus) are present in the estuary year-round. Above the estuary, the Mad River is home to resident coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarki clarki), rainbow trout (O. mykiss irideus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomas occidentalis), and Humboldt sucker (Catostomas occidentalis humboldtianus). The Mad River Estuary is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California (1974) State of California The Mad River watershed was described as at carrying capacity with 22 colonies of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) in 1954, from the river mouth to well upstream. These beaver were re-introduced into the North Fork Mad River in 1946, or possibly were migrants from the Little River (Humboldt County). North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) were also numerous.

It is one of the very few occupied Anglo-Norman castles in Ireland. The castle was built by John de Courcy in 1184 and it was later occupied by the Savage family and their dependents, the Smiths. In the 17th century Sir James Montgomery, then living at Rosemount, Greyabbey, purchased the Quintin estate from Dulaltaigh Smith. His son William, built a walled courtyard and other smaller towers, a large house adjacent to the central tower and a great kitchen to the seaward side of the castle structure. They then re-roofed the castle and added new floors, all probably before 1659. The Montgomerys sold the castle to George Ross, but he never lived in the castle, allowing it to become a near ruin. While he lived in The Mount Ross estate a few miles outside of Portaferry. In the early 19th century the castle was inherited by Elizabeth Calvert (n√©e Blacker), a descendant of Ross, and restored in 1850. The central keep was raised, a walkway made within the battlements, a drawing room opened into the inner gardens, and a dining room constructed on the lowest floor of the great tower. Most of the grounds were also enclosed by a massive stone wall. Eventually the estate was purchased by the Burgess family, who lived in Quintin from the early 1930s until the 1950s. Skeets Martin, an auctioneer from Belfast, and his wife, then occupied the castle until the early 1970s. In 1978 the castle was opened as a private old people's home, which it remained for many years until sold into private ownership. The castle has been extensively refurbished by McGimpsey and Kane Builders, changing hands most recently in late 2006. The latest owner had trouble with upkeep, in particular paying of renovation works, forcing the castle into the hands of administrators in 2012. In June 2013 Quintin Castle was sold (asking ¬£1.65m with 22 acres) by NAMA to the Tayto Group (owned by the Hutchinson family's Manderley Food Group), which in July 2016 applied for permission to use the Castle as an 8-bedroom private function venue for weddings, visiting customers, training and conferences.

Musayyib's municipal government has heavy representation from the Office of the Martyr Sadr, the political wing of Moqtada Sadr's Militia. There is a small minority representation by the Badr Corps as well. The city has had its occurrences of violence since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. Most notably, the city experienced two large truck bombs - one on the Musayyib Bridge, which links Baghdad to Karbala, in late 2004 and one in the town center in 2005 that killed 90 people. Musayyib also saw the largest combat operation the US Army's 4th Infantry Division fought during its tour of duty in 2006.

It is located outside the village of Ingatestone, approximately south west of Chelmsford and north east of London. The house was built by Sir William Petre, and his descendants (the Barons Petre) live in the house to this day. Part of the house is leased out as offices while the current Lord Petre's son and heir apparent lives in a private wing with his family. The hall is open to the public on selected afternoons between Easter and September. History Sir William Petre (c1505-1572) William Petre bought Ingatestone manor soon after the Dissolution of the Monasteries for some ¬£850 and commissioned the building of the house. In June 1561, Queen Elizabeth I spent several nights at Ingatestone Hall on her royal progress, where she held court. The Petre family laid on a lavish welcome, procuring food and drink and decorating the house. In November 1564, Lady Katherine Gray was transferred to the charge of Sir William Petre. For two years she was in his custody, and resided at Ingatestone Hall; where she was then removed to the care of Sir John Wentworth (a kinsman of Petre's first wife) at Gosfield Hall. The Petre family were recusants, remaining loyal to the Roman Catholic Church after the English Reformation had turned the Kingdom of England into a Protestant country. Statutes were passed prohibiting Catholic worship in England, the Book of Common Prayer was established as the official liturgy of the Church of England, and practising Catholics faced severe punishments. Like many noble Catholic families, the Petres worshipped in secret, holding clandestine Catholic Mass in the private family chapel at Ingatestone Hall. The first Baron Petre, Sir John Petre, befriended the composer William Byrd, also a Catholic. In 1589‚Äì90, Byrd spent Christmas with the family at Ingatestone along with John Petre‚Äôs half sister Dorothy Petre and her husband Nicholas Wadham later co-founders of Wadham College, Oxford and in 1593 Byrd took up residence in the neighbouring village of Stondon Massey. Byrd supported the Petre family's covert Catholic worship by composing a comprehensive repertory of choral music to be sung in the private chapels at Ingatestone and nearby Thorndon Hall, the other Petre family property. The compositions included two sets of motets called Gradualia (1605 and 1607) and a set of three Mass settings, such as the Mass for Four Voices (1592‚Äì3), works first heard at Ingatestone that are now considered to be some of the finest examples of Tudor music. The Petre family sheltered a number of Catholic priests at Ingatestone, among them was St. John Payne, who was executed in 1582. The hall contains two priest holes that were used for this purpose. In the late 18th century Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre moved the family seat to Thorndon Hall and rented Ingatestone Hall out to tenants. In 1876 much of Thorndon Hall was destroyed by fire. During World War I, Lionel Petre, 16th Baron Petre was killed in action in 1915 and his widow, Lady Rasch, decided to move back to Ingatestone. During the Second World War, the house was let to Wanstead High School. In the 1950s, Essex County Council used the north wing to house the Essex Record Office and mounted annual exhibitions there until the late 1970s. In 1952 the hall became grade I listed and the gatehouse grade II* listed, while several of the outhouses became Grade II listed. Ingatestone Hall houses the remaining Petre family picture collection. Architecture Ingatestone Hall, May 2003 Plan of Ingatestone Hall showing the additions and demolished sections The building comprises three wings (north, east and south) around a central court. It was built by Sir William Petre 1539‚Äì1556 around a central courtyard in English bond brick and includes features typical of Tudor , including stepped gables and tall, ornate chimney pots. Within the courtyard, a prominent feature is a tall crenellated turret containing an octagonal staircase. In the late 18th century Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre moved back to the other family property, Thorndon Hall, which was being rebuilt in the Palladian style by the architect James Paine. At around this time, Ingatestone Hall underwent significant alterations and was converted into smaller rented apartments. The west wing, which contained the Great Hall, was demolished, opening the enclosed courtyard out into the U-shaped building that is seen today, and the north wing was extended and the outer court buildings were rebuilt, including an entrance arch topped with a one-handed clock. This clock turret, engraved with the motto \\"Sans dieu rien\\" (\\"without God, nothing\\") is thought to have been the work of Paine. The Long Gallery in the east range of the house was the main area of the house. It adjoins the remains of the former family chapel, which was pulled down and rebuilt in 1860. The two priest holes within the building, used during the 16th and 17th centuries to conceal Catholic clergy, are located in the east wing in a void under the turret, and in the south wing behind a chimney stack in the old study. In the 20th century, when Lady Rasch, widow of the 16th Baron Petre, moved the family back to Ingatestone Hall, she began a major project to restore Ingatestone Hall to its original Tudor appearance. The works, overseen by the architect, W.T. Wood, included replacing alterations to the building with reproductions of Tudor period features, notably the re-instatement of mullioned windows on the west side of the building on the ground floor. The initial phase of project was completed in 1922. In literature and film Mary Elizabeth Braddon's 1862 novel Lady Audley's Secret is set at Ingatestone Hall and was inspired by a stay there. The exterior of hall was used as a filming location to represent Bleak House in the 2005 television adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel and also appeared in an episode of the TV series Lovejoy. Sketches from the TV programmes Horrible Histories and The Fast Show were also filmed at the hall.

The square was previously named Dimitrije Tucoviƒá Square after the prominent Serbian socialist.Trg Slavija - City of Belgrade  Location  Slavija is located less than 1.5 kilometers south of Terazije (downtown Belgrade), on an altitude of 117 meters.Statistical Yearbook of Belgrade 2007 - Topography, climate and environment The majority of the square itself belongs to the municipality of Vraƒçar (eastern and central parts) while the western parts belong to the municipality of Savski Venac. The neighborhood which surrounds the square borders the neighborhoods of Cvetni Trg in the north, Vraƒçar's sub- neighborhoods of Grantovac in the north-east and Englezovac/Savinac in the south-east, and Zapadni Vraƒçar to the west.  History  Until the 1880s, the area around Slavija was a large pool on the eastern outskirts of the city. The pond was naturally drained by the Vraƒçarski potok, down the modern Nemanjina street, into the Gypsy Pond in the neighborhood of Savamala. The remnant of the pond is the large underground water spring under the modern Hotel Slavija. The earth from the top of the Vraƒçar hill above the Slavija was used to cover and drain the pond, in turn flattening the hill and creating the modern Vraƒçar plateau. The formation of the square started when a well-known Scottish businessman and Nazarene Francis Mackenzie, bought a large piece of land above the present square and parcelled it for sale (the area became subsequently known as Englezovac). Soon after that, Mackenzie has built a house for himself at Slavija (at the place where the old \\"Slavija\\" cinema used to be), which in 1910 was turned into the Socialist People's Center, a gathering place of the worker's movement. The other, smaller buildings at the corner of Kralja Milana and the square, where the famous caf√©s \\"Tri seljaka\\" and \\"Rudniƒçanin\\" used to be, were destroyed before and during World War II. Today demolished, the original inn, later hotel \\"Slavija\\" was built from 1882 to 1888. The hotel's kafana became one of the best known in Belgrade. The venue had a big hall for the parties and balls, and a spacious summer, open-air garden. The hotel hosted recitals, theatrical shows and choirs performances. The large object gave name to its surroundings, and then to the entire neighborhood. Word \\"Slavija\\" itself is a generic term for land inhabited by the Slavs. Bronze bust of Dimitrije Tucoviƒá on the central plateau before it was removed on 13 November 2016 Until World War II Slavija remained an unregulated crossroad of 8 streets, which crossed at different angles. Surrounding was an entangled web of small streets which, though cobblestoned in the early 20th century, were remains of the old, dirt paths dating from the Ottoman period. German occupational forces concluded that the traffic flow rate in Slavija was too low and that it obstructs the transportation. City government, part of the Quisling administration in Serbia, was entrusted with the task of conducting construction plans for Slavija devised in Germany. Massive works, headed by engineer Maksimoviƒá, began in the fall of 1942. Apart from transforming Slavija into the proper roundabout, underground works were also conducted. A major effluent sewer (sewage collector) was built, which collected wastewater and groundwater from the hills of Vraƒçar and Zvezdara. The sewer further conducted the water under the Nemanjina Street into the Sava river. As of 2018, the roundabout, sewer and its outlet into the river still function. In the 21st century, the massive size of the sewer and large pipes are major obstacles for the construction of the projected underground passages around Slavija. Slavija was projected as the final square in a succession of squares around Belgrade's central route from Kalemegdan to Englezovac: Studentski Trg- Trg Republike-Terazije-Cvetni Trg-Slavija. In time, Studentski Trg and Terazije lost their square functions, becoming streets, while Cvetni Trg, with final changes in early 2000s, is completely defunct as a traffic object, so Slavija and Trg Republike remain as the rare true squares in downtown Belgrade. After World War II, the new communist regime renamed the square in 1947 in honour of prominent socialist figure, Dimitrije Tucoviƒá and placed a bronze bust of Tucoviƒá at the central square plateau. The bust, work of Stevan Bodnarov, was placed in 1949. In the early 2000s it was officially changed back to Slavija. Hotel Slavija was built in 1962, and enlarged later (complex Slavija A and Slavija B). A third addition, the ultra modern Slavija Lux was built in 1989.  Administration  Slavija is today divided between the municipalities of Vraƒçar and Savski Venac. Savski Venac's section was within the local community of West Vraƒçar, while Vraƒçar's section was organized as the local community of Slavija with the population of 4,608 in 1981 and 4,281 in 1991. That local community was later annexed to Cvetni trg but in 2010s the municipality of Vraƒçar abolished local communities altogether.  Traffic importance  Tram roundabout route on Slavija Square Slavija is one of the most vibrant traffic objects in Belgrade, being one of the major squares of Belgrade. It is one of the rare traffic routes in the city where all three types of public transportation (buses, trolleybuses and trams) meet. Due to the general inadequacy of the city's transportation, traffic jams are regular on the square and especially hard if helped by some additional reason (bad weather, snow, especially the 2006 reconstruction of the Autokomanda interchange, etc.). The transportation importance of the square can be seen as it branches into the eight streets: * Boulevard of Liberation, which goes up and down the Vraƒçar hill and connects it to Autokomanda and the highway; * Svetog Save, which also goes up the Vraƒçar hill and ends up at the Temple of Saint Sava; * Makenzijeva, which also through Vraƒçar connects it to the neighborhood of ƒåubura; * Prote Mateje, which connects it to the Belgrade's longest street, Boulevard of the King Alexander; * Beogradska, which also connects it to the Boulevard of the King Alexander, and the neighborhood of Ta≈°majdan and further to Palilula; * Kralja Milana, the main street of Belgrade, going through downtown (Terazije) and further to the Square of the Republic and Kalemegdan; * Nemanjina, which connects it to the main railway and bus stations and the bank of the Sava river; * Deligradska, which connects it to the vast complex of the Clinical Center of Serbia; Over 70,000 pedestrians and 140,000 vehicles pass through Slavija daily. After the prolonged 2016-2018 reconstruction, the roundabout was further narrowed to make room for the central fountain while nothing to fix any traffic problems was done. After the Republic Square reconstruction in 2019, without any announced plans, and due to the botched works on the square and city administration's wish to turn the entire downtown into the pedestrian zone, lines of public transportation across the Slavija were partially shortened, making Slavija the terminus (trolleybuses 21 and 22), or were completely abolished (trolleybus 19). Thousands of commuters were then forced to use the square as a transfer station for further commuting to downtown, with additional bus line 22A being introduced as trolleybuses replacement, further polluting already highly polluted city. This caused instant traffic jams in Slavija, already burdened by the massive traffic. Already crowded, the remaining lines became almost useless during the rush hours as they were constantly overcrowded, while pedestrian part of the square became a \\"race track\\" for the commuters who have to run to make a transfer as neither the timetable nor the location of the stations were synchronized. It was pointed out that after the reconstruction the traffic worked \\"somehow\\", but that after latest changes it collapsed completely. City authorities stated they acted after \\"serious analyses and talks\\" and upon wishes of the citizens. Asked to make public those analyses and explain when and how the citizens were interviewed about such major changes, administration refused to disclose any documents.  Architecture  Due to numerous and constant changes in the architectural structure of the urban tissue surrounding the square, Slavija became a synonym for an architecturally ugly and devastated area and the source of one of the most popular urban legends in Belgrade: the curse of the Mitiƒáeva rupa (\\"Mitiƒá's hole\\"). = Mitiƒáeva rupa = In the 19th century, the \\"Rudniƒçanin\\" kafana was located at the modern corner of Beogradska and Kralja Milana streets. In decades before the opening of the Belgrade Main railway station in 1884, the venue was one of the major transloading and packaging spots in Belgrade. It had a vast yard, which also included stables and quarters for merchants and bullockies, where the goods and food arriving from the interior were stored and repackaged for the city markets. The complex survived until the 1920s. One of the richest people in Belgrade before World War II, Vlada Mitiƒá, bought the lot to build the largest department store in the Balkans, but the outbreak of the war halted the realization, though the foundations were dug. The project was to be the third twin of the Palace Albanija, the tallest building and the first skyscraper in Belgrade and in the Balkans at the time. The future store was tentatively named \\"Mitiƒá Warehouse\\" or \\"Mitiƒá Tower\\", and was planned to be even taller than Albanija itself. After the war, Communist government imprisoned Vlada Mitiƒá and confiscated his entire property, including the lot on Slavija, on the corner of the Kralja Milana and Beogradska streets, and money prepared for the construction of the department store. From 1946 to 1980 26 different project were completed for the lot, but none was realized. Then mayor of Belgrade, Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá decided to put a large sundial in the place in the first half of the 1980s. In the early 1990s, Dafiment banka, one of the major Ponzi schemes of the Milo≈°eviƒá's regime, bought the lot and announced a monumental shopping mall, but after the scheme failed completely, the lot was fenced and turned into the dump . After the regime change in 2000, the area was cleaned and a temporary park with children playground was built instead. The failed projects continued, including the ultra-modern, gigantic shopping mall by the Israeli investors which turned out to be a complete hoax. All of this was more than enough for people to consider the \\"hole\\" a cursed place. The park was renovated from April to July 2017. Slavija Square - looking towards ‚ÄúJat Airways Slavija Hotel‚Äù (centre) and Slavija Lux (far right) National Bank of Serbia headquarters = Cinema Slavija = Built in 1888, the residence of Francis Mackenzie became known as the \\"Peace Salon\\" after it was ceremonially opened in 1889. Next to it, a pharmacist Kosta Nikoliƒá built a one-storey house which became a well-known pharmacy, so as the several smaller buildings around it with shops, including the tinsmith Anton ≈†uster. The Serbian Social Democratic Party purchased the edifice in 1910, turning it into the center of the burgeoning worker's movement. In the early 1930s the venue was transformed into the inn. After World War II, new authorities nationalized everything and turned former Mackenzie's residence into the \\"Slavija\\" cinema, occupying area between the Beogradska and Prote Mateje streets. For decades one of the symbols of Belgrade, the cinema was demolished in 1991, but like the Mitiƒá's hole, none of the projects for construction on this site have been realized, though the official reason for the demolition of the entire quarter, including the former Nikoliƒá's complex, was the construction of the new Beobanka building. Not knowing what to do with the empty lot, city government turned it into the temporary parking lot. As of 2020, the area is still a parking and the land is in the process of restitution to the descendants of its pre- nationalization owners. One of the nationaliyed parcels, owned by the medical doctor and radiologist Aleksandar Markoviƒá (1878-1961), which covers , was returned to his descendants in October 2020. Majority of the modern parking lot is located on it. = Slavija hotels = There are three Slavija hotels on the square: * Slavija I, between the Makenzijeva and Svetog Save streets, right on the square; * Slavija II, also between those two streets but behind the Slavija I (to which it makes one complex), further from the square; * Slavija Lux, across the old hotels, between the street of Svetog Save and the Boulevard of the Liberation; The old hotel Slavija from 1962, in the manner of the International style is today viewed by the Belgraders as an obsolete and ugly building, with its hospital-like look, especially compared to the modern marble and glass Slavija Lux which perfectly fits into the buildings behind it. Inside the hotel is elaborately decked out with wooden panelling on most surfaces in the rooms. It features a Casino and large dining room. The hotel was never fully renovated and still operates, though not using all rooms. The hotel was opened in 1962 before the 7th European Athletics Championships. The oldest section, Slavija I, also known as Kula (\\"Tower\\"), has 17 floors. Slavija II was added in 1973, serving as the dependency of Slavija I. Slavija Lux, built in only 6 months in 1989, was opened for the 9th Summit of the Non- Aligned Movement. Altogether, there are 600 rooms in all three buildings. = National Bank of Serbia = Construction of the new building of the National Bank of Serbia also began in the early 1990s. It is located a little bit further from the square itself, but due to its size it is visible from many parts of Belgrade. Money problems caused a decade and a half of delays. A massive construction was deemed ugly and inappropriate for the location by many Belgraders and in 1994 the then governor of the bank, Dragoslav Avramoviƒá, stated that he would not move into the new building even if it were completed on time. The massive glass building was finished in 2006.  Projects  For decades, architects, urbanists and city authorities can't decide how to reconstruct and adapt the square. Over the time, many public competitions were held for the best solutions, labeling it sometimes as a ‚Äúhaunted square‚Äù. Architects always pointed out that the traffic function is the most important and that it has to be addresses first, and then to plan the surroundings and also that Slavija was to be envisioned as a whole and not to be fixed partially, because sum of the parts does not make a whole. Some of the projects were quite over-ambitious and exotic: * 1992 ‚Äì Projects for the construction on the location of the Mitiƒáeva Rupa. * 2004 - Project envisioned a monument to the \\"modern Serbia\\" instead of the monument to Dimitrije Tucoviƒá. New monument was to be a cylindrical glass construction of the same height as the neighboring hotel \\"Slavija\\". Inside the construction a panoramic elevator was predicted which would reach the lookout at the top. Lyrics of the \\"Himna slobode\\" (Hymn to the Liberty) wre planned to be written on the inside walls of the glass monument. City even provided the funds for the project, but the project was ultimately rejected, with the official explanation that the public was against it. * 2005 ‚Äì Architects Tamara Petroviƒá & Milo≈° Komleniƒá; central part of the roundabout was to be the location of a sun clock. Roofed square in the section in front of the National Bank was planned with commercial area below the roof and an underground passage to the metro. * 2006 - Energoprojekt's project envisioned Slavija as the pedestrian zone, while the traffic was to be lowered two floors underground. New symbol of Slavija was planned, a 150 meters tall tower. * 2008 ‚Äì Belgrade's Institute for urbanism rehashed the 2005 project, but mostly concentrated on the traffic. Instead of reconstructing the entire square, the Institute adopted a plan to do it block by block. Project also included the construction of two commercial 8-stories buildings, shopping mall and an entrance to the underground garage and a future metro station, on the location of the former cinema Slavija. In front of the National Bank a shallow pool with a sculpture in it was projected and the green zone around it. The fountain would \\"react\\" to the emotions of the pedestrians through the special sensors. * 2012 - Project envisioned the transfer of the pedestrian traffic in the network of tunnels, in an effort to quicken the car traffic on the ground level. Trolleybuses and trams were to be relocated to the rim of the roundabout. Plan also has foreseen the removal of the remains of Dimitrije Tucoviƒá and construction of the large fountain instead, covering the entire island within the roundabout.  2016-2018 reconstruction  After the political changes in the city government in 2013, new city authorities decided to adopt the 2012 project, with some changes. They abandoned the idea of the underground pedestrian passages and instead plan to displace the existing zebra crossings 50 to 100 meters further from the roundabout. They kept the fountain on the central island of the roundabout which was to be a musical fountain with a diameter of 32 meters and the water jets 16 meters high. Criticism from the architects was directed to the fact that transportation solutions will not speed up the traffic flow, the needlessness of the fountain on such a place, and that, in general, new city government removed from the project the best parts and kept the worst. Traffic experts pointed out that the displacement of the pedestrian crossings won't help the traffic and that it will be less safe for the pedestrians themselves. Also, as Belgrade is known for its strong winds, the water from such a high jet streams would constantly wet the pavement of the square. City government replied that the fountain will have wind sensors. Architect Dragoljub Bakiƒá said that both the project, and the execution which followed, are of the \\"horribly low quality\\". Actually, the area of the already busy roundabout is reduced by one lane during the reconstruction. = Fountain = Construction of the fountain began on 3 December 2016. As a response to the constant criticism about the fountain, including that it will be completely surrounded by some of the busiest traffic in the city, thus inaccessible to the pedestrians, and a price which is, for the Serbian economic conditions deemed way to high for such a construction (214 million dinars or some 1.75 million euros), Belgrade's city manager Goran Vesiƒá stated that those who do not like the musical fountain don't have to listen to it. On 13 November 2016 the bust of Dimitrije Tucoviƒá was removed and on 15 December 2016 his remains were reinterred into the Alley of the Greats in Belgrade's New Cemetery. Surviving members of Tucoviƒá family weren't present, while their wishes to bury Tucoviƒá in his home village of Gostilje and to relocate the bust to the town of U≈æice were ignored. A smaller version of Tucoviƒá bust was placed at his tomb. In March 2017, the city's Transportation Secretariat sent a memo in which warned that the project is not adjusted for such a major traffic section. The secretariat warned that the planned dispersion of the water will make the roads wet and slippery in summer and create ice in winter, as it is supposed to work throughout the year, thanks to the special heaters. They concluded that the fountain projected that way is not suitable for the highly frequent roundabout but rather for the parks and open green areas and that it can endanger the traffic. Ban on further construction was suggested if the inadequacies are not fixed. The solution turned out to be a changed direction of the sprinklers, 74 out of 458, within the fountain. Lit with 400 spotlights, the fountain was opened on 6 June 2017, after a month of delay, and at the final cost of 254 million dinars (2,06 million euros), with taxes. The traffic policemen who manage the traffic on Slavija now wear the traditional white uniforms. As the fountain is unreachable, Vesiƒá stated that the new park, across the fountain, will be a place where the \\"citizens will gather, watch at the fountain and take photos of it\\". Experts' criticism of the fountain continued. During the trials in the days before it was officially opened, music was played all day (after the opening it is several hours before noon and several in the evening) and was indeed too loud - it was heard several blocks away. Local residents called both the communal inspection and the communal police, but they both declared themselves incompetent. Milan Vujaniƒá, professor at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering, asserted that the fountain is still a safety risk. Architect Borislav Stojkov, who devised the 1979 urbanistic plan for Slavija, called it a \\"kitsch-parade\\", waste of money and \\"Potemkin village in the center of Belgrade\\". Architectural theorist and member of the Serbian Academy of Architecture Slobodan \\"Gi≈°a\\" Bogunoviƒá described it as the \\"rosemary on the lapel of the ragged suit\\", \\"illiterate pleasing to the taste of politicians and ignorant councilors\\" and \\"water well that swallowed lot of money\\". Author and critic Milan Vlajƒçiƒá called it an \\"insult for Belgrade\\", a \\"Chinese rattle\\" and a \\"nonsense\\". Bakiƒá called it an \\"eyesore\\" and \\"watering trough\\". Politicians, on the other hand, praised the project. Vesiƒá dismissed all criticism calling it \\"political\\" and that after only three days, the fountain became the \\"symbol of Belgrade\\". Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure, Zorana Mihajloviƒá, stated that to her, Slavija is more beautiful with the fountain. President of Serbia Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, who in terms of administration or jurisdiction has nothing to do with the fountain, defended the project saying that he can't give an answer to \\"those who complain that they have no access to the fountain...what did they expect, that they will be able to wash their feet in it\\" and to \\"people who hate the entire world\\". Vuƒçiƒá added that those who criticize the fountain actually can't forgive him \\"because he participated in three strongest, most compelling victories in the modern Serbian history\\", referring to the last three electoral rounds. He asserted that the fountain is among the ten most beautiful ones in Europe. The fountain was damaged in December 2017 when a van, which participated in the three-car collision, hit its outer granite plates, forcing it out of service for a week. In September 2018, the commission was formed to choose which songs will be played. It was officially named \\"The Commission for the realization of the artistic work of the fountain on the Slavija Square\\". With everything that happened during the construction, and things which followed (malfunctioning, wetting the carriageways, shutting down because of the repairs, several car accidents including cars crashing into the fountain damaging it), it has been described as the controversial, \\"creature\\" and \\"jinxed attraction\\", with dubious effect on traffic safety in the square. Controversies continued around the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly because of deputy mayor Vesiƒá. He announced the fountain would play \\"patriotic\\" songs for the Statehood Day on 15 February. Part of the cultural establishment called it unacceptable, opposed to the meaning of the holiday and political campaigning. Though the idea wasn't publicly dropped, the fountain remained silent on holiday. Vesiƒá ordered for the fountain and several other city landmarks to be lit in the lights of the German flag, supporting Germany in fighting the outbreak, on the eve of 6 April, anniversary of the vicious 1941 German bombing of Belgrade, which killed several thousand people and destroyed up to 25% of the city. This action met with almost unanimous public odium. In order to support Serbian health workers, on 11 April he organized gathering of city communal workers, who parked various vehicles around the fountain during the total pandemic curfew. At the time when citizens already began to support health workers with applause in the evening, early 1-minute long applause, with Vesiƒá's TV statement was labeled magnificent by the government media, while the opposition called it a political campaign. = Roundabout = After the fountain was opened, on 10 June 2017 the first phase of the reconstruction began. It includes the demolition of the smaller, illegally built edifices around Slavija. The latest change in the project includes a small park between the Kralja Milana and Nemanjina streets. The park will be a location of the monument to Dimitrije Tucoviƒá, which was removed from the center of the roundabout. The deadline for the reconstruction was 7 November 2017. However, in the summer of 2017, major traffic congestions developed in the wider downtown area as the city began several large reconstructions of important traffic spots. Due to the delays because of the failed tendering and problems with permits, the reconstructions of the Ruzveltova street (which began in May), Bulevar Osloboƒëenja and Slavija (June), Bore Stankoviƒáa (July) Branko's Bridge, Plateau of Milan Mladenoviƒá and Beogradska (August) and Glavna in Zemun, all overlapped in August. The summer of 2017 has been named as an example of a good idea with a bad plan, it was nicknamed the \\"hell summer\\", while the commuting through the city was described as a \\"nightmare\\". Concerning Slavija, there was also a matter of the fountain which was shut down and conserved until the works on the square were finished. Fountain worked only for two and a half months, so questions are asked why the square wasn't finished first, cause now there are additional costs (conservation, etc.) for the already too expensive fountain. The works on Slavija were awarded to the \\"Ratko Mitroviƒá\\" company, which was already criticized for its handling of the 2014 reconstruction of the Vojvode Stepe Street. The situation, described as the \\"months of collapse\\" was further aggravated by the temporary strikes of the workers of \\"Ratko Mitroviƒá\\" because their salaries were months late and the company didn't pay their social and health insurance. They organized strikes on 13 July and 11 September. It was announced that the company didn't pay the insurance and pension fees for the workers since 2014, which raised question how the city could choose such a company because one of the conditions was that they have no debts to the state. On 13 October 2017, while the excavator was digging a channel on Slavija, a lump of hard material fell from its bucket onto the main water pipe in this part of the city causing it to burst. As a result of the pipe burst, described as a \\"deluge\\", the water was ejected in the air and the pond was created in the center of the square, up to deep. The water then spilled over into the ending section of the Kralja Milana street, further complicating the traffic. Though the problem was fixed later that day, the communities on social networks had a field day with the comments and photomontages. They especially made fun of mayor Sini≈°a Mali's comment on a previous incident with the Slavija fountain (\\"it isn't cracked, it overspills\\") and his and president Alexander Vuƒçiƒá's pet project Belgrade Waterfront (in Serbian, Beograd na vodi, \\"Belgrade on the water\\"). The three most problematic spots were open for traffic simultaneously on 16 November 2017 (Slavija, adjoining Bulevar Osloboƒëenja, Ruzveltova) even though none of them were fully completed. Citizens noted that not much appears to be changed after such a long reconstructions, while mayor Mali admitted that on Slavija only the pavement was changed.Beogradska Hronika, at 8:33 Soon, the problems appeared, apparently as a result of hasty and low quality work. By January 2018 the granite slabs on the sidewalks and concrete bedding for the tram tracks were cracking, the asphalt concrete with which the streets were paved was denting, while the painted marks and signs were peeling off. = Plateau = The park, promised by the authorities, turned out to be a large concrete- granite plateau. Even though still being under construction, the cracks and deterioration were quite visible by February 2018. City architect Milutin Foliƒá then announced that the plateau will host info-center, public restroom, a mini store and an observation point from which people could watch the fountain. He set the deadline for October 2018. Still, by April 2018 the damages and cracks were widespread and the granite plating of the plateau began to crumble. The city secretariats, contractors and planners all accused each other, blaming the bad project, dumping prices, bad sub-contractors, etc. The same contractor, \\"MBA MIljkoviƒá\\" has been previously hired by the city several times and each time there were problems (Vojvode Stepe Street, Ruzveltova Street), but city continued to hire them \\"because they always had the lowest price\\". City ordered them to fix the problems by May or the penalties will be collected. The repair of the still unfinished plateau began on 18 April 2018, with deadline set to mid-May. As works barely progressed, city extended the deadline until early August. The construction on Slavija has been jokingly named \\"The Building of Slavija\\", after epic poem The Building of Skadar in which the construction of a fortress was hampered by a vengeful fairy who destroyed by night everything the workers would build by day. The deadline was then prolonged again, to 31 August. On 1 September, works officially ended and the drinking fountain has been placed, with journalists noting that no one will probably ever be blamed or punished for such a sloppy work. It turned out that not everything was completed even though the workers left on the deadline date, which prompted the mayor Zoran Radojiƒçiƒá to state how he is \\"disappointed because not everything was finished\\", while the arrangement of the plateau extended further. By November 2018 it was evident that the plateau was cracking all over again and was still being occasionally repaired. Allegedly, it was because of the trams passing by, even though city administration plans to conduct new tram tracks around the plateau. Over the cracked concrete, the decking began, but the deck started deteriorating and cracking right away, even before the placing of it was finished. The bust of Tucoviƒá was returned to the square on 16 October 2018, but placed on the new pedestal built on the plateau, close to the building of the National Bank. In July 2019, ten months after the official completion of the works, city administration admitted there are damages, though it was obvious before (cracks, including some quite long ad deep, especially on the cascade part of the plateau, sitting areas cracked and crumbled, broken slabs all over, neglected and out of order drinking fountain). City summoned the contractors who defended themselves claiming that city added additional jobs to then so they couldn't do the previously accepted jobs properly, but also blamed a weather. City, on the other hand, also accused occasional skaters of breaking the slabs. City ordered the contractors to fix the plateau until December 2019, when the warranty expires, or the city will activate the collateral. The elevated part of the plateau, in one of the corners, was envisioned as the location of the Belgrade Tourist Organization office, public restroom and a kiosk. As of July 2019 nothing has been built.

He is best known for his book Coloniser, Exterminer - Sur la guerre et l'Etat colonial. Le Cour Grandmaison is a professor of political science at the √âvry-Val d'Essonne University and a teacher at the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie. He is the president of the October 17, 1961 Association Against Oblivion, which advocates official recognition for the crimes committed by France during the 1961 Paris massacre.  Coloniser, Exterminer  In his book Coloniser, Exterminer (2005) Le Cour Grandmaison states that techniques and concepts used during the period of late 19th- century New Imperialism were later used during the Holocaust. He points to both Tocqueville and Michelet who spoke of \\"extermination\\" during the colonization of the Western United States and the removal of Native American tribes. He quotes Tocqueville's 1841 comment on French conquest of Algeria: > \\"In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore > [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, > women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any > people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept... I believe the laws of > war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by > destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid > incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks\\" > (quoting Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l‚ÄôAlg√©rie in ≈íuvres compl√®tes, > Paris, Gallimard, Biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade, 1991, pp 704 and 705. \\"Whatever the case, continued Tocqueville, we may say in a general manner that all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria.\\" According to LeCour Grandmaison, \\"De Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France‚Äôs position in the world, and, second, changes in French society.\\" Tocqueville, who despised the July monarchy (1830‚Äì1848), believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened, he believed, by \\"the gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of Thomas Robert Bugeaud, Tocqueville went as far as saying that \\"war in Africa\\" had become a \\"science\\": > \\"...war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and > everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. > One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his > country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new > science\\". LeCour Grandmaison states that techniques employed by the French army during the 1954-62 Algerian War were rooted in history. He believes the history of warfare should be not limited to the technical progress of weapons, but should encompass the \\"judicial, administrative and conceptual arsenal\\" which accompanies it: \\"We can only understand the extreme the violence of the 1848 civil war - which much of the time qualifies as \\"bloody repression\\" - if we place them in a longer genealogy, by the way exterior, and brought back to what was experimented before, most notably during the Algerian war [the 1830 invasion of Algeria]\\" In the same interview, LeCour Grandmaison, distinguishes between the criticisms of colonial abuse and those of the principle of colonization itself, basing his arguments on Zola, Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Darwin, Andr√© Gide, Albert Londres, Jules Verne, Maupassant, Foucault, Barthes and Joseph Conrad. He states how Marx, Engels and their contemporaries were not immune to 19th-century racial ideology, as they too considered colonization as inevitable and justified, and non-European people as \\"primitives\\" and \\"barbarians\\". It wasn't until the Third International that the socialist movement opposed colonialism and supported national liberation movements.  State racism  Following the views of Michel Foucault, LeCour Grandmaison spoke of a \\"state racism\\" under the French Third Republic, notable by the example of the 1881 Indigenous Code applied in Algeria. Replying to the question \\"Isn't it excessive to talk about a state racism under the Third Republic?\\", he replied: > \\"No, if we can recognize \\"state racism\\" as the vote and implementation of > discriminatory measures, grounded on a combination of racial, religious and > cultural criteria, in those territories. The 1881 Indigenous Code is a > monument of this genre! Considered by contemporary prestigious jurists as a > \\"juridical monstruosity\\", this code planned special offenses and penalties > for \\"Arabs\\". It was then extended to other territories of the empire. On one > hand, a state of rule of law for a minority of French and Europeans located > in the colonies. On the other hand, a permanent state of exception for the > \\"indigenous\\" people. This situation lasted until 1945.\\"  23 February 2005 law  Olivier LeCour Grandmaison was one of a number of historians who criticized the February 23, 2005 law, instituted by the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which required that teachers promote \\"positive values\\" of French presence abroad, \\"in particular in North Africa\\". The law was not only accused of interfering with the autonomy of Universities within the state, but also of being an obvious case of historical revisionism. The legislation was repealed by president Jacques Chirac in 2006 following criticisms in France from historians and the left-wing, and from abroad, including Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and N√©gritude writer Aim√© C√©saire.

The cadre has a permanent staff of mountain and arctic warfare instructors and trains mountain leaders for employment in the formations of the corps. History During the 1950s the Royal Marine Cliff Assault Wing was formed to train marines in rock climbing and cliff assault techniques. Elite training of Cliff Leaders in the late 1950s required rocky landings from various small craft (kayaks, Zodiacs and other motorized assault craft) often in heavy seas onto the Cornish coast, and rapid tactical ascents and descent of the vertical faces.See Commando Climber by Mike Banks, Commanding Officer (London J.M. Dent 1955). This skill set was necessary for exposing all trainees during the last week of the commando (green beret) course. Instructors publicly demonstrated (e.g. at Navy Days) commando methods of abseiling and high-speed fixed rope descent from clifftop grapple-hook anchors. These would typically include the 'run-down' method (a simple face down arm wrap, sometimes demonstrated on high urban buildings, and essential when carrying small arms) and the 'front swallow' and other dangerous slides down a fixed rope. These demonstrations were discontinued after Captain Antony Easterbrook, a 31-year-old member of the Cadre, fell to his death during a display in Madison Square Garden in 1960. The Cliff Assault Wing became the Cliff Assault Troop in 1962, the Reconnaissance Leader Troop in 1965 and the Mountain And Arctic Warfare Cadre in 1970. It moved to Stonehouse Barracks at that time. The Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre featured in the 1985 BBC Television documentary series Behind the Lines. The series followed the progress of 25 prospective members of the cadre as they endure survival training on a Hebridean island (Islay) and Arctic conditions in Norway. The cadre was renamed the Mountain Leader Training Cadre in the early 1990s. Courses ML1 is open only to Royal Marines who have completed Senior Command Course. Training similarly takes 8 months, with candidates instructing ML2 training under supervision before being assessed by experienced trainers instructing in regular units. ML2 is open to Subalterns and Other Ranks who have completed Junior Command Course. The course is 8 months long and takes place over the autumn and winter months in the United Kingdom and Norway. Training includes rock climbing, survival, Resistance to Interrogation (RTI), patrolling and raiding, snow and ice climbing and cold weather survival. ML3 is a 9-week course open to all levels, these individuals go on to serve in the Commando Unit Recce Troops, Brigade Patrol Troop, and Special Forces Support Group.

The vast majority of its course is through southern Humboldt County, though a short section of the river flows through northern Mendocino County. Communities, from north to south, closely associated with the Mattole River include: Petrolia, Honeydew, Ettersburg, Thorn Junction, and Whitethorn. The river enters the ocean at the Mattole Estuary about west-southwest of Petrolia and south of Cape Mendocino. History \\"Mattole\\" refers to an Athabaskan Indian people, the Mattole. They historically called themselves Matt√≥al or bedool, but were referred to by neighboring Wyott Indians as Medol or me'tuul. The local tradition is that Mattole means \\"clear water\\". The Mattole lived principally on the Mattole and Bear rivers. During the Bald Hills War, this tribe mustered its warriors but it was outgunned and practically exterminated because of its resistance to white settlers. Watershed The river and its 74 tributaries drain about , including the eastern side of the King Range, and flows through Mattole Valley before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. Although the Mattole River's source is at about elevation, its tributaries originate as high as above sea level. The North Fork of the Mattole River enters the river main stem just west of Petrolia. For most of its length, the river is only a east of the King Range National Conservation Area. About halfway to the ocean, near Honeydew, California, the river passes by Humboldt Redwoods State Park. There are numerous tributaries and creeks that feed the drainage area. Some of the largest are the Upper North Fork at Honeydew (as opposed to the North Fork at Petrolia), Honeydew, Bear, Rattlesnake, and Oil Creeks. Ecology and conservation The Mattole River has been declared by the California Coastal Commission as a 303(d) impaired waterbody that flows into a Marine Protected Area (Punta Gorda State Marine Reserve). Areas in the Mattole River watershed are being restored to revive habitat that was degraded by a combination of early industrial-style timber harvest techniques and associated road construction, naturally erosive geology, and damage by two 100-year floods, which occurred in 1955 and 1964. The Mattole River and Range Partnership, consisting of the Mattole Restoration Council, Mattole Salmon Group, and Sanctuary Forest, undertakes this work with the collaboration of watershed landowners and funding from multiple private and sources. The river is used for recreation and agricultural, municipal and industrial water supply. It also provides wildlife habitat, including cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning.State of California Water Quality Control Plan North Coastal Basin 1B, July 1975, p.13 The Mattole River is home to three salmonid species listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act: chinook and coho salmon, and steelhead. Coho salmon are additionally listed as threatened under the California State Endangered Species Act. The Mattole Salmon Group counted just three adult Coho salmon in the river in the 2009-2010 winter (and only one redd), which is the lowest number of coho counted since the group began surveys in 2004. This is far below the 19th- century historical estimates of 17,000 to 20,000 adults annually, or the 1950s and 1960s estimates of 8,000 and 5,000 annually, respectively. In 2010‚Äì2011 ten coho were counted and five redds, but these numbers are 95% lower than 2006‚Äì2007. Each salmon run is on a three-year cycle. The Mattole Restoration Council, the Mattole Salmon Group, Sanctuary Forest, the Mill Creek Watershed Conservancy, the Upper Mattole River and Forest Cooperative and the Mattole River and Range Partnership fosters the Mattole River habitat restoration work and serves as a model for other communities wanting to work cooperatively to repair anadromous salmonid habitat. Recently the group planned a pilot project to decrease winter runoff and increase summer flows, by using a model of beaver dams and pools. Research done by an ecosystem analyst from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center of NOAA Fisheries shows that salmon smolt production per beaver dam ranges from 527 to 1,174 fish, whereas production in a pool formed by large woody debris is only 6 to 15 fish. This suggests that re-establishment of beaver populations would be 80 times more effective in salmonid recovery efforts than placement along of large woody debris. In the early 1990s residents of the lower Mattole River (Humboldt County, CA) watershed created the Mattole Watershed Alliance to work on improving Mattole River conditions toward the common goal of preserving populations of wild salmonids. The common plant associations within the Mattole include the following: (1) coast redwood forest (in the southern headwaters), (2) mixed coast Douglas-fir and hardwood primarily tanoak and Pacific madrone forest, (3) mixed chaparral, primarily manzanita, mountain whitethorn, California scrub oak, and coyote brush, and (4) grasslands. Riparian zones of the Mattole also support bigleaf maple, red alder, Fremont cottonwood, Oregon ash, and willow. { Logging train crossing the Mattole River mouth, circa 1900  Climbing high to collect native seeds for restoration in the Mattole Watershed Volunteer replants native Douglas Fir on the river  Mattole River at Arthur W. Way County Memorial Park } Parks and Recreation Arthur W. Way County Memorial Park is on the north bank of and adjacent to the river. Geography In the 1850s, Euro-American settlers started ranching and agricultural traditions on the land. This would inhibit contraction of disease and decrease the native Mattole tradition of relying on river resources.Buran, C. (2001). Efforts to restore the Mattole River and its watershed. Restoration and Reclamation Review, 7(4) Post World War II: Logging of Douglas fir became an increased practice for this period of building construction and the tax value of standing trees rose as well. Since logging increased, more debris settled in the Mattole River, further damaging it. From 1947 to 1988, the old-growth coniferous forest in the watershed was decreased by 90 percent. Because of the increased industrialism of this time period, road building led to a network of roads. The basin streams became destabilized. Forest practices, like the skidding of logs downstream channels became normal practice. The streams and forestry along the Mattole were damaged as a result. Logging boomed from 1955 to 1964 and two historically large floods greatly changed the structure of the Mattole streams. After the floods of 1964, sediment yields averaged 16,370 tons per square mile of watershed area, approximately .25 inches per year averaged across the watershed‚Äôs area. At this time the erosion rates in the Mattole River were approximately 0.001 inches per year. Erosion increases dirt and debris in the river, hindering waterflow and devastating the survival of the river‚Äôs living organisms. The best spawning habitat areas for salmonid species were damaged in 1970 when the chain development of residential housing began. Large landowners divided their land into 40 to 200-acre squares for this development. As a result, the developments caused the transportation of sediment to slow and eventually fill great spawning habitat stream channels. Restoration A 1959 survey from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported Mattole spawning runs were 10,000 Chinook salmon and 4,000 coho salmon. Later in 1964, a survey from the California Department of Fish and Game reported Mattole spawning runs were 10,000 Chinook salmon and 4,000 coho salmon. During the 1980s, reports showed the Chinook salmon run fell to 3,000. This number dropped even lower in 1990 and 1991, when Chinook salmon run fell to 100 and coho salmon fell to approximately 100 as well. The American Fisheries Society classified the species as ‚Äúhigh risk for extinction‚Äù. 1980: The Mattole Salmon Group (MSG) was formed by local residents. Their aim is to restore the native salmon populations. The MSG created gravel-lined ‚Äúhatchboxes‚Äù to substitute for the lost spawning habitat areas. Adult spawners were held until they had their eggs and these were incubated in the hatchboxes. This process jumped the survival rate of ‚Äúegg-to-fry‚Äù from 15 percent to 80 percent. In 1981, local residents and activists began the Mattole salmon project by Freeman House.Zuckerman, S. (1988). Restoration ecology: Living according to nature. Nation, 247(10), 340-342. Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=aph&AN;=8800018601&site;=ehost- live They began incubating salmon eggs, clearing logjams and obstacles for fish migration and plant trees to sustain the riverbanks. They will choose to take care of the salmon before they work on their homesteads. Freeman House released the first Mattole Restoration Newsletter was issued in 1983. Its concepts encouraged residents to fight for fine timber, abundant fish, productive grasslands, and rich and varied plant and animal communities. In 1983, the Mattole Restoration Council (MRC) was formed. Their purpose being to combine the restoration efforts with landowners and residents. They issued ‚ÄúElements of Recovery,‚Äù a catalog of prescriptions and erosional sources in 1987. It mapped and categorized areas of tributary drainage and erosional features on the watershed. This project revealed the number of roads, including both active and abandoned roads in the Mattole basin. Techniques and expertise for this project were developed at Redwood National Park. In 1991, MRC‚Äôs Douglas fir reforestation project showed a survival rate of 70 to 80 percent. This increased shade, aiding in the hatching of eggs which require a cool temperature. Rock wing and small wing deflectors were installed and protected about 400 yards of the riverbank from 1977 to 1984. Of the structures, six created wide scour pools from 3 to 6 feet deep, with shade from overhead riparian vegetation. Headwater Channel Species From the early 1960s to 1999, the Southern torrent salamander was encountered in undisturbed slow-flowing water.Welsh Jr., H. H., Hodgson, G. R., & Lind, A. J. (2005). Ecogeography of the herpetofauna of a northern california watershed: Linking species patterns to landscape processes. Ecography, 28(4), 521-536. doi:10.1111/j.0906-7590.2005.04024.x In 1997, timber harvesting limited the ancient pacific tailed frogs in the headwater channels causing the species became endangered. In 2005, the pacific tailed frogs could be found in small population sizes along old-growth forests. Their small populations are scattered along the river, because of heightened water temperatures. These temperature highs are above the level for egg development during the summer when these frogs oviposit under stream substrates. The pacific tailed frogs are also endangered, because they have morphological adaptations and biophysical constraints with temperatures so they are ecologically dependent. Reptiles of Mattole River In 2005, Foothill yellow-legged frog were commonly encountered in all channels of the river. Their tadpoles are found increasingly at temperatures above 13 degrees Celsius. The adults are often found in open sun, basking on ‚Äúgravel bars, boulders and cobbles,‚Äù because they are ‚Äúheliotherms‚Äù (their body temperature warms by sun‚Äôs rays). Their eggs are deposited in shallow water in open sunlight near their cobbles and boulders. Rough-skinned newts can be found in headwater channels or terrestrial habitats. In 2010, Western fence lizards are found along alluvial channels of the river. This number increases as the water temperature and the level of sediment increases. They stay near the warmer climates because their invertebrate prey is more accessible here.

It chronicles the fall from grace of a fictional heroic Polish bricklayer, Mateusz Birkut (played by Jerzy Radziwi≈Çowicz), who became the Stakhanovite symbol of an over-achieving worker, in Nowa Huta, a new (real life) socialist city near Krak√≥w. Agnieszka, played by Krystyna Janda in her first role, is a young filmmaker who is making her diploma film (a student graduation requirement) on Birkut, whose whereabouts seems to have been lost two decades later. The title refers to the propagandist marble statues made in Birkut's image. It is somewhat of a surprise that Wajda would have been able to make such a film, sub silentio attacking the socialist realism of Nowa Huta, revealing the use of propaganda and political corruption during the period of Stalinism. The film director presaged the loosening grip of the Soviets that came with the Solidarity Movement, though it has been acknowledged by Polish film historians that due to censorship the script languished in development hell since 1962. The film extensively uses original documentation footage from the construction of Nowa Huta and other subjects of Poland's early communist era, as well as the propagandist/inspirational music of Stalinist Poland. Agnieszka has trouble making the film from archival sources and museum collections and from interviews with people whose answers provide partial information on Birkut's life, but who don't seem to know about his current location or situation. The authorities decide that the young student digs too deeply into the recent past, and inform her that their permission to create the film is withdrawn. Her equipment and the materials she gathered are confiscated. Agnieszka's father speculates that there must be a single specific reason for the authorities' fear of further disclosure and suggests that she should locate Birkut and talk to him to find out more, even if she is no longer involved in making the film. With this inspiration, Agnieszka tracks down Mateusz's son, Maciej, in the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard. (Both father and son, Mateusz and Maciej, are played by the same actor: Jerzy Radziwi≈Çowicz.) Agnieszka learns from Maciej that his father died years ago. The ending of Man of Marble leaves the death of Mateusz Birkut ambiguous. In his script, Wajda had wanted to reveal that Mateusz had been killed in clashes at the shipyards in 1970, a major confrontation that prefigured the rise of Solidarity ten years later, but he was prevented by censorship. In 1981, Wajda filmed Man of Iron, a follow-up to Man of Marble, which depicts Maciej's subsequent involvement in the Polish anti-Communist workers' movement. Man of Iron extensively deals with Mateusz's killing in the clashes of 1970. Plot Agnieszka, is a young filmmaker who is making her film thesis on Mateusz Birkut, a bricklayer elevated as a hero in a stunt to increase construction efficiency and brick quotas. However, he has since had a fall from grace of the Party and other officials. His current whereabouts seem to have been lost two decades later, and she attempts to piece together the details of his downfall. Agnieszka has difficulty making the film from archival sources and museum collections, but little work remains outside of official propaganda. Then Agnieszka goes to successful director Jerzy Burski, who recounts the details from the making of his unfinished film, Building Our Happiness. The truth behind the propaganda film comes to light, revealing how Birkut was selected as an example for demonstrating the progress and efficiency of a new industrial city Nowa Huta. Selected by Jodla, the local Party Secretary, Birkut's fame spread from the bricklaying record of 30,000 bricks in one shift launched him to stardom. Burski does not divulge much about Birkut following his initial rise, but puts her in touch with a man who knew Birkut personally. Agnieszka then goes to Michalak, an agent of an unnamed state organization who tailed Birkut during his fame. He acted a dual role of security and keeping tabs on Birkut's activities. From him is learned the details of Birkut's accident which stopped him from continuing his bricklaying feats. A burning hot brick was mixed in with the rest, burning Birkut's hands badly. Michalak then sheds light on Birkut's activities after being placed in the inspectorate. A seemingly true believer, Birkut was beloved by the working people and fought for their betterment. Stalled by a lazy and selfish bureaucracy, Birkut loses heart and increasingly butts heads with powerful politicians and officials. At the same time as his own health was failing, Birkut's friend from the bricklaying feats Wincenty Witek is arrested by the state and Birkut fights for his release. Losing hope, Birkut falls into despair and drunkenly attacks a local party building, breaking a window. Next Agnieszka watches archive newsreels from the trial of Birkut's friend Witek and others in what was known as the trial of the ‚ÄúSkocznia Gang‚Äù who sought to reduce worker efficiency and sabotaging construction sites. Witek and Birkut both seem to have been sentenced to prison terms and reeducation. After the trial and release from reeducation, Witek has successfully turned his career around and is now an important official in Katowice. He recounts Birkut's return from prison, in which Witek has accepted the party line and tries to encourage Birkut to do the same. Throughout Agnieszka's interview with him, he dodges questions and continuously praises the advances being made at Katowice. Next the film crew go and interview Hanka, Birkut's wife before his denunciation as a traitor. Yet when she realizes the topic of her interview, she becomes extremely distressed. She recounts the story of how Birkut tracked her down and met with her. Again Birkut is given the opportunity to take advantage of his past and become successful, but again he seems to have turned it down. Hanka has fallen into drunkenness and shame. During the review phases, the authorities are not happy and rescind support for her movie. Her cameras and film reels she gathered are confiscated. New film of Birkut is found in the archives, but they are not allowed access to editing it and including it in what they have remaining of her film. Agnieszka's father consoles her about her film and speculates that there must be a single specific reason for the authorities' fear of further disclosure and suggests that she should locate Birkut and talk to him to find out more, even if she is no longer involved in making the film.

Early life and education He was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, the youngest son of Jonathan Jackson and his second wife, Hannah Tracy Jackson, who was the daughter of Irish-born merchant Patrick Tracy.http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg62/gg62-50219-prov.html He enjoyed more schooling than most young men in post-Revolutionary America, attending Newburyport public schools as well as the private Dummer Academy. Growing up in a commercial family, however, Jackson was anxious to prove his business acumen, so in 1795, at the age of fifteen, he served as an apprentice clerk to William Bartlett, a wealthy Newburyport merchant, and as captain's clerk to his elder brother Henry. He spent several years at sea on behalf of Bartlett and his brother Henry from 1799 to 1808, impressing experienced merchants and sea masters with his drive and knowledge of navigation and maritime commerce. He completed four trading voyages abroad between 1800 and 1807, which gave him the opportunity to gain \\"experience in the Eastern trade and a respectable capital base\\".  Business career  Jackson established himself in Boston as a merchant specializing in the East and West Indies trade. Despite curtailed shipping interests during the War of 1812, Jackson collaborated with brother-in-law Francis Cabot Lowell (1775‚Äì1817) to establish a textile factory in Waltham, Massachusetts, and founded the Boston Manufacturing Company with him and the other \\"Boston Associates\\" in 1813. The Waltham factory was the first to integrate all the steps of converting raw cotton into cotton cloth into one mill building. On February 10, 1818, Jackson, Daniel Pinckney Parker, and other members of the Boston Associates, were granted the charter of the Suffolk Bank by the Massachusetts General Court. Jackson, Parker, the other charter's holders, and the bank's directors met periodically from February 27 to March 19 at the Boston Exchange Coffee House to discuss the organization of the bank. On April 1, 1818, the bank opened for business in rented offices on State Street until the bank moved permanently to the corner of State and Kilby Streets (currently occupied by either 75 State Street or Exchange Place) on April 17. Jackson owned 300 shares of the bank. By 1820, the limited waterpower of the Charles River led Jackson and his colleagues to establish the Merrimack Manufacturing Company to produce printed calico cloth at the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River. In 1822 he appointed himself as agent of Proprietors of Locks and Canals, gaining the ability to determine \\"who could start what mill and where in Lowell, and for how much\\". Incorporated as the town of Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1826, it was named for Francis Cabot Lowell. In 1830, problems of transportation and communication by canal and turnpike convinced Jackson to oversee the construction of the Boston & Lowell Railroad, the first railroad to receive a charter from the Massachusetts General Court, and established the standard American rail gauge. On May 27, 1835, it made its maiden trip to Boston, with Jackson, George Washington Whistler, and James Baldwin aboard. Although Jackson had hoped to retire after the railroad began operating in 1835, but his poor business decisions did not make that possible. For example, In the late 1830s, he liquidated nearly all of his interest in the Lowell Mills to invest it into real estate, which turned into a disaster. He died from a sudden attack of dysentery on September 12, 1847. Family In 1810 he married Lydia Cabot, whose brother Francis Cabot Lowell would become an important business partner/ The couple had nine children, including the writer Anna Cabot Jackson Lowell. He was also the brother of Charles Jackson, grandfather of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.. Holmes' father was a student of another brother, physician James Jackson.

Josef Greindl was born in Munich and studied at the Munich Music Academy with Paul Bender. His opera debut was in 1936, as Hunding in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre in the State Theatre in Krefeld. In 1944, Adolf Hitler included him in the Gottbegnadeten list (\\"God-gifted list\\" or \\"Important Artist Exempt List\\" of artists considered crucial to Nazi culture), which exempted him from the requirement to serve in the German military.Ernst Klee, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945, S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, , p.197. He played the part of King Marke in the 1952 Furtw√§ngler recording of Tristan und Isolde. This vintage recording often appears in critics list of the top 100 greatest recordings, since Kirsten Flagstad was also in the cast. He sang at the Metropolitan Opera in 1952‚Äì3. He sang in Wieland Wagner's last Ring. In 1973, he became a professor at the Vienna Hochschule and later died in that city (in 1993). His daughter Gudrun Greindl Rosner is also a singer. Greindl had a voice like a gravel quarry‚Äîmassive, wide, deep, rough, and ancient-sounding, grey-timbred rather than black. From the mid-1940s through the late 1960s he was one of the three or four leading performers of Wagner's and Mozart's big bass roles, possessing the size and strength for the former and the dexterity, brains, and extreme range for the latter. He frequently appeared as Fafner, Hunding, and Hagen in the same performance of the Ring Cycle, which made him the only singer in the cast who had to perform all four nights. His earliest recorded singing was at Bayreuth, as Pogner the goldsmith, a character in his fifties or sixties, in 1943 when he (Greindl) was 31 years old. Although he was not as tall as some other big basses, his stage-presence was formidable. He was not nearly as well-publicised as his frequent co-star Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but Josef Greindl's recorded repertoire is almost equally wide and full, including besides Mozart and Wagner beyond reckoning, operatic roles by Gluck, Verdi, Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Smetana, Weber, Flotow, Berg, Orff, Cimarosa, Lortzing, and Beethoven; lieder by Schubert, Schumann, and Carl Loewe; and sacred music by Bach, Handel, Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Verdi, Schubert, Dvorak, and Rossini. Although he was famous for the low bass parts, his top was very comfortable and he began experimenting with higher- pitched roles in the 1960s: Hans Sachs (at which he excelled), the Wanderer in Siegfried, the title character in Der fliegende Holl√§nder and even Don Alphonso in Cos√¨ fan tutte.New York Times obituary April 3, 1993 He can be seen on video as Hans Sachs, Hagen (brief excerpts only), Rocco, King Phillip, Geronimo in Il matrimonio segreto, the Commendatore, and as Hunding in a concert performance of Act I of Die Walk√ºre.

Built between 1391 and 1398, the Stecknitz Canal was the first European summit-level canal and one of the earliest artificial waterways in Europe. In the 1890s the canal was replaced by an enlarged and straightened waterway called the Elbe‚ÄìL√ºbeck Canal, which includes some of the Stecknitz Canal's watercourse. The original artificial canal was deep and wide; the man-made segment ran for , with a total length of including the rivers it linked. The canal included seventeen wooden locks (of which the Palmschleuse at Lauenburg still exists) that managed the elevation difference between its endpoints and the highest central part, the Delvenaugraben. History In the Middle Ages the trade between the North Sea and Baltic Sea grew dramatically, but the sea journey through √òresund, increasingly important to commercial shipping since the thirteenth century, was time-consuming and dangerous. Therefore, the emerging Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck and Eric IV of Saxe-Lauenburg agreed in 1390 to cooperate in the construction of an artificial canal between the Elbe and the Baltic Sea. Construction on the canal began in 1391; thirty barges carrying the first load of salt from L√ºneburg reached L√ºbeck on 22 July 1398. The Stecknitz Canal soon replaced the existing overland cart road as the main transport mode for L√ºneburg salt on the Old Salt Route. In L√ºbeck the salt was stored in vast salt warehouses and then transferred to ocean-going vessels for export throughout the Baltic region. In the reverse direction the Stecknitz barges transported cereals, furs, herring, ash, timber and other goods from L√ºbeck, which were reloaded in Lauenburg and transported down the Elbe to Hamburg. Later coal, peat, brick, limestone and gravel were added to the cargo. The importance of the canal was greatest in years in which √òresund was closed to merchant ships because of disputes over the Sound Dues and foreign shipping. Dollinger points out that the revenue from canal tolls doubled in 1428/29 after √òresund was closed. In the fifteenth century traffic peaked, with more than 3,000 shipments of more than 30,000 tons of salt moving on the canal each year. This number declined by the seventeenth century to 400 to 600 shipments (5,000 to 7,000 tons). In 1789 there were still sixty-four shipments carrying approximately 680 tons of salt. Plans for a new Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea canal were proposed as early as the seventeenth century, but none was implemented until the end of the nineteenth century, when the new Elbe‚ÄìL√ºbeck Canal was built using parts of the old route of the Stecknitz Canal. For five hundred years the canal was used to transport the \\"white gold\\" and other goods; today the Palmschleuse lock in Lauenburg is one of the last remaining parts of the former canal, preserved as an historical monument. Technology The Palmschleuse lock in Lauenburg, a preserved original lock from the Stecknitz Canal The Stecknitz Canal consisted of an artificial waterway (the Delvenaugraben) linking two minor rivers, the north-flowing Stecknitz and south-flowing Delvenau. The man-made trench itself was about deep and wide, though it was enlarged between 1821 and 1823 to a depth of and a width of . Outside the artificial segment the canal followed the tortuous natural watercourses of the two rivers; as a result, the full journey from Lauenburg to L√ºbeck stretched to a distance of , even though the straight-line separation between the two cities is only . The journey along the canal often lasted two weeks or longer due to the number and primitive design of the locks and the difficulty of towing. The canal's course originally included thirteen locks, which later renovations increased to seventeen. Initially most were one-gate flash locks built into weirs (usually set below the mouth of a tributary creek), where water was dammed until a barge was ready to pass downriver. In Lauenburg the initial course included one chamber lock (the Palmschleuse) because of a watermill whose operation would have been made impossible by a flash lock. Over the course of the canal's lifetime further flash locks were progressively converted to chamber locks until the 17th century. The canal overcame the drainage divide between the North and Baltic Seas, with a summit height of above sea level. In order to supply the top portion of the canal with water, flow was diverted from Hornbeker M√ºhlenbach. To the north the canal descended to the Ziegelsee by the town of M√∂lln and then connected to the Stecknitz by a series of eight locks. The southern end of the artificial canal descended to the Delvenau through a staircase of nine locks. Barges and drivers The Kringelh√∂ge, the old Stecknitz drivers' guild-house in L√ºbeck The original salt barges measured roughly by , with a draft when loaded to capacity with around 7.5 tons of salt, and required at least ten days to make the journey one way. When traveling uphill or through chamber locks the barges had to be hauled by laborers or animals walking the towpath on the banks of the channel. By the nineteenth century newer vessel designs included rigging that eliminated the need for towing (with sufficient wind). In Lauenburg and L√ºbeck the barges were unloaded and their contents transferred to ships for export down the Elbe and Trave. Stecknitz barge drivers were only permitted to own one barge each, so they could not acquire great wealth in the trade; in the long run this ensured their dependence upon the L√ºbeck salt merchants, who were not bound by any such limitations and amassed great fortunes. The guild of the Stecknitzfahrer (Stecknitz barge drivers) still exists today in L√ºbeck and meets annually at the Kringelh√∂ge to celebrate the guild's history.

The airport is one of the busiest in Mindanao, especially considering its classification. It is classified as a secondary airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), a body of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) responsible for the operations of airports in the Philippines except the major international ones. In 2005, the airport handled 75,751 passengers. Its passenger traffic has grown at least 52% from year 2000 statistical figures with an average annual growth rate of around 10.4%.Aircraft, Passenger and Cargo Traffic-Dipolog Airport Accessed May 14, 2007 History Aerial view of Dipolog Field in 1945 During the incumbency of Matias C. Ranillo Sr. as Governor of Zamboanga peninsula in 1937-1941, President Manuel Quezon and his daughters Zenaida and Aurora \\"Baby\\", were invited to inaugurate the opening of the first bridge linking Dipolog to nearby Dapitan in 1939. The bridge stands to this day as the Quezon Bridge. The 600-meter macadam airstrip was opened in October 1941, a few months before the outbreak of World War II, by then-Vice President Sergio Osme√±a and Chief of Staff Basilio Valdez. They inaugurated the airport on a flight on board a Douglas DC-2 of the Philippine Army Air Corps (PAAC). They were welcomed by Governor Matias C. Ranillo, Sr. but the entourage promptly proceeded to Dipolog Cathedral for a thanksgiving mass since the plane almost crashed at landing. Father Nicasio Yebes Patangan was the officiating priest. =Development= C-47 Skytrain 1945 The original terminal was made of composite wood material at the northern side of the runway near the Philippine Constabulary Camp, now Camp Hamac in Sicayab. During World War II, the field was overrun by rank grass. It was still used by Col. Hipolito Garma's guerrilla 105th Division, as a re-supply base for Wendell Fertig's guerrillas and as an emergency landing field.Smith, R.R., 2005, Triumph in the Philippines, Honolulu: University Press of the Pacific, In October 1944, Governor Ranillo led the Dipolognons to clear the runway at the request of the Filipino guerrilla forces. By 8 March, four divisions of 16 Vought F4U Corsair US Marine fighter bombers and the 13th US Air Force established base as part of the Victor IV liberation plan. They covered the landing of the 41st Infantry Division in Zamboanga on D-day scheduled on 10 March. It was completely restored in 1947 with the construction of a longer runway and bigger terminal that was relocated to the eastern side of runway 20. A new access road was also constructed, complementing its facility. Commercial operation by Philippine Airlines commenced in 1952 using a Douglas DC-3 aircraft for routes to and from Cebu City and Zamboanga City. Concreting and expansion of the runway was made in 1974 when a new taxiway and apron was built. A new terminal building was constructed in 1980, relocating the old terminal to where it stands to this day. A bigger parking area and new access road was opened with the new terminal. A control tower was added in 1991, and new runway lights were installed in 2004. The runway development as of this day The airport's strategic location during World War II and the liberation of Zamboanga and Mindanao by American and Philippine Commonwealth Forces in 1945 prompted the national government to develop the field as an alternate to Zamboanga International Airport principally for national security reasons arising from natural and man-made emergencies. This was made apparent during the tumultuous period of the Muslim Rebellion in the early 1970s. Its infrastructure at that time was testament to its strategic importance. =Commercial traffic= The late 1980s saw a dramatic upsurge in foreign tourist arrival. Aerolift Philippines launched flights to Manila using a Beechcraft 1900-C aircraft in 1987. The airport's commercial viability for growth was established as more flights were mounted by Philippine Airlines prompting the national government to introduce further development. The city government of Dipolog incorporated its growth potential in their development strategy plan. In 1992, after extending its runway by 500 meters and constructing a control tower, Dipolog Airport officially welcomed its first mid-size passenger jet, a Philippine Airlines Boeing 737-300. The same year, daily flights to Dumaguete were introduced by PAL using Short 360 aircraft but were dropped one year later. In 2002, at least 25% of the passenger traffic bound for Dipolog Airport was composed of foreign tourists. In July 2006, Cebu Pacific launched non-stop service to Manila using an Airbus A319 with a seating capacity of 150 passengers. In December 2006, it registered a maximum traffic of 330 daily passengers on several occasions based on the aircraft's available capacity serving the route with Philippine Airlines using the much bigger Boeing 737-400 with a seating capacity of 180 passengers. The airport was expected to handle more than 150,000 passengers per year by 2009 or an average of 415 daily passengers, which is equivalent to three narrow-body aircraft flights or two flights using one wide-body and one narrow-body aircraft. During the incumbency of former Mayor Evelyn Uy, the City Government built a bridge and an access road to Barangay Barra cutting travel time to and from the City's Business District. =Future development= In 2018, the Department of Transportation (DOTr), through Secretary Arthur Tugade, planned to upgrade Dipolog Airport, and other local Philippine airports to handle evening flights. Airlines and destinations A Philippine Airlines Airbus A320 at Dipolog AirportDue to cancellation of flights following the COVID-19 pandemic, this list is no longer current and destinations are subject to change without prior notice. Structure =Terminal= Dipolog Airport Terminal Building The airport has one terminal and a 150-meter by 100-meter apron. The apron is capable of supporting two Airbus A320s and three large general aviation planes simultaneously. There are plans to expand the apron to accommodate bigger aircraft. The terminal building, which originally had a capacity of 170 passengers, now has a seating capacity of 300 passengers due to new flights offered by Cebu Pacific. The terminal houses a metal detector and an X-ray machine for fast security check-in of passengers and their baggage. Dipolog Airport Fire Station Dipolog Airport parking area was converted to a security buffer zone. The new parking area is outside the gate near the Miss Universe Garden. =Other structures= The airport has a modern control tower, a Category V fire station with four firetrucks and a new parking area complex near the Miss Universe Garden. The new parking area would have a capacity of 100 vehicles when completed by the end of the year. The old parking area, which had a capacity of ninety vehicles, was partially converted into an security buffer zone, to address probable terrorist threats. Forty slots of the old parking area were made part of the new parking area. The city government is expanding again the parking area to accommodate the additional passenger traffic toward the vicinity of the Miss Universe Garden. There is a mini-garden at the runway side of the terminal that contains a grotto. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) had put up the Heroes' Lounge for use of members and retirees of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines Medal of Valor and Philippine National Police Medal of Valor awardees, together with their families. Dipolog Airport is one of the 24 airports in the Philippines to have a lounge dedicated to uniformed personnel and family members. Master plan =Third Airport Development Project= The Dipolog Airport upgrading project was part of the 1997 Third Airport Development Project, a six-airport package that was supposed to be funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the Philippine government with its counterpart fund. However, the Philippine government failed to provide on the counterpart fund for the $93 million project. The ADB loan was cancelled effective May 31, 2003. Scope of work Designs for rehabilitation and upgrading were undertaken by COWI-NACO JV, with three local sub-consultants: TransAsia, Basic Team and COWI Philippines. The scope of works included: # Runway rehabilitation, extension and widening, and improvements of taxiways and aprons # Grading of safety areas adjacent to the runway # Construction of proper fencing between airside and landside areas # Installation of x-ray equipment # Upgrading of terminal and construction of new cargo building and other support facilities to increase service levels to handle forecast traffic for year 2010 # Installation of runway, approach lights and navigational aids in order to meet the international ICAO safety and security standards # Expansion of utility facilities such as water supply and sewage treatment and # Improvements of landside parking facilities. As of April 2007, only items numbers one, two, five, six, and seven were not yet implemented due to huge budgetary requirements. =Southern Philippines Airport Development Project= DOTC repackaged the project in 2005 into the Southern Philippines Airport Development Project for funding. By 2006, ADB reconsidered Dipolog Airport as one of only three of the six airport projects to be considered for funding based on the request of airline companies operating on the approved facilities, commercial viability, and passenger traffic. =ADB Proposed Project Package= *Total project cost estimate: 731 million pesos *Government counterpart: PHP 115 million **Repair and completion of shoreline protection structure (seawall) and land reclamation *Currency rate conversion: 57 PHP per 1 USD *Date of completion: 2009 Components The airport as seen from above *Runway extension, widening and asphalt overlay of the entire length **2,500 X 45 meters *expansion of the taxiway, apron and terminal building **apron capacity ***1 wide-body stand ***2 narrow-body aircraft stands ***2 general aviation stands *construction of cargo building *installation of approach lights ILS and radar equipment References External links *Zamboanga del Norte: Province Brief History *Profile of Dipolog Airport by the Dipolog city government. *Airport Investors Report, July 2006 *Zamboanga airport closed as aircraft blocks runway, by Bong Garcia, MINDANAO NEWS *Govt readies new superbody to replace airport agencies, By Darwin G.

The building was designated Grade I listed in 1952. History Constructed in the first half of the reign of Henry VIII, Layer Marney Tower is in many ways the apotheosis of the Tudor gatehouse, and is the tallest example in Britain. It is contemporaneous with East Barsham Manor and Sutton Place, Surrey, with which latter building it shares the rare combination of brick and terracotta construction.Harrison, Frederic. Annals of an Old Manor House: Sutton Place, Guildford. London, 1899, p.163 The building is principally the creation of Henry 1st Lord Marney, who died in 1523, and his son John, who continued the building work but died just two years later, leaving no male heirs to continue the family line or the construction. What was completed was the main range measuring some three hundred feet long, the principal gatehouse that is about eighty feet tall, an array of outbuildings, and a new church. The buildings suffered considerable damage from the Great English earthquake of 1884, and a subsequent report in The Builder magazine described the state of the house as such that ‚Äòthe outlay needed to restore the towers to anything like a sound and habitable condition would be so large that the chance of the work ever being done appears remote indeed‚Äô. The repairs were begun by brother and sister Alfred and Kezia Peache, who re-floored and re-roofed the gatehouse, as well as creating the garden to the south of the Tower. The next owner was Walter de Zoete who carried on and expanded the work, with a team of 13 domestic and 16 outside staff. He enlarged the gardens, built a folly known as the Tea House (converted to a self-catering holiday cottage in 1999), and converted the stables into a Long Gallery where he housed his collection of furniture, paintings and objets d‚Äôarts. As a consequence of all this work it would be fair to say that the interior owes more to the Edwardian aesthetic of Walter de Zoete than to the Marneys. Walter de Zoete lost money in the Japanese stock market crash, and sold the house to a Dr and Mrs Campbell. The house came to the present owners, the Charringtons, in 1959. Gerald and Susan Charrington had been married in Layer Marney church in 1957; two years later Mrs Campbell‚Äôs executors put the house up for sale and the Charringtons purchased it. It has been occupied by the Charrington family ever since. The gardens are listed as Grade II on the English Heritage Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England,\\"Layer Marney Tower, Colchester, England\\" at parksandgardens.ac.uk while the building itself was designated Grade I in 1952.Layer Marney Tower, British Listed Buildings, accessed 17 June 2016. In 2012 the tower and gardens are open to the public from 1 April to 30 September for a small admission fee. The tower is also available for wedding ceremonies and receptions, as well as conferences. It has proved popular as a media location. Films and television programs which feature shots of Layer Marney Tower include Preaching to the Perverted, Pasolini's Canterbury Tales, and Lovejoy.

Administrative Services Administrative services are emphasized in providing assistance to students in registration, obtaining learning materials, applying for credit transfer, and addressing other matters that can influence students‚Äô study process. Student Assessment The assessment of student learning is based on: tutorial assignments, practical works, practicum assignments, and final examination. These components reflect students‚Äô overall learning achievement and contribute to the semester final grades of the students. UT administers final examinations at the end of every semester or twice a year. Final examinations are conducted as supervised pencil-paper tests simultaneously throughout the country. Students who take the Bachelor (Sarjana/S1) Programs are required to take the Program's Final Assignment at the end of the program as part of the requirements. Students who take the Master Programs (S2) are required to write Master Program's Final Assignment (a thesis) and pass the final oral examination. For certain courses and cases UT also offers the opportunity for students to take the examination on-line. Final grades are announced via various methods including through UT website, and UPBJJ-UT. Credit Transfer UT students may apply for credit transfer for courses previously taken from other accredited universities.

Portugal Telecom became a partner in 1997.A Portugal Telecom, British Telecom e a MCI anunciam Alian√ßa Estrat√©gica , in Portugal Telecom's site Concert was the first multi-service global end-to-end telecommunications provider,MCI and British Telecom are getting a concerted jump on the competition but is being first enough? XXVth REPORT on Competition Policy - 1995 which broke the global national telecom monopoly on both international and in-country services. Its aim was to provide single deliverer end-to-end connectivity to multinational corporations. Its speed of global service coverage and availability was gained by leasing bandwidth from national telecoms companies, unlike competitors like FLAG or Global Crossing who physically laid cables in oceans, roads and pavements. After the breakdown of the BT/MCI relationship, it became a joint venture between BT and AT&T; in 1999. After BT and AT&T;'s relationship broke down in 2001, Concert's assets were split between the two parties and merged into their regional operations in 2002. Business need for Concert In 1992, Sir Iain Vallance's SCOOP project in BT (later called Project Sovereign BTs History ), objective was to rid the organisation of its Civil Service culture, and create a strategy to develop to create a global-level competitive group. This needed two deliverables in the business plan: *UK based \\"the customer is King\\" approach, with a structure focused on specific market sectors *global carrier level services, which removed the problem of B-end delivery by owning the whole route. At the time, international telecommunications services were based on agreements between national telecommunication providers wholly \\"owning\\" their countries territory Concert was developed to address the second deliverable - the conductor of global business. It was recognised in the strategy for Concert, that the organisation (i.e. - BT and Concert combined) could not own the world - nor would it want to, as some markets may be key to certain customers, but not to the overall strategy. Secondly, the regulation of global communications was broken down into national, regional, and global based regulators - to address them all would be highly complex, but most importantly slow rollout speed of the service. Resultantly, Concert had to be seen to be an independent organisation of its founder BT. It was decided to locate Concerts global HQ in North America, the largest global telecommunications market. Reston, Virginia was chosen as it was both easily accessible from Europe, and sat in the then developing telecommunications and technology corridor of Northern Virginia. Concert started building its Global network in 1993;European diversions in telecom unlike its competitors FLAG and COLT who physically built their network using their own assets, Concert grew rapidly by purchasing capacity from other TelCo's. Concert with MCI In June 1994 BT and MCI (who had been talking to European rivals France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom about the same idea http://www.thunderbird.edu/wwwfiles/pdf/about_thunderbird/case_series/a07980014.pdf), launched Concert Communications Services, a $1 billion joint venture between the two companies. MCI had been in trouble for a while and needed cash - while BT needed a partner for Concert and access to the North American market: BT resultantly bought 20% of MCI to secure the deal, and inject the needed cash.British Acquire 20% of MCI - New York Times Concert's aim was to build a network which would provide easy global connectivity to multinational corporations. A series of Concert products were announced, which were based on Concert's global delivery platform, to fulfill its stated mission to develop a portfolio of enhanced telecommunication services targeted at multinational corporations. These services were available to purchase from both the owners, plus a series of partners who signed into the Concert global platform around the world.AT&T; Loses Out In Latin America To British-MCI Link : Spain Firm Switches Sides in Deal On Phones - International Herald TribuneJapan Telecom to offer Concert global communications services and dedicated global account management to leading multinationals. - M2 Presswire - HighBeam Research Concert's portfolio of services included:Global Alliances of Telecommunications Companies - Forms of Organizations *Global virtual network services - voice, switched data, and conferencing *Global managed data services - low and high speed packet switching and frame relay as well as pre- provisioned, managed, and flexible bandwidth services. These services included the integration of the former Tymnet network *Global application services - messaging, electronic data interchange, e-mail, and videoconferencing *Customer management services - network management outsourcing According to Concert, by August 1995 Concert products encompassed approximately $700 million contracts with 2,000 customers in 40 countries and 800 cities.

It is the fifth and final book in the award-winning Hatchet series, which deals with Brian Robeson, a boy who learns wilderness survival when he is stranded after a plane wreck. Plot summary Brian, who is now sixteen years old, is canoeing through the Canadian wilderness. He realizes that the woods are now his home and he will never be happy in modern society with its noise, pollution, and inauthentic people. He now spends his time in the wild hunting, fishing, and home schooling himself. While Brian does not miss human contact, he finds his thoughts frequently turning to Kay-gwa-daush (also known as Susan), the only daughter of the Cree family who rescued him at the end of Brian's Winter. Though he has only seen her photograph, her family has described her as an adventurous, self-reliant young woman, and Brian wonders if she might be a kindred spirit. While canoeing, Brian finds a seriously wounded Malamute dog, which he nurses back to health. The dog is clearly domesticated, and Brian begins to worry that whatever maimed the dog may have done the same to her owners. He remembers his Cree friends, the Smallhorns, and decides to go check on them. When Brian reaches their cabin, he finds that a bear had killed the parents and apparently chased Susan into hiding. Brian returns her to her home and buries the family while she radios for help. The authorities arrive to take Susan to relatives in Winnipeg. Brian, along with the dog, stays behind in order to hunt down and kill the bear, knowing very well that the hunt could cost him his life. Brian uses skills he has learned (explained in past books Hatchet, Brian's Return, and Brian's Winter) to search for the bear that killed his friends. He finds bear tracks on an island and begins to follow them. He later realizes that he was walking in a circle. Soon, the hunter becomes the hunted. The bear is actually following Brian. The next day, instead of moving on, he waits for the bear. After a hard-fought battle with the bear, Brian is triumphant.

It is a long, narrow islet, long. It is in the centre of the Abaco Islands and is near Gumelemi Cay. It is about 8 miles from Marsh Harbour. Approximately 150 people live on the island, mostly along the five and a half mile long stretch of beach. Great Guana Cay's settlement is known for its loyalist culture and architecture, as well as its social scene. Several traditional loyalist homes are in the settlement, which wraps around a natural harbor.  Overview  Great Guana Cay is an Abaco barrier island that hosts elkhorn and staghorn coral reefs. It also contains a large amount of virgin forest, where migrating birds and resident Abaco species live. Loggerhead sea turtles, green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles nest on the island's beaches. Both white-crowned pigeons and white-tailed tropicbirds nest on the island. Before removal of the crabbing-ground mangroves by a golf development, land crabs such as mountain crabs were common and were hunted for food by the native population. A cove on the island called Kidd's Cove was named after the pirate William Kidd.  Baker's Bay controversy  Great Guana Cay came to international attention in conservation circles when the residents of the island grouped to form Save Guana Cay Reef, an organization designed to fight the large footprint of the Baker's Bay Golf & Ocean Club, located at Baker's Bay.

Fifteen years after completion of The Four Musketeers, much of the cast and crew reassembled to film The Return of the Musketeers (1989), loosely based on Dumas' Twenty Years After (1845). Plot During the Anglo-French War (1627‚Äì29), which involved suppression of the Protestant rebels of La Rochelle, Cardinal Richelieu continues the machinations he began in The Three Musketeers by ordering the Count de Rochefort to kidnap Constance Bonancieux, dressmaker to the Queen Anne of France. The evil Milady de Winter, who wants revenge on junior musketeer d'Artagnan, seduces him to keep him occupied. He soon discovers her true nature, however, and also that she was once married to his fellow musketeer Athos, who had supposedly killed her after discovering that she was a branded criminal. The trio of musketeers ‚Äî Athos, Porthos, and Aramis ‚Äî rescue Constance from imprisonment in Rochefort's abode of Saint Cloud and take her to safety in the convent of Armentieres. De Winter sends d'Artagnan poisoned wine and a note intended to trick him into thinking that the trio have been imprisoned for drunkenness. On his way to bail them out, d'Artagnan is attacked by Rochefort and his men. The trio join the fight, and Rochefort flees. One of his men is captured and tortured for information, revealing that Richelieu is going to the Dovecote Inn near La Rochelle, but then drinks the poisoned wine and dies, revealing de Winter's trap. The trio then proceed to the inn where they spy on Richelieu. The Cardinal orders de Winter to threaten the Duke of Buckingham with exposure of his affair with the Queen, to discourage him from sending a relief force to aid the rebels; she is to kill the Duke if he does not comply. In return, de Winter asks for a warrant, so she can kill d'Artagnan and Constance. Richelieu reluctantly signs one, wording it in a way that leaves no evidence against himself: \\"By my order and for the good of the state, the bearer has done what has been done.\\" After revealing himself to de Winter, Athos takes the death warrant from her and later tells d'Artagnan of the plot. D'Artagnan sends his servant Planchet to warn the Duke. In England, de Winter asks Buckingham not to help the rebels, but he refuses. De Winter tries to assassinate him, but she is captured. Buckingham has his servant John Felton lock her away in the Tower of London, but she seduces Felton and convinces him that Buckingham is his enemy. Felton helps her to escape and return to France, then murders Buckingham before Planchet can warn him. Soon after, La Rochelle surrenders. Rochefort and de Winter are still intent on killing d'Artagnan and Constance. With a force of guards, they occupy the convent at Armentieres and battle all four musketeers when they arrive. While Rochefort and his men hold the musketeers at bay, de Winter strangles Constance. Athos captures de Winter; D'Artagnan duels Rochefort and apparently kills him with a lunge through the chest (though it is revealed in the sequel The Return of the Musketeers that he actually survived the wound). The four musketeers sentence de Winter to death by beheading, and they hire an executioner to carry out the punishment. Afterward, they are arrested by the Cardinal's guards. Richelieu charges d'Artagnan with murder for killing a valuable servant of the State, but d'Artagnan shows him the signed death warrant which, due to its ambiguous phrasing, appears to authorize d'Artagnan's actions. Defeated and quite impressed at d'Artagnan's achievement, the Cardinal offers him a commission for either him or one of his three friends to become an officer. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis all reject it, and d'Artagnan is promoted to Lieutenant of the Musketeers.

The decision was therefore made to split the project into two films, and thus the two halves were released as The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers some six months apart. Most of the actors were incensed that their work on the long shoot was used to make an entirely separate film, while they were only being paid for the work of one. Lawsuits were filed on behalf of those contributing to the film to gain the salaries and benefits associated with a second film that was not mentioned in the original contracts. All SAG actors' contracts now have what is known as the \\"Salkind clause\\", which stipulates how many films are being made. Reception and awards The film received mostly positive reviews. It was also nominated at the 48th Academy Awards for Best Costumes (Yvonne Blake and Ron Talsky).

History The manor of West Malling was given by King Edmund I to Burgric (or Burhic), Bishop of Rochester, in 946. The land was lost to the church in the Danish Wars but was restored to the diocese in 1076. About 1090, Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester and monk of Bec Abbey in Normandy, chose Malling as the site of his foundation for a community of Benedictine nuns, one of the first post-Conquest monasteries for women. Just before his death in 1108, Gundulf appointed the French nun Avicia as the first abbess. Gundulf had endowed the community with the manor of Malling and Archbishop Anselm had given the manor of East Malling. Royal grants gave the nuns the rights to weekly markets and annual fairs as well as wood-cutting and pasturage rights in nearby royal forests. Bequests and gifts also added to the community's income. The western end of the Norman abbey church of St Mary's Abbey, probably completed towards the end of the 12th century. As the abbey prospered, West Malling became a flourishing market town. In the four-and-a-half centuries of Benedictine life at the abbey, major events included a fire in 1190 which destroyed much of the abbey and town, the Black Death in 1349 which reduced the community to four nuns and four novices, and the surrender of Malling to the Crown on 28 October 1538 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last elected abbess, Elizabeth Rede, had been deposed when she defied both Henry VIII and Thomas Cranmer over the appointment of a high steward for the abbey. Margaret Vernon, who had been tutor to Cranmer's son, and had already surrendered Little Marlow Priory, was appointed Abbess of Malling in her place. On 28 October 1538, two agents of the Crown seized the abbey seal and signed the deed of surrender, but apparently were unable to persuade a single nun to sign. Immediately before the Dissolution, Malling Abbey had an annual income of ¬£245, placing it among the wealthiest third of women's communities in England. With its outlying lands, its Norman church, Early English cloister, early 15th century guest house and two early 16th century gatehouses, it was a rich prize for the Crown. During the 350 years that followed, the abbey was owned by many families, most being absentee owners. The buildings fell into ruin until the mid-1700s when Frazer Honeywood, a London banker, built a neo-gothic mansion and repaired the remaining medieval fabric. In 1892, the property was purchased by Charlotte Boyd whose life's work it was to create a trust to restore church property to its original use. She invited a small Anglican Benedictine community, the Community of Saints Mary and Scholastica, to settle at the abbey. This community had been founded by Fr Ignatius of Llanthony Abbey (Joseph Leycester Lyne) but had become independent of his rule in 1879, with Mother Hilda Stewart OSB as their abbess ‚Äì the first Anglican Benedictine abbess since the English Reformation. This community left Malling Abbey in 1911, joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1913 and now resides at Curzon Park, Chester. Present The Anglican Benedictine community of nuns that has made its home at Malling Abbey since 1916 was founded in 1891 as an active parish sisterhood. The sisters worked among the poor in Edmonton, north London, until they became attracted to the Benedictine contemplative life through the preaching of Abbot Aelred Carlyle. In 1906, they moved to a farmhouse in Baltonsborough, a remote village in Somerset, to begin their enclosed monastic life under Benedictine vows. In 1916, the trustees of Malling Abbey invited them to move to the more spacious and historic abbey and to continue its tradition of Benedictine prayer, worship, work, study and hospitality.'Houses of Benedictine nuns: The abbey of Malling', in A History of the County of Kent: Volume 2, ed.

The chimpanzee population in Mahale Mountains National Park is the largest known and due to its size and remoteness, the chimpanzees flourish.

The Mahale mountains were traditionally inhabited by the Batongwe and Holoholo people, with populations in 1987 of 22,000 and 12,500 respectively. When the Mahale Mountains Wildlife Research Center was established in 1979 these people were expelled from the mountains to make way for the park, which opened in 1985.

It is a bicameral state legislature, consisting of a 60-member Wyoming House of Representatives, and a 30-member Wyoming Senate. The legislature meets at the Wyoming State Capitol in Cheyenne. There are no term limits for either chamber. The Republican Party holds a supermajority in the current legislature, which began meeting in 2019; 51 of the 60 seats in the House and 27 of the 30 seats in the Senate are held by Republicans. History The Wyoming State Legislature began like other Western states as a territorial legislature, with nearly (though with not all) the parliamentary regulations that guide other fully-fledged state legislatures. =Women's Suffrage= During its territorial era, the Wyoming Legislature played a crucial role in the Suffragette Movement in the United States. In 1869, only four years following the American Civil War, and another 35 years before women's suffrage became a highly visible political issue in both the U.S., Britain, and elsewhere, the Wyoming Legislature granted all women above the age of 21 the right to vote. The legislature's move made Wyoming the first territory of the United States where women were explicitly granted the voting franchise. News spread quickly to other neighboring territories and states. In 1870, the Utah Territorial Legislature followed suit and granted the voting franchise to women. The move by the legislature was motivated by a number of factors, including bringing Eastern women to the territory to increase its population (it has consistently been among the least-populated states in America), to publicize the new territory, to bring more voters into the fold (both for existing political elites and again due to its small population), and by genuine concerns that women should be allowed the vote. Due to the territory's change of voting laws in 1869, the U.S. Congress was hostile to Wyoming and its legislature. During proceedings to make Wyoming a U.S. state in 1889 and 1890 in writing a new constitution that would continue female suffrage, Congress threatened to withhold statehood unless women's suffrage were abolished. After the Wyoming Legislature and territorial government sent a telegram back to Washington with the ultimatum that Wyoming would remain a territory rather than become a state without women's suffrage, Congress withdrew its threat, and on July 10, 1890, President Benjamin Harrison signed into law Wyoming becoming the 44th U.S. state. Wyoming's early entry into female politics continued into the 20th century. In 1925, Democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross became the first elected female governor of a U.S. state.

The 146th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 3, 2006. In the episode, Liane has problems controlling her son Cartman, and enlists several reality television shows to help with his problematic behavior. Plot After Cartman gets into trouble at school (forcing another student into a Saw-esque situation for calling him \\"chubby\\"), Liane admits that she cannot control her son anymore. She turns to Nanny 911 (whom Cartman psychologically harasses about her decision to not have children) and Supernanny (who ends up in a mental hospital sobbing and eating her own excrement while shouting \\"It's from Hell!\\"), but their attempts to change Cartman's behavior are unsuccessful. Desperate, Liane turns to Cesar Millan, the Dog Whisperer. Millan does not treat Cartman as a human child, instead using dog-training techniques. Millan's methods are extremely effective, leading to intense frustration from Cartman. After a period of time, Cartman's behavior improves, although he himself feels as if he is not in control of his own actions. As Liane enjoys her more flexible lifestyle, Cartman plots to kill his mother, although he cannot go through with his plan. With Cartman's behavior now in-check, Millan returns for a final visit. Liane thanks him and invites him on an outing, which he declines because he sees her as a client and not a friend. As her son was previously her friend, Liane asks Cartman to join her on the outing. After he refuses, Liane persuades Cartman to spend time with her, saying he can have anything he wishes, and Cartman returns to normal, an unsettling smile on his face. Reception IGNs Eric Goldman gave the episode a score of 8.0 out of 10, writing: \\"While not among the terrific episodes that began the season, this was a very fun installment of the show, and a nice spotlight on Cartman and what it might take to finally make him obey.\\"Goldman, Eric (May 6, 2006). \\"South Park: Tsst! Review\\". IGN. Retrieved October 27, 2016. Jordan B. Peterson praised the episode, calling it a brilliant exposition of a Freudian Oedipal situation.Peterson, Jordan (January 30, 2017). \\"2017 Maps of Meaning 3: Marionettes and Individuals (Part 2)\\" YouTube Retrieved April 4, 2017. When asked if he was offended by his caricature on the episode, Cesar Millan stated that he thought it and the entire episode was \\"fantastic\\". Cultural references There are numerous references to popular American reality television programs. Of the most prominent, shows such as Nanny 911 and Supernanny which are both British programs in origin are parodied extensively. Both TV show hosts Stella Reid and Jo Frost are portrayed having accentuated British accents and stereotypically bad teeth. Unlike the \\"real\\" television shows, neither Stella's or Jo's methods of disciplining unruly children work - ultimately forcing an insulted Stella to refuse to work with Cartman, and Jo Frost being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, eating her own excrement and repeating the phrase \\"It's from Hell!\\" The Dog Whisperer is also featured in the episode, along with show host Cesar Millan. A Skeksis from The Dark Crystal can be seen as one of the nannies. The visual effect of Cartman's angel and devil subconsciousnesses during the part where he almost attempts to kill his mother in her room was a similar reference to the 1997 science- fiction film Contact. The way Cartman changes as he makes his way down the hallway is a direct reference to the 1980 body horror film Altered States. As the episode ends, the closing shot of Cartman staring towards the viewer is a reference to the closing shot of The Omen (1976). Home release \\"Tsst\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007.

Their story is detailed in Midrash Eleh Ezkerah. Although not killed at the same time (since two of the rabbis listed lived well before the other eight), a dramatic poem (known as Eleh Ezkera) tells their story as if they were killed together. This poem is recited on Yom Kippur, and a variation of it on Tisha B'Av. Story as told in the poem Eleh Ezkerah In the poem,Text of Eleh Ezkerah poem the Roman emperor Hadrian decides to martyr ten rabbis as 'punishment' for the ten brothers listed in the Torah who sold their brother Joseph to Ancient Egypt.Genesis 37 He justifies this by saying that the penalty for this was death.According to Jewish law, one who kidnaps his fellow Jew and sells him into slavery is punished with death (Exodus 21:16) Though this crime took place almost 2000 years earlier, and Jewish law does not allow for the descendants of sinners to be punished,Deuteronomy 24:16 the Roman commander goes ahead with the executions because (he says) there are 'none like you' ten who are capable of rectifying this crime. The poem lists the first two to be executed: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha ha-Kohen Gadol. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel was beheaded, and while Rabbi Yishmael grieved, weeping over his severed head, the Roman ruler's daughter coveted Rabbi Yishmael for his physical beauty. When she was told that he would have to be executed as well, she asked that the skin of his head be flayed while he was alive, so she could stuff the skin and look at his face. When the servants began to strip away the skin on the forehead where the phylactery is placed, Yishmael cried aloud and died. Next to die was Rabbi Akiva, whose skin was raked with iron combs. Despite the pain consuming him, he was still able to proclaim God's providence in the world by reciting the Shema, drawing out the final Echad - \\"One\\". The next sage martyred was Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion, who was wrapped in a Torah scroll and burned alive. Wet sponges of wool were placed on his chestArtscroll, p. 933 to ensure he would not die quickly. When he was being burnt, he told his students that he could see the letters of the sacred Torah \\"flying up\\" to heaven. In the poem, the remaining martyrs listed are Hutzpit the Interpreter, Elazar ben Shamua, Hanina ben Hakinai, Yesheivav the Scribe, Judah ben Dama and Judah ben Baba, in that order. In Midrash Eleh Ezkerah, the order is somewhat different. =Listed Martyrs= # Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel # Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha ha-Kohen # Rabbi Akiva # Rabbi Haninah ben Teradion # Rabbi Hutzpit the Interpreter # Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua # Rabbi Hanina ben Hakinai # Rabbi Yesheivav the Scribe # Rabbi Judah ben Dama # Rabbi Judah ben Baba Historical evaluation Popular imagination seized upon this episode in Jewish history, and embellished it with various stories relating the virtues of the martyrs and the fortitude shown by them during their execution. These legends became in the Geonic period the subject of a special midrash‚Äîthe Midrash Asarah Harugei Malkut, or Midrash Eleh Ezkerah. The deaths are described therein as being gruesome. Contrary to the accounts given in the Talmud, Midrash Rabbah, and Midrash Eleh Ezkerah,Avodah Zarah 17b, 18a; Berachot 61b; Sanhedrin 14a; Lamentations Rabbah 2:2; Proverbs Rabbah 1:13 which clearly state that there were intervals between the executions of the ten teachers, the poem Eleh Ezkerah describes their martyrdom as occurring on the same day, probably in order to produce a greater effect upon the mind of the reader. Use in ritual The poem Eleh Ezkerah is best known as part of the Yom Kippur mussaf recital in the Ashkenazi ritual.Jewish Encyclopedia: The Ten Martyrs This was made part of these services because of the impact losing so many pillars of Judaism would have to the masses. As such, it has become one of the 'highlights' of the day, marking a point when the congregation should reflect on their own lives and the sacrifices that were made for their sake. A similar poem Arzei haLevanon is recited as one of the Kinot on Tisha B'Av. The Tisha B'av text (kinot #21), which is shorter than Yom Kippur's Eleh Ezkerah * places Judah ben Baba and Yesheivav the Scribe in a different order * says that there are ten, but omits Judah ben Dama and Hanina ben Hakinai * and adds that ** the body of Yesheivav the Scribe was fed to dogs; he \\"was not buried in a proper grave.\\"Artscroll Complete Tisha B'Av Service, p. 255 ** Elazar ben Shamua was killed while, on a Friday night, he was saying Kiddush.

In September 2018, he was one of 49 former Sri Lankan cricketers felicitated by Sri Lanka Cricket, to honour them for their services before Sri Lanka became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Early career He started playing first eleven school cricket at St. Benedict's College, Colombo, in 1960 and was a leading schoolboy cricketer in his time being amongst the best wicket keeper - batsman. He was adjudged the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1964. Domestic career Almost straight from school he was picked to tour India with the Ceylon team in 1964 under Michael Tissera. Although he didn't play in the unofficial tests, Ceylon beat India in the third unofficial test which was the country's first major victory overseas. He was selected to tour England with the Ceylon team in 1968, but the tour was cancelled just before it was due to begin.S. S. Perera, The Janashakthi Book of Sri Lanka Cricket (1832‚Äì1996), Janashakthi Insurance, Colombo, 1999, pp. 320‚Äì26. He won his first test (unofficial) Cap against Colin Cowdrey's England touring team in an unofficial test match in 1969 and since then played representatively for Ceylon/ Sri Lanka in unofficial tests and ODI both at home and abroad regularly, until retiring in 1979. He represented the Nondescripts Cricket Club from 1963 to 1979 and played in the Premier Division for an unbroken period of 16 years, captaining the club to many championship titles. Beyond cricket Having qualified as an Advanced Coach in 1982 with the National Cricket Association in England he served as one of the National coaches in Sri Lanka as soon as Sri Lanka was admitted as a full member of the ICC and was also instrumental in setting up a structured National Coaching Plan in the country. He toured with the Sri Lanka team, on its first official test tour as Assistant Manager handling the cricket aspects of the tour and continued to serve in national team management capacities from time to time for a number of years, juggling assignments with his own business responsibilities. He served on the Executive Committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka for 12 consecutive years, serving on the Coaching Committee for most of the time. He worked tirelessly concentrating on the aspects of fielding, and Sri Lanka's consistent development in fielding standards, even up to the winning of the World Cup in 1996 is attributed to his efforts. He also served as the Executive Secretary (Voluntary) of the Sri Lanka Cricket Foundation which was set up to support the needs of cricket in Sri Lanka, in keeping with its newly acquired status as a full member of the ICC. He succeeded the first Executive Secretary Mahinda Wijesinghe and conducted the affairs of the organization for three years. He also served as a National Selector from 1983 to 1988, and also in 2011, and was on the ICC Cricket Committee for a period, representing Sri Lanka. Having been introduced to television cricket commentary initially at the Cricketers Benevolent Fund Series (CBFS) in Sharjah, Ranjit Fernando has been the voice of Sri Lanka Cricket working as a TV commentator on almost all Sri Lankan series and other international engagements for a long time.

Practice and Implementation  At present, it is largely an individual choice rather than an organized social movement. Ethical living is an offshoot of sustainable living in which the individual initially makes a series of small lifestyle changes in order to limit their effect on the environment. Making the decision to start to live ethically can be as easy as beginning to recycle, switching off lights when leaving a room, buying local organic or fair trade produce, or eating less meat. Many people often go further by re-using/re-cycling waste water, using renewable resources in their homes such as solar panels or atmospheric water generators, or replacing driving with greener modes of transport such as biking. Many, however, believe that even more drastic lifestyle changes need to be made in order to combat climate change. For example, the impending increase in our world's population will likely exacerbate resource scarcity and increase carbon emissions. For this reason, many believe that ethical living could mean taking control of one's reproductive health and \\"requires social solutions such as increasing women's empowerment in public and private life, and broadening the population movement beyond the family planning and reproductive health movements in order to raise its chances of success.\\" Krajnc, A. \\"\\"Can Do\\" and \\"Can't Do\\" Responses to Climate Change.\\" Global Environmental Politics, vol. 3 no. 4, 2003, pp. 98-108.

They were first produced by Playmates Toys in 2003. Despite their popularity, they only sold for a few years before being discontinued. Like Micro Machines, these micros were almost all about an inch and a half in length. The big selling point for this brand of micros was the ball bearing in the base for added speed, hence the brand name Speedeez. All cars included the ball bearing, but some of the aircraft did not. Vehicles The first series of Speedeez were all military related. These early releases contained both airplanes and ground vehicles. The later releases contained mostly cars. There are many desired models that have never been released in micro scale, before or since, that were sold including the Jeep Jeepster, the PT Cruiser, the Audi TT, the BMW Z3, the BMW Mini and the Dodge SRT-4. They also made a civilian version Hummer H2 that was quite popular, and produced a good variety of Chevy Corvettes and Ford Mustangs. Playsets Numerous playsets were also available. The most popular were the fold-out playsets that looked like real cars and could be folded open to reveal a larger playset for the micro vehicles. Three different playsets of this style were produced: the Mustang GT, the Mini Cooper, and the Hummer H2. These playsets were often voted among the top toys of the year.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox, and Brooklyn Dodgers between 1921 and 1933.\\"Lu Blue Statistics and History\\". \\"baseball- reference.com. Retrieved May 20, 2017. A native of Washington, D.C., Blue played professional baseball, principally as a first baseman, for 18 years from 1916 to 1933, including 13 years in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers from 1921 to 1932, the St. Louis Browns from 1928 to 1930, the Chicago White Sox in 1931 and 1932, and the Brooklyn Dodgers for one game in 1933. Blue was a switch-hitter who had a career on-base percentage of .402 and was one of the best fielding first basemen of his era. He interrupted his baseball career for military service in World War I and was later honored with burial at Arlington National Cemetery. In 2001, baseball historian Bill James ranked Blue as the 77th best first baseman of all time. Early years Blue was born in Washington, D.C., in 1897. He was one of two sons born to Charles H. Blue, a New Jersey native born in 1852, and Ida Mae (Reamer) Blue, a Pennsylvania native born in 1856.Census entry for Anna M. Blue and family.

Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Blue grew up a fan of the Washington Senators. Despite discouragement from his family, who thought baseball was a waste of time, Blue was determined to play baseball. He attended Briarly Hall Military School in Poolesville, Maryland, where his play for the school's baseball team drew the attention of professional scouts. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Blue began playing Martinsburg Blue Sox of the Blue Ridge League. He compiled a disappointing .216 batting average in 1916, but his average jumped to .319 with a .517 slugging percentage in 1917. A switch-hitter, Blue reportedly hit grand slams from both sides of the plate in the same game during the 1917 season. The Detroit Tigers purchased Blue's contract in the fall of 1917. He did not make the team in 1918 and was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving at Camp Lee in Virginia during World War I. After the war, the Tigers assigned Blue to the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast League. Blue appeared in 174 games for the Beavers in 1919 and compiled a .281 batting average. The following year, he appeared in 165 games for Portland and compiled a .291 average. =Detroit Tigers= In 1921, with Ty Cobb as the Tigers' new player-manager, Blue finally made it to the big leagues at age 24. He immediately became the Tigers' regular first baseman, starting 152 games at the position in 1921, and compiling a .308 batting average and a .416 on-base percentage. Blue later gave credit to Cobb for helping him to improve his performance as a hitter. Blue remained entrenched as the Tigers' starting first baseman for seven seasons, from 1921 to 1927. Blue was a reliable hitter in his years at Detroit, hitting above .300 four times, including a .311 season in 1924. He finished among the leaders in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player award three times for the Tigers: 10th in 1922, 19th in 1924, and 12th in 1925. In addition to hitting for average, Blue had a keen eye and a talent for drawing walks. He was among the league leaders in bases on balls ten times in his career (1921‚Äì1923, 1925‚Äì31). He finished his career with 1,092 walks. Driven largely by his ability to draw walks, Blue was also among the league leaders in on-base percentage four times, including a career-high .430 on-base percentage in 1931 ‚Äì second best in the American League. Blue's career on-base percentage was .402 ‚Äì 115 points above his .287 career batting average. With his ability to get on base, Blue was also a top run scorer, with 1,151 runs scored in his career, including six seasons with 100 or more runs and a career-high 131 runs as the leadoff hitter for the 1921 Detroit Tigers. Blue was also an excellent fielding first baseman. In 1,571 games at first base, Blue had 15,644 putouts and a career range factor of 10.60 ‚Äì almost 3.00 full points above the league average of 7.64 for first basemen in his era. In 1922, his range factor was 11.2 ‚Äì more than 4.20 points higher than the league average of 6.94. He had 1,506 putouts in 1922 and led American League first basemen in putouts in 1929 (1,491) and 1931 (1,452). He also led American League first basemen in assists in 1928 (107) and double plays (121). Often among the league leaders in fielding percentage, Blue would get to balls other first baseman could not touch. On September 8, 1922, Blue had two unassisted double plays in a single game. On June 19, 1923, Blue was knocked unconscious after being hit in the head by a ball during fielding practice. Blue nevertheless went to bat in the first inning and hit a single to right field. Blue was woozy from the pre-game blow and barely made it to first base. The Yankees agreed to allow a courtesy runner, and Blue later returned to finish the game. In 1927, Blue clashed with the Tigers' new manager, George Moriarty. Moriarty moved Blue from the leadoff spot to the seventh spot in the batting order. Blue's relationship with Moriarty deteriorated through the season, with Blue announcing at the end of the season that he would never play another game for the Tigers. =St. Louis Browns= On December 13, 1927, the Tigers traded Blue and Heinie Manush to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for Harry Rice, Elam Vangilder and a player to be named later. Blue and Manush both became stars for the Browns. In 1928, Blue appeared in 154 games, all at first base, and compiled a .281 batting average and 80 RBIs. He ranked among the American League's leaders in 1928 with 105 bases on balls (second), 116 runs scored (fourth), 14 home runs (sixth), 263 times on base (sixth), 57 extra base hits (eighth), a 4.7 wins above replacement rating (eighth among position players), and 250 total bases (tenth). He also led the American League's first basemen with 107 assists and 121 double plays turned. With former Tigers Blue and Manush in the lineup, the Browns compiled an 82-72 record and finished third in the American League. In 1929, Blue appeared in 151 games for the Browns, all at first base, and compiled a .293 batting average. He led the American League with 296 total times on base and ranked second with 126 bases on balls and sixth with a .422 on-base percentage. He also led the American League's first basemen with 1,491 putouts and ranked fourth with 88 assists. In 1930, Blue appeared in only 117 games, 111 at first base. He suffered from a sore arm in 1930, and his batting average slipped to .231. =Chicago White Sox= After a poor performance in 1930, the Browns sent a new contract to Blue reducing his salary of $14,500 to less than half that amount. Blue refused to sign on those terms, and on April 3, 1931, the Browns sold Blue to the Chicago White Sox. Blue returned to the leadoff spot for the White Sox and responded with one of the best seasons of his career. He compiled a .304 batting average and ranked among the American League leaders with 15 triples (second), 127 bases on balls (second), 309 times on base (third), a .430 on-base percentage (fifth), 119 runs scored (sixth) and 13 stolen bases (tenth). He also had an outstanding season defensively, leading the league's first basemen with 1,452 putouts, and ranking among the league leaders with 81 assists (third), 105 double plays turned (fourth), and a 10.14 range factor per nine innings (fourth). His 16 errors also ranked second in the league. He wound up 17th in the voting for the 1931 American League Most Valuable Player award. In 1932, Blue appeared in 112 games for the White Sox, including 100 as the team's starting first baseman. His batting average dropped to .249‚Äì55 points lower than the prior season. However, he ranked among the American League's leaders with 17 stolen bases (fifth) and 88 assists at first base (second), 106 double plays at first base (fourth), and a 10.91 range factor per nine innings at first base (second). He was eventually benched in favor of Billy Sullivan and released on February 2, 1933. =Brooklyn and Toronto= On April 19, 1933, Blue was signed as a free agent by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He appeared in only one game for the Dodgers on April 25, 1933, failing to hit in a single plate appearance. He was released by the Dodgers on April 29, 1933. Blue played 13 seasons in the major leagues and compiled a career batting average of .287 and a career on-base percentage of .402. He totaled 2,365 total bases, 1,696 hits, 1,152 runs scored, 1,092 bases on balls, and 109 triples. On May 8, 1933, Blue signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. He appeared in 113 games for Toronto and compiled a .259 batting average. Later years Blue was married at least twice. On June 9, 1924, he was married in Detroit to Pauline Chambers, a native of Texas.Marriage record for Luzerne A. Blue. Ancestry.com. Michigan, Marriage Records, 1867-1952 [database on-line].

Heyn is widely regarded as one of the best cover point fielders ever to represent Sri Lanka. In September 2018, he was one of 49 former Sri Lankan cricketers felicitated by Sri Lanka Cricket, to honour them for their services before Sri Lanka became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). School cricket Born to a cricketing family, his father Major General Bertram Heyn was also a cricketer for the All Ceylon team. Heyn began his cricket career at St Peter's College in Colombo, where he represented the school from 1961 to 1964, captaining in 1964. He also represented Colombo Schools against the Indian Schoolboys in that same year. Domestic career He represented the Burgher Recreation Club whilst in school, and played there until the 1969/70 season. He then played for the Nondescripts Cricket Club from 1970/71 until 1975/76, captaining in the 1974/75 season. His first-class debut was in 1964, playing 50 matches in total and compiling four hundreds (the highest being 136 against Indian Universities at Bangalore in December 1975). Note - at the time only Ceylon/Sri Lanka matches against foreign sides were classified as first-class. As Sri Lanka were unlikely to attain full test status at the time, Heyn emigrated to England in 1976. Here he played for Richmond Cricket Club in the Middlesex County Cricket League until 1983, captaining in 1979 & 1980\\\\. In 1979 he set a batting record with 5 hundreds in the league season. In 1981 he played 4 games for Berkshire in the Minor Counties Championship - unfortunately, further appearances were not possible due to work & family commitments. In 1984 he retired completely from the game at the age of 39, having played a season for Lensbury Cricket club.

Life Henry probably was a son of the Franconian noble Henry III Testa of Pappenheim, Imperial marshal of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Historians have speculated whether Henry Testa and Henry of Kalden are one and the same person, though recent research tends to the assumption of a father-son relationship. They are also rated as the builders of Kaltenburg Castle, erected between 1150 and 1180. The Pappenheim dynasty had held the hereditary marshal office since about 1100. Henry Testa was one of the leaders of the Third Crusade and is documented serving Emperor Frederick's son and successor Henry VI, while the latter was yet just King of the Romans, in his 1190/91 campaign to the Sicilian kingdom as his right by marriage to the Norman princess Constance. He participated in the unsuccessful siege of Naples, before intense summer heat, epidemics and supply shortages caused the Imperial troops to leave the siege early, and even Empress Constance was left behind and captured (released 1192). Henry Testa returned to Germany, and presumably died in 1191 at Monte Cassino. Henry von Kalden succeeded his father as Imperial marshal in the service of Emperor Henry VI. In 1194, when Henry VI finally subdued the peninsula and could invade Sicily, his marshal was with him. Back in Germany, he spent Christmas 1195 with the emperor at the Imperial Palace of Hagenau. Henry of Kalden was again sent to Catania, where he and Markward von Annweiler defeated a large resistance army of Sicilian nobles in 1197, sacked the city and took captive its bishop. Henry was one of the leaders of the Crusade of 1197 and led the Imperial army to Acre in September, however, the German princes denied his authority and chose Duke Henry of Brabant as commander. Nevertheless, when the crusaders heard of Emperor Henry's death in Messina, they had to return to Germany in order to secure their hereditary estates. Henry remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and entered the service of Henry VI's brother and successor in Germany, Duke Philip of Swabia. In the throne quarrel with the Welf prince Otto IV, he aided Philip against the forces of Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia in 1204 and against the Cologne citizens in 1206, as well as in the negotiations with Pope Innocent III. On 8 June 1208, however, Philip was murdered out of rage by the Bavarian count palatine Count Otto VIII of Wittelsbach. Henry of Kalden received permission from the Pope to track down and kill Otto to avenge his master's death. Granted, Henry killed him at Oberndorf, on the Danube, near Regensburg, and cut off his head. He nevertheless accepted the new circumstances and joined the side of the recently crowned Emperor Otto IV, whose closest advisor he became, arranging Otto's marriage with Philip's daughter Beatrice and moulding an aggressive Sicilian policy. After the December 1212 coronation of Henry VI's son Frederick II, however, Otto's position worsened and the marshal returned to the Hohenstaufen fold. He is last documented in 1214 deeds.

In England, the heir apparent to the throne, James Francis Edward Stuart, had just been born to the unpopular King James II of England, and baptised a Catholic. The letter asked William, who was a nephew and son-in-law of James II, to use military intervention to force the king to make his eldest daughter, Mary, William's Protestant wife, his heir. The letter alleged that the newborn prince was an impostor. The letter informed William that if he were to land in England with a small army, the signatories and their allies would rise up and support him. The Invitation briefly rehashed the grievances against King James. It claimed that the king's son was supposititious (fraudulently substituted) and that the English people generally believed him to be so.When the young prince was born, rumours immediately began to spread that he was an impostor baby, smuggled into the royal birth chamber in a warming pan. The true child of King James and Queen Mary was allegedly stillborn. The present consensus among historians is that he was almost certainly their real son. The letter deplored that William had sent a letter to James congratulating him for the birth of his son, and offered some brief strategy on the logistics of the proposed landing of troops. It was carried to William in The Hague by Rear Admiral Arthur Herbert (the later Lord Torrington) disguised as a common sailor, and identified by a secret code. The invitation caused William to carry out his existing plans to land with a large Dutch army, culminating in the Glorious Revolution during which James was deposed and replaced by William and Mary as joint rulers. William and Mary had previously asked for such an invitation when William started to assemble an invasion force in April of that year. This request was done through secret correspondence that had been taking place since April 1687, between them and several leading English politicians, regarding how best to counter the pro- Catholic policies of James. William later justified his invasion by the fact that he was invited, which helped to disguise the military, cultural and political impact that the Dutch regime had on England at a time his reign was unpopular and he feared a popular uprising. The signatories were: *Charles Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury *William Cavendish, Earl of Devonshire *Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby *Richard (Lumley), Viscount Lumley *Henry Compton, Bishop of London *Edward Russell *Henry Sydney (who wrote the Invitation) Danby and Compton were generally considered to be Tories (court party), the other five as Whigs (country party). After William's rise to power, five were elevated further in the peerage; Russell was made a peer with the mid-rank of Earl; and Compton as Bishop of London had his suspension (for refusing to suspend strongly anti-Catholic reverend John Sharp), running into a third year, lifted and performed the Coronation, granted lands granted in Maryland to his second cousin, and became a commissioner in revision of the litany.

In hopes of influencing voters in upcoming party congress elections, Vacul√≠k released the manifesto \\"Two Thousand Words to Workers, Farmers, Scientists, Artists, and Everyone\\" in several major Prague newspapers, complete with signatures of other public figures. The date was 27 June 1968, the day after preliminary censorship was abolished by the national assembly. In the \\"Two Thousand Words,\\" Vacul√≠k asked that the public \\"demand the resignation of people who have misused their power\\" by criticism, demonstrations, and strikes.Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k, \\"Two Thousand Words to Workers, Farmers, Scientists, Artists, and Everyone,\\" in From Stalinism to Pluralism: A Documentary History of Eastern Europe since 1945, ed. Gale Stokes (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 130. He also expressed concern over the \\"recent apprehension\\" regarding the reforms due to \\"the possibility that foreign forces\\"‚Äîthose of the Warsaw Treaty Organization‚Äî\\"may intervene in Czechoslovakia's internal development.\\"Vacul√≠k, \\"Two Thousand Words,\\" 130. If this were to happen, Vacul√≠k argued: > ‚Ä¶the only thing we can do is to hold our own and not indulge in any > provocation. We can assure our government‚Äîwith weapons if need be‚Äîas long as > it does what we give it a mandate to do. =Impact of the \\"Two Thousand Words\\"= Despite the overall moderate tone and Marxist‚ÄìLeninist orthodoxy,Crampton, Eastern Europe, 334. the \\"Two Thousand Words\\" called for action on the part of the public in case of military intervention and therefore denied the leading role of the party, as Vacul√≠k's 1967 speech had. It was popular throughout Czechoslovakia with both intellectuals and workers, and its popularity only increased after the party officially condemned it. It also significantly increased the concerns of the Soviet Union. Following the \\"Two Thousand Words,\\" Leonid Brezhnev's party leadership, seeing a situation similar to that in 1956 Hungary developing,Renner, History of Czechoslovakia, 67. used the term \\"counterrevolution\\" to describe the Prague Spring for the first time.Alan Levy, So Many Heroes, (Sagaponack, NY: Second Chance Press, 1980), 166. If a counterrevolution was taking place (and the Soviet Union was increasingly disposed to categorising the events in Czechoslovakia as such, as other radicals continued to act and Dubƒçek failed to gain their confidence), socialism as the Soviet Union saw it was threatened and invasion by Warsaw Treaty Organisation troops, as occurred 20‚Äì21 August 1968, was deemed justified. This policy of the acceptability of using force wherever socialism was thought to be threatened would become known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, and Vacul√≠k's \\"Two Thousand Words\\" was an integral step toward this early application of it. Vacul√≠k as a dissident After Gust√°v Hus√°k came to power in 1969 and censorship increased, Vacul√≠k (now no longer a party member) was part of the circle of dissident writers in Czechoslovakia. In 1973, he started Edice Petlice (Edition Padlock), a samizdat series that he ran until 1979. Others followed with their own series, despite harassment from the party's secret police.Igor H√°jek, \\"Traditions of Czech Literature: Curses and Blessings,\\" in Czechoslovakia 1918‚Äì88: Seventy Years of Independence, ed. H. Gordon Skilling (Oxford: Macmillan, 1991), 188. Some samizdat authors, including Vacul√≠k, were also published in the west.H√°jek, \\"Traditions of Czech Literature,\\" 189. The core of the samizdat authors eventually developed and signed the foundation document of Charter 77;Renner, History of Czechoslovakia, 126. Vacul√≠k attended the second of the planning meetings in December 1976.Havel, Disturbing the Peace, 132. On 6 January 1977, Vacul√≠k, along with Havel and Pavel Landovsk√Ω, an actor, attempted to take a copy of the charter to the post office to mail to the Czechoslovak government. Their car was pulled over by the Party secret police, and all three were taken in for interrogation. Other signatories were subsequently subjected to interrogations and searches of their homes, as well.Renner, History of Czechoslovakia, 138. In late 1978, however, Vacul√≠k published the article \\"Remarks on Courage\\", a piece that helped set the tone for criticism of charterists.Renner, History of Czechoslovakia, 135. Of the original signatories, most were from the intelligentsia in Prague and Brno,Crampton, Eastern Europe, 348. and Vacul√≠k and others warned against them becoming so isolated that average citizens could no longer relate to Charter 77. His criticism worked against a mythologisation of the Charter and ensured a continued discussion of its position and role. After communism Vacul√≠k continued to write; the official ban on his works was lifted in late 1989. He had a weekly column in Lidov√© noviny that featured feuilletons addressing various Czech political and cultural issues, just as much of his underground work during Communism had.Linda Mastalir, Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k: a Czechoslovak man of letters, Radio.cz Death Vacul√≠k died of natural causes at the age of 88 on 6 June 2015 in Dob≈ôichovice, where he lived by his son.Ludvik Vaculik: Writer and dissident whose 'Two Thousand Words' tract led to the Prague Spring and the Soviet invasion Bibliography *The Axe (1966) *The Guinea Pigs (1970) *ƒåesk√Ω sn√°≈ô (The Czech Dreambook) (1980) *A Cup of Coffee with My Interrogator: The Prague Chronicles of Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k (1987) The New York Times *Vacul√≠k, Ludv√≠k. \\"Two Thousand Words to Workers, Farmers, Scientists, Artists, and Everyone.\\" In From Stalinism to Pluralism: A Documentary History of Eastern Europe since 1945, edited by Gale Stokes, 126-30.

The unit provides Fire Support Teams (FST - formerly called Forward Observation parties) to control and co-ordinate Naval firesMOD Mission task List (Maritime) v2.01 dated Aug 05 (naval gunfire support, naval air delivered guided and unguided munitions) from Royal Navy and allied ships, land based air delivered munitions and artillery fire from the gun batteries of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, when ashore in support of 3 Commando Brigade. In support of this role, the battery provides FSTs to the Royal Navy when conducting training on a variety of gunnery ranges around the world. 148 Battery's FSTs comprise gunners of the Royal Artillery, already qualified members of the regiment when posted into the battery, augmented by Royal Navy communications personnel (signallers) who are required to undergo the All Arms Commando Course. All personnel within the battery are also parachute trained. The battery is supported by a Battery Fitter Section from 29 Regiment's attached Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Workshop, also commando qualified. The battery and its Battery Fitter Section are based at RM Poole in Dorset. History =Formation= Originally formed during the Second World War, the unit eventually evolved into the 95 Forward Observation Unit (95 FOU). In 1975 the unit was reduced to its current size and co-located with the SBS at RM Poole. It was tasked with providing FO teams to the Royal Marines, the Parachute Regiment; the ACE Mobile Force (Land) (AMF(L)) and the SBS. The smaller sized unit soon found it was unable to meet its many obligations. =The Falklands War= After the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, the unit deployed to the South Atlantic where it operated alongside both the SAS and SBS. The skills of the Commando- trained unit were in high demand as commanders re-discovered their usefulness. FO teams were relocated about the islands as the British advanced on the capital at Port Stanley. Three British civilians in Port Stanley were killed by British naval gunfire controlled by the unit, when a ships' gun beacon MIP radar malfunctioned. The three women were sheltering in a part of the town which the FO team officer had been briefed was free of civilians. The FO team were themselves in a very exposed position to the north of the town. The FO officer calculated the ship's error, but the ship's computer system did not indicate anything wrong, so after three rounds were fired the FO officer dismissed the ship from the firing line. The ship's weapons staff spent the next 24 hours going through their system, and discovered their radar had not locked onto the correct datum point, creating an error in firing equal to that calculated by the FO officer. The Argentine military command were very quick to announce this error as a deliberate act of aggression towards the Islanders. The FO team, which was still conducting covert reconnaissance and bombardment, learned of the tragedy from the BBC World Service.[McManners, Hugh. Falklands Commando]. FO teams called artillery fire and air strikes onto Argentine positions in support of every major British assault. With the Argentine surrender, the unit returned to their home in Poole. =Persian Gulf 1991= 148 provided teams initially in Northern Iraq and later assisted in the Scud missile hunt. =Balkan Wars= 148 provided fire support to various British formations. =Iraq= 3 Commando Brigade conducted an amphibious landing to occupy the Al Faw Peninsula during Operation Telic, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On the first night of the operation the unit suffered its first deaths of the war when a US Marine helicopter crashed close to the Iraq Border. =Afghanistan= Lance Bombardier Ross Clark aged 25 from South Africa, and Lance Bombardier Liam McLaughlin, aged 21 from Lancashire, were killed during a rocket attack in the Sangin area of Helmand province on 3 March 2007. Battery structure The battery is formed into a number of Fire Support Teams (FSTs), operating ashore or in advance of the Forward Edge of Battle Area, to observe and identify candidate targets, conduct preliminary Battle Damage Assessment, adjust fire or provide target illumination for laser guided weapons. The battery consists of HQ personnel, Fire Support Teams and administrative and logistical support personnel. A FST consists of five personnel; a patrol commander (a Captain Royal Artillery), with a Bombardier RA as the second in command (2IC). The rest of the team consists of a (Royal Navy) communicator, RA Lance Bombardier, and Gunner. The team can be split in two with the Bombardier commanding one team and the Captain the other. All unit members are capable of co-ordinating air strikes and directing artillery fire. Selection and introductory training Volunteers for the battery must first complete the All Arms Commando Course, and a basic parachute course. After Commando qualification, unless already Observation Post qualified, they then undergo six months of basic Gunnery Control training and Observation Post operations. Personnel are trained in infiltration and exfiltration, covert observation, target identification and location, voice and data communications, adjusting gunfire from both afloat and ashore, and Forward Air Control (FAC) techniques. Upon completion of the course a new Naval Gunfire Assistant (NGA) will be assigned to a Forward Observation team for a probationary period. Continuation and unit training Once a NGA has completed probation the candidate may be selected to undergo further amphibious training beyond that of AACC. During amphibious training, NGAs are trained in over-water parachute infiltration. Training is also conducted in Small/Fast Boat Coxswains; Small/Fast Boat operations and long-range surface navigation. Much of the training is conducted at night with this being the preferred time for covert infiltration and exfiltration. One team member (the team medic) is also cross trained as a combat medical technician with additional medical training in BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) and BARTs (Battlefield Advanced Resuscitation). The unit conducts training in various exercises and climates including mountain and arctic, jungle, desert and temperate. It regularly deploys with Royal Marines units to Norway for annual cold weather warfare training and to Belize for jungle warfare training. Given the similar skillsets there is a level of training with the USMC's Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO) and Netherlands Marine Corps Marine Joint Effects Observer Groups to standardise procedures to assure interoperability. Equipment The battery uses the vehicles and standard equipment of 3 Commando Brigade, supplemented with specialist observation capabilities; night vision, voice and data communications and target indication such as Laser Target Designators and GPS location. Personal weapons are the L85A2, with the L7 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMGs) and Minimi as support fire weapons. As of July 2020, the battery has began transitioning to the Colt Canada C8 rifles, similar to that of the USKF and the Royal Marines adapting the Future Commando Force perception.

At the close of the conference the participating governments signed onto the Warsaw Declaration, agreeing ‚Äúto respect and uphold core democratic principles and practices‚Äù including, among others, free and fair elections, freedom of speech and expression, equal access to education, rule of law, and freedom of peaceful assembly.‚ÄúWarsaw Declaration: Toward a Community of Democracies‚Äù, Toward a Community of Democracies Ministerial Conference, Warsaw, Poland, 2000-06-27. In closing remarks to the ministerial conference in Warsaw, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan praised the Community of Democracies as a positive development toward global democracy, saying. ‚ÄúWhen the United Nations can truly call itself a community of democracies, the Charter's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting \\"social progress in larger freedoms\\" will have been brought much closer.\\"  Structure  The CoD works on the base of the Warsaw Declaration. Since 2018, their work is more specifically guided by the Community‚Äôs Strategic Plan for 2018-2023 which identified the following strategic objectives: * Encouraging Adherence to the Warsaw Declaration * Support for Democratic Consolidation in Transitioning Countries * Deepening the Dialogue on the Challenges to Democracy Their internal structure include regular Ministerial Conferences, a Governing Council, a Chairmanship, a Permanent Secretariat headed by the Secretary General, six Working Groups as well as two Affiliated Bodies. = Governing Council = Currently, the Governing Council consists of the following Member States: Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Mali, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Norway, North Macedonia Nigeria, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Sweden, United States of America, Uruguay, and the United Kingdomhttps://community- democracies.org/?page_id=58 = Presidency = As of September 2019, the two- year Presidency of the CoD is held by Romania. Past Presidencies included: South Korea (2001-2003), Chile (2003-2005), Mali (2005-2007), Portugal (2007- 2009), Lithuania (2009-2011), Mongolia (2011-2013), El Salvador (2013-2015), the United States (2015-2017). Between Sept 2017-Sept 2019, the CoD was led by a collective chairmanship of the CoD Executive Committee. Ministerial Conferences are held towards the end of each presidency term in the capital of the presiding state, resulting in the adoption of a common declaration / plan of action towards the following activities of the Community: Warsaw 2000, Seoul 2002 (South Korea), Santiago 2005 (Chile), Bamako 2007 (Mali), Lisbon 2009 (Portugal), Vilnius 2011 (Lithuania), Ulaanbaatar 2013 (Mongolia) and Washington D.C. 2017 (United States of America)https://community- democracies.org/?page_id=8147 = Permanent Secretariat = Since 2009, a Permanent Secretariat of the CoD operates in Warsaw, providing technical, logistical, organizational and administrative support to all its bodies. The current head of the Permanent Secretariat and therefore Secretary General of the CoD is Thomas E. Garrett, appointed September 1, 2017. =Working Groups= Working Groups (WG) are action-oriented structures that drive the implementation of the strategic objectives of the Community of Democracies. WGs are composed of states, civil society representatives, and other democracy stakeholders. WG mandates are approved by the Governing Council, and they supported and coordinated by the Permanent Secretariat of the Community of Democracies. Currently, there are six Working Groups: * Working Group on Enabling and Protecting Civil Society * Working Group on Promoting Freedom of Opinion and Expression * Working Group on Women and Democracy * Working Group on Education for Democracy * Working Group on Elections * Working Group on CoD Governance and Effectiveness = Affiliated bodies = The CoD consults two external bodies on a regular basis.  Academic Advisory Board (AAB)  The Academic Advisory Board assists the work of the CoD by providing an academic perspective.  Civil Society Pillar  The Civil Society Pillar (also Civil Society Assembly) refers to the non-governmental process of the CoD, including civil society organizations, foundations, and experts devoted to promoting democracy. It is represented by the non-governmental \\"International Steering Committee\\" (ISC), which is composed of 26 leaders of civil society organizations from all regions of the world, the Chair and Vice- Chair and the organization which serves as the ISC's secretariat. In April 2018, Fundacion Multitudes was elected as the first Permanent Secretariat of the CSP and Paulina Ibarra as Chair of the ISC. The ISC advises governments on the actions needed to enable civil society to work freely to strengthen democracy, rule of law, and protection for the fundamental rights enshrined in the Warsaw Declaration. The ISC coordinates a variety of initiatives for civil society, including the civil society forum taking place in the biannual Ministerial Conferences of the Community, which results in a set of recommendations to the Ministerial Declaration made by civil society representatives. Other activities =Myanmar Constitutional Democracy Project= In 2018, the CoD finalised the Phase III of the Myanmar Constitutional Democracy Project, implemented cooperation with Australia- Myanmar Constitutional Democracy Project, that aimed to facilitate an inclusive constitutional framework, through embracing all stakeholders within society and providing them with the necessary legal tools and language to engage in the process of drafting and amending it. In 2018, the CoD published a Building a Democratic Constitutional Culture in Myanmar booklet, which contains a summary of fundamental principles and concepts of constitutional democracy with a particular focus on those most relevant to the situation in Myanmar. Together with the two constitutional democracy workshops, held in Myanmar in February 2018, the booklet constitutes an effort to increase the capacity of key stakeholders to participate in the process of democratic reforms in Myanmar, extend their knowledge on constitutional matters, as well as to contribute to the development and support of a culture of constitutionalism in Myanmar. = Advancing Women's Political Participation = To support women's participation in politics, the Community of Democracies implemented ‚ÄúAdvancing Women‚Äôs Political Participation‚Äù project, implemented in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and International IDEA. As part of the project, five regional consultations were held on the margins of large international democracy-related events in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Consultation brought together politicians, state officials, civil society activists, academics, and members of international and regional organizations to discuss gender equality and strategies for advancing women's political empowerment in the MENA region. The project's five regional reports and final report contain specific policy recommendations on the advancement of women's political participation in each region.

It stands on the main watershed between Borrowdale and Thirlmere and can be climbed from either flank. Walla Crag is a subsidiary top of Bleaberry Fell. Topography Situated in the central area of the national park, four kilometres (2¬Ω miles) south of Keswick, Bleaberry Fell is the northernmost top on the ridge that separates the valleys containing the lakes of Derwent Water (Borrowdale) and Thirlmere. This ridge, which also contains the fells of High Seat and High Tove, is notoriously boggy underfoot, but Bleaberry Fell is mostly dry and the heather-covered summit gives an excellent all-round vista. To the east the fell has the rock faces of Iron Crag and Goat Crags as it falls away towards the Thirlmere valley. Ascents The fell is usually climbed from the car park in Great Wood in Borrowdale, firstly ascending Walla Crag via Cat Gill and then continuing south-easterly for two kilometres (1¬º miles) to Bleaberry Fell which is clearly in view. The fell can also be climbed from Keswick, an 11-kilometre (7-mile) round trip, again going by Walla Crag. Walla Crag is in fact part of Bleaberry Fell, being the outlying north western crags, but is given the status of a separate fell by Lake District writers due to its excellent views and popularity. Another possible starting point is the hamlet of Dale Bottom on the main Keswick to Ambleside road. It is possible to continue from Bleaberry Fell southerly along the ridge to take in the other Wainwright fells of High Seat and High Tove following a line of old fenceposts. This ridge is very boggy.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Geology The summit of the fell is representative of the Birker Fell Formation. This is composed of plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas and subordinate sills. To the south en route to High Seat are garnet-bearing porphyric andesite.

Retrieved on 2006-11-14 was a self-taught Finnish weapons designer. Of the 50 weapons he designed, the best known is the Suomi M-31 SMG. Other well-known weapon designs of his include the Lahti-Saloranta M/26 LMG, Lahti L-35 pistol, and Lahti L-39 anti-tank rifle. Lahti also designed the 7,62 ITKK 31 VKT anti- aircraft machine gun and the 20 ITK 40 VKT anti-aircraft cannon. His work is considered decisive in defending Finnish independence and increasing trust in the reliability of domestic weapons produced there. Biography =Early years= Aimo Johannes Lahti was born in Viiala on 28 April 1896, to Evert Williamson Lahti and Ida Sophia Carlsdaughter n√©e Viitanen, the oldest of five boys. He had a safe and somewhat wild childhood. Lahti did not enjoy school and left after the sixth year of elementary school. He started working in the Viiala glass factory when he was 13 years old. In the same year, he bought his first weapon, a Berdan rifle, with five marks he had earned in the factory. Lahti was fascinated by the rifle‚Äôs mechanism and visited local gunsmith S√§teri with whom he examined the weapon closely. Aimo Lahti visited him several times, becoming familiar with weapon mechanisms. Lahti served his conscription in central Finland‚Äôs regiment during 1918 and 1919. On October 20, 1919, he married Ida Dagmar Lassila (1 December 1890 ‚Äì 27 October 1968) with whom he had a son, Olavi Johannes Lahti. Olavi was later a pilot in the Finnish Air Force and died in 1944. =Master Armorer in the Finnish Army= After working for the railway Aimo Lahti joined the Finnish Army as a Master Armorer in 1921. He was influenced in this decision by Captain Rosenholm. In 1922, he started to design the Suomi M-31 SMG after examining the Bergmann MP18, which had many design problems and was expensive. The new design was revolutionary because the reliability, accuracy, and rate of fire were excellent. The first 200 Suomi SMGs were produced in 1922. After the prototypes were made, he was ordered to work under the control of the Ministry of Defence and to design a light machine gun, which eventually would be the Lahti-Saloranta M/26. He then improved the Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle by designing the M/27 \\"Pystykorva\\" \\"Spitz\\", named for its foresight guards' resemblance to the dog breed's ears. This rifle was later issued to the Finnish Army as their service rifle. In 1932 Lahti and the Ministry of Defence signed two important agreements about Lahti's earnings and other economic benefits. It also gave the government rights to use and sell his designs. In the same year, he got an offer to move to an American weapon company. He was offered a check for 3 million marks and a five percent commission on the weapons that would have been produced in the United States. On the same day the Ministry reformed his older contract. Lahti received more benefits and rights to his inventions and therefore did not feel that moving to the United States was a better offer. Lahti continued to design weapons until the end of the Continuation War when the Allied Control Commission questioned him about the lost 30 \\"assault rifles\\" that he was designing and other topics. The commission made a decision that he would not be allowed to work as a weapon designer anymore. He enjoyed a Finnish Army‚Äôs Major General‚Äôs pension after the age of 50, until his death in 1970 in Jyv√§skyl√§ at the age of 74.

He served as Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court and as United States Senator from Vermont. Early life Born in Waterford, Vermont, son of Royal Ross and Eliza (Mason) Ross. Ross attended the public schools and St. Johnsbury Academy. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1851 and was principal of the Chelsea and Craftsbury Academies from 1851 to 1856. He studied law in the Chelsea office of former Congressman William Hebard, and later with Charles Davis of Danville and William A. Fletcher of Michigan; he was admitted to the bar in 1856. Career Ross was Treasurer of Passumpsic Savings Bank from 1858 to 1868. He practiced law in St. Johnsbury until 1870. After being State's attorney for Caledonia County from 1862 to 1863, he was appointed a member of the State board of education, holding that office from 1866 to 1870. From 1865 to 1867, Ross was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives and he was a State senator in 1870. He was a member of the State Board of Education from 1866 to 1870 and served on the Vermont Council of Censors in 1869. He was judge of the Vermont Supreme Court from 1870 to 1890 and Chief Justice of Vermont from 1890 to 1899. In December 1898, U.S. Senator Justin S. Morrill died. Governor Edward Curtis Smith offered to appoint Benjamin F. Fifield to the vacancy, and Fifield tentatively accepted. Several days later, Fifield declined, and Smith then offered the appointment to Ross, who accepted. He served from January 11, 1899 to October 18, 1900, when a successor was elected. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee to Examine Branches of the Civil Service (Fifty-sixth Congress). He was not an active candidate for reelection in 1900. In October 1900, Ross was elected president of the Vermont Bar Association, and he served a one-year term. In November 1900, he succeeded David J. Foster as chairman of the state board of railroad commissioners, and he served until being succeeded by Fuller C. Smith in November 1902. Death and burial Ross retired to his home in St. Johnsbury, where he resided until his death. He died on February 23, 1905 from injuries sustained when his sleigh was struck by a train a few days earlier. According to published accounts, Ross and his wife were stopped at a crossing while a train passed by. Their horse became frightened and dashed between two train cars, demolishing the sleigh and killing Mrs. Ross. The train crew transported Ross to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a broken hip and other injuries, and remained until his death. Ross is interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. His wives are buried at either side of his grave. Family Ross married twice. He married Eliza Ann Carpenter (1826-1886) on November 22, 1852. They were the parents of eight children, including Caroline C., Eliza M., Helen M., Julia, Martha E., Edith Helen, Edward H., and Jonathan C. In 1887, he married Helen Daggert, and they remained married until her death.

It occurs when the semiconductor junction is overloaded by exceeding its power density and absorbs too much of the produced light energy, leading to melting and recrystallization of the semiconductor material at the facets of the laser. This is often colloquially referred to as \\"blowing the diode.\\" The affected area contains a large number of lattice defects, negatively affecting its performance. If the affected area is sufficiently large, it can be observable under optical microscope as darkening of the laser facet, and/or as presence of cracks and grooves. The damage can occur within a single laser pulse, in less than a millisecond. The time to COD is inversely proportional to the power density. Catastrophic optical damage is one of the limiting factors in increasing performance of semiconductor lasers. It is the primary failure mode for AlGaInP/AlGaAs red lasers. Short-wavelength lasers are more susceptible to COD than long-wavelength ones. The typical values for COD in industrial products range between 12 and 20 MW/cm2. Causes and mechanisms At the edge of a diode laser, where light is emitted, a mirror is traditionally formed by cleaving the semiconductor wafer to form a specularly reflecting plane. This approach is facilitated by the weakness of the [110] crystallographic plane in III-V semiconductor crystals (such as GaAs, InP, GaSb, etc.) compared to other planes. A scratch made at the edge of the wafer and a slight bending force causes a nearly atomically perfect mirror-like cleavage plane to form and propagate in a straight line across the wafer. But it so happens that the atomic states at the cleavage plane are altered (compared to their bulk properties within the crystal) by the termination of the perfectly periodic lattice at that plane. Surface states at the cleaved plane have energy levels within the (otherwise forbidden) band gap of the semiconductor. The absorbed light causes generation of electron-hole pairs. These can lead to breaking of chemical bonds on the crystal surface followed by oxidation, or to release of heat by nonradiative recombination. The oxidized surface then shows increased absorption of the laser light, which further accelerates its degradation. The oxidation is especially problematic for semiconductor layers containing aluminium. Essentially, as a result when light propagates through the cleavage plane and transits to free space from within the semiconductor crystal, a fraction of the light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser‚Äîwhich is electrically pumped‚Äîis in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the band gap of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The band gap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of positive feedback, and the result can be melting of the facet, known as catastrophic optical damage, or COD. Deterioration of the laser facets with aging and effects of the environment (erosion by water, oxygen, etc.) increases light absorption by the surface, and decreases the COD threshold. A sudden catastrophic failure of the laser due to COD then can occur after many thousands hours in service. Improvements One of the methods of increasing the COD threshold in AlGaInP laser structures is the sulfur treatment, which replaces the oxides at the laser facet with chalcogenide glasses. This decreases the recombination velocity of the surface states. Reduction of recombination velocity of surface states can be also achieved by cleaving the crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and immediate deposition of a suitable passivation layer. A thin layer of aluminium can be deposited over the surface, for gettering the oxygen. Another approach is doping of the surface, increasing the band gap and decreasing absorption of the lasing wavelength, shifting the absorption maximum several nanometers up. Current crowding near the mirror area can be avoided by prevention of injecting charge carriers near the mirror region. This is achieved by depositing the electrodes away from the mirror, at least several carrier diffusion distances. Energy density on the surface can be reduced by employing a waveguide broadening the optical cavity, so the same amount of energy exits through a larger area. Energy density of 15‚Äì20 MW/cm2 corresponding to 100 mW per micrometer of stripe width are now achievable. A wider laser stripe can be used for higher output power, for the cost of transverse mode oscillations and therefore worsening of spectral and spatial beam quality. In the 1970s, this problem, which is particularly nettlesome for GaAs-based lasers emitting between 1 ¬µm and 0.630 ¬µm wavelengths (less so for InP based lasers used for long-haul telecommunications which emit between 1.3 ¬µm and 2 ¬µm), was identified. Michael Ettenberg, a researcher and later Vice President at RCA Laboratories' David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey, devised a solution. A thin layer of aluminum oxide was deposited on the facet. If the aluminum oxide thickness is chosen correctly, it functions as an anti-reflective coating, reducing reflection at the surface. This alleviated the heating and COD at the facet. Since then, various other refinements have been employed. One approach is to create a so-called non-absorbing mirror (NAM) such that the final 10 ¬µm or so before the light emits from the cleaved facet are rendered non-absorbing at the wavelength of interest. Such lasers are called window lasers. In the very early 1990s, SDL, Inc. began supplying high power diode lasers with good reliability characteristics. CEO Donald Scifres and CTO David Welch presented new reliability performance data at, e.g., SPIE Photonics West conferences of the era. The methods used by SDL to defeat COD were considered to be highly proprietary and have still not been disclosed publicly as of June, 2006. In the mid-1990s IBM Research (Ruschlikon, Switzerland) announced that it had devised its so-called \\"E2 process\\" which conferred extraordinary resistance to COD in GaAs-based lasers. This process, too, has never been disclosed as of June, 2006.

It is located west of the Icefields Parkway, above Chephren Lake, on the continental divide between Alberta and British Columbia. At , it is the 46th highest peak in Alberta, and the 59th highest in British Columbia. Howse Peak's name comes from Howse Pass, which lies to the west. The pass was named by David Thompson, after the Hudson's Bay Company trader Joseph Howse, who crossed the pass in 1809. (Thompson had actually crossed the pass two years earlier.) Climbing Howse Peak is a dramatic mountain, rising over above both the Mistaya River to the east and Howse Pass to the west, in only a few horizontal kilometres.Map of Bow Lake and Saskatchewan Crossing, Gem Trek Publishing, 1995, It is also a formidable climbing challenge. The easiest route requires a hike up the Howse River and then a climb up a glacier on the west side of the peak. In addition, at least two high-quality, difficult (Grade V/VI) technical routes exist on the east side of the mountain. The first ascent was made on August 14, 1902 by J. Norman Collie, Hugh Stutfield, G.M. Weed, and Herman Woolley, guided by Hans Kaufmann. Starting from their camp at the foot of the peak, they began the ascent with a tiring two hour jaunt through the woods, continuing onto a rocky ridge that led up to the peak. However, they soon ran into two precipitous rock faces along the ridge. The first was tackled with little difficulty, the second however proved a more formidable challenge. With much time and effort expended, Kaufmann and Woolley managed to descend a 50-foot perpendicular rock chimney. The rest of the group however decided to descend into the valley before re-attaining the ridge further along. After a long snow grind interrupted by a few crevasses, they reached the summit eight hours from their starting point. \\"The summit is formed of a most enormous snow cornice running along the ridge for a great distance, and overhanging the terrific precipices which line the western side of Bear Creek above Waterfowl Lake.\\" Geology Like other mountains in Banff National Park, Howse Peak is composed of black limestone and yellow sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Howse Peak Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Howse Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Howse Peak drains into the Mistaya River, Howse River, and the Blaeberry River.

Wanting his sons to succeed on their own and to expand the family business across Europe, Mayer Amschel Rothschild had had his eldest son remain in Frankfurt, while his four other sons went to different European cities to establish a financial institution to invest in business and provide banking services. Endogamy within the family was an essential part of the Rothschild strategy in order to ensure control of their wealth remained in family hands. Through their collaborative efforts, the Rothschilds rose to prominence in a variety of banking endeavors including loans, government bonds and trading in bullion. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century they became major stakeholders in large-scale mining and rail transport ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of Europe. By 1820, N M Rothschild & Sons bank was already operating successfully in London, England, de Rothschild Fr√®res in Paris, and S M von Rothschild in Vienna, Austria where Salomon Mayer von Rothschild became a powerful ally of Austria's Prince Klemens Metternich. In March 1821, in support of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, the Austrian army entered the Sicilian Kingdom and occupied Naples. This event opened the door to the Rothschild interests and Carl von Rothschild was sent to Naples where he established C M de Rothschild & Figli to operate as a satellite office to the Rothschild banking family of Germany headquarters in Frankfurt am Main. Elevated to peerage In 1822, the five Rothschild brothers at the head of the family's banks in various parts of Europe were each granted the title of baron or Freiherr by Austria's Francis I, formerly Francis II the last Holy Roman Emperor. As such, members of the Naples family used \\"von\\" Rothschild to acknowledge the grant of nobility. Involvement in finance and industry Carl von Rothschild developed a good working relationship with Luigi de' Medici, the \\"Direttore della Segreteria di Azienda del Regno di Napoli\\" (Finance Minister), and his operation became the dominant banking house in Naples. As a result of Carl's success, the Rothschilds had a substantial banking presence in England and three other major European capitals, giving the family considerable influence and an advantage over their competitors. During the winter of 1826, Leopold of Saxe- Coburg, future King of the Belgians was a guest of Carl von Rothschild at his villa in Naples. In 1829, he was appointed consul-general of Sicily at Frankfurt and in January 1832 the Jewish banker was given a ribbon and star of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George at a ceremony with the new Pope, Gregory XVI. The C M de Rothschild & Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the Papal States and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. However, in the 1830s, Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank's growth and profitability. During the second half of the 1840s the business evidenced no growth and was only marginally profitable. The year 1855 was one of considerable change for the Rothschild family with the death of the head of both the Naples and German branches. Of the three sons of Carl von Rothschild, the eldest, Mayer, and the youngest surviving son, Wilhelm, succeeded their childless uncle Amschel Mayer von Rothschild in Frankfurt while the middle son reluctantly agreed to run the Naples branch. The succession negotiations were marked by considerable rancor as cousin Anselm von Rothschild, the then head of the Rothschild banking family of Austria, disagreed with the decision and Adolphe felt he had been unfairly treated. Closure of the Naples branch However, the interests of all Rothschild banking families across Europe were adversely impacted in a very major way by three historical events: # the Revolutions of 1848; # the Great Depression of the 1930s; # Nazism of the late 1930s through World War II. The end of the Naples branch began when revolution broke out and Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples on September 7, 1860 and set up a provisional government. Because of the family's close political connections with Austria and France, was caught in a delicate position. He chose to take temporary sanctuary in Gaeta with the Bourbon king Francis II of the Two Sicilies but the Rothschild houses in London, Paris, and Vienna were not prepared to financially support the deposed king. With the ensuing unification of Italy, and the mounting tension between Adolf and the rest of the family, after forty-two years in business the Naples house closed in 1863. Mathilde Hannah von Rothschild (1832‚Äì1924) of the Austrian branch of the family, who married Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild of Naples/Frankfurt, founded and endowed the as a public institution. In 1901, at the time of the closure of the Rothschilds' Frankfurt office, family discussions took place concerning the disposition of the records of the Naples house. Alphonse James de Rothschild opposed the idea of preserving the documents in the Rothschild Library in Frankfurt and eventually it was agreed that all the Naples office records be destroyed. The brothers Mayer Carl and Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild had only daughters (ten in total) and with the 1935 deaths of Emma Louisa de Rothschild (daughter of Mayer Carl) and Adelheid de Rothschild (daughter of Wilhelm Carl), the Neapolitan branch went extinct in the male line. All branches of the Rothschild banking family are famous for their art collections and a number for their palatial estates. Because the Naples branch was run by just two family members, father Carl Mayer von Rothschild and son Adolphe, the only great property they occupied there was the Villa Pignatelli at Riviera di Chiaia with a spectacular view of Mount Vesuvius, acquired in 1841.

The screenplay was written by Leon Piedmont, based on the novel In the Heat of the Summer by John Katzenbach. The film was named after the term of the same name that refers to a pattern of weather that occurs in Florida during the late summer months. In order to achieve accuracy for the scenes that take place in the busy newsroom, the filmmakers used Miami Herald reporters as on-set consultants and extras and shot in the actual newsroom as opposed to recreating it on a soundstage.  Plot  Malcolm Anderson is a reporter for a Miami newspaper, who is burned out from years of covering the worst crimes in the city. He promises his girlfriend Christine that they will move away from the city, but he ends up covering a series of grisly murders by a serial killer who calls him telling the reporter that he will kill again. The lines between covering the story and becoming part of it are blurred.  Cast  Production =Development and writing= Veteran crime reporter for the Miami Herald newspaper John Katzenbach wrote the novel, In the Heat of the Summer, based on his years of experiences and of stories told to him by fellow reporters he knew. He tried to examine what he described as ‚Äúthe nature of reporting and the ambiguity and ambivalence of the job. There's a fundamental dilemma in, on the one hand, thinking 'How can I intrude on these people at the moment of exquisite agony?' and, on the other hand thinking 'My God, I'm sitting on a terrific story!'‚Äù Producer David Foster who was also a graduate of the journalism school at the University of Southern California, was given Katzenbach‚Äôs manuscript and agreed to bring it to the big screen along with fellow producer Lawrence Turman. The film was named The Mean Season after the term of the same name that refers to a pattern of weather that occurs in Florida during the late summer months. Hot mornings with sticky weather lead into violent thunderstorms that blow in from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico in the afternoon. However, the rain doesn't alleviate the heat and only makes things hotter that evening. This cycle repeats every day for a month. Foster and director Phillip Borsos spent time studying the way people worked in the Herald. Borsos said, ‚ÄúI wanted to know what goes on at 3 p.m., at 5 p.m. There's a wonderful flow of traffic at different times of the day. Gradually, the room fills up. Later, there's a ferocious attack at the computer terminals. A lot of newspaper movies have 10 people in the background, or 50, but there's always the same level of action. If the script said 3:10 p.m., and the first edition was an hour off the streets, I wanted to know what would be happening.‚Äù Coincidentally, when Borsos and his crew arrived at the Herald offices in April 1984, Christopher Bernard Wilder, a man suspected of kidnapping and killing several young women, shot himself in a confrontation with the police at a gas station in New Hampshire. Borsos remembers, ‚Äúit seemed as though there were about 500 reporters in the office, and everybody was going insane.‚Äù In order to prepare for the role, Kurt Russell followed around veteran Herald crime reporter Edna Buchanan and photographer Tim Chapman. At first, he couldn‚Äôt figure out \\"how they justify what they do. But I found out that these are very caring people. They may be callous about how they do their jobs, but they're not callous about people. That allowed me, from a reporter's point of view, to have the truth of why Malcolm was able to press on when some people thought he shouldn't.\\" Richard Masur prepared for his role as an editor by spending several days at the Herald‚Äôs city desk. In order to achieve accuracy for the scenes that take place in the busy newsroom, Borsos used Herald reporters as on-set consultants and extras. Katzenbach told Foster, ‚Äúthat if he made a film about newspapers it was extremely important not to cut corners when presenting the journalistic aspects.‚Äù To that end, the production shot in the actual Herald newsroom between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. as opposed to recreating it on a soundstage. None of the actual clutter and look of the place was changed for the film. Foster said, ‚ÄúI don't think we could have had the aroma, the feel we had at the Herald. It had a tone, that city room. I had no idea news reporters were that sloppy.‚Äù However, Borsos would have preferred to adopt a more stylized look. He said, ‚ÄúI preferred to have it look somewhat stylized and slightly unreal, more what you would call a 1950's film-noir type of picture. I think making it slightly abstract can be a way of reaching more people. When something is too real, that can almost be a way of limiting you.‚Äù Katzenbach was also a regular on the set as a consultant. The actual City of Miami Police Department's SWAT Team appeared in a scene where Russell's character enters the house of a victim. Many interiors were also filmed inside the City of Miami Police Department Headquarters as well as the Richard E. Gerstein Criminal Justice Building.  Release  =Box office= The Mean Season was released on February 15, 1985 in 876 theaters and grossed USD $1.5 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $4.3 million in North America. =Critical reception= In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that the film, \\"has a brisk pace and a lot of momentum. It also has a few more surprises than the material needed, since Mr. Borsos, who for the most part works in a tense, streamlined style, likes red herrings.\\" Jack Kroll in Newsweek wrote, \\"This movie has the weather of Body Heat, the moral stance of Absence of Malice and the perverse plot-angle of Tightrope. It's also not as good as any of these\\". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote, \\"Overall the film seems a little flat, a little stale. The clouds roil and the thunder claps like a gun report\\".

It is the third Musketeers film directed by Richard Lester, following 1973's The Three Musketeers and 1974's The Four Musketeers. Like the other two films, the screenplay was written by George MacDonald Fraser. The character of Mordaunt, Milady de Winter's son in the original novel, is replaced by Milady's daughter, called Justine de Winter. Several cast members from the first two reprised their roles in this one. Jean-Pierre Cassel, who played Louis XIII in the original films, has a cameo appearance as Cyrano de Bergerac. While filming in September 1988, character actor Roy Kinnear died following an on-camera accident in which he fell off a horse. His role was completed by using a stand-in, filmed from the rear, and dubbed-in lines from a voice artist. Plot Twenty years after the events of The Four Musketeers, Cardinal Mazarin has imprisoned the Duke of Beaufort. Mazarin hires d'Artagnan to bring together Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, to work for him. Porthos accepts, but Athos and Aramis decline. By this time, Athos has a son named Raoul. Milady de Winter's daughter, Justine, captures and questions the executioner that the musketeers hired to kill her mother. After finding out that \\"Comte de la Fere\\" hired him, she kills him. Raoul happens upon the aftermath of this event and chases after Justine, who is disguised as a priest. After a swordfight, when he discovers who she really is and her plan, Raoul leaves and tells d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Athos that Justine wants to kill them. Comte de Rochefort is unable to prevent Beaufort from escaping from his prison, and he is subsequently arrested by Mazarin. Mazarin sends d'Artagnan and Porthos after Beaufort, but Beaufort escapes them due to interference from Athos and Aramis, who are working for Beaufort. This starts a fight amongst the Musketeers, in which d'Artagnan slices Aramis' hand. Aramis breaks his sword and rides away. d'Artagnan and Porthos are fired by Mazarin for not catching Beaufort. Rochefort, who has survived his near-fatal clash with d'Artagnan in the previous film and has gone into hiding, finds Justine and tells her the names of d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, revealing to her that the Comte de la Fere is Athos. King Charles I of England is to be executed, so Queen Anne of Austria sends d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Raoul to rescue him. They attempt a rescue by knocking out the executioner, but Justine takes his place and beheads Charles. The Musketeers have several encounters with Justine: in one, Raoul's true allegiance is revealed to her; in another, Justine and Rochefort attempt to kill the Musketeers by blowing up their ship. The Musketeers notice their trap, set their own bomb and escape. Rochefort is killed when the ship explodes, but Justine escapes. Justine attempts to kill King Louis XIV, but is stopped by the Musketeers, and their battle concludes with Justine jumping out of the window into the water. Aramis rejoins the Musketeers, and they force Mazarin to sign several forms in favour of them, including making Porthos a baron, Aramis a bishop, and Raoul being commissioned into the Guards. The film ends with the Musketeers riding together again. Cast * Michael York as d'Artagnan * Oliver Reed as Athos * Frank Finlay as Porthos * Richard Chamberlain as Aramis * C.

It reunited him with the main cast of the first two films. Author George MacDonald Fraser said that in the film \\"Charles I is seen playing golf, which is, incidentally, true. He was playing golf just before he was captured.'' Lester said the two main problems with the film were a lack of money, and a refusal of the Salkinds to let him use footage from the first two films. \\"The whole concept of making Dumas' Twenty Years After was destroyed,\\" said Lester. \\"It was the hole beneath the water line.\\" However Lester did admit even that may not have worked as the target audience were unlikely to have been familiar with the original films.Soderberg p. 135. The film was shot in Spain. Charlton Heston was hoping to be asked to reprise his role as Richelieu from the original films but the cardinal had died several years before the events of the new movie. Heston did give the filmmakers permission to use a painting of Richileu that featured his likeness‚Äîprovided he was given the painting once filming ending. \\"It's a good portrait,\\" wrote Heston. \\"I'm very fond of it. It's very much in the style of the period.\\" =Death of Roy Kinnear= Roy Kinnear was accidentally killed during production in Toledo, Spain. The Spanish crew misunderstood the instructions of director Lester and washed down the cobblestone street prior to filming, making the stones wet. Kinnear and other cast members had to travel on horses across the Alc√°ntara Bridge above the river Tagus. Kinnear was given one fifteen minute practice ride before the take. When Kinnear and other cast members rode into the shot on horses and stopped, Kinnear's horse slipped, and Kinnear (not a confident horseman) fell off, breaking his pelvis. He was treated at the Ruber Internacional Hospital in Madrid and on 20 September was transferred to a nearby clinic but died soon after from a heart attack brought on by his injuries. After a six year legal battle Kinnear's widow was awarded ¬£650,000 in damages from the production company, Falconfilms‚Äîconsisting of producer Pierre Spengler and director Richard Lester. A court later ruled that the hospital was 60% liable for his death and ordered them to pay 60% of the payout figure. \\"It was ghastly,\\" said Fraser. \\"He was such a jolly, witty character in the prime of life. His death put paid to any chance of the movie being a success.\\" Release Completed in 1988, The Return of the Musketeers was released for cinemas in the European market in April 1989, and while it was given positive reviews by the critics, it was not well received at the box office. It was released on video in the spring of 1990. The film was acquired by Universal for U.S. theatrical release, but given its lackluster European box office, the studio chose instead to give the film its U.S. debut on cable television's USA Network (which was part owned by the studio) two years later, on 3 April 1991. Years later in a career interview Lester said, \\"I really won't talk about The Return of the Musketeers...I never have and I won't now. But I think you can draw your own conclusions.\\" Reception The Return of the Musketeers received mixed reviews: the online review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes currently rates it at 60%, based on 5 reviews.

He died of heart trauma after a match in Savannah, Georgia in which he defeated Ox Baker.  Early life  Gunkel was born on February 16, 1924 in Chicago, Illinois. He attended Kelvyn Park High School before attending Purdue University. He competed on the university's wrestling and football teams. As an All-American wrestler, he was undefeated in his junior and senior years and helped his team win the Big Ten Conference twice. As an individual, he finished second in the NCAA final to Dick Hutton. He also won the Amateur Athletic Union national championship in both 1947 and 1948.  Professional wrestling career  =Texas= Gunkel originally wanted to become a teacher, but he entered professional wrestling immediately after leaving university. He made his debut in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1948. He then moved to Texas, where he competed for throughout the early 1950s. On September 4, 1951, he defeated Duke Keomuka to win the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship. After dropping the title belt to Miguel Guzm√°n, he later regained it by defeating Keomuka again. His third and final Texas Heavyweight Championship came in 1953, when he defeated Mr. Moto to win the vacant championship. He was also successful as a tag team wrestler, as he won the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship seven times with six different partners. While wrestling in Texas, Gunkel was managed by professional boxer Jack Dempsey. =Georgia= After Gunkel and his last partner, Amazing Zuma, dropped the tag team title in Texas, Gunkel left the promotion. He moved to Georgia, where he competed for the remainder of his career and won two dozen championships. His first title belt in Georgia came when he teamed with Don McIntyre to win the Georgia version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship.  Death  On August 1, 1972, Gunkel wrestled Ox Baker in Savannah, Georgia. During the match, Baker punched Gunkel in the chest. Gunkel won the match, but he died later that day of heart problems. An autopsy showed that Gunkel suffered from undiagnosed arteriosclerosis, but that his death was a result of heart trauma. It was determined that Baker's punch created a hematoma, which led to a blood clot that caused his death when it reached his heart. Gunkel was buried in Arlington Memorial Park in Sandy Springs, Georgia. Following his death, Gunkel's wife Ann announced her intention to take his place in the ABC Booking wrestling organization. Gunkel's partners objected and closed the promotion. They immediately opened a new promotion that excluded Ann Gunkel. Ann Gunkel formed the All-South Wrestling Alliance, which operated until November 1974, when she was forced to sell the company because of declining business. Ray Gunkel was posthumously inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Hall of Fame in 2008. His daughter Pam accepted the award on his behalf.

Hachiville was a commune in the canton of Clervaux until 1 January 1978, when it was merged with the communes of Asselborn, Boevange, and Oberwampach to form the new commune of Wincrange. The law creating Wincrange was passed on 31 October 1977. The name Hachiville appears for the first time in a charter in the year 1130. It is believed, however, that the site has been inhabited since Celtic times and that it was occupied by the Romans. The village's greatest fame lies in its celebrated hermitage, which is probably located on an ancient Celtic place of worship. Former commune The former commune consisted of the villages: * Hachiville * Hoffelt * Weiler * Neum√ºhle * Lehresm√ºhle * Moulin-Neuf (lieu- dit)  Church  = The Altar Screen = The Helzer Klaus altarpiece The carved altar screen now displayed in Hachiville's baroque parish church is considered one of Luxembourg's most precious art treasures. Originally housed in the hermitage chapel just outside the village, the piece, which appears to date from the sixteenth century, depicts scenes from the life and the passion of Christ. The hermitage chapel, Helzer Klaus, revered as a pilgrimage site in its own right, now contains a plaster copy of this original altarpiece. In 1973, Luxembourg issued a set of stamps depicting images of religious statues based on this altarpiece. A few years later, in August 1976, the altarpiece was stolen. Fortunately, it was found a little more than a month later, packaged and ready to ship abroad. The mystery of who planned the crime still remains. The Helzer Klaus, or the hermitage chapel Legend shrouds the origin of this altar screen. According to the story, the screen came from Frankish lands and was intended for a church in Belgium. However, as the oxen stopped for a drink at the mineral spring that still flows by the hermitage, they were shackled to the ground by some invisible power. The cart that bore the altarpiece was too heavy to move by any human means, and the art it contained was too costly to take any chances with. This was seen as a miraculous sign from the Queen of Heaven that she desired the altar to be built here, in the old chapel at the edge of a beech grove. The hermitage itself has also been honored with a stamp. A watercolor depiction of the restored chapel was featured in a stamp set in 1989. = Folk Belief = An interesting divination ritual is associated with the hermitage and its mineral spring. It has been said that if you are unmarried and in search of a spouse, you must make your way to the chapel and walk three times around it without being observed. Then you should beat your head twice against a thick tree standing there (or is it once against each of two trees?), followed by a jump barefoot into the spring which flows close to the chapel door. If all these rituals have been successful, in the silence you should hear the name of your future husband or wife in the burbling of the water.

Based in Hyde Park, Page's enterprise grew until it was recognized as the largest calfskin dealer in the world. During the American Civil War Page registered for the draft, and then served as a major in the 4th Regiment of Vermont Militia. He was Lamoille County Treasurer from 1866 to 1872. Page was also involved in the lumber business and served as President of the Lamoille County Savings Bank and Trust Company and the Lamoille County National Bank, both in Hyde Park. In addition, he was also a director of the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad.

During his term, the office of Governor of Vermont was empowered to appoint judges of all city and municipal courts, and legislation was enacted providing for secret ballots in elections. In 1908, Page was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Redfield Proctor, which John W. Stewart had held temporarily by appointment pending the election results. Page easily defeated the token Democratic candidate, Vernon A. Bullard; he was reelected in 1910 and 1916 and served from October 21, 1908, to March 3, 1923. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1922.

Biography  Born Kalman Mayer Rothschild in Frankfurt am Main, he was the fourth of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743‚Äì1812) and Gutl√© Schnapper (1753‚Äì1849). He would become known as \\"Carl\\" by the family except for his English relatives who translated it as \\"Charles\\". Raised in an increasingly prosperous family, he was trained in his father's banking business and lived at home until age twenty-nine when he acquired a modest residence at 33 Neue Mainzer Strasse in Frankfurt am Main in preparation for his marriage on 16 September 1818 to Adelheid Herz (1800‚Äì1853). They would have the following children: * Charlotte (1819‚Äì1884) married Lionel de Rothschild * Mayer Carl (1820‚Äì1886) * (1823‚Äì1900) * Wilhelm Carl (1828‚Äì1901) * Anselm Alexander Carl (1835‚Äì1854) Wanting to expand the family business across Europe, the eldest Rothschild son Amschel remained in Frankfurt, while each of the other sons were sent to different European cities to establish a banking branch. The 1821 occupation of Naples by the Austrian army provided the opportunity for the Rothschilds to set up business in the Kingdom. Carl Rothschild was therefore sent to Naples where he established C M de Rothschild & Figli to operate as a satellite office to the Rothschild banking family of Germany headquarters in Frankfurt am Main.Carl Mayer (Carl) von Rothschild (1788-1855), Rothschildarchive.org Carl Rothschild has sometimes been seen as the least gifted of the five brothers. However, he proved himself in Naples as a strong financial manager and someone very capable at developing all-important business connections. He established a good working relationship with Luigi de' Medici, the \\"Direttore della Segreteria di Azienda del Regno di Napoli\\" (Finance Minister), and his operation became the dominant banking house in Naples. As a result of Carl's success, the Rothschilds had a substantial banking presence in England and three other major European capitals, giving the family considerable influence and an advantage over their competitors. Carl Mayer gained a significant influence with the Bourbon king in Naples. Clients of the Naples bank also included the Vatican, the dukes of Parma and the dukes of Tuscany.Die Rothschild-Dynastie - 2 Jahrhunderte einer Finanzdynastie, Bornpower.de In 1822, Carl Rothschild and his four brothers were each granted the title of baron, or Freiherr, by His Imperial Majesty Kaiser Franz I of Austria. During the winter of 1826, Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, future King of the Belgians, was a guest of Carl Freiherr von Rothschild at his villa in Naples. In 1829, Carl was appointed consul-general of Sicily at Frankfurt and in January 1832 the Jewish banker was given a ribbon and star of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George at a ceremony with the new Roman Catholic Pope, Gregory XVI. Reports that Rothschild was permitted to kiss the Pope's hand, rather than his foot, as was customary at the time, led to controversy in the Catholic world that the Pope was selling Rome out to \\"a Jew.\\" A former Rothschild residence in Hemsbach, Germany, a town where Rothschild became its first honorary citizen Carl von Rothschild maintained homes in Frankfurt am Main and in Naples.

Approximately 2500 units were built in Morris, New York, USA from 1916 to 1952. Development =Prototypes= Linn was a native of Maine and in his quest for a better machine to travel rural roads with his dog and pony show equipment gave up on a six-wheel-drive design by 1907 to have Alvin Lombard, of Waterville, build a machine using the tracks off a Lombard Steam Log Hauler, and underslung gasoline engine and wheels on front. It was equipped with a ship-style cabin with living quarters and able to pull a string of wagons behind as well as supply electric lights for his circus. By 1909 this was replaced because of size with a single rear-tracked machine with standard wheeled front axle; however as Linn had become employed as a salesman, demonstrator and mechanic for Lombard a patent dispute erupted and Linn left Maine with his show. =Improved traction system= By 1916 Linn had developed an even smaller, more stable gasoline-powered half-track with an improved flexible traction system, independent of each other, with a central triangle-shaped rocker using two tear-dropped runner blocks suspended by axles, then surrounded by an independent roller chain to disperse the load through these rollers, patented in 1918. The feature being with constant ground following traction, and steering accomplished by front wheels (or sled in winter); full power was supplied to both tracks all the time and transmitted to the ground so there was no loss of tractive effort when turning. Lombard and most other crawlers used a rigid bed inside the tracks which would be lifted off the ground at times, and track-steer crawlers reduce power through clutch or brake action to their tracks to turn, losing additional tractive effort. With its payload carrying ability, the Linn did not require trailers or wagons to move a load, something which off-road terrain does not always permit, and no dead weight or ballast was needed for traction, as simply more payload could be added. Applications Linn tractors were used to haul freight beyond the ends of the rail lines on some Canadian power projects.http://www.islandfalls.ca/linntractor/linntractor.htm When the concept of rural snow plowing became accepted around 1920, Linn was one of the pioneers, with a v-plow and adjusting leveling wing design that was unmatched until better pneumatic tires, four-wheel-drive trucks and better highways appeared in the mid-1930s to plow highways on a more frequent basis. To combat this a new concept of a single machine able to switch from truck to tractor with the push of a lever appeared in 1938, known as the C5 or later trademarked term \\"CATRUK\\", but management and war priorities limited its development and it was abandoned after World War II. This machine was built in a cab-over configuration, front wheel drive, and a hydraulically lowered dual- wheeled tag-axle that would push the tracks up off the ground. \\"HAFTRAK\\" is another Linn trademark.

Notker Labeo (c. 950 ‚Äì 28 June 1022), also known as Notker the German () or Notker III, was a Benedictine monk and the first commentator on Aristotle active in the Middle Ages. \\"Labeo\\" means \\"the thick-lipped one\\". Later he was named Teutonicus in recognition of his services to the German language. He was born about 950, from a noble family of Thurgau, and he was a nephew of Ekkehard I, the poet of Waltharius. He went to the Abbey of Saint Gall when only a boy, and there acquired a vast and varied knowledge by omnivorous reading. After finishing his education, he continued in the abbey as a teacher and then head of the school under abbot Burckhard II. His contemporaries admired him as a theologian, philologist, mathematician, astronomer, connoisseur of music, and poet. He tells of his studies and his literary work in a letter to Bishop Hugo of Sitten (998‚Äì1017), and we also know of his activities through texts from his pupil Ekkehard IV. The Necrologium sancti Galli recorded his death under June 28, 1022, as \\"Obitus Notkeri doctissimi atque benignissimi magistri\\". He died stricken by the plague. For the benefit of his pupils he translated several texts from Latin into German. He mentions eleven of these translations, but unfortunately only five are preserved: (1) Boethius, \\"De consolatione philosophiae\\"; (2) Martianus Capella, \\"De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii\\"; (3) Aristotle, \\"De categoriis\\"; (4) Aristotle, \\"De interpretatione\\"; (5) \\"The Psalter\\". Among those lost are: \\"The Book of Job\\", at which he worked for more than five years; \\"Disticha Catonis\\"; Virgil's \\"Bucolica\\"; and the \\"Andria\\" of Terence (Terenz in German). Of his own writings he mentions in the above letter a \\"New Rhetoric\\" and a \\"New Computus\\" and a few other smaller works in Latin. We still possess the Rhetoric, the Computus (a manual for calculating the dates of ecclesiastical celebrations, especially of Easter), the essay \\"De partibus logicae\\", and the German essay on Music. Among his most distinguished pupils are the aforementioned Ekkehard IV, Salomo III bishop of Constance, and Batherus, a wandering scholar who wrote a biography of St. Fridolin. In K√∂gel's opinion Notker Labeo was one of the greatest stylists in German literature. \\"His achievements in this respect seem almost marvelous.\\" His style, where it becomes most brilliant, is essentially poetical; he observes with surprising exactitude the laws of the language and created the first systematic orthography of Old High German. Latin and German he commanded with equal fluency; and while he did not understand Greek, he was weak enough to pretend that he did. He put an enormous amount of learning and erudition into his commentaries on his translations. Much may be found that was of interest in his time, philosophy, universal and literary history, natural science, astronomy. He frequently quotes the classics and the Fathers of the Church. It is characteristic of Notker that at his dying request the poor were fed, and that he asked to be buried in the clothes which he was wearing in order that none might see the heavy chain with which he had been in the habit of mortifying his body.

Things seem to be grim for Joe when he's diagnosed with a brain tumor, but a bit of good fortune appears on the horizon when he wins a jackpot at the race track. However, Hush (Sharon Stone), a stripper who has fallen deeply in debt to a gang of thugs, steals Joe's newly won fortune to pay them off. Joe gets his money back by explaining to the gangsters what happened, but only because they mistake him for a syndicate kingpin they've heard about but never met. When the gangsters discover that Joe is a florist and not a career criminal, they find the situation less than amusing.

Simmons (uncredited) Production In October 1998, actress Sharon Stone stated that Beautiful Joe would be her next project, saying she had read the script while visiting her father, Joe, in a hospital. Stone said production would take place in San Francisco, where she lived. Filming instead took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, and began in June 1999. Filming in British Columbia was initially scheduled to last from June 28 to August 17. The film's budget was $15 million, and filming took place in British Columbia because of various economic incentives, which saved the production $1.5 million. Although the film was partially set in Louisville, Kentucky, it would not feature any scenes shot there, with the possible exception of stock footage for outdoor shots. During July 1999, filming took place at Hastings Racecourse, a horse- racing track located at Vancouver's Hastings Park. For the film, the Hastings race track was transformed to portray the Churchill Downs horse track in Louisville. The scene included approximately 800 extras who cheered from the track's grandstand. In August 1999, Stone's husband, Phil Bronstein, had a heart attack and she returned to San Francisco to be with him. Stone's departure caused production to stop for two days, and for the following three days, director Stephen Metcalfe shot scenes that did not involve her character. Stone returned to the film set a week after Bronstein's heart attack and angioplasty. Production was expected to wrap on August 19, 1999, as scheduled, or possibly a day later. Gil Bellows said about the film, \\"It was one of those experiences that doesn't end the way one intends. I'd rather not talk about it.\\" The film was produced by Fred Fuchs and Steven Haft, and financed by London-based Capitol Films. During production, Capitol Films entered an agreement with Carl Icahn's Stratosphere Entertainment, which was to distribute the film in the United States. Release Beautiful Joe was never released in theaters. In the United States, the film premiered on the Cinemax cable network on November 19, 2000, and was released on VHS and DVD on May 22, 2001.

He was the first lieutenant governor of Vermont after that state was admitted to the Union in 1791, and upon the death of Vermont's first governor Thomas Chittenden, served as governor for the last seven weeks of Chittenden's term. (During the 14 years before admission to the Union, when Vermont was a largely unrecognized state, several others served as lieutenant governor and two persons served as governor.) Biography Brigham, son of Paul and Catherine (Turner) Brigham, was born in January 1746, in Coventry in the Colony of Connecticut. The exact date of his birth varies from source to source. Some give his birthday as January 6; others give it as January 17. He married Lydia Sawyer (of Hebron, Connecticut) on October 3, 1767, and the couple had five children. Career Brigham served from January 1, 1777 to April 22, 1781 as a captain in the Connecticut Militia during the American Revolutionary War. He was a company commander of Continental troops under the command of General George Washington and wintered in Valley Forge during the winter of 1777. In the spring of 1782 Brigham and his family moved to Norwich, Vermont, where he was a farmer and a land speculator. He served as high sheriff of Windsor County, Vermont, for five years and as major general of the Vermont Militia. He was chief judge of the county court for five years, and was a presidential elector for Vermont in 1792. He was on the Governor's Council from 1792 to 1796. Brigham was annually elected lieutenant governor of Vermont for 16 consecutive years, from 1796 to 1813; only the brief Federalist resurgence removed Brigham and other Republicans from office. After conclusion to the War of 1812, which gave life to the moribund Federalist Party all across New England for their opposition, Brigham was again lieutenant governor, this time from 1815 until 1820. Upon the death of Governor Thomas Chittenden, he served for a short time as the second Governor of Vermont from August 25 to October 16, 1797, when the new governor, Isaac Tichenor was sworn in. Brigham then resumed his duties as lieutenant governor. He retired and returned to his home in Norwich in 1820. Death and legacy Brigham died in Norwich on June 16, 1824.

To this end, he founded a congregation of Religious Sisters and another one of Brothers. Early life Dujari√© was born in Rennes-en-Grenouilles, France on December 9, 1767, and was a seminarian in Angers when the French Revolution broke out in 1789. Beginning in 1789, the parishes, convents and monasteries that had provided most of the country‚Äôs education and health care were closed and their assets seized.\\"Father Jacques Dujari√©\\", Congregation of Holy Cross, US Province In 1791, when the Revolutionary government required all clergy to take an oath of loyalty to the state, the seminary disbanded and Dujari√© returned home. Priests and religious who did not take the oath were forced into hiding to avoid imprisonment, deportation, or even execution. For several years, Dujari√© traveled from village to village, disguising himself as a shepherd in order to assist the priests who were ministering ‚Äúunderground.‚Äù In July 1795, he resumed his studies for the priesthood in secret with a pastor in Ruill√©-sur- Loir. On December 26 of that same year, he was secretly ordained a priest in Paris. Throughout the Revolutionary period he ministered to the Catholic faithful as an \\"underground priest\\" throughout northwestern France, particularly in the countryside around Ruill√©-sur-Loir, in the former province of Maine.Ramey, Lucha. \\"Holy Cross Celebrates the Life of Fr. Jacques-Fran√ßois Dujari√©\\", February 17, 2012 At times he even posed as a peddler to go out through the countryside tending the people. After the restoration of the Catholic Church, Abb√© Dujari√© was installed as parish priest of the town of Ruill√© on 27 May 1803. He worked tirelessly to rebuild the parish, but he became profoundly concerned about the state of affairs in which the Revolution had left the Church and the state of education, especially in the poorest region outside the town, known as the \\"Heights\\". The Sisters of Providence In 1806 Dujari√© recruited two young women of the region to teach girls and care for the sick. He had the Little House of Providence built for them in that locale. Immediately the women set up a school, dispensary and a routine of visiting and caring for the ill. Within just a few years the group of women spread out to surrounding parishes to carry out Dujari√©'s vision. They group had grown so much by March 1821 that he began the building of a larger house for them on the outskirts of the town, called the Great House of Providence. In 1831 they were recognized religious congregation, called the Sisters of Providence.\\"Rev. Jacques Dujari√©\\", Congregation of Holy Cross, Rome, Italy Their motto became: Deus providebit (God will provide). The Brothers of St. Joseph Dujari√© had a view to build a joint congregation of men and women, of priests, brothers and sisters, all working together on the model of the Holy Family, providing for one another the gifts of their vocation for the sake of the mission. Out of this motivation, in 1820 Dujari√© had also founded the Brothers of St. Joseph for the education of rural boys. Similarly dedicated to the renewal of education and the Church, the Brothers by his plan would share in the resources of the Sisters of Providence. This the sisters objected to and had him removed from a position of responsibility for their Congregation. In 1835, the Brothers of St. Joseph had grown to open and teach in schools throughout northwestern France, running as many as 60 schools. Still, they had not been formed into a religious community with a novitiate or recognition from the Church. Dujarie, on account of his failing health, handed responsibility for the Brothers to the Abb√© (now Blessed) Basil Moreau, who had in the same year founded a group of \\"Auxiliary Priests\\" within the Le Mans Diocese. By 1837 Moreau would take a major step toward realizing Dujari√©'s dream of a unique congregation of men and women‚Äîpriests, Brothers and Sisters‚Äîby bringing together the Brothers of St. Joseph and the Auxiliary Priests of the Diocese of Le Mans into a new Association of Holy Cross, which would become the Congregation of Holy Cross. Death In October 1836, Dujari√© retired to live with the Brothers at their motherhouse in Le Mans. He died there on 17 February 1838, the founder of two communities which would soon become three congregations: the Sisters of Providence (Ruill√©-sur-Loir, France), the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, (Indiana), and the Brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross Dujari√© was buried in the cemetery of the Brothers. His remains, however, were transferred to the Sisters, and he was re-interred at their motherhouse in Ruill√© on 31 August 1873.

He is most notable for his service as a United States Representative and Senator. A native of St. Albans, Vermont, he was educated in St. Albans and Cleveland, Ohio, and began working as a teenager to help support his family after his father became disabled. He became a clerk for the Central Vermont Railway, and later became a journalist and editor of the St. Albans Messenger newspaper. Greene also served in the militia; enlisting as a private, by the time of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War he was a company commander with the rank of captain. He later served on the military staff of Governor Edward Curtis Smith, with the rank of colonel; Smith had been his employer at the Central Vermont Railway and St. Albans Messenger. Long active in politics and government as a Republican, in 1912 he won a special election to complete the term of Congressman David J. Foster, who had died. He was reelected to a full term in November 1912, and won reelection to four more terms. In 1922, Greene was elected to the United States Senate. He was reelected in 1928, and served until his death. In 1924, Greene was wounded when Prohibition agents attempting to apprehend the owners of a Washington, DC moonshine still accidentally shot him in the head. Greene never fully recovered, and was left partly paralyzed. He died as the result of surgical complications while being treated for a hernia, and was buried in St. Albans. Early life Frank Greene was born in St. Albans, Vermont on February 10, 1870. He attended the public schools in St. Albans and Cleveland, Ohio. The Greene family had relocated to Cleveland because Frank's father Lester had become Secretary/Treasurer of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. When Frank Greene was 13 his father became ill and could no longer work. The family returned to Vermont and Frank quit school to help support his family by taking a job as a messenger with the Central Vermont Railway. He remained with the railroad until 1891, learning shorthand and stenography and advancing to the position of chief clerk in the general freight department. Having worked part-time as a correspondent for The Boston Globe and other newspapers beginning in 1888, in 1891 Greene made journalism his full-time career, first as a reporter for and later as editor of the St. Albans Messenger.Prentiss Cutler Dodge, Encyclopedia of Vermont Biography, 1912, page 78 He was president of the Vermont Press Association from 1904 to 1905.E.P. & G.S.Walton, Vermont Year Book, Formerly Walton's Register, 1907, page 21 Military service Greene served in the Vermont National Guard from 1888 to 1900.

It was founded in 1893 in Dearborn near Greater Detroit. Dearborn High is one of the three high schools of the Dearborn City School District and is located at 19501 Outer Drive. There are over 2000 students currently attending Dearborn High. Its attendance boundary includes sections of Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.\\"Dearborn Public Schools Boundary Proposed Language Revisions July 2012.\\" Dearborn Public Schools. Retrieved on December 23, 2016.  History  The original 1893 high school building stood at the northeast corner of Mason street and Garrison avenue. An auditorium and gymnasium unit was added to the east of this structure in 1920. The 1893 building was razed in 1925 and a three-story 40-classroom structure, made for 900 students, erected in its place. An addition of 10 classrooms was added as a north wing in 1950. Dearborn High School moved to its current location on Outer Drive in 1956. The Mason Street building was remodeled as the Ray H. Adams Junior High School, named for the superintendent of schools when the 1925 building was erected. The junior high school closed in 1985 and the building was again remodeled to become part of a modern high-scale office complex. Sports Dearborn High School is currently a member of the Kensington Lakes Activities Association. In school history, the Pioneers and Lady Pioneers have won a combined 11 state championships in 5 different sports with six of them coming in boys' swimming. In addition, they have won numerous conference, district, and state regional titles in every sport. The school colors are orange and black; the Pioneer mascot is dressed as a mid-19th century frontiersman, wearing a coonskin hat with a brown leather jacket, pants, and boots with leather fringe. At one point, the mascot carried a 19th-century hunting rifle but that was ended by the administration in the late 1990s. Their previous football field was nicknamed \\"The Boneyard\\". The Pioneers' biggest rivals are the Tractors from Dearborn Fordson High School and the Thunderbirds of Dearborn Edsel Ford High School. According to T. C. Cameron, author of Metro Detroit's High School Football Rivalries, the rivalry with Ford High \\"has always been spirited\\" and that Ford's teams \\"never pass on a chance\\" to challenge Dearborn High in games.Cameron, T. C. Metro Detroit's High School Football Rivalries. Arcadia Publishing, 2008. , 9780738561684. p. 33. In regards to the one with Fordson, he stated the games have been \\"scrubbed for years at a time\\" and that the rivalry was \\"love-to-hate\\". The rivalry was affected by the 2006 job change of Jeff Stergalas, previously the head coach at Fordson, into being an assistant coach at Dearborn High School. In 2015 both schools held food drives to coincide with the Dearborn‚ÄìFord football game.

Life Notker was born around 940 and probably belonged to a noble Swabian family. He is mentioned in the ' as Provost of Saint Gall in Switzerland, but he is not mentioned by the otherwise prolix historians of St Gall. In 969 he was appointed imperial chaplain in Italy, and in 972 he was nominated by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor as bishop of Li√®ge, a suffragan of the Archbishop of Cologne. When he received the countship of Huy in 980, he simultaneously obtained secular power for the See and thus became the first Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge. He travelled to Rome for the coronation of Otto II by Pope Gregory V, and later negotiated a peace treaty between Henry II and Robert, the king of France. He adhered faithfully to the cause of the emperor Otto III, whom he accompanied to Rome. It was also who he brought back his corpse to Germany and prayed at his funeral in 1002. Achievements After receiving secular power from Otto II, Notker transformed the episcopal city into the capital of an ecclesiastical principality in the Holy Roman Empire. He built a new cathedral, Saint Lambert's, seven collegiate churches, including St. John's in Li√®ge, after the model of Aachen Cathedral, two abbeys and a city wall. He laid the foundation of the fame of the Li√®ge Schools, to which studious youths soon flocked from all Christendom. By procuring the services of Leo the Calabrian and thus making possible the study of Greek, Notker gave notable extension to the Li√®ge curriculum. Among Notker's pupils, who extended the influence of the Li√®ge schools to ever wider circles, may be mentioned Hubald, Wazo of Li√®ge, Franco, who also taught at Li√©ge, Gunther of Salzburg, Ruthard of Mainz and Erluin of Cambrai, Heimo of Verdun, Hesselo of Toul, Heriger of Lobbes, Adelmann (who later studied under Fulbert at Chartres), Gozechin who taught at Mainz and Adalbald of Utrecht. In Folcwin's opinion Notker's achievements surpass those of any of his predecessors. He developed the urban structure of the city, its fortifications, commerce and education. Under his rule, the city of Li√®ge was sometimes called the \\"Northern Athens\\". Authorship He has sometimes wrongly been identified as the author of the ' written under his patronage by Heriger of Lobbes. Johannes Fried considers Notker, rather than John Canaparius, the author of the ', a life of Adalbert of Prague written around 1000, which contains the first recorded mention of Danzig/Gdansk, as '.
